Abstract = {{The physical com patibility and chemical stability of aztreonam and
   vancomydn hydrochloride when combined at clinically used high and low
   concentrations were studied.
   Admixtures consisting of aztreonam 4 mg/mL and vancomycin 1 mg/mL (as
   the hydrochloride salt) in 5\% dextrose injection, aztreonam 4 mg/mL and
   vancomycin 1 mg/mL in 0.9\% sodium chloride injection, aztreonam 40
   mg/mL and vancomycin 10 mg/mL in 5\% dextrose injection, and aztreonam
   40 mg/mL and vancomycin 10 mg/ mL in 0.9\% sodium chloride injection
   were prepared in triplicate in polyvinyl chloride containers. Three
   containers of each type of admixture were stored at 4, 23, and 32
   degrees C. Samples were removed immediately and at various time points
   over 31 days. Compatibility was assessed by visual examination, with a
   turbidimeter, and with a particle sizer-counter. Stability was
   determined by stability-indicating high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC).
   All the admixtures initially appeared clear to the unaided eye after the
   disappearance of a transient white swirl in the high-concentration
   admixtures (aztreonam 40 mg/mL and vancomycin 10 mg/mL). However, the
   high-concentration admixtures immediately developed unacceptable levels
   of a microcrystalline precipitate when viewed with a high-intensity
   fiber-optic light source. Easily visible gross turbidity and
   precipitation formed after various periods but often within 24 hours.
   HPLC showed aztreonam 4 mg/mL and vancomycin 1 mg/mL in 5\% dextrose
   injection to be a stable combination for 7 days at 32 degrees C, 14 days
   at 23 degrees degrees C, and 31 days at 4 degrees C. In 0.9\% sodium
   chloride injection, the drugs in the low-concentration admixtures were
   stable for 7 days at 32 degrees C and for 31 days at 4 and 23 degrees C.
   Stability of the combination in the high-concentration admixtures was
   maintained for 3 days at 23 and 32 degrees C and for 14 days at 4
   degrees C.
   Aztreonam and vancomycin hydrochloride were considerably less compatible
   and stable in the high-concentration admixtures than in the
   low-concentration ones.}},

Abstract = {{Two novel crown ether compounds,
   N,N'-bis(2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl)-4,13-diazadibenzo-18-crown-6 (CCE) and

   own-6 (FCE), have been synthesized as potential reagents for the
   selective extraction and determination of heavy metal ions,
   Characterizations of the acid-base reactivity and the heavy metal ion
   extraction capabilities are reported, Both CCE and FCE undergo four-step
   ionization processes with associated tautomeric transformations and form
   stable complexes with divalent metal cations that can be extracted into
   1,2-dichloroethane, Extraction constants for Ba(II), Ca(II), Cd(II),
   Cu(II), Hg(II), Pb(II), and Sr(II) have been determined for both
   reagents, For CCE, the extraction order is Hg(II) much greater than
   Pb(II) > Cu(II) > Cd(II) > Ca(II) > Sr(II) > Ba(II), whereas the order
   for FCE is Hg(II) much greater than Cu(II) > Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Ca(II) >
   Sr(II) > Ba(II), The selectivity of CCE for Hg(II) over the
   next-best-extracted cation, Pb(II), is similar to 2 x 10(7) and that of
   FCE for Hg(II) over next-best-extracted cation, Cu(II), is similar to 5
   x 10(6), Potential applications to chemical analysis, based on the
   unprecedented selectivity of both reagents for Hg(II), are briefly
   examined.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature, load and blend ratio effects on the melt index of low
   density polyethylene (LDPE)/linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE)
   blends were studied. The experimental results suggested that the
   correlation between overall melt index and blend ratio of LDPE/LLDPE
   blends was governed by a log-linear relationship. This relationship, in
   turn, offered a simple method for the estimation of the melt index of
   LDPE/LLDPE blends with minimum experimental work. The results of the
   temperature effect indicated that if blending was for improving
   processability, the sensitivity of the melt index of LDPE should then be
   less than that of LLDPE; whereas, the reverse sensitivity of melt index
   to temperature was for improving properties of end products. It was
   shown that melt index increased with increasing applied load. The
   compressibility characteristics of the polymer melt was thought to
   account for the susceptibility of melt index to the applied load. Two
   distinct melting peaks were obtained from the differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) thermograms. This suggested that compatibility was not
   responsible for the effects shown by the factors studied in this work.}},

Abstract = {{The high strain rate behavior of two different tungsten-based composites

   bar and high strain rate pressure-shear plate impact experiments. The
   two materials investigated are (a) a W/(W-Ni-Fe) `'heavy alloy''

   composite containing 72 wt.\% W and a Hf matrix/binder phase. For each
   material, stress-strain curves are obtained in compression and shear
   over the strain rate range of 10(3) to 10(5) s(-1). The flow stresses
   observed in the W/Hf composite during these dynamic deformations are
   comparable to those observed in the W/(W-Ni-Fe) material, in spite of
   the lower tungsten content of the W/Hf composite. Further, the W/Hf
   composite displays approximately the same degree of strain-rate
   hardening as the W/(W-Ni-Fe) composite. The observed behavior of the
   W/(W-Ni-Fe) composite is compared with the predictions of several
   phenomenological models for high-rate deformations, including the
   Johnson-Cook and Zerilli-Armstrong models.}},

Abstract = {{The heat capacities of 1,3-dioxolane clathrate hydrates (DXL . 17H(2)O)
   doped with potassium hydroxide (x = 1.8 x 10(-4) and 1.8 x 10(-3) to
   water) were measured with an adiabatic calorimeter in the temperature
   range between 13 and 300 K. A glass transition due to freezing of the
   water reorientation appeared at 43 K in both samples. The relaxation
   time of the reorientational motion of the water molecule was obtained
   from the enthalpy relaxation data and the corresponding activation
   enthalpy was determined to be about 8 kJ mol(-1) for both samples. A
   eutectic melting between DXL hydrate and KOH hydrate occurred at 216 K
   in the sample richer in KOH (x = 1.8 x 10(-3)), indicating that the
   solubility limit of KOH to DXL hydrate is around x = 1.8 x 10(-4).
   Differential thermal analyses of
   (1,3-dioxolane)(1-x)(tetrahydrofuran)(x) mixed hydrates doped with KOH
   (x = 1.8 x 10(-4)) were performed in the temperature range between 20

   hydrate (T-trs = 62 K) decreased with increase in x and the transition
   did not occur for x < 0.6 owing to the slowing down of the transition
   rate. This result indicates that the ordering transition of the water
   and guest molecules did not occur in DXL hydrate because the
   hypothetical transition temperature is lower than the freezing
   temperature of the water reorientation.}},

Abstract = {{Rigid poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) compounds were prepared in a Haake
   torque rheometer using various blending conditions. The fusion levels of
   processed compounds were evaluated by a capillary rheometer and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), based on the entrance pressure
   drop and the heat of fusion, respectively. S-shaped fusion curves were
   obtained. Starting temperature of the mixer, rotor speed, and totalized
   torque are the three major factors that affect the fusion level of PVC
   compounds blended in the Haake torque rheometer. All three parameters
   have a significant effect; however, totalized torque has the greatest
   effect and this can be characterized using a torque rheometer. Both
   capillary rheological and DSC thermal analysis can be applied to
   determine the fusion level of a PVC compound. The morphological changes
   of the various fusion processes were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   These average numbers of bonds have been used to estimate the cohesive

   energies. A trial also has been made to explain the previously published
   data of threshold voltage (V-th), optical properties (E(04)) and glass

Abstract = {{We inserted pieces of metal foils (Al and Au) into a metal Berthelot
   tube together with water or xylene to investigate whether corrosion of
   metals limits the achievement of negative pressure. For the test using
   Al foil with water, the negative pressure rose to -30 bar but diminished
   almost to zero after 250 cycles, whereas those for all the others
   increased with the number of temperature cycles. Corrosive reaction of
   Al with water yielded Hp gas and the resulting increase in the gas
   concentration in the water enhanced the nucleation probability of
   cavitation, not on the metal surface but in the solution. In order to
   attain high negative pressures for water in a metal tube, we should take
   into account a possible restriction of this achievement of negative
   pressure by corrosion of metals in contact with water, even though the
   metals used were well de-gassed beforehand.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal administration of adenosine analogs and an adenosine kinase

   present study, we determined the effects of N-6-cyclohexyladenosine
   (adenosine A(1) receptor selective),
   2{[}p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethyl- carboxamidoadenosine
   (CGS-21680) (adenosine A(2A) receptor selective), and
   5-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) (non-selective), on formalin
   induced nociceptive responses (flinching/lifting and licking/biting)
   using two concentrations of formalin (2\% and 5\%). We also examined the
   antinociceptive effects of 5'-amino-5'-deoxyadenosine, an adenosine
   kinase inhibitor, and deoxycoformycin, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor,
   under these conditions. Adenosine A(1) receptor agonists, but not the
   A(2A) selective agent, produced significant antinociception, as did
   5'-amino-5'-deoxyadenosine, but not deoxycoformycin. The extent of
   antinociception produced was greater with the lower stimulus intensity.
   The effects of NECA and 5'-amino-5'-deoxyadenosine were inhibited by
   caffeine, indicating the involvement of cell surface adenosine receptors
   in their actions. We conclude (a) that the adenosine A(1), but not the
   A(2A), receptor is involved in spinally mediated antinociception, (b)
   that adenosine kinase is more important than adenosine deaminase in
   regulating endogenous adenosine levels in the spinal cord, and (c) that
   stimulus intensity is an important determinant of the efficacy of
   purines in the spinal cord.}},

Abstract = {{The preferred orientation of polycrystalline TiN films grown by
   ultrahigh-vacuum reactive-magnetron sputter deposition on amorphous SiO2
   at 350 degrees C in pure N-2 discharges was controllably varied from
   (111) to completely (002) by varying the incident ion/metal flux ratio
   N-2(+) ion energy E(i) maintained constant at similar or equal to 20 eV
   (similar or equal to 10 eV per incident J(i)/J(Ti) from 1 to greater
   than or equal to 5 With the N-2(+) accelerated N). All samples were
   slightly over-stoichiometric with N/Ti=1.02+/-0.03. Films deposited with
   J(i)/J(Ti) = 1 initially exhibit a mixed texture with competitive
   columnar growth which slowly evolves into a nearly complete (111)
   texture at film thicknesses greater than 1 mu m. However, films grown
   with J(i)/J(Ti)greater than or equal to 5 exhibit an essentially
   complete (002) preferred orientation from the earliest observable
   stages. The normalized XRD (002) intensity ratio in thick layers
   increased from similar or equal to 0 to 1 as J(i)/J(Ti) was varied from
   1 to greater than or equal to 5. Both (111) and (001) interplanar
   spacings remained constant as a function of film thickness yielding a
   lattice constant of 0.4240+/-0.0005 nm, equal to that of unstrained bulk
   TiN. Contrary to previous models, the present results establish that TiN
   preferred orientation can be controlled without introducing large

Abstract = {{Anisotropy of the silicon valence band does not lead to any significant
   anisotropy in the longitudinal hole transport properties, but we find
   that the transverse mobility is quite anisotropic. The transverse
   mobility represents the response of charge carriers to a small
   transverse electric field in the presence of a strong longitudinal
   field. A detailed, anisotropic Monte Carlo method has been applied to
   the calculation of the hole transverse differential mobility in silicon.
   The transverse differential mobility is studied both with regard to
   variations in the orientation, with respect to the crystalline axes, of
   the high longitudinal electric field, and with regard to variations in
   the transverse direction of the mobility, taken in the plane
   perpendicular to the high electric field. The anisotropy of the valence
   band causes the transverse differential mobility to strongly vary with
   respect to the electric field orientation. Symmetry considerations show
   that the transverse differential mobility is isotropic in the \{100\}
   and \{111\} planes and has twofold rotational symmetry in the \{101\}
   planes. Our calculations bear this out. Furthermore, we show that the
   transverse mobility can be much different from the chordal mobility, in
   distinction to the case for isotropic band structures. (C) 1995 American

Abstract = {{An analysis procedure for real time spectroscopic ellipsometry data is
   described that allows one to characterize compositional gradients in
   thin films prepared by continuously varying the deposition parameters.
   This approach provides the time evolution of (i) the instantaneous
   deposition rate, (ii) the surface roughness layer thickness, and (iii)
   the near-surface dielectric function and composition of the film with a
   depth resolution as high as 7 Angstrom. We apply the analysis to obtain
   the depth profile of the relative void volume fraction for an amorphous
   silicon-carbon alloy film prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
   deposition. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Neurons in the pontomedullary raphe magnus (RM) and adjacent nucleus
   reticularis paragigantocellularis pars alpha (NRPG alpha) are thought to
   participate in the modulation of spinal nociceptive transmission. In
   order to determine whether these cells also contribute to the
   suppression of nocifensive reflexes produced by general anesthetics, the
   spontaneous activity of RM/NRPG alpha cells was recorded in rats
   anesthetized with isoflurane (IF) at several steady state
   concentrations, corresponding to depths which are below, equal to, or
   above the threshold for blocking the motor response to noxious stimuli
   (minimum alveolar concentration, MAC). Neurons were classified by their
   spontaneous activity patterns and their responses to noxious stimulation
   as OFF, ON, REGULAR or NEUTRAL cells. After cell classification, unit
   activity, arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and EEG activity were
   simultaneously recorded, in the absence of somatic stimulation, for 1 h
   at each of two or three concentrations of IF. The concentrations tested
   were low (1.05-1.25\%), medium (1.30-1.45\%) and high (1.70-1.90\%). ON,
   OFF and some NEUTRAL cells exhibited alternating periods of inactivity
   and activity when recorded during periods of low and medium anesthetic
   concentrations. At high steady state anesthetic concentrations; the mean
   discharge of most OFF, ON and NEUTRAL cells decreased by greater than
   25\% from their mean discharge rate at the low concentration. REGULAR
   cells maintained a uniform firing rate at all steady state anesthetic
   concentrations studied. Since high concentrations of IF do not activate
   OFF cells, the putative inhibitory output neuron of the RM/NRPG alpha,
   it is unlikely that the activity of RM/NRPG alpha neurons contributes to
   the suppression of nocifensive movement by the general anesthetic, IF.}},

Abstract = {{Hermit crabs respond to odors signaling potential shell availability by
   (1) withdrawing if they are in relatively large shells; (2) fleeing if
   the shells are ones they would occupy if given choices; (3)
   investigating if the shells occupied are relatively small. We used these
   behavioral responses as measures of shell fit to assess shell resources
   of Clibanarius vittatus (Bose). From analysis of responses we conclude
   shell resources are dynamic. Behavioral tests suggest many crabs
   occupied relatively large shells in the spring and relatively small
   shells in the fall. Crabs in shells in which they would remain when
   presented with excess shells never comprised more than 30\% of the
   population at any time of the year. Behavior of subpopulations of crabs
   from sand/mud and oyster reef habitats and crabs on land or in water at
   low tide was determined. In the fall, crabs whose behavior indicated
   they occupied relatively small shells for their size were found mainly
   in sand/mud habitats and remained in the water at low tide. Crabs whose
   behavior suggested shells they occupied that fit well were rare. The few
   that were found were found mainly in sand/mud habitats and were equally
   distributed on land and water. Crabs behaving as if shells were large
   for their size were found distributed evenly throughout oyster reef and
   sand/mud habitats and on both land and in water at low tide.
   Distributional results could not be explained by reduced mobility.
   Movement studies showed that even crabs in weighted shells should not be
   trapped by a receding tide. We postulate crab habitat choice is a
   behavioral adjustment that compensates for imperfect shell fit.}},

   In the first instance, the structures can be taken to be (a slight

   which seem to be the most useful are those which can be realized as

   plant transcription extract. The transcript of the potato spindle tuber
   viroid (PSTVd) consists of a monomeric molecule with 17 additional
   nucleotides, thus doubling most of the central conserved region of
   viroids of the PSTVd-class. The transcript can assume four different
   secondary structures, which either co-exist as conformers in solution or
   can be kept as metastable structures after different treatments by
   temperature and/or ionic strength. The structures were analysed by
   thermodynamic calculations and temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis
   and were confirmed by oligonucleotide mapping. Only the so-called
   extended middle structure was processed to exact viroid circles. In this
   structure the 5'-and 3'-ends are branching out from the rod-like viroid
   structure at the loop starting with nucleotide 87. The other structures
   were processed only if they could be rearranged into the active
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{The term onychomycosis refers to fungal infection of the nails whether
   this is a primary event or a secondary infection of a previously
   diseased or traumatised nail. Infection may be due to dermatophyte
   (ringworm, tinea unguium), yeast, or other non-dermatophyte (mould)
   species, and the clinical appearance may indicate the nature of the
   offending organism. In paronychia chronic infection of the nail fold is
   most often coused by Candida species, but bacterial infection with Gram
   negative species such as Pseudomonas may coexist. Acute paronychia
   (whitlow) due to staphylococcal infection may also occur, and the
   presence of these bacterial infections will influence management.
   Invasion of the nail plate by Candida species may occur in the presence
   of paronychia, immune deficiency state (including chronic mucocutaneous
   candidiasis), Raynaud's disease, or endocrine disorders. This paper
   reviews the clinical features of onychomycosis and the differential
   diagnosis of nail dystrophy, gives the reasons for appropriate
   mycological investigation, and discusses guidelines for appropriate
   treatment on the basis of laboratory findings and particular clinical
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The 10 year experience of a single center performing
   allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in 70 patients with chronic
   myeloid leukemia (CML) is analyzed.
   METHODS: Seventy patients transplanted for CML between November 1982 and
   October 1992 were evaluated. Fifty-two patients were in the first
   chronic phase (FC), 10 in an accelerated phase, 4 in blast crisis and 4
   in the second chronic phase. The combination of cyclosporin and
   methotrexate was the most commonly used prophylactic schedule for graft
   versus host disease (GVHD) (60 cases) and T depletion was not performed
   in any case. The combination of cyclosphosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total
   body irradiation was used in 48 patients with the remaining patients
   received busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg). The
   estimation of survival was performed using the Kaplan-Meier limit
   product method. The prognostic factors influencing survival, disease
   free period and relapse were evaluated by Cox multivariate models of
   proportional risk.
   RESULTS: Actuarial survival at four years was 40\% (95\% CI: 26-58\%).
   Multivariate analysis selected variables associated with lower survival,
   the presence of acute GVHD (relative risk -RR-4.75), advanced disease
   phase (RR: 3.26) and age over 30 years (RR: 3.57). Eleven patients had
   relapsed. Multivariate analysis found the absence of chronic GVHD (RE:
   5.3) and advanced phase (RR: 1.91) to be associated to a higher
   probability of relapse. In a separate analysis of the 48 patients
   transplanted in chronic phase who received cyclosporin and methotrexate,
   the disease free survival was longer for those under the age of 30 years
   (71.4\% vs. 36\%) without acute GVHD (68.8\% vs. 39.6\%) and those
   transplanted from a male donor (64.6\% vs. 30\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Advanced phase of the disease, the presence of acute graft
   versus host disease and the age and female sex of the donor are the main
   factors associated to shorter survival in allogeneic bone marrow
   transplant for chronic myeloid leukemia. In contrast, the presence of
   chronic graft versus host disease decreases the possibilities of
   relapse.}},

Abstract = {{Asthma is a manifestation of bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) and forms
   part of the spectrum of atopic diease. Some pedigree studies of atopy
   have suggested linkage with the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon
   RI beta) gene on chromosome 11q13, but others find no linkage. The
   molecular genetics of asthma and BHR have not been studied in the
   general population.
   We examined the genetic linkage of the Fc epsilon RI beta gene with
   clinical asthma and the underlying phenotypes of BHR (to methacholine)
   and atopy (defined by skinprick testing) in 123 affected sibling-pairs
   recruited from the general population. We found evidence of significant
   linkage of a highly polymorphic microsatellite marker in the fifth
   intron of the Fc epsilon RI beta gene to a diagnosis of asthma (18.0\%
   excess of shared alleles, p=0.002) and to SHR (21.7\% excess of shared
   alleles, p=0.001). Significant linkage was also observed in siblings
   sharing BHR when those with atopy were excluded (32.8\% excess of shared
   alleles, p=0.004). Atopy in the absence of BHR did not show significant
   linkage to the Fc epsilon RI beta gene (7.2\% excess of shared alleles,
   p=0.124).
   These findings suggest that mutations in the Fc epsilon RI beta gene or
   a closely linked gene influence the BHR underlying asthma, even in the
   absence of atopy.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that PVN
   administration of equimolar doses of VIP and PHI induce similar
   increases in plasma ACTH and CORT concentrations via the release of CRF
   and vasopressin in fasted, freely moving rats studied during the early
   light cycle. The purpose of these investigations was to determine
   whether VIP and PHI act via the same receptor and/or mechanism.
   Individual studies involving the PVN administration of either VIP or PHI
   in doses ranging from 0.3 to 30.0 nmol/rat demonstrated that VIP
   increases both ACTH and CORT secretion throughout the administered
   range. In contrast, PHI was an effective stimulant in doses up to 15
   nmol/rat but had no effect on either ACTH or CORT at a dose of 30
   nmol/rat thus yielding a bell-shaped dose-response curve. When
   increasing doses of PHI (0.15-3.0 nmol/rat) were administered against a
   background of VIP (3.0 nmol/rat) predictably additive responses were
   observed; however, when increasing doses of VIP (0.15-3.0 nmol/rat) were
   administered with PHI (3.0 nmol/rat) only the higher doses of VIP
   facilitated the PHI-induced secretion while the lower doses of VIP
   actually reduced the PHI-induced ACTH secretion. Finally, pretreatment
   with {[}Lys(1), pro(2,5),Arg(3,4),Tyr(6)]-VIP, anVIP (1.5 nmol/rat)
   totally suppressed VIP-induced ACTH secretion but had no effect on
   PI-II-induced secretion. These studies collectively suggest that VIP and
   PHI utilize different receptors/mechanisms to regulate HPA secretion.
   Furthermore, when a range of doses of anVIP (1.5-30.0 nmol/rat) was
   tested against VIP (3.0 nmol/rat), ACTH secretion was totally suppressed
   at all doses of the antagonist. However, the maximal reduction of CORT
   secretion occurred at the lowest dose of anVIP and increasing doses were
   less and less effective, suggesting that not only PHI but VIP may also
   both stimulate and inhibit HPA secretion. While both the stimulatory and
   the inhibitory actions of PHI appear to involve ACTH, only the
   stimulatory action of VIP is ACTH-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{The first numeric dating of late Pleistocene loess from the Palouse
   region of eastern Washington is reported. This loess is interbedded with
   thin, distal tephra layers, some identified as Mount St. Helens
   products. Both the interbedded tephra layers and thick paleosols that
   have developed in the loess have previously been correlated across the
   region. A thicker correlative of one of these tephra layers (Mount St.
   Helens set C) was collected from Summer Lake, Oregon, for direct dating
   by thermoluminescence (TL). Polymineral, fine grain TL ages for loess
   from three chosen sections in Washington range from 17 to 83 ka. These
   imply ages for some tephra beds that are significantly older than
   implied by earlier radiocarbon (C-14) dating. For example, TL ages of
   17-21 ka for loess bracketing a tephra layer correlated to Mount St.
   Helens set S suggests a somewhat older age for this ash than the
   previously accepted C-14 age of similar to 15.5 +/- 0.5 ka cal yr
   (corrected to calendar years). TL ages of 46 +/- 6 (1 sigma) ka and 57
   +/- 7 ka for loess above, and of 53 +/- 7 ka and <75 +/- 6 ka below a
   tephra bed correlated to a Mount St. Helens set Cw layer, along with a
   TL age of 46 +/- 5 ka for fine-silt-sized glass from a Mount St. Helens
   set Cy bed in Oregon, revise upward from similar to 38 ka cal yr (C-14
   age is similar to 36 ka B.P.) to similar to 50 ka the age of this
   regionally important marker ash set. Several TL ages, taken together,
   imply a much longer eruptive history for Mount St. Helens than
   previously thought. A TL age of 83 +/- 8 ka just below a previously
   undated tephra layer from Mount St. Helens (EMSH ash) suggests that the
   eruptive history of the mountain extends back to at least 80 ka.
   Furthermore, age depth extrapolation through our sections to an ash
   (WA-5C) probably correlated to Mount St. Helens suggests an eruptive
   history of at least 120 ka.}},

   perturbation theory at the MP4SDTQ level of approximation provides more

   the most accurate method used in our previous work. These calculations
   prove the presence of ferromagnetic ordering within the same
   quasi-graphite plane of ferrocarbon crystal. The presence of such
   ordering has been shown within the same quasi-graphite plane upon
   substitution of sp(3) carbon atoms by ions B-, N+ and so on.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured proton release into the medium after proton transfer
   from the retinal Schiff base to Asp(85) in the photocycle and the C=O
   stretch bands of carboxylic acids in wild type bacteriorhodopsin and the
   E204Q and E204D mutants. In E204Q, but not in E204D, the normal proton
   release is absent. Consistent with this, a negative band in the Fourier
   transform infrared difference spectra at 1700 cm(-1) in the wild type,
   which we now attribute to depletion of the protonated E204, is also
   absent in E204Q, In E204D, this band is shifted to 1714 cm(-1), as
   expected from the higher frequency for a protonated aspartic than for a
   glutamic acid. Consistent with their origin from protonated carboxyls,
   the depletion bands in the wild type and E204D shift in D2O to 1690 and
   1703 cm(-1), respectively. In the protein structure, Glu(204) seems to
   be connected to the Schiff base region by a chain of hydrogen-bonded
   water. As with other residues closer to the Schiff base, replacement of
   Glu(204) with glutamine changes the O-H stretch frequency of the bound
   water molecule near Asp(85) that undergoes hydrogen-bonding change in
   the photocycle. The results therefore identify Glu(204) as XH, the
   earlier postulated residue that is the source of the released proton
   during the transport, and suggest that its deprotonation is triggered by
   the protonation of Asp(85) through a network that contains water
   dipoles.}},

Abstract = {{The neoclassical analysis is a field in which fuzzy continuous functions
   are investigated. For this purpose, new measures of continuity and
   discontinuity (or defects of continuity) are introduced and studied.
   Based on such measures, classes of fuzzy continuous functions are
   defined and their properties are obtained. The class of fuzzy continuous
   functions may be considered as a fuzzy set of continuous functions. Its
   support consists of all functions on some topological space X into a
   metric space Y and its membership function is the corresponding
   continuity measure. Such an expansion provides a possibility to complete
   some important classical results. Connections between boundedness and
   fuzzy continuity are investigated. Criteria of boundedness and local
   boundedness are obtained for functions on Eucleadean spaces.
   Besides, such new concepts as fuzzy convergence and fuzzy uniform
   convergence are introduced and investigated. Their properties and
   connections with fuzzy continuous functions are explicated. Some
   results, which are obtained here, are similar to the results of
   classical mathematical analysis, while others differ essentially from
   those that are proved in classical mathematics, In the first case
   classical results are consequences of the corresponding results of
   neoclassical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium effect on nucleolar activity in the presence of heavy metals
   (Cd, Cr, Pb) was assessed by determining the variation in number and
   diameter of nucleoli in cortex cells of Pisum sativum. The ability of
   cells to incorporate H-3-uridine and H-3-lysine into nuclei, nucleoli
   and cytoplasm was also determined. The presence of metals increased the
   number of cells with one nucleolus and lowered the number of cells with
   two but mostly with three nucleoli, Calcium added to chromium diminished
   the number of cells with one nucleolus increasing those with two
   nucleoli when this ion was present in cadmium solution. The size of a
   single nucleolus as well as a total nucleolar dimension in the nucleus
   of cells both in calcium and those treated with metals underwent
   reduction as its number increased. Calcium alone and that added to metal
   solutions enhanced the size of a single nucleolus as well as the total
   nucleolar dimension. In material treated with heavy metals or after
   calcium addition the intensity of RNA synthesis in nucleolus and
   radioactivity of nucleus was positively correlated with the number of
   nucleoli. Disturbances in this relation within nucleolus and nucleus
   appeared in the presence of cadmium and lead as well as after calcium
   addition. No relation between the number of nucleoli and radioactivity
   of cytoplasm was seen in all experimental series except calcium alone.
   The lack of positive correlation between the number of nucleoli and
   radioactivity of nucleoli, nuclei and cytoplasm was also observed after
   incubation with H-3-lysine. Exception was nucleolus in the presence of
   calcium or chromium and lead after calcium addition.}},

Abstract = {{A recent cruise to the Office of Naval Research Atlantic Natural
   Laboratory obtained similar to 100\% Hydrosweep bathymetric coverage,
   >200\% Hawaii MR1 (HMR1) side scan coverage, gravity and magnetics over
   an area spanning three ridge segments along axis (similar to 25 degrees
   25'N to similar to 27 degrees 10'N), and crustal ages from 0 to 26-30 Ma
   (similar to 400 km) on the west flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This
   data set represents a first opportunity for an extensive regional
   analysis of abyssal hill morphology created at a slow spreading ridge.
   The primary purpose of this work is to investigate the relationship
   between abyssal hill morphology and the properties of the ridge crest at
   which they were formed. We apply the method of Goff and Jordan {[}1988]
   for the estimation of two-dimensional statistical properties of abyssal
   hill morphology from the gridded Hydrosweep bathymetry. Important
   abyssal hill parameters derived from this analysis include
   root-mean-square (rms) height, characteristic width, and plan view
   aspect ratio. The analysis is partitioned into two substudies: (1)
   analysis of near-axis (<7 Ma) abyssal hills for each of the three
   segments and (2) analysis of temporal variations (similar to 2-29 Ma) in
   abyssal hill morphology along the run of the south segment. The results
   of this analysis are compared and correlated with analysis of the
   gravity data and preliminary determination of faulting characteristics
   based on HMR1 side scan data. Principal results of this study are: (1)
   Abyssal hill morphology within the study region is strongly influenced
   by the inside-outside corner geometry of the mid-ocean ridge segments;
   abyssal hills originating at inside corners have larger rms height and
   characteristic width and smaller plan view aspect ratio than those
   originating at outside corners. (2) The residual mantle Bouguer gravity
   anomaly is positively correlated with intersegment and along-flow-line
   variations in rms height and characteristic width, and it is negatively
   correlated with plan view aspect ratio. From this result, we infer that
   lower-relief, narrower, and more elongated abyssal hills are produced
   when the crust being generated is thicker. (3) Intersegment variations
   in near-axis rms height negatively correlate with average fault density
   as determined from analysis of HMR1 side scan imagery.}},

Abstract = {{A new acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (13) containing an adenine moiety
   was synthesized, which acted as an excellent inhibitor of calf mucosal
   adenosine deaminase. This inhibitory property allows it to exert great
   synergistic effect on certain antiviral agents (e.g., ara-A, 37).
   Phosphonate 13 was not phosphorylated by the bovine brain guanylate
   kinase nor by 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate synthetase. Syntheses of
   biologically active nucleotide phosphonate 40 and its phosphonoamidate
   derivative 42 were accomplished, which showed remarkable activity
   against herpes viruses and exhibited low host cell toxicity.
   3'-Azido-nucleoside phosphonate 20 and 3'-fluoronucleoside phosphonate
   32, as well as the corresponding dinucleotide analogs 47 and 48, and
   their respective phosphonoamidates 53-56 were also synthesized as new
   compounds, among which phosphonoamidates 53-56 showed potent activity
   against human immunodeficiency virus. Phosphonoamidates 55 and 56
   bearing a methyl D-alaninate moiety exhibited less cellular toxicity
   than 53 and 54 bearing a methyl L-alaninate moiety. Nucleotide
   phosphonate 40 as well as dinucleotide phosphonates 47 and 48 were found
   susceptible to degradation by phosphodiesterases. Their respective

Abstract = {{Transition structures for the 1,3-polar addition of azide anion to
   hydrogen cyanide, formaldimine, nitrogen, cis- and trans-diazene,
   ethylene and acetylene were obtained at the MP2/6-31+G{*} theoretical
   model. The additions can be divided into two groups: addition to a
   triple bond, giving rise to an aromatic heterocyclic product, and
   addition to a double bond, forming a non-aromatic product. All
   transition structures correspond to a concerted mechanism for the polar
   cycloaddition. Symmetrical dienophiles, apart from cis-diazene, give
   rise to synchronous transition structures. The anomaly is explained in
   terms of strong n-n repulsion of the reactants in the transition
   structure. The reactivity of the compounds can be rationalized in terms
   of the bond orders of the newly forming bonds, from the frontier orbital
   energy differences and from the charge transfer from the azide anion to
   the dienophile. The quantitative correlation of the reactivity has been
   judged on the basis of the activation energies of the reactions
   calculated at MP2/6-31+G{*} and MP3/6-31+G{*}. It is predicted that the
   addition of azide to nitrogen is the slowest and that the additions to
   hydrogen cyanide and acetylene have the lowest barriers, in agreement
   with literature data.}},

Abstract = {{A strong association between interatrial septal aneurysm (IASA) and
   stroke has recently led many authors to consider IASA as a potential
   cardiac source of embolism. We studied the morphological characteristics
   and main associations of MSA in a large cooperative study based on
   transoesophageal echocardiographic examinations; 259 IASA were studied
   in 134 men and 125 women with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years. Fifty-five
   percent of IASA were found to overlap the commonly described fossa
   ovalis region, IASA protruded into the right atrium in 90\% of the
   cases. They appeared thin in 81\% of the patients and highly mobile in
   79\%. Fifty-eight percent of patients had a history of systemic embolic
   events, while an atrial septal shunt was detected in 61\% of the
   patients. In patients with an embolic event, only the mobility of IASA
   was significantly higher than in those with no embolic event. In nine
   cases a pulmonary embolism was associated with arterial embolism.
   Furthermore, we reported three cases of paradoxical embolism. However,
   the true demonstration of a thrombus within the IASA was quite rare.
   Conclusion: IASA is probably an important risk factor for stroke. In
   patients with IASA and a history of embolic events, IASA may enhance
   migration of a thrombus constituted in situ or transiting through it.
   Marked mobility of IASA may also increase the risk of peripheral
   embolus.}},

Abstract = {{In several glassy polymer-solvent systems the observed initial uptake of
   solvent is linear in time. A sharp front moving at a constant velocity
   v(0) divides the polymer into two regions: ahead of the front the
   solvent concentration is low and the polymer is still glassy, while
   behind it the concentration is high and the polymer has been
   plasticized. Here a simple description of this process is presented. It
   is based on the idea that the slow plasticization kinetics sets an upper
   limit for the flux of solvent into the glassy region. Our description
   predicts that the front velocity will crossover to the usual 1/root t
   behaviour at t approximate to tau(1) = D-1/v(0)(2) (here D-1 is the
   diffusion coefficient for solvent in the plasticized region) and that an
   induction time (whose duration depends on the value of the diffusion
   coefficient D-0 in the glassy region) will precede the establishment of
   the front.}},

Abstract = {{The GATA motif (WGATAR) is found in the promoter regions of numerous
   Caenorhabditis elegans genes, including two intestine-specific genes,
   vit-2 and ges-l, in which it has been shown to be required for promoter
   function. The protein ELT-1, encoded by a single-copy gene homologous to
   the GATA family of vertebrate transcription factors, is potentially
   capable of interacting with this element. In order to determine whether
   ELT-1 is a transcriptional activator that recognizes this sequence, we
   have expressed it under the control of the GAL1 promoter in yeast. lacZ
   driven by the CYC1 promoter lacking an upstream activation sequence
   (UAS) but containing GATA sequences was used as a reporter.
   beta-Galactosidase was expressed upon induction only when GATA sequences
   were present, and expression was increased dramatically by additional
   binding sites. Deletion analysis demonstrated that the C terminus,
   containing only one of the two zinc fingers, is sufficient for
   activation. In addition, the DNA-binding domain and two transactivation
   regions were identified by fusing these isolated domains to previously
   defined domains of heterologous transcription factors. While most single
   base alterations in the GATA core sequence eliminated activity, an A to
   C change in position four, creating a GATC core, was found to increase
   activity significantly. The deleted ELT-1 protein containing only the
   C-terminal Zn finger was sufficient for activation in response to GATA,
   but both fingers were required for activation at GATC. A variety of
   sites with non-optimal sequences surrounding the GATA core also were
   found to be excluded better by the protein containing both Zn fingers.
   Furthermore, a fusion protein containing the entire ELT-1 DNA binding
   domain fused to the VP16 activation domain was found to have an even
   greater preference for the GATC core, as well as the optimal flanking
   bases. We conclude that, although ELT-1 having only its C-terminal
   finger is capable of activation in response to the WGATAR site, the
   presence of the upstream finger supplies additional base specificity.

Abstract = {{A detailed analysis of high-resolution side-scan sonar data shows that
   the volcanic edifices built within the axial zones of the slow spreading
   (20 mm/yr) Reykjanes Ridge and the slow spreading (25 mm/yr)
   Mid-Atlantic Ridge are remarkably similar. In fact, individual
   seamounts, hummocks (rounded mounds), and hummocky ridges at the
   Reykjanes Ridge have nearly identical morphological counterparts at the
   Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), arguing that commonly eruptive conditions are
   similar at the two ridges. The construction of these volcanic edifices,
   typical of slow spreading ridges, occurs at the Reykjanes Ridge despite
   its proximity to the Iceland hot spot and the influence of the hot spot
   on other characteristics of the ridge axis, such as its overall shape
   (an axial high north of about 59 degrees N), its shallow axial depths,
   and its thicker crustal section. The volume of magma that goes into
   constructing volcanic edifices at each of 12 segments of the MAR and
   four regions of the Reykjanes Ridge is calculated using multibeam
   bathymetry data. Our results indicate that edifice volume per unit
   seafloor area, equivalent to a uniform thickness over the area of
   interest, is larger at the MAR than at the Reykjanes Ridge, on average.
   Taking into account spreading rate, we then estimate B, the average
   building rate per unit length along the axis, which is also larger at
   the MAR. We conclude that the same volcanic edifices build the crust at
   the Reykjanes Ridge and MAR, but that their emplacement is more frequent
   at the MAR. To explain our results and reconcile them with those of
   Magde and Smith (1995) who documented that seamounts are taller and more
   abundant at the Reykjanes Ridge than at the MAR, we consider the
   controls on diking and eruption within the axial zones of the two
   ridges. We suggest that the combination of slower spreading rate and the
   oblique geometry of spreading at the Reykjanes Ridge leads to fewer
   eruptions which are more widely dispersed across the axial zone than at
   the MAR. If this hypothesis is correct, the proportion of seamounts
   modified by subsequent eruptions will be less. This might also explain
   the taller heights of the seamounts if there is less overlap and
   infilling between edifices.}},

   insulin has been reported to be inconsistent, Also, the involvement of
   calmodulin (CaM) in insulin stimulation of PDE has been controversial,
   In this report, conditions for the isolation of rat liver plasma
   membranes containing PDE that is sensitive to in vitro insulin
   stimulation and the involvement of CaM in insulin stimulation of PDE
   were investigated, In vitro insulin raised the V-max of the enzyme
   without altering its apparent K-m and was dose dependent. Insulin
   stimulation was lost after freezing, sonication, solubilization with
   detergents, or storage of the membranes at 4 degrees C for 4 h after
   isolation, Insulin stimulation was completely blocked by the CaM
   antagonist compound 48/80, EG;TA, or trifluoperazine, Two isoforms of
   membrane-bound PDE were separated by ion-exchange chromatography
   following solubilization of the plasma membranes, The activities of both
   isoforms were stimulated by exogenous CaM. Plasma membrane PDE eluted
   after the application of exogenous CaM plus Ca2+. The data support the
   concept of a critical involvement of CaM in insulin activation of liver

Abstract = {{Folates and antifolates are converted to polyglutamates, which are
   better retained in cells and may also bind more tightly to cellular
   proteins than the parent compounds. The regulation of the process of
   polyglutamate formation and breakdown is not fully clarified yet and is
   being studied by a number of approaches. An early observation concerning
   the potential regulation of polyglutamate formation was that insulin
   caused a marked increase in the rate and accumulation of polyglutamates
   of methotrexate (MTX) in rat hepatoma cells. The present study
   demonstrated that insulin caused a decrease in the activity of
   gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GH), the enzyme that degrades polyglutamates,
   that was inversely commensurate with the increase in the synthesis of
   MTX polyglutamates. The effects of insulin on GH activity with regard to
   concentration, time of onset, and the effect of N-6, O-2' dibutyryl CAMP
   and theophylline were consistent with the reduction in GH being
   responsible for the increase in cellular MTX polyglutamate accumulation.
   Insulin addition also led to an increase in folate polyglutamates. The
   insulin effects were also seen with H35D cells, a subline with enhanced
   glutamyl hydrolase activity as a result of having been made resistant to
   5, 10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid. When H35 cells with insulin were
   compared with H35D cells lacking insulin, there was an 8-fold increase
   in GH and a 44-fold decrease in the number of gamma-glutamate residues
   added to MTX.}},

Abstract = {{The potentially pathological example of LaO has been chosen to test the
   application of ligand field theory (LFT) to metal monoxides. The test
   consists of a comparison of closed-shell ligand LFT (CSLLFT) results (in
   which a 2(+)/2(-) ionic M(2+)O(2-) model is a priori postulated with a
   point-charge ligand) against ab initio multiconfiguration
   self-consistent-field-multireference configuration interaction
   (MCSCF-MRCI) results (in which no ionicity is assumed a priori and an
   internal structure is allowed for the ligand). Special care has been
   devoted to the determination of a La3+ pseudopotential and its
   associated atomic basis set in order to keep the ab initio model close
   to the LFT one, yet at the same time capable of clearly exhibiting the
   consequences and the importance of the restrictions imposed in the
   CSLLFT model. The ab initio calculations reveal that the effective
   (Mulliken) ionicity in LaO is not La2+O2- but quite close to La+O-.
   Despite this, the (2(+)/2(-)) ionic CSLLFT model leads to the correct
   orbital occupations in the ground state but this model cannot account
   for the significant covalency contribution via the nominal 2p sigma and
   2p pi oxygen orbitals. The CSLLFT calculations correctly reproduce the
   excitation energies of the four lowest-lying observed states of LaO:
   these states are calculated to within 2000 cm(-1) and globally better
   than via ab initio calculations. However, the (2(+)/2(-)) ionic CSLLFT
   model is shown to ignore the existence of a manifold of low-lying
   quartet (and doublet) states of (1(+)/1(-)) ionicity that might be
   relevant for interpreting features of the spectrum. This result
   exemplifies the need for developing, beyond the first attempts made in
   this direction, a computationally manageable open-shell ligand theory
   for the frequently encountered case of predominantly ionic structures
   with an open-shell ligand. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Recent empirical evidence supports the importance of adequate

   concealment have been associated with larger treatment effects compared
   with trials in which authors reported adequate allocation concealment.
   While that provides empirical evidence of bias being interjected into
   trials, trial investigators rarely document the sensitive details of
   subverting the intended purpose of randomization. This article relates
   anonymous accounts of deciphering assignment sequences before allocation
   based on experiences acquired from epidemiologic workshops for
   physicians. These accounts run the gamut from simple to intricate
   operations, from transillumination of envelopes to searching for code in
   the office files of the principal investigator. They indicate that
   deciphering is something more frequent than a rare occurrence. These
   accounts prompt some methodological recommendations to help prevent
   deciphering. Randomized controlled trials appear to annoy human
   nature-if properly conducted, indeed they should.}},

Abstract = {{The rRNA-encoding genes (rDNAs) have been cloned and characterized from
   Wolbachia pipientis (Wp), the gonadial bacteria-like parasite of the
   mosquito Culex pipiens (Cp) and the moth Ephestia cautella (Ec). In Wp
   from both insect species the rDNAs are organized in a way which appears
   to be very unusual. The rRNAs are encoded by two unlinked transcription
   units, each present in a single copy per genome. One contains the 16S
   rDNA only, while the other is an operon encoding both the 23S and 5S
   rDNAs. Each transcription unit contains two putative upstream promoters,
   and downstream a Rho-independent terminator. The 16S rDNA, as well as
   the 23S-5S rRNA operon are not linked to any tRNA-encoding sequence and
   lack the antitermination boxes which are usually present immediately
   downstream from eubacterial promoters of rDNAs. Wp infecting Ec and Cp
   are highly similar taking as criteria the rDNAs and their flanking
   sequences. However, it clearly appears that each insect species harbours
   a different and specific Wp strain, or even subspecies. Phylogenetic
   relationships deduced from the complete sequences of their rDNAs
   undoubtedly confirm that Wp from Cp and Ec belong to the alpha-group of
   Proteobacteria, and are closely related to the Rickettsia.}},

Abstract = {{The quantal behaviour of a particle in a one-dimensional triangular
   potential well, driven by a monochromatic electric field, is studied. A
   classical high-frequency expansion together with semiclassical uniform
   methods are used to obtain an explicit form, of the Roquet evolution
   operator in the unperturbed basis. A local exact solution is found for
   the eigenvalue equation of this operator under certain conditions. The
   local solution provides a tool for the quantitative investigation of the
   eigenstates. It predicts the appearance of quasi-resonances, or photonic
   states, and gives their location, shape and width as a function of
   parameters. It also predicts a local crossover from a decaying region to
   a more extended region as a function of n, with a point of crossover n,
   between them. The results concerning the local structures are used to
   justify and extend a previously suggested method for the investigation
   of the asymptotic properties of the eigenstates. These are found to
   decay with a power depending on the field parameters (first proposed by
   Benvenuto et al). The specific system studied here is suggested as a
   prototype model for a class of driven one-dimensional bound systems,
   whose main characteristic is an increasing density of states as a

Abstract = {{The pathway of protein folding is now being analyzed at the resolution
   of individual residues by kinetic measurements on suitably engineered
   mutants. The kinetic methods generally employed for studying folding are
   typically limited to the time range of greater than or equal to 1 ms
   because the folding of denatured proteins is usually initiated by mixing
   them with buffers that favor folding, and the dead time of rapid mixing
   experiments is about a millisecond. We now show that the study of
   protein folding may be extended to the microsecond time region by using
   temperature-jump measurements on the cold-unfolded state of a suitable
   protein. We are able to detect early events in the folding of mutants of
   barstar, the polypeptide inhibitor of barnase. A preliminary
   characterization of the fast phase from spectroscopic and Phi-value
   analysis indicates that it is a transition between two relatively
   solvent-exposed states with little consolidation of structure.}},

Abstract = {{A series of polystyrene/poly(ethyl acrylate-n-butyl acrylate)
   {[}PS/P(EA-nBA)] latex interpenetrating polymer networks (LIPNs) were
   synthesized by the two-stage emulsion polymerization method. The
   influence of composition, crosslinker content, chain transfer agent,
   polar group, and feeding sequence on the damping properties of the LIPNs
   were investigated with a Rheovibron Viscoelastometer. The results show
   that the PS/P(EA-nBA) LIPNs are a partially miscible system, and that
   LIPNs favor the broadening of the damping temperature range. The
   influence of crosslinker content of network I on the damping properties
   of the LIPNs is not the same as that of network II. The damping
   properties of the PS/P(EA-nBA) LIPN is superior to that of P(EA-nBA)/PS
   LIPN. Moreover, the introduction of polar groups into the system can
   increase the damping properties, and adding chain transfer agent can
   broaden the damping temperature range. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   surfactant-rich phases. Where there was an initial association between
   the polymer and surfactant, separation occurred at higher

   flocculation, a theory for which gives the approximate distributions of

   understood by comparison with their effects on the cloud points of the

Abstract = {{Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) apparently
   forms Cl- channels in apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells. A
   detailed model describes molecular structure and biophysical properties
   of CFTR and the impact of various mutations as they occur in cystic
   fibrosis. In the present report mutations were introduced into the
   putative 6th alpha-helical transmembrane pore forming domain of CFTR.
   The mutants were subsequently expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection
   of the respective cRNAs. Whole cell (wc) conductances could be
   reversibly activated by IBMX (1 mmol/l) only in oocytes injected with
   wild-type (wt) or mutant CFTR but not in oocytes injected with mater or
   antisense CFTR. The activated conductance was partially inhibited by
   (each 100 mu mol/l) DIDS (27\%) and glibenclamide (77\%), but not by 10
   mu mol/l NPPB. The following mutations were examined: K335E, R347E,
   R334E, K335H, R347H, R334H. They did not measurably change the wt-CFTR
   anion permeability (P) and we conductance (G) sequence of: P-Cl- > P-Br-
   > P-l- and G(Cl-) > G(Cl-) > G(l-), respectively. Moreover, anomalous
   mole fraction behavior for the ck cAMP activated current could not be
   detected: neither in wt-CFTR nor in R347E-CFTR. Various mutants for
   which positively charged amino acids were replaced by histidines (K335H,
   R347H, R334H) did not show pH sensitivity of the IBMX activated we
   conductance. We, therefore, cannot confirm previous results, CFTR might
   have a different molecular structure than previously suggested or it
   might act as a regulator of ion conductances.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate interactions between the polychlorinated biphenyl-binding
   protein uteroglobin and phospholipids, we used a liposome-pelletting
   assay. PCB-BP/uteroglobin bound to liposomes made from negatively
   charged phospholipids (PtdSer and PtdIns) in the presence of 5 mM
   calcium, No binding to liposomes made from phospholipids without net
   charge (PtdChol and PtdEtn) was observed, nor could we detect binding in
   the absence of calcium or when magnesium was substituted for calcium.
   This suggests that PCB-BP/uteroglobin can bind to phospholipids in vivo
   and may have a role in the phospholipid homeostasis of the airway and/or
   secretory pathway of the Clara cell.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of two mixing geometries (at the same scale) with
   different flow energy distributions on the performance of the
   gibberellic acid fermentation and on the morphology of the producing
   fungus Fusarium moniliforme was investigated. Fermentations were
   performed using a turbine mixing system (TMS) and a counterflow mixing
   system (CMS), which were high and low power number mixing systems,
   respectively. Different agitator speed rate profiles were maintained to
   obtain equal specific power inputs to both mixing systems. Substantial
   differences in morphology and productivity of F. moniliforme were found.
   To investigate the causes of these differences, local values and spectra
   of the kinetic energy of flow fluctuations were measured during the
   fermentations using a stirring intensity measuring device (SIMD) and a
   frequency spectrum analyzer. Biomass and gibberellic acid concentrations
   were found to be higher in the TMS, where the energy distribution was
   less even, and where the main part of the energy was at small
   frequencies (large eddies). An automated image analysis method was used
   for quantitative characterization of F. moniliforme freely dispersed
   mycelia and clump morphology. A higher proportion of clumped mycelia
   with clumps of larger area, perimeter, and roughness was observed in the
   TMS. A correlation between the morphology and productivity was found,
   and TMS favored the development of more productive mycelia with longer
   and thinner hyphae. Introduced power was not a good parameter to
   characterize different impellers, even at a given scale. (C) 1995 John

Abstract = {{Kinetics of lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of esters were modeled using
   reactant activities for aqueous-organic, biphasic systems. By using
   thermodynamic activities of the substrates in ordinary rate equations,
   the kinetic parameters were corrected for the contribution of
   substrate-solvent interactions and a uniform quantification of the
   substrates for lipase attached to the interface can be achieved. The
   kinetic parameters, on the basis of their thermodynamic activities,
   should be constant in different systems, provided that the solvents do
   not interfere with the binding of the substrates to the enzyme nor
   affect the catalytic mechanism. Experimental and computational methods
   on how to obtain the thermodynamic activities of the substrates are
   presented. Initial rates were determined for Pseudomonas cepacia lipase
   (PcL)-catalyzed hydrolysis of decyl chloroacetate in dynamic emulsions
   with various solvents. The thermodynamic equilibrium and corrected
   kinetic constants for this reaction appeared to be similar in various
   systems. The kinetics of Pet in an isooctane-aqueous biphasic system
   could be adequately described with the rate equation for a ping-pong
   mechanism. The observed inhibitory effect of decanol appeared to be a
   consequence of this mechanism, allowing the backreaction of the decanol
   with the chloroacetyl-enzyme complex. The kinetic performance of Pet in
   systems with toluene, dibutyl ether, and methyl isobutyl ketone could be
   less well described. The possible causes for this and for the remaining
   differences in corrected kinetic parameters are discussed. (C) 1995 John

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine whether Glimepiride, an oral
   sulfonylurea drug, prevents the onset of diabetes in diabetic prone BB
   rats. S750181, a sulfonylurea drug that has minimal in vivo glucose
   metabolic effects, was also tested. In addition, the shortest period of
   sulfonylurea treatment required for prevention was determined. Eighty
   rats were studied for all treatment periods with 40 receiving a daily
   oral gavage dosage of Glimepiride and 40 receiving a daily oral gavage
   dosage of vehicle solution. Diabetes onset was monitored by glycosuria
   and blood glucose levels. In study I, with a treatment period of 35-142
   days of age, Glimepiride-treated rats showed a 32\% incidence of
   diabetes, whereas control rats had a diabetes incidence of 55\%
   (p<0.04). In study II, with a treatment period of 60-140 days of age,
   Glimepiride-treated rats showed a 29\% incidence of diabetes compared to
   54\% in controls (p<0.03). Further, comparing the time of diabetes onset
   between the Glimepiride and control groups showed that Glimepiride
   delays diabetes onset (p<0.02). In study III, with a treatment period of
   50-100 days of age, Glimepiride-treated rats showed a 17\% overall
   diabetes incidence at 170 days, whereas the controls were 43\% (p<0.01).
   In study IV, with a treatment period of 60-140 days of age,
   S750181-treated rats showed a 38\% diabetes incidence and the control
   group showed a 43\% diabetes incidence. There was no significant
   delaying or prevention effect observed in the S750181 group. To
   determine if Glimepiride affected autoimmune events, the severity of
   islet inflammation was examined. In study I, islet histology from total
   and nondiabetic animals indicated that Glimepiride-treated rats had a
   lower severity of islet inflammation than that of the control rats
   (p=0.023). These studies show that a) Glimepiride has diabetes
   preventive effects, b) shorter treatment periods of only 40 days can be
   effective and c) Glimepiride decreases the severity of islet
   inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Transgenic mice that overexpress v-Ha-ras, c-myc, c-neu or int-2
   proto-oncogenes in the mammary epithelium develop breast tumors with
   morphologies that are characteristic of each initiating oncogene, Since
   these morphological differences reflect distinctive patterns of
   tumor-specific gene expression, the identification of the products of
   these genes might shed light on the mechanisms of transformation and/or
   the identity of target cells that are transformed by specific classes of
   oncogenes, By focusing on the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway, we have
   found that the transmembranal protein-tyrosine phosphatase epsilon (PTP
   epsilon) is highly expressed in murine mammary tumors initiated by c-neu
   and v-Ha-ras, but not in mammary tumors initiated by c-myc or int-2.
   This difference is striking and occurs both in primary tumors and in
   epithelial cells cultured from them, Moreover, PTP epsilon
   overexpression appears to be mammary tumor-specific in that it is not
   found in other ras-based tumors and cell lines, These observations
   suggest that PTP epsilon either plays a role in ras- and neu-mediated
   transformation of mammary epithelium or marks mammary epithelial cells
   particularly susceptible to transformation by these oncogenes, Because
   of its distinctive expression in these mammary tumors, we have further
   characterized murine PTP epsilon, cloning and determining the complete
   structures of its cDNAs and showing that it is a glycoprotein that is
   N-glycosylated in a tissue-specific manner.}},

Abstract = {{Synaptotagmins I and II are inositol high polyphosphate series (inositol
   1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate,
   and inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate) binding proteins, which are
   thought to be essential for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis of neurosecretory
   vesicles. In this study, we analyzed the inositol high polyphosphate
   series binding site in the C2B domain by site-directed mutagenesis and
   compared the IP4 binding properties of the C2B domains of multiple
   synaptotagmins (II-IV). The IP4 binding domain of synaptotagmin II is
   characterized by a cluster of highly conserved, positively charged amino
   acids (321 GKRLKKKKTTVKKK 324). Among these, three lysine residues, at
   positions 327, 328, and 332 in the middle of the C2B domain, which is
   not conserved in the C2A domain, were found to be essential for IF,
   binding in synaptotagmin II, When these lysine residues were altered to
   glutamine, the IP4 binding ability was completely abolished. The primary
   structures of the IP4 binding sites are highly conserved among
   synaptotagmins I through IV. However, synaptotagmin III did not show
   significant binding ability, which may be due to steric hindrance by the
   C-terminal flanking region. These functional diversities of C2B domains
   suggest that not all synaptotagmins function as inositol high
   polyphosphate sensors at the synaptic vesicle.}},

Abstract = {{We have shown previously (Nishimura, M., Fedorov, S., and Uyeda, K,
   (1994) (J, Biol, Chem, 269, 26100-26106) that the administration of high
   concentrations of glu cose stimulates dephosphorylation of Fru-6-P,a
   kinase: Fru-2,6-bisphosphatase in perfused liver, and xylulose (Xu) 5-P
   activates the dephosphorylation reaction, To characterize the protein
   phosphatase, we have purified the Xu Ei-P-activated protein phosphatase
   to homogeneity from livers of rats injected with high glucose, Several
   protein phosphatases in the livers were separated by DEAE cellulose
   chromatography, but only one peak of the enzyme was activated by Xu 5 P.
   The protein phosphatase was inhibited by okadaic acid (IC50 = 1-3 nM)
   and did not require Mg2+ or Ca2+, suggesting that the enzyme was type
   2A, The enzyme was a heterotrimer (M(r) = 150,000) and consisted of
   structural (A, 65 kDa), catalytic (C, 36 kDa), and regulatory (B, 52
   M)a) subunits, Amino acid sequences of five tryptic peptides derived
   from the B subunit showed similarity with those of the B alpha isoform
   of rat protein phosphatase 2A, but five out of 73 residues were
   different, The protein phosphatase catalyzed dephosphorylation of
   Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase, phosphorylase K-m and pyruvate kinase,
   and the K, values were 0.8 mu M, 3.7 mu M, and 2.2 mu M, respectively,
   Among these substrates dephosphorylation of only the bifunctional enzyme
   was activated by Xu 5-P, and the K-a value for Xu 5-P was 20 ELM. Xu 5 P
   was the only sugar phosphate which activated the PP2A among all the
   sugar phosphates examined.
   These results demonstrated the existence and isolation of a unique
   heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A in rat liver which catalyzed the
   dephosphorylation of Fru-6-P,2-kinase:Fru-2,6-Pase and was activated
   specifically by Xu 5-P, The Xu 5-P-activated protein phosphatase 2A
   explains the increased Fru 2,6-P-2 level in liver after high glucose
   administration.}},

Abstract = {{Biochemical studies of signaling mediated by many cytokine and growth
   factor receptors have implicated members of the Jak family of tyrosine
   kinases in these pathways. Specifically, Jak3 has been shown to be
   associated with the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor gamma chain, a
   component of the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Mice
   lacking Jak3 showed a severe block in B cell development at the pre-B
   stage in the bone marrow. In contrast, although the thymuses of these
   mice were small, T cell maturation progressed relatively normally. In
   response to mitogenic signals, peripheral T cells in Jak3-deficient mice
   did not proliferate and secreted small amounts of IL-2. These data
   demonstrate that Jak3 is critical for the progression of B cell
   development in the bone marrow and for the functional competence of
   mature T cells.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method
   involving UV detection was developed for determination of caffeic acid
   in rabbit plasma. A Lichrosphere CN column (250 mm x 4 mm I.D., 5 mu m)
   was used as the stationary phase and the mobile phase consisted of 2\%
   acetic acid solution at a flow-rate of 1.0 ml/min. The UV absorbance was
   monitored at 320 nm. The plasma sample was acidified by the addition of
   0.01 parts of concentrated phosphoric acid (85\%) to maintain caffeic
   acid stability. After a simple clean-up procedure, the limit of
   quantitation achieved was 0.1 mu g/ml, and the standard curve was found
   to be linear over the concentration ranges of 0.1-2.0 mu g/ml and 0.1-40
   mu g/ml. The coefficient of variation for within- and between-run
   precision and accuracy was less than 10\%, and the recovery was 82.3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Rifamycin B and rifamycin SV belong to the class of macrocyclic
   antibiotics known as ansamycins. These macrocyclic antibiotics were used
   as chiral selectors in capillary electrophoresis to enantioselectively
   resolve a number of chiral compounds. They contain groups capable of
   providing the types of multiple interactions necessary to achieve chiral
   recognition between enantiomers. In fact, they appear to be
   complimentary in the types of compounds they can enantiomerically
   resolve. Rifamycin B is shown to be enantioselective towards positively
   charged compounds, while rifamycin SV was enantioselective towards
   negatively charged solutes. The choice of wavelength for detection
   significantly affects sensitivity. Monitoring one of the wavelengths
   which coincide with the absorption minima of the chiral selector
   enhances sensitivity. Resolution is enhanced by keeping the amount of
   analyte injected on column as low as possible and it is demonstrated
   that it is possible to detect as little as 0.1\% of one enantiomer in
   the presence of the other enantiomer using indirect detection.}},

Abstract = {{Raman microprobe spectroscopy was applied to the study of the
   photochromic properties of thin amorphous MoO3 (a-MoO3) films. The films
   became blue during UV irradiation, a process that involves a partial
   reduction of Mo-VI, and were bleached by electrochemical oxidation. Such
   coloration-bleaching cycles can be repeated many times, Raman peaks
   assigned to the three Mo-O stretching modes (singly, doubly, and triply
   coordinated oxygen) were observed to shift reversibly during the
   coloration-bleaching cycles. Raman peak shifts occurring during the
   coloration process were consistent with predictions of Mo-O bond
   strengths based on bond lengths in crystalline MoO3 and hydrogenated
   MoO3 presented in the literature. Disorder increased in the a-MoO3
   structure as a result of the UV-induced coloration, as evidenced by
   increases in the Raman peak width, and decreased in the bleaching
   process. These changes were also reversible. We conclude that the local
   structure in the colored state in a-MoO3 is similar to that in the
   crystalline hydrogen bronze HxMoO3, where x less than or equal to 0.36.}},

   The presence of two pseudoscalar states at 1.416 +/- 0.002 GeV/c(2),
   with width 0.050 +/- 0.004 GeV/c(2), and at 1.46 +/- 0.01 GeV/c(2), with

   resonance decays mainly to K (K) over bar pi, possibly with final state
   interactions and a small contribution coming from a(0) pi. The higher
   mass 0(-+) state, which is seen for the first time in (p) over bar p

Abstract = {{Several observations have suggested that NF-kappa B transcription
   factors could be involved in carcinogenesis. To investigate the
   possibility that members of the NF-kappa B family participate in the
   molecular control of the transformed phenotype, we examined the
   expression of these proteins in human breast cancer cell lines as web as
   in primary tumors. Western Immunoblots demonstrated high expression of
   the p52 precursor p100 (NFKB2) in several breast cancer cell lines while
   human mammary epithelial cells express this protein only faintly.
   Eighteen primary breast tumors out of 24 displayed significant
   expression of the p100/p52 protein. In MDA-MB-435 cells, overexpressed
   p100 and p52 are predominantly cytoplasmic and coimmunoprecipitation
   experiments demonstrated that p100 sequesters the heterodimer p50/p65 in
   the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that most p65 protein is complexed with
   p100 in these cells while it is complexed predominantly with I kappa
   B-alpha in cell lines expressing less p100. Our data strengthen the
   hypothesis that NF-kappa B could be involved in carcinogenesis and
   suggest that the p100/p52 NF-kappa B submit could play a role in the
   development of human breast cancers, possibly by sequestering other
   NF-kappa B-related proteins in the cytoplasm.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments show that enclosed air in a thin walled structure affects
   some modes of vibration significantly. Air coupling between vibrating
   sides of the structure cannot (always) be neglected and frequencies
   cannot be predicted if calculations are performed as if in a vacuum. As
   a first attempt to include the enclosed air in a FE model of a violin
   body, the elastic properties of the air are modelled as a set of
   one-dimensional non-interacting elastic members (columns of air)
   connecting opposite sides of the orthotropic shell structure. This
   admittedly oversimplified (but easy to formulate) model must be used
   with great care, since it neglects the three-dimensional wave behaviour
   of the enclosed air. A lower limit of allowed frequencies is that which
   corresponds to a wavelength in air which is much greater than a
   characteristic length of the object. For the violin this lower limit is
   less than about 600 Hz. Optical modal analysis of the real, physical,
   violin model has been performed by using electronic holography.
   Calculated modes of vibration are compared with experimental ones. For
   the lowest eigenmodes a good agreement between measured and calculated
   frequencies is reached despite the simple air model used. Modal shapes
   remain surprisingly unaffected. For some engineering calculations the
   simple one-dimensional model might be used. (C) 1995 Academic Press

   type I receptor, BRK-2. To examine the role of BRK-2 + BRK-3 receptor
   complex in BMP signaling during early embryogenesis, the
   dominant-negative form of BRK-3 was ectopically expressed in the Xenopus
   embryos. A secondary body axis expressing the Sonic hedgehog and N-CAM
   genes is induced by injecting mRNA encoding truncated form of BRK-3 into
   ventral marginal region, implicating the BMP signaling in axial mesoderm
   induction. Formation of the secondary axis depends on whether the
   deletion extends into the kinase domain, not into the carboxy-terminal
   tail, suggesting that the kinase domain, but not the tail region, is
   essential for BMP signaling. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Previous experiments have demonstrated that the regulation of E2F-1
   transcription factor activity is critical for the maintenance of normal
   cell proliferation control. Regulation of E2F-1 is accomplished through
   at least two mechanisms: posttranslational regulation by binding
   proteins such as Rb and transcriptional regulation of the E2F-1 gene.
   The E2F-1 gene promoter has recently been isolated to examine this
   latter aspect of E2F-1 regulation. Preliminary studies demonstrate that
   the E2F-1 promoter is under E2F-dependent negative control during the
   cell growth response, being transcriptionally repressed through E2F
   sites in GO and early G1. We now demonstrate that the presence of an E2F
   DNA-binding complex containing the Rb-related p13O protein (Rb2)
   correlates with E2F-1 gene repression and that overexpression of p13O
   inhibits transcription from the E2F-1 promoter. Moreover, D-type
   cyclin-dependent kinase activity specifically activates the E2F-1
   promoter by relieving E2F-mediated repression but is inhibited by
   coexpression of the cdk4 and cdk6 inhibitor p16 (CDKN2, MTS1, INK4).
   Taken together, these findings suggest that E2F-1 gene expression is
   controlled during cell cycle progression by a regulatory network
   involving at least one oncogene (cyclin D1) and several potential tumor
   suppressor genes.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments are presented on the effects of external periodic variation
   of CO2 concentration on the dissipation and thermodynamic efficiency of
   photochemistry in whole leaves which have damped oscillations in
   photochemical activity. The results confirm, in an in vivo system, the
   possibility of variable efficiency and variable dissipation of chemical
   reactions, far from equilibrium, obtained by means of external periodic
   variation of constraints. Leaves of the C-3 species, Arbutus menziesii
   Pursh., were placed in an atmosphere of supersaturating CO2
   concentration (5.0\%) and illuminated for a given period with strong
   actinic light to elicit damped oscillations in the rate of
   photochemistry. The external concentration of CO2 was then varied
   between that of normal air and 5.0\%. We measured changes in the steady
   state fluorescence (F') and the maximum fluorescence during illumination
   for 1.3 s with saturating light (F'(m)). The experiment was repeated for
   seven periods and two different phases of CO2 perturbations. From F'(m),
   and F' we calculate the changes in Stern-Volmer quenching of the maximum
   variable fluorescence (SVN) and the quantum yield of photochemistry
   (phi(PC)). SVN is a measure of the absorbed excitation energy dissipated
   as heat, and phi(PC) is a measure of the efficiency of photon
   utilization by photosystem II. When the phase of the perturbation in CO2
   concentration is out-of-phase with the onset of illumination, an
   increase in the average phi(PC) is observed relative to a perturbation
   of the same period, but in-phase. In addition, for some periods of
   perturbation, the average SVN for out-of-phase perturbations decreases
   relative to in-phase perturbations, while at other periods there is no
   difference between the in- and out-of-phase perturbations. A resonance
   response in SVN is observed that has a relationship to the phase and
   period of the perturbation. These results show that the average
   dissipation and thermodynamic efficiency of photochemistry depend not
   only on the mean external concentration of CO2 but also oh the phase and
   period of the external changes in CO2 concentration. We report an
   unexpected discrepancy between the results of an oxygen evolution
   measurement and the photochemical yield, phi(PC), obtained from
   fluorescence measurements in 2.5\% and 5.0\% CO2. In a companion paper,
   we present the formulation of a kinetic model for the (damped)
   oscillations based on ion-gated channels.}},

Abstract = {{To identify cyclins specifically associated with control of melanoma
   cell proliferation, we now compared expression of cyclin A, reported to
   be a marker for hematological malignancies, with. that of cyclin D and
   its cdk4 kinase partner. All these proteins were expressed in
   proliferating B16 melanoma. However, L-tyrosine which induces melanoma
   terminal differentiation, selectively decreased cyclin D with no
   comparable effect on cdk4 or cyclin A. A 5-hour exposure of the cells to
   the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium vanadate,further decreased
   cyclin D from differentiated cells, suggesting that tyrosine
   phosphorylation regulates cyclin D turnover. Addition of serum to
   starved cells also revealed that tyrosine did not block the early cyclin
   D increase associated with serum stimulation, but accelerated its
   subsequent loss. Our data suggest that cyclin D decrease with melanoma
   terminal differentiation could be an alternative mode of growth arrest
   even in cells harbouring a mutant or transcriptionally silent cdk4
   inhibitor tumor suppressor p16(ink4) gene. These results also imply that
   cyclin D may be useful as a target and as a prognostic marker in

   Ames Salmonella microsome assay, a mammalian cell mutation assay, a rat
   bone marrow micronucleus test and an in vitro assay for induction of
   chromosomal aberrations. Ceftiofur (U-64279E, NAXCEL (R), EXCENEL (R)),
   a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic, was subjected to this battery
   of assays. The result of the first three (Ames test, V79/HPRT mammalian
   cell mutation assay and the micronucleus test) were negative, the in
   vitro assay for induction of chromosome aberrations in CHO cells gave
   positive results. The nature of the observed aberrations was primarily
   chromatid and isochromatid breaks, gaps and fragments with little
   evidence of chromosomal rearrangements in the absence of S9 metabolic
   activation. The aberration increase was only seen following an extended
   (44 h) exposure to drug, no evidence of clastogenic activity was seen in
   the presence of S9 metabolic activation or at shorter treatment times.
   The severe treatment conditions required to produce the clastogenic
   effects also produced very high levels of mitotic inhibition and thus
   the observation of chromosomal aberrations is unlikely to be
   biologically meaningful.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a general frame work for computing the asymptotic
   error probability (i.e., at high average SNR's) of M-ary and binary
   signaling schemes over Rician and Rayleigh fading diversity channels. A
   general theorem (Theorem 1) relates the asymptotic error rate of
   multipath and multichannel receivers (over AWGN, ISI free channels) to
   the multi-dimensional integral of the conditional error probability. Two
   other theorems are presented for the particular cases where the
   conditional error probability is a function of the sum of received SNR's
   (Theorem 2) or received amplitudes (Theorem 3). Theorems 2 and 3 are
   related for linear coherent systems, and closed form expressions are
   obtained for equal gain combining systems.
   Detection structures for typical diversity schemes (coherent/noncoherent
   maximal ratio and equal gain combining, and quadratic noncoherent
   combining) are considered, We analyze the asymptotic error rates of some
   M-ary signaling schemes (MPSK/MPAM with Kth order diversity and
   orthogonal signals with K = 1 and with coherent and noncoherent
   detection). Binary signaling is also considered in our study.}},

Abstract = {{Glutamine transaminase K (homodimer; M(r) of monomer similar to 45,000)
   is a major cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase of rat kidney cytosol.
   Several cysteine S-conjugates are known to cause kidney damage.
   Mitochondria are especially sensitive, and glutamine transaminase K
   activity is present in the mitochondrial fraction of rat kidneys.
   Therefore, it is possible that the mitochondrial form of glutamine
   transaminase K is a cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase of the rat kidney
   and that this activity contributes to the mitochondrial damage. However,
   the literature contains conflicting data on this point. We obtained
   highly purified mitochondrial glutamine transaminase K and showed that
   it possesses little cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase activity with
   S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine and
   S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine as substrates. Recently, a
   high-molecular-weight cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase (M(r) similar to
   330,000) was shown to be present in the cytosol of rat kidney
   homogenates and partially purified. We present evidence that suggests
   that a similar high-molecular-weight enzyme is present in rat kidney
   mitochondria and that this protein may be a major cysteine S-conjugate
   beta-lyase of these organelles.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To document risk factors, morbidity and mortality associated
   with neonatal systemic candidiasis.
   Setting: The neonatal intensive care unit and paediatric intensive care
   unit of Oatif Central Hospital.
   Subjects: Neonates with culture proven systemic candidiasis.
   Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of patients' records.
   Results: Thirteen neonates consisting of 10 (5.1/1000) of the 1946
   admissions into the neonatal intensive care unit and three outside
   admissions into the paediatric intensive care unit had culture proven
   systemic candidiasis. Major risk factors of systemic candidiasis were:
   prolonged usage of broad spectrum antibiotics (100\%), endotracheal
   intubation and mechanical ventilation (92.3\%), low birthweight
   (69.2\%), umbilical vessel cannulation (61.5\%), chest tube insertion
   (38.5\%) and total parenteral nutrition (30.8\%). Two of the very low
   birthweight infants died. Amphotericin B toxicity was low.
   Conclusion: Neonatal systemic candidiasis may be a problem in Saudi
   Arabia like other countries where neonatal intensive care is being
   practised. It is associated with serious morbidity and a high mortality
   rate in the very low birthweight infants and should be suspected in a
   seriously ill neonate with signs of sepsis but failure to respond to
   antibacterial antibiotic therapy.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the relationship between mating behaviour,
   insemination and fertilization in birds, 233 mating trials were
   conducted with Japanese quail to determine the percentage of eggs laid
   that were fertile following a single confirmed or putative insemination.
   Fertilization success of single inseminations was highly variable.
   Insemination did not guarantee fertilization of any eggs; following
   one-third of the trials, no fertile eggs were laid. Only 3\% of
   inseminations fertilized as many as eight eggs, making it unlikely that
   a single insemination could fertilize an entire clutch in this species.
   Forced copulations had the same fertilization success as other
   copulations, and thus could be a successful male reproductive strategy
   in this species. Voiding of foamy material containing sperm by the
   female shortly after copulation did not reduce fertilization success in
   any consistently significant manner. Fertilization success was
   unaffected by the presence of a hard-shelled egg in the uterus at the
   time of insemination. Trials in which the female ran from the male's
   initial approach resulted in fewer fertile eggs following insemination;
   that is, this behaviour predicted low fertilization success.
   Fertilization success was highly correlated and thus predictable if the
   same female was mated again with the same male, but was uncorrelated if
   she was mated with a different male or if the same male was mated with
   different females. These two predictors of fertilization success (female
   behaviour and male-female combination) are interpreted as evidence for
   female control of paternity via sperm selection (postcopulatory female
   choice). (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour}},

   Trichoderma species and the bacterium Bacillus subtilis was influenced

Abstract = {{Previously, the lymphatic absorption of retinol was shown to be lowered
   markedly in zinc-deficient (ZD) rats, in parallel with a decrease in
   phospholipid (PL) output. The present study investigated whether an
   intraduodenal infusion of PL would restore the intestinal absorption of
   vitamin A in ZD rats fed 3 mg of Zn/kg of diet, as compared with a zinc
   adequate pair fed (PF) rats fed 31 mg of Zn/kg. Both ZD and PF rats were
   trained for meal feeding and fed equal amounts of the respective diets
   twice daily for 5 weeks. Each rat with lymph cannula was infused at 3
   mL/hr via a duodenal catheter with a triolein emulsion containing 5.4 mu
   Ci H-3-retinol (H-3-ROH) and 70 nmol retinol with or without 40 mu mol
   phosphatidylcholine (PC). The absorption of H-3-ROH was measured by
   collecting lymph hourly for 8 hr during lipid infusion. When infused
   with no PC, the absorption of 3H-ROH was significantly lower in ZD rats
   beginning at 2 hr. Until it plateaued at 5 hr, the retinol absorption in
   ZD rats occurred at 0.42 nmol/hr, which was about 50\% of the rate
   observed in PF rats. The cumulative absorption of H-3-ROH for 8 hr was
   19.0 +/-C 1.4\% in ZD and 29.7 +/- 1.6\% dose in PF rats. The cumulative
   PL secretion was 7.5 +/- 1.1 mu mol in ZD and 14.2 +/ 1.1 mu mol in PF
   rats. Also, the output of PL remained significantly lower at each hourly
   interval in ZD than in PF rats. The hourly PL output was correlated
   closely with the hourly H-3-ROH absorption (r = 0.80, P < 0.05). When PC
   was infused, the rate of H-3-ROH absorption and total absorption for 8
   hr in ZD rats were restored completely to the PF level, with a
   simultaneous increase in lymphatic PL output. In both ZD and PF rats,
   the H-3-ROH absorption increased at 0.97 nmol/hr prior to 5 hr and
   reached a maximum at 3.9 nmol/hr at 5 hr. The PL outputs for 8 hr in ZD
   and PF rats were 14.6 and 21.6 mu mol, respectively. The lymphatic
   output of oleic acid was correlated highly with SH-ROH absorption (r =
   0.80, P < 0.05). These findings provide the first evidence that a
   limited supply of PL to the enterocyte is a primary cause of the
   impaired absorption of retinol and oleic acid in ZD rats. This may be
   due to a defect in the biliary secretion of PL into the intestinal
   lumen. It is postulated that, because of the lack of PL, the enterocyte
   of ZD rats fails to form chylomicrons, principal carriers of dietary
   lipids and lipid-soluble nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{We have in a population-based setting evaluated biochemical markers of
   bone metabolism in 328 women, aged 40-80 years, and related it to
   contents of bone mineral measurements and the retrospective and
   prospective presence of fracture. The participants were recruited from
   the city population files. Serum samples for analysis of osteocalcin
   (Oc), procollagen I carboxy-terminal extension peptide (PICP), and
   carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were taken, and
   forearm bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by single photon
   absorptiometry (SPA). Fracture history was recorded, and the information
   was verified and supplemented from both radiologic and orthopedic files.
   Five years later the registration of fractures was repeated. At the
   initial investigation, Oc was 23\% lower in women who had sustained a
   fracture (n = 37) within 6 years before measurement (6.3 +/- 3.6 mu g/l
   vs 8.2 +/- 4.2 mu g/l (p = 0.006)), after adjusting for age and BMC
   differences. PICP and ICTP were not different from values in the women
   without fracture. However, in women aged 70-80 years with a fracture
   sustained during the previous 6 years, PICP was lower (128 +/- 32 mu g/l
   vs 144 +/- 34 mu g/l, p = 0.046). Oc and ICTP were significantly
   correlated to age and BMC (Oc-age r = 0.36, Oc-BMC r = -0.31, ICTP-age r
   = 0.44, ICTP-BMC r = -0.24). The correlations of PICP were weaker.
   Prospectively, logistic regression gave an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (p =
   0.015) for a low PICP and fracture susceptibility, at a change of 1 SD,
   independent of age and BMC. In the age bracket 70-80, the odds ratio was
   2.4 (p = 0.036). The odds ratio for ICTP, independent of age and BMC,
   was 1.9 (p = 0.043) for 1 SD decrease and subsequent fracture risk We
   concluded that women who had sustained at least one recent fracture had
   an altered bone turnover with decreased bone formation but an unaltered
   resorption. Women with retrospectively registered fractures also
   sustained subsequent fractures. A decrease from the mean of the collagen
   markers PICP and ICTP was associated with an increased risk for future
   fracture. Utilizing these biochemical markers of bone metabolism in a
   female population, PICP and ICTP had a similar influence on the risk of
   future fracture as forearm BMC (OR = 1.6, p = 0.03).}},

Abstract = {{A multi-parametric study of empirical relationships between macroseismic
   data and magnitude is presented for the Italian region by the analysis
   of a new extended data set concerning 146 earthquakes. The available
   magnitude determinations include all of the most intense earthquakes
   which occurred in Italy in the last century and have been obtained by an
   accurate revision of original instrumental data. Intensity data have
   been revised and upgraded on the basis of the most recent studies: only
   local intensities directly documented have been used. Macroseismic
   determinations of M(s), m(B) and M(wa) magnitudes have been performed.
   The empirical relationships between maximum felt intensity (I-max) and
   magnitude have been determined by the use of a distribution-free
   approach and a linear regression analysis. This last parameterization
   allows for the explanation of more than 60\% of the Variation in
   magnitude. In order to improve these results, the linear dependence
   between magnitude, I-max and average distances (in logarithm)
   corresponding to fixed attenuation values has been explored. The
   comparison between instrumental magnitudes and corresponding
   macroseismic estimates obtained From empirical relationships shows that
   the respective uncertainties are comparable.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work on the domain organization of the thylakoid is reviewed and
   a model for the thylakoid of higher plants is presented. According to
   this model the thylakoid membrane is divided into three main domains:
   the stroma lamellae, the grana margins and the grana core (partitions).
   These have different biochemical compositions and have specialized
   functions. Linear electron transport occurs in the grana while cyclic
   electron transport is restricted to the stroma lamellae. This model is
   based on the following results and considerations. (1) There is no good
   candidate for a long-range mobile redox carrier between PS II in the
   grana and PS I in the stroma lamellae. The lateral diffusion of
   plastoquinone and plastocyanin is severely restricted by macromolecular
   crowding in the membrane and the lumen respectively. (2) There is an
   excess of 14 +/- 18\% chlorophyll associated with PS I over that of PS
   II. This excess is assumed to be localized in the stroma lamellae where
   PS I drives cyclic electron transport. (3) For several plant species,
   the stroma lamellae account for 20 +/- 3\% of the thylakoid membrane and
   the grana (including the appressed regions, margins and end membranes)
   for the remaining 80\%. The amount of stroma lamellae (20\%) corresponds
   to the excess (14-18\%) of chlorophyll associated with PS I. (4) The
   model predicts a quantum requirement of about 10 quanta per oxygen
   molecule evolved, which is in good agreement with experimentally
   observed values. (5) There are at least two pools of each of the
   following components: PS I, PS II, cytochrome bf complex, plastocyanin,
   ATP synthase and plastoquinone. One pool is in the grana and the other
   in the stroma compartments. So far, it has been demonstrated that the PS
   I, PS II and cytochrome bf complexes each differ in their respective
   pools.}},

Abstract = {{The nematogenic properties of some substituted diamides originate in
   their ability to self-assemble in wires, owing to the hydrogen bonds
   that can link one to each other. An analysis of the X-ray diffraction
   patterns allows us to give a more accurate picture of the molecular
   organization of diamides in nematic and columnar hexagonal mesophases.
   The mean intermolecular distances can be measured and the corresponding
   `'unit cell'' volume is compared to the molecular volume deduced from
   dilatometry experiments. In the nematic state, the unit cell volume is
   14\% larger than the molecular one, while in the hexagonal columnar
   phase the unit cell volume varies from 1.05 to 0.95 times the molecular
   volume between the nematic transition and the solidification. This
   unexpected behaviour could be explained assuming two kinds of sites.
   Major part of the molecules are inserted into a quasi infinite simple
   wire, being bound on each side to a hemi-strand. Besides a small amount
   of molecules are bound to three different neighbors, being thus located
   on nodes which link together three hemi-strands. Taking into account the
   features of the scattering function, and its evolution with temperature
   we describe the disorder induced by each defect and give an estimation
   of the node concentration in the mesophases.}},

Abstract = {{The compatibility and biological activity of aldesleukin (a form of
   recombinant interleukin-2) in the presence of selected i.v. drugs during
   simulated Y-site administration was studied.
   Five milliliters of aldesleukin 33,800 IU/mL in 5\% dextrose injection
   was mixed in glass test tubes with 5 mt of each of 19 i.v. drugs
   prepared at concentrations used in routine clinical practice. The
   compatibility of the combinations was assessed by visual examination and
   spectrophotometry at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 hours after preparation, and
   bioassays were conducted to determine the activity of aldesleukin in the
   combinations.
   Lorazepam was the only drug visually incompatible with aldesleukin. All
   the secondary drugs were spectrephotometrically compatible with
   aldesleukin. However, the bioassays showed that the following drugs
   reduced the activity of aldesleukin: ganciclovir sodium,
   lorazepam,pentamidine isethionate, prochlorperazine edisylate, and
   promethazine hydrochloride. Thus, aldesleukin became less biologically
   active when combined with four drugs for which visual examination
   suggested compatibility and when combined with five drugs for which
   spectrophotometry indicated compatibility.
   Aldesleukin 33,800 IU/mL in 5\% dextrose injection lost significant
   biological activity in the presence of prochlorperazine edisylate,
   promethazine hydrochloride, lorazepam, ganciclovir sodium, and
   pentamidine isethionate during simulated Y-site administration. Visual
   assessment and spectrophotometry may not be valid methods for assessing
   possible changes in the biological activity of aldesleukin when combined

   to avoid any heat transfer due to convection in the still. So, the heat
   loss from the water in an insulated still is due to evaporation and
   radiation only. Hence, the air mass transfer is not included in the
   analysis. In the presence of vacuum, the effect of the non-condensable
   gas, which reduces the rate of condensation, is also avoided. The
   results show that applying vacuum inside the solar still increases the
   water productivity about 100\%, i.e. enhancing the efficiency about
   100\%. This can be considered as the maximum increase in the
   productivity of the still up to now.}},

Abstract = {{From a histologic and endoscopic standpoint, colon and rectal cancer
   (CRC) begins as a small neoplastic polyp which progressively enlarges
   and transforms through a dysplasia stage into invasive cancer. Recently,
   molecular abnormalities underlying the adenomacarcinoma progression have
   been defined. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and mismatch
   repair genes are found to be dysfunctional early in the neoplastic
   process; either as inherited or somatic mutations. Subsequently, polyps
   progress to cancer along one of two paths depending on which gene is
   abnormal. When the APC gene is the initial mutation tumor development
   follows the `'loss of heterozygocity'' (LOH) pathway. If mismatch repair
   genes are altered, the `'replication error'' (RER) pathway is followed.
   Somatic mutations of the K-ras oncogene and the MCC, DCC, and p53 tumor
   suppressor genes accumulate in the LOH pathway and mark the progression
   through polyp stages. Microsatellite instability is a characteristic of
   the RER pathway but the precise genes involved in this pathway currently
   are not known. Defining these pathways has led to a new classification
   scheme for CRC with resultant changes in our clinical approach to
   screening, surveillance, and treatment. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The isozyme distribution of cichlid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is
   related to species environmental preferences. Cichlasoma amazonarum
   occurs in different environments and presents LDH tissue distribution
   patterns that correlate with oxygen tension at the capture location.
   Cichlasoma amazonarum was exposed to longterm severe hypoxia (51 days at
   36.4 +/- 5.9 mmHg), tissue LDH isozyme distribution was analyzed by
   electrophoresis and enzyme activities were measured by monitoring the
   oxidation of NADH as pyruvate was reduced to lactate. The exposure of
   Cichlasoma amazonarum to long-term severe hypoxia resulted in changes in
   the tissue distribution of LDH isozymes. The major changes in response
   to hypoxia occurred in heart, liver and brain: isozyme A(4) was
   activated in heart and brain, whereas isozyme B-4 was activated in
   liver. The most significant quantitative change occurred in brain LDH of
   hypoxia-exposed animals which adopted muscle type kinetics, reflecting a
   new LDH isozyme distribution, LDH activity was significantly reduced
   (P<0.05) in animals exposed to hypoxia (N = 8): suggesting an overall
   LDH suppression. Pyruvate inhibition decreased in all hypoxia-exposed
   tissues, Thus, the ability of Cichlasoma amazonarum to regulate LDH
   tissue expression according to oxygen availability allows the animal to
   survive chronic hypoxic environments. This phenotypic plasticity may
   occur in other hypoxia-tolerant fish species.}},

Abstract = {{High-quality geosynthetics of high-stiffness materials are being

   performed on plastic mesh reinforced sand. The sand density, mesh
   stiffness and the number of reinforcing layers were varied. From these
   tests it was concluded that there may be a limiting reinforcement
   stiffness, influenced by the number of reinforcing layers after which
   there will he no further gain in strength. The density of sand
   reinforced using plastic mesh is found not to control strongly the
   strength. The results also revealed that the use of multiple layers of
   low-quality material can be more effective than the use of fewer layers

Abstract = {{A new miniaturized thin film Pirani type vacuum sensor that detects
   pressure from 1 X 10(-5) to 760 Torr was developed. The compact
   instrument is attitude insensitive, rugged, and has rapid response to
   pressure variations. The very small dimension between the heating
   element and the heat sink prevents the flow from entering into the
   viscous regime thus resulting in a predominately conductive heat
   transfer over the entire pressure range. This removes the complexities
   introduced into the pressure versus output curve by convective heat
   transfer. The output is linear from 1 x 10(-4) to 1 Torr, and then
   monotonically increases beyond 760 Torr. A unique feature of this
   instrument is the use of a microprocessor to compute the sensor power
   from the analog voltage and current. In the molecular flow regime, the
   absolute pressure is directly proportional to the power dissipated by
   the surrounding gas. By measuring the power, the sensor rejects most of
   the errors introduced by ambient temperature variations. The
   analog-to-digital converters for both the current and the voltage
   signals use the Sigma-Delta conversion method to reject electrical noise
   by the averaging technique. This results in the stable signal detection
   of pressure down to 1x10(-5) Torr. The instrument is thermally stable
   over an ambient temperature range of 0-50 degrees C when the pressure is
   between 1 X 10(-4) and 760 Torr. (C) 1995 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The objectives of this study were (i) to assess the effect
   of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy on the risk of stillbirth, and
   (ii) to characterize the relationship between hypertension and
   stillbirth separately by gravidity, race, `explained' Versus
   `unexplained' causes of stillbirth, and antepartum versus intrapartum
   stillbirths.
   Method's. The study was based on a retrospective cohort of approximately
   400,000 pregnancies identified through the birth and fetal death
   certificates in North Carolina, USA, between 1988 and 1991.
   Multivariable polytomous logistic regression was used to generate odds
   ratios comparing stillbirth risk in hypertensive compared to
   non-hypertensive mothers, adjusted for potential confounders.
   Results. The risk of chronic hypertension was 7.6 per 1000 pregnancies,
   while pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and eclampsia were reported
   in 36.6 and 6.0 per 1000 pregnancies, respectively. Pregnancies among
   chronic hypertensives were more likely to result in losses after 28
   weeks gestation (RR=3.29, 95\% CI: 2.43-4.43), while the risk ratio was
   2.16 (95\% CI: 1.45-3.22) for losses prior to 28 weeks' gestation.
   Pregnancies to patients with PIH were at 1.42 (95\% CI: 1.15-1.79) times
   greater risk of terminating in late stillbirth, while the risk ratio for
   eclampsia was 2.23 (95\% CI: 1.51-3.30). The risk ratio for `explained'
   antepartum stillbirth was higher than intrapartum stillbirth for all of
   the hypertensive diseases.
   Conclusions. Hypertensive disorders were found to have a strong adverse
   impact on stillbirth suggesting that early diagnosis of hypertension
   during pregnancy and adequate medical intervention may help reduce the
   risk of stillbirth.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in brain structure and function may explain individual

   accuracy and energy utilization were compared to human reaction time and
   cerebral metabolic data to evaluate which variations most reliably
   reproduced the human results. Varying the synaptic failure rare appears
   essential for mimicking the human reaction time data and increasing
   network connectivity is the most efficient way to improve network
   accuracy for a given degree of neuronal activation. The results suggest
   that variations in the physiologic events of synaptic neurotransmission

Abstract = {{Data refinement, as practised conventionally for a model-based
   development method, involves at least two difficulties, First, there is
   the production of a theory of data types which supports the process of
   discharging the proof obligations that arise, Second, there is the
   discovery of pre- and post-conditions for the new operations associated
   with the new, refined data model, We describe a development technique
   based on transformation which alleviates some of these problems, This
   paper concentrates on the second problem, although in the conclusion to
   the paper we provide a sketch of how it alleviates the first problem,
   While the paper is of a tutorial nature, it describes original work
   which has been applied within a larger context than the small examples
   which a tutorial paper, by necessity, has to employ, This work has
   demonstrated that a pure transformational approach to data refinements
   is feasible and that a small number of transformations can be used
   during data refinement.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of the dynamic behavior of polymeric liquid crystals is
   given in terms of a second-rank order parameter tensor describing the
   orientational state of the local microstructure. The continuum equations
   governing the dynamics of the material are analyzed under both
   steady-state and transient conditions for isotropic and
   liquid-crystalline fluids subjected to shear and magnetic fields.
   Analysis reveals that a great variety of dynamic behavior for
   liquid-crystalline materials can be accommodated within the framework of
   a continuum theory in terms of a second-rank order parameter tensor, and
   that this dynamic behavior approximates well the orientational behavior
   obtained with the more complex distribution function theories. Under
   some conditions the. associated theological behavior of the continuum
   theory exhibits discrepancies in the normal stress behavior compared to
   theological calculations based on the distribution function theory. For
   simultaneous application of shear and magnetic fields, both the
   direction and the strength of the magnetic field play a major role in
   determining the dynamic system response. (C) 1995 Society of Rheology.}},

   (Pyloriset Dry), 27\%/42\% (Pyloriset EIA-G), 14\%/29\% (Pyloriset

Abstract = {{An aerobic incubation of N-15-labelled green manure in soil was
   performed: (1) to determine the extractability of organic and inorganic
   N fractions from decomposing plant residues in the soil; (2) to provide
   evidence that electro-ultrafiltration-extractable organic N (EUF-N-org)
   was mineralized during the soil incubation; and (3) to compare the
   course of extractable N-org with inorganic N accumulation. A loamy sand
   (Colluvisol) derived from mottled sandstone, Hessia, Germany was used.
   Rape labelled with N-15 was incorporated in the soil and incubated for
   80 d at 20 degrees C. The same incubation procedure was done without
   rape for control. Samples were taken 13 times during the incubation to
   analyse for NH4+, NO3- and N-org in EUF soil extracts. The
   extractability of N-15-labelled N-org by EUF was, on average, 7.7 times
   greater than the share of total labelled N-org on the total soil N-org
   (labelled + unlabelled). This indicates that the EUF technique extracts
   with relative, selectivity N-org derived from the green manure. Net N
   mineralization of applied N occurred up to day 40 of incubation and 38\%
   of the applied N-org was mineralized. Labelled EUF-N-org was maximal on
   day 2 of incubation followed by a decrease up to day 40. After day 40,
   labelled EUF-N-org remained stable. This course clearly indicates that
   some of the EUF-N-org had been mineralized. Nevertheless, the decrease
   of labelled EUF-N-org did not correspond to the accumulation of labelled
   inorganic N. The major decrease took place from day 2 to day 9, but
   about 80\% of the increase of labelled inorganic N was observed after
   day 9.}},

Abstract = {{The ant community associated with Apion sp. (Coleoptera Apionidae) galls
   on Diospyrus hispida DC (Ebenaceae) was studied in a cerrado (savanna)
   area in southeastern Brazil. We asked the following questions: (a) what
   ant species occupy the galls, (b) are there any relationships among gall
   occupation, plant height, and gall distance from the ground, and (c) do
   ants differentially select galls? Seven ant species were found:
   Camponotus sp. 1 and Camponotus sp. 2, Crematogaster brevispinosa (Mayr
   1870), Zacryptocerus pusillus (Klug 1824), Pseudomyrmex gracilis
   (Fabricius 1804), Solenopsis sp., and Leptothorax sp. Plant height,
   distance of the gall to the ground, gall volume, number of channels
   inside the galls, the length of ant's body and the width of ant's head
   were recorded. Ants occupied the largest galls (t = 2.653, n = 144, P <
   0.05). The number of channels in occupied galls was significantly
   different from that in unoccupied galls (t = 5.565, n = 144, P < 0.05).
   Differential utilization of galls may be explained by the different
   biology and competitive interactions of the ant community.}},

Abstract = {{The potential use of industrial and municipal waste glass as a partial
   pozzolanic replacement Sor Normal Portland cement in mine backfill has
   been investigated Considerable quantities of glass are currently
   discarded into landfill sites at high cost to municipal and industrial
   users with no foreseeable environmental benefits being gained by such
   disposal. This research study was undertaken to assess the viability of
   using ground waste glass materials as partial binder replacement of
   Portland cement fractions within consolidated mine backfill materials.
   The program was implemented to review various factors that could
   influence successful incorporation of glass waste replacement of cement,
   these factors being the Sensibility of glass waste procurement,
   determination of process economics and the physical and chemical
   suitability of ground waste glass materials to generate adequate
   backfill strength when replacing Normal Portland cement fractions.
   A series of laboratory assessment trials were established to evaluate
   backfill component characteristics and mixture strength properties for
   both standard Portland cement-consolidated and blended Portland
   cement/ground waste glass-consolidated backfill materials. Side-by-side
   review of the strength behaviour of various component backfill/cement
   mixtures was designed to permit comparative evaluation of the
   capabilities of ground waste glass and Portland cement products as
   backfill consolidating agents.}},

   \{phi(S-1,...,S-n):phi is an element of F-infinity\} is reflexive,
   extending in this way the classical result of Sarason {[}S]. Some

Journal = {{BASIC RESEARCH IN CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{482-488}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Inorganic phosphate (P-i) accumulates extremely rapidly in ischaemic
   heart muscle and intracellular binding of this metabolite may account
   for the precipitous loss of function seen at the onset of severe
   ischaemia. We have used P-31-NMR spectroscopy to measure the free
   cytosolic {[}P-i] and chemical assay techniques to measure total tissue
   P-i at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 12 min of complete global ischaemia in the
   isolated isovolumic rat heart. At zero time, the P-i assayed chemically
   was 30.77 +/- 5.52 mu mol/g dry wt (mean +/- SD, n = 7) whilst P-i
   assayed by NMR was 3.39 +/- 1.21 mu mol/g dry wt (n = 15). Thus, 27.38
   mu mol/g dry wt of P-i was bound at a cytosolic {[}P-i] of 0.82 mM.
   After 12 min of ischaemia, 49.88 mu mol/g dry wt of Pi was bound at a
   cytosolic {[}P-i] of 4.11 mM. When all data were fitted, using a
   non-linear, least squares fit (p < 0.05), to the binding isotherm: Bound
   P-i = B'(max). {[}P-i]/(K'(d)+{[}P-i]), the apparent binding parameters
   K'(d) and B'(max) were estimated to be 1.1 +/- 0.6 mM and 64.0 +/- 10.2
   mu mol/g dry wt respectively. During the first minute of global
   ischaemia when the rate-pressure product had decreased by 79 \% of its
   pre-ischaemic value, bound Pi had increased by 58 \% and free cytosolic
   {[}P-i] by 162 \%. When functional and metabolite changes were expressed
   as a fraction of the total change which occurred during the 22-min
   ischaemic period, bound P-i had the profile most similar to the
   rate-pressure product. Both the amount of bound P-i and free cytosolic
   {[}P-i] correlated with loss of contractile function as the ischaemic
   period progressed. The results show that during ischaemia, P-i is bound
   progressively as free cytosolic {[}P-i] is increased as the result of
   high energy phosphate hydrolysis. While these results are consistent
   with the possibility that P-i binding may contribute to ischaemic
   contractile failure, no molecular explanation for the possible effect of
   bound P-i on contraction has been proposed.}},

   resection (n = 10), abdominal hysterectomy (n = 10), or hip replacement
   surgery (n = 10) served as control groups. Isolated hyperthermic liver
   perfusion was performed with cytostatic-containing perfusate (melphalan
   and cisplatinum). Patients with recurrent malignant melanoma confined to
   one limb underwent isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion with
   cytostatic-containing perfusate (melphalan). Blood samples for
   determination of PMN elastase, neopterin, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were drawn
   from the patients preoperatively, 1 minute before the start of the
   perfusion, 60 and 120 minutes after the start of the perfusion, and 24
   hours postoperatively. Samples from the perfusate were drawn 60 minutes
   after the start of the perfusion, High concentrations of plasma PMN
   elastase were found both in patients undergoing liver and limb perfusion
   and in patients undergoing liver resection surgery. Elevated
   concentrations of IL-6 were found in the patients undergoing liver
   perfusion and in patients undergoing liver resection. In none of the
   patients were there increased concentrations of neopterin or TNF-alpha.
   The perfusate contained high concentrations of PMN elastase, neopterin,
   and IL-6. This study also demonstrated that major surgery leads to
   elevated concentrations of PMN elastase and IL-6. An increase of PMN
   elastase and IL-6 was seen in response to perfusion and to surgical

Abstract = {{Our objective was to clarify the DNA-binding activity of transcription

   patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA).
   Synovial membranes were obtained during arthroplasty of the knee from 7
   patients with RA and 4 patients with OA. Nuclear extracts obtained from
   the synovial membranes were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift
   assay to determine the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B. Markedly high
   DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B was detected in the synovial
   membranes of RA patients, while virtually no activity was observed in
   those of OA patients. These results suggest that the high induction of
   NF-kappa B in the nuclear extracts may be relatively specific to
   synovial membranes in RA. NF-kappa B may regulate the production of

   test (''sicca 1'': BST = 0-5 mm, n = 78 eyes; `'sicca 2'': BST = 6-10
   mm, n = 109 eyes) and (2) subjective symptoms (normal BST, burning,
   foreign body sensations, tearing, dryness of the eyes: n = 78 eyes). One
   group of healthy patients (normal EST, n = 132 eyes) served as controls.
   Lipid peroxide levels and myeloperoxidase activity, as parameters for
   oxidative tissue damage and inflammatory activity, were determined in
   the tear fluid. Those patients whose consent could be obtained were
   subjected to the rose bengal test (sicca 1: 56 eyes; sicca 2: 97 eyes;
   subjective symptoms: 44 eyes; controls: 49 eyes). The correlation
   between BST and rose bengal test results was calculated. Results: Lipid
   peroxides were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the groups sicca 1 and
   subjective symptoms than in healthy controls, as was the inflammatory
   activity in groups sicca 1, sicca 2 and subjective symptoms.
   Additionally, the inflammatory activity in the group sicca 1 was
   significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in the groups sicca 2 and
   subjective symptoms. No evidence of a significant correlation between
   BST and rose bengal test results was observed. Conclusions: Both
   oxidative tissue damage and polymer phonuclear leukocytes indicating an
   oxidative potential occur in the tear film of patients suffering from
   dry eyes. These reactions lead to severe damage of the involved tissue.
   Free radicals and inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis or in
   the self-propagation of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films were prepared by a sol-gel
   method on platinized Si and (100) MgO substrates. The evolution in the
   crystallinity was then studied in real time during annealing with an
   in-situ X-ray diffraction system using a Ruud-B arrett
   position-sensitive scintillation detector. Annealing rates of 50 degrees
   C min(-1) and 100 degrees C min(-1) were utilized to study the growth of
   an intermediate phase and the perovskite phase. This provided direct
   evidence on the structure evolution during heat treatment. It was
   observed that an intermediate phase, possibly the pyrochlore, existed
   over the temperature range 433-580 degrees C. The film transformed to
   the perovskite phase as soon as the temperature reached the range
   595-600 degrees C and progressively grew as the temperature approached
   650 degrees C. These results suggested that it may be difficult to
   bypass intermediate phase formation at this annealing rate. However, for
   a 100 degrees C min(-1) heat treatment, the amount of intermediate phase
   was suppressed from the 50 degrees C min(-1) case on both platinized Si
   and MgO substrates.}},

   demonstrates its efficacy in palliating lung cancer patients who

   benefits far outweigh the risks, The role of endobronchial brachytherapy
   for cure is less clear. For most instances `'prolonged palliation''
   would be a more suitable term than `'cure.'' Further data is needed to
   clarify the proper place of endobronchial brachytherapy as a boost to
   external beam radiation therapy. The dose, fractionation scheme, and
   timing relative to external beam radiation therapy are based on
   institutional preference at this time. The historical evolution,

   solutions, the Darken quadratic formalism is able to accurately fit the

   to a relatively high level in one component (x(i) greater than or equal
   to 0.33).
   The Darken formalism requires only 2x2 binary adjustable parameters and
   1 ternary parameter. In this procedure we need at least 4 binary and 1
   ternary measurements.
   Three quadratic representations of the excess function, each one valid
   in one corner area, cover the whole ternary system.
   A single Redlich-Kister polynomial of the fifth degree is suitable for
   an accurate representation of the excess function in the whole diagram
   and mixes together the three Darken quadratic formalisms.
   The method has been tested successfully for the mixing enthalpy of the
   ternary (Pb, Bi, Sn) liquid phase with an accuracy better than 150 J/mol

   two ways. In whole cell tight-seal voltage-clamp experiments, membrane
   permeant cGMP analog, 8-bromo-cyclic-GMP (8-Br-cGMP), induced membrane
   currents and dramatically enhanced light-induced currents. The currents
   induced by 8-Br-cGMP possessed reversal potentials similar to those
   induced by light. The magnitudes of cGMP-induced currents exhibited
   marked dependence on intensity of back-ground illumination. Potential

Abstract = {{The adsorption and segregation of carbon or sulfur on Ni single crystal
   surfaces have been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
   and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Different
   adsorbate(segregate)-induced surface modifications have been detected in
   dependence on the original Ni surface orientation and the kind of
   nonmetal atoms: i) Adsorption of carbon from ethylene on Ni(111) at 6.7
   x 10(-4) Pa and 1000 K leads to the epitaxial growth of a graphitic
   carbon monolayer which exhibits the structure of the hexagonal basal
   plane of graphite. However, as is found for highly oriented pyrolytic
   graphite (HOPG), only three of six carbon atoms of the (0001) graphite
   plane are imaged by STM. In contrast, on Ni(771) at 663 to 1000 K carbon
   islands have been formed but no graphite monolayer formation is
   detected. This behavior can be understood by considering the aspects
   that no large-area epitaxy between the graphite basal plane and the
   Ni(110) terraces exists and that the surface carbon activity was too low
   to initiate substrate restructuring. ii) Segregation of sulfur (from the
   Ni bulk containing 5 to 7 ppm S) on Ni(110) at 1043 K and Theta(S)
   approximate to 0.4 ML initiates the growth of sulfur islands which show
   a c(2 x 2)-S overlayer structure, whereas on Ni(111) at 823 K and
   Theta(S) approximate to 0.2 ML (average value) a reconstructed surface
   phase is forming which can be described as an adsorbed two-dimensional
   sulfide Ni2S.}},

Abstract = {{The two-stage theory of lexical production distinguishes the retrieval
   of lemmas from the subsequent retrieval of the forms of words. The

   theory makes very strong predictions regarding the dissociability of
   these information types. In this report we present the case of an

   various naming tasks this patient's intact ability to identify the
   grammatical gender of words that he cannot produce stands in stark
   contrast with his inability to provide any information regarding
   particular lexical forms. We document the reliability of this
   performance pattern, and we discuss the significance of this pattern

   ages. No inherited zircons were identified in the granodiorites, and the
   Pb-206{*}/U-238 ages (1.65 +/- 0.18 Ma; 1.98 +/- 0.08 Ma {[}2 sigma])
   are interpreted as crystallization ages, These synkinematically emplaced
   granodiorites, intruded into actively extending continental crust, are
   some of the youngest known granitoids currently exposed at the Earth's
   surface, Zircon ages from felsic gneisses (2.63 +/- 0.16 Ma; 2.72 +/-
   0.28 Ma {[}2 sigma]) are interpreted to date zircon growth subsequent to
   eclogite facies metamorphism. Felsic gneiss samples also contained
   zircon xenocrysts from Cretaceous-Miocene protoliths, In striking
   contrast, zircons from igneous and metamorphic clasts from the
   Goodenough No, well indicate a single population with a
   Pb-207{*}/Pb-206{*} age of 2781 +/- 9 Ma (2 sigma). We speculate that
   they are derived from basement rocks unroofed during initial stages of
   development of the D'Entrecasteaux metamorphic core complexes, These
   results provide the first direct evidence for the existence of Archean
   protoliths in the basement rocks of southeastern Papua New Guinea.}},

Abstract = {{High quality epitaxial films of the `infinite layer' (IL) compound
   Sr(x)Ca1-xCuO(2) (X=0-1) have been grown by pulsed laser deposition on
   NdGaO3 (110) substrates, thus including the last member of this series
   CaCuO2, for the first time, to our knowledge. The quality of films
   varied with the composition: higher quality films were obtained for x=0
   and 0.1. The experimental results have been explained by taking into
   account the lattice match between film and substrate: a better match
   results in a better film quality. A very good match is obtained on
   NdGaO3 substrates for IL films with small or zero Sr content. Attempts
   to grow IL films were also carried out on SrTiO3, and LaAlO3,
   substrates. On SrTiO3 substrates it was not possible to grow IL films in
   the absence of Sr, while on LaAlO3, substrates no IL films could be
   grown at all. In the case of SrTiO3, the lattice match is good only for
   Sr-rich films, while in the case of LaAlO3, no good match can be
   obtained for any composition. Such substrate effects are not unexpected
   due to the importance of the substrate for the pseudomorphic
   stabilization of the otherwise unstable IL structure.}},

Abstract = {{Ln this study, we examined the relation between spontaneously reported
   adverse experiences and responses given on the comparison of ophthalmic
   medications for tolerability (COMTOL) checklist questionnaire which
   queries the frequency and bother of specific side-effects known to be
   associated with topical ophthalmic agents used to treat ocular
   hypertension or open-angle glaucoma, and the impact that the
   side-effects have on health-related quality of life. The study was a
   4-week, randomized, open-label, two-period cross-over clinical trial
   comparing dorzolamide and pilocarpine in 92 patients who were also
   receiving timolol for the treatment of ocular hypertension or open-angle
   glaucoma. Patients completed the COMTOL questionnaire at baseline and at
   the end of each period and spontaneous reports of adverse experiences
   (AEs) were collected throughout the study by the investigator. Since
   there were only 3 spontaneously reported AEs related to drug treatment
   while patients received dorzolamide and since COMTOL scores indicated a
   low level of side-effects, the analyses were limited to pilocarpine
   treatment periods, We discovered that during the pilocarpine treatment
   periods, a large percentage (94\%) of the 47 patients, who failed to
   spontaneously report any adverse experiences, indicated on the COMTOL
   that they had experienced side-effects. These discrepancies between the
   methods of spontaneous reports and a checklist questionnaire are similar
   to those previously reported in the literature for other drugs. Unlike
   previous literature, we went beyond identifying discrepancies with the
   two reporting methods and we looked for possible explanations for why
   the discrepancies existed. We discovered that patients who spontaneously
   reported AEs expressed more bother from these specific side-effects on
   the questionnaire than patients who did not spontaneously report AEs. As
   well, patients who spontaneously reported AEs and discontinued drug as a
   result of the AEs expressed on the COMTOL the greatest bother from
   side-effects. This trend of increasing negative impact (as patients
   reported AEs and discontinued) was also observed with COMTOL global
   question scores on the impact of side-effects on health-related quality
   of life, the impact of activity limitations on quality of life,
   satisfaction with medication and compliance with medication. Therefore,
   spontaneous reporting of side-effects appears to be detecting the most
   clinically meaningful side-effects.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) occur in approximately 1\%
   of the white population, These lesions are often surgically excised
   prophylactically because of increased melanoma risk.
   Objective: In this study 87 CMN of all sizes from infants 12 months of
   age or younger (mean age, 6.6 months) were examined histologically.
   Methods: Each lesion was evaluated for depth of nevus cell involvement,
   overall epidermal and dermal pattern, and cytologic atypia.
   Results: Most CMN involved the lower half of the reticular dermis
   (89\%), and 51\% infiltrated the subcutaneous tissue. Depth of nevus
   cell infiltration was positively correlated with size of the lesion. The
   predominant dermal pattern was diffuse interstitial infiltration (63\%).
   Patchy nevus cell patterns were observed in 37\% of the CMN and were
   associated with smaller lesions (p < 0.001). Most of the CMN displayed
   no cytologic atypia (70\%), and we found no cases of melanoma. Atypia
   was not significantly associated with either size or location of the
   nevus.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that depth and pattern of nevus cells
   are directly related to size of CMN in infants.}},

   Materials and Methods: Mucosal biopsies from 22 persons were obtained
   and incubated. PGE(2) was then determined by radioimmunoassay.
   Results: Compared to healthy subjects, patients with gastric ulcers or
   gastritis show diminished accumulation of PGE(2) in the incubation,
   medium. Other factors Like age, gender, and alcohol consumption were
   also investigated, however, they do not influence endogenous
   prostaglandin production, In contrast, PGE(2) synthesis was found to be
   decreased in smokers.
   Conclusions: Our data indicates a deficiency in endogenous PGE,
   synthesis as one cause of gastric ulcerations and offer an. explanation
   of the higher incidence of gastric ulcer disease in subjects with
   nicotine abuse.}},

Abstract = {{Macrobicycles 1-3 have been prepared by palladium-catalyzed double
   macrocyclization. The planar geometry of this system is such that the
   para axis of the inner ring exactly matches the inner diameter of the
   macrocycle. Molecular models suggest that the inner ring of 1 should be
   able to rotate freely about its long axis, acting like the spindle of a
   turnstile. For large spindle substituents, this rotation will become
   hindered while for intermediate sized substituents, a pair of
   energetically equivalent conformational states should rapidly
   interconvert on an experimentally observable time scale. Substituted
   derivatives 2 and 3 possess diastereotopic methylene protons which
   become operationally enantiotopic upon fast rotation. Based on
   variable-temperature H-1 NMR and longitudinal T-1 relaxation
   experiments, examples of what are believed to be freely rotating 2 and
   conformationally locked 3 spindles are reported. These molecules
   represent the first iteration in the development of phenylacetylene
   macrocycles possessing conformational bistability that may eventually
   lead to new types of solids or liquid crystals that respond rapidly to

Abstract = {{A quantitative trait locus (QTL) influencing filarial worm intensity is
   linked to QTL for susceptibility to other mosquito-borne pathogens.
   Experimental Parasitology 81, 355-362. Because intensity of infection
   was significantly increased in a substrain of Aedes aegypti selected for
   susceptibility to the filarial worm, Brugia malayi, experiments were
   designed to assess numbers of microfilariae (mf) ingested and midgut
   penetration by mf in this susceptible substrain as compared to a
   refractory substrain selected from the same parental stock. Refractory
   mosquitoes ingested significantly fewer mf than susceptible mosquitoes
   and significantly fewer numbers of mf penetrated through refractory
   midguts as compared to susceptible midguts. In 16.7\% of the refractory
   midputs no mf were able to penetrate the midgut and in three refractory
   mosquitoes over 250 mf were ingested, bur no mf penetrated the midgut.
   These results indicate that permissiveness of the midgut for penetration
   by microfilariae can determine not only parasite intensity, but also
   prevalence of infection. The genetic basis for ingestion of mf and
   midgut penetration was assessed using restriction fragment length
   polymorphism markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. This
   mapping identified a QTL on chromosome 2, idb{[}2,LF181] (idb, intensity
   determinant for Brugia), that seems to influence ingestion ability. This
   QTL is linked to a previously identified QTL for susceptibility to B.
   malayi, fsb{[}2,LF98], as well as to loci for susceptibility to the
   malaria parasite, Plasmodium gallinaceum, and yellow fever virus. These
   results suggest that this region of chromosome 2 contains one or more
   genes that influence susceptibility of A. aegypti to several
   mosquito-transmitted pathogens. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Croconazole hydrochloride is new antifungal agent of the imidazole type.
   A 1\% croconazole cream (Pilzcin(R), Merz + Co., D-Frankfurt/Main) was
   investigated in a multicentre trial involving 132 patients (mean age
   46.7 +/- 15.5 years; 69 men, 63 women) suffering from tinea pedis
   (interdigital space, n = 86; other foot sites, n = 46). The fungal
   infections were caused predominantly by Trichophyton rubrum
   (interdigital space, n = 43; other foot sites, n = 33), followed by
   other Trichophyton and Candida species. The patients were treated once
   daily for a period of up to 3 weeks. In the majority of cases complete
   cure was achieved at both locations. On fungal microscopy no fungi were
   seen after 3 weeks in 82.6\% of patients in the `interdigital space'
   group and in 80.4\% of patients in the `other foot sites) group. Two
   weeks after the end of the treatment no fungi could be found in culture
   in 81.4\% of the patients in the `interdigital space' group and in
   80.4\% of patients in the other group. All skin symptoms of the mycoses
   (itching, scaling, erosions, reddening) decreased during the observation
   period. In 82.6\% of patients in the `interdigital space' group and in
   76.1\% of patients treated in the `other foot sites' group efficacy was
   rated by the physician as good or very good. Tolerability was evaluated
   as good or very good in 90.7\% and 89.1\% of the cases. Local skin
   intolerabilities were not observed. The therapeutic results show that

Abstract = {{Background: Various mechanisms can contribute to cellular resistance to
   doxorubicin. These include expression of the multidrug transporter
   P-glycoprotein (product of the mdr1 gene {[}also known as PGY1]), Mrp
   (multidrug resistance-associated protein), the p110 major vault protein,
   altered glutathione metabolism and altered levels or activity of
   topoisomerase II (Topo II). We reported recently that single-step
   treatment of human MES-SA sarcoma cells with 40 nM doxorubicin resulted
   in selection of spontaneous mutants at a rate of 1.8 x 10(-6) per cell
   generation. All individually selected mutants manifested the
   multidrug-resistant phenotype, related to activation of the mdr1 gene.
   Purpose: Luria and Delbruck fluctuation analysis was performed with
   MES-SA cells to determine the mutation rate and the nature and
   mechanisms of resistance after single-step selection with doxorubicin in
   the presence of the cyclosporin PSC 833, a potent modulator of multidrug
   resistance. Methods: Ten flasks mere seeded with 2000 cells/flask and
   grown to confluent populations of approximately 8 x 10(6) cells. After
   reseeding in 96-well plates, the populations mere treated with 40 nM
   doxorubicin and 2 mu M PSC 833 for 3 weeks. Surviving colonies were
   scored, individually harvested, and propagated. The drug-resistant
   phenotype mas assessed by the tetrazolium dye (MTT) cytotoxicity assay
   and by monitoring cellular glutathione content and radiolabeled drug
   accumulation. Coupled reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR) was used to evaluate mdr1, MRP, Topo II alpha, and Topo II beta
   gene expression. Topo II, P-glycoprotein, and p110 levels were examined
   by immunoblotting or immunocytochemistry. Topo II activity was assessed
   by decatenation of kinetoplast DNA, and etoposide-induced cleavable
   complex formation was studied by the potassium-sodium dodecyl sulfate
   precipitation assay. Results: Mutations were detected at a rate of 2.5 x
   10(-7) per cell generation. Analysis of variance indicates that
   spontaneous mutations, rather than changes in cellular function,
   conferred resistance to doxorubicin and PSC 833. None of the isolated
   clones expressed mdr1 messenger RNA or P-glycoprotein, and none
   exhibited an increase in MRP expression. No alterations mere found in
   cellular glutathione content, intracellular accumulations of
   daunorubicin and etoposide, levels of p110 protein, or levels of Topo II
   beta transcripts. However, a significant decrease in Topo II alpha
   messenger RNA and protein mas found in ail examined clones, as well as
   decreased Topo II catalytic activity and reduced cleavable complex
   formation in the presence of etoposide. Conclusions: PSC 833
   co-selection reduced the mutation rate for doxorubicin-selected
   resistance by 10-fold and suppressed the emergence of mdr1 mutants.
   Survival of cells exposed to doxorubicin and PSC 833 occurs by selection
   of spontaneously arising mutants that exhibit altered Topo II alpha
   expression. Implications: Our results suggest that treatment with
   multidrug resistance modulators such as PSC 833 together with multidrug
   resistance-related cytotoxins may suppress the activation of mdr1 and
   prevent the emergence of resistant cancer cell clones with the
   multidrug-resistant phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation examines the localization and migration of
   purified T cell subsets in comparison with B cells, CD8 T cells and
   CD4(+)CD8(-) single-positive thymocytes, CD4 T cell subsets in the rat
   are defined by mAb MRC OX22 (anti-CD45RC), which distinguishes resting
   CD4 T cells (CD45RC(+)) from those (CD45RC(-)) which have encountered
   antigen in the recent past-subpopulations often referred to as `naive'
   and `memory', Purified, Cr-51-labelled CD45RC(+) CD4 T cells broadly
   reflected the migration pattern of CD8 T cells and B cells, Early
   localization to the spleen was followed by a redistribution to
   mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and cervical lymph nodes (CLN), B cells
   migrating at a slightly slower tempo, There was almost no localization
   of these subpopulations to the small or large intestine {[}Peyer's
   patches (PP) excluded], In contrast, CD45RC(-) CD4 T cells
   (indistinguishable in size from the CD45RC(+) subset) localized in large
   numbers to the intestine; they were present here at the earliest time
   point (0.5 h), persisted for at least 48 h but did not accumulate,
   indicating a rapid exit, Numerically, localization of CD45RC(-) CD4 T
   cells in the MLN could be accounted for entirely by afferent drainage
   from the intestine, Unexpectedly, CD45RC(-) CD4 T cells (but not other
   subsets) localized and accumulated in the thymus, In vivo treatment with
   mAb HP2/1 against the integrin alpha(4) subunit inhibited almost
   entirely CD45RC(-) CD4 T cell migration into the PP (98.1\%), intestine
   (87.1\%), MLN (89.1\%) and thymus (93.5\%); migration into the CLN was
   only reduced by half, To distinguish between recognition of MAdCAM-1 and
   VCAM-1 by alpha(4)-containing integrins, recipients were treated with
   mAb 5F10 against rat VCAM-1, Except for the thymus and a small reduction
   in CLN, localization of CD45RC(-) CD4 T cells was unaffected; entry to
   the thymus was almost completely blocked (92.3\%) by anti-VCAM-1. The
   results indicated (i) that CD45RC(-) CD4 T cells alone showed enhanced
   localization to the gut and PP probably via alpha(4) beta(7)-MAdCAM-1
   interaction; (ii) that many CD45RC(-) cells entered non-mucosal LN
   independently of alpha(4) integrin or VCAM-1; and (iii) that entry of
   mature recirculating CD45RC(-) CD4 T cells into the thymus across thymic
   endothelium was apparently regulated by alpha(4) integrin-VCAM-1
   interaction.}},

Title = {{THE VALIDATION OF A NEW VASCULAR DAMAGE ASSAY FOR PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
   AGENTS}},
Journal = {{PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{The therapeutic effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT: photodynamic
   sensitizer + light) is partly due to vascular damage. This report
   describes a new vascular photodamage assay for PDT agents and a
   validation of the assay. The method described here quantitates changes
   in tissue blood perfusion based on the relative amount of injected
   fluorescein dye in treated and untreated tissues. A specially designed
   fluorometer uses chopped monochromatic light from an argon laser as a
   source for exciting fluorescein fluorescence. The fluorescent Light
   emitted from the tissue is collected by a six element fiberoptic array,
   filtered and delivered to a photodiode detector coupled to a
   phase-locked amplifier for conversion to a voltage signal for recording.
   This arrangement permits a rather simple, inexpensive construction and
   allows for the simultaneous use of the argon laser by other
   investigators.
   The routine assay for characterizing a specific photosensitizer at a
   standard dose consists of the sequential allocation of eight mice to a
   set of different light doses designed to span the dose-response range of
   fluorescein fluorescence exclusion (measured 8-10 min after fluorescein
   injection). The assay validation experiment used an anionic
   photosensitizer, 2-{[}1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a at a
   dose of 0.4 mu mol/kg. The parameter estimates (n = 34 mice) from
   fitting the standard Hill dose-response model to the data were: median
   fluorescence exclusion light dose FE(50) = 275 +/- 8.3 J/cm(2) and Hill
   sigmoidicity parameter m = -3.66 +/- 0.28. Subsets of the full data set
   randomly selected to simulate a standard eight mice experiment yielded
   similar parameter estimates, The new assay provides reliable estimates
   of PDT vascular damage with a frugal sequential experimental design.}},

Abstract = {{Of 255 mature male sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from two Alaskan
   lakes (Aleknagik and Iliamna), 254 (99.6\%) were infected with the
   nematode Philonema oncorhynchi with a mean wet mass of 3.1 g (SD = 3.4
   g) of nematodes. Fish that had spent 1 year in the lake prior to seaward
   migration had significantly lower parasite masses than those that had
   spent 2 years in the lake (2.7 vs. 4.1 g). However, there was no
   significant difference in parasite masses between lakes or among
   spawning populations within the lakes for fish of a given age or of all
   ages combined, even though the populations differed in age composition.
   The variation in relative parasite mass (mass of parasite (g) /mass of
   fish (kg)) was mainly explained by the significant variation in total
   mass of the parasites and the sea age of the fish. Thus, total parasite
   mass was correlated with the duration of residence in fresh water, while
   the relative parasite mass was correlated with fish size, and hence with
   the duration of residence in the sea. In spite of heavy infections (up
   to 28 g of nematodes) in many salmon, there were no corresponding
   reductions in mass/length or in the development of two sexually
   dimorphic features, body depth and snout length. Thus, parasite
   infection did not appear to affect traits under sexual selection, as
   hypothesized by Hamilton and Zuk.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity in rat isolated longitudinal muscle
   myenteric plexus preparations of the small intestine was determined by
   measuring the accumulation of H-3-L-citrulline during 30 min incubation
   with H-3-L-arginine.
   In untreated preparations a significant amount of H-3-L-citrulline
   accumulated in the tissue, about 2000 dpm/30 mg per 30 min, accounting
   for about 1.7\% of the tissue radioactivity. Intermittent electrical
   field stimulation (15 Hz, 10 s trains with 10 s intervals for total of
   20 min) caused a threefold increase in H-3-L-citrulline accumulation.
   The NO synthase inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)
   reduced the spontaneous accumulation of H-3-L-citrulline by 65\% and
   prevented the electrically evoked increase. Removal of extracellular
   calcium or addition of tetrodotoxin blocked the electrically evoked
   increase in H-3-L-citrulline accumulation without affecting spontaneous
   accumulation, Application of the calcium ionophore A 23187 (10 mu mol/l)
   or 45 mmol/l potassium caused a twofold increase in the accumulation of
   H-3-L-citrulline. The muscarine receptor agonist oxotremorine (1 mu
   mol/l) had no effect on spontaneous accumulation of H-3-L-citrulline,
   but inhibited the electrically evoked increase by about 50\%, and this
   effect was blocked by scopolamine. A substantial amount of
   H-3-L-citrulline (15 000 dpm) accumulated also in the incubation media,
   and this was increased 1.7-fold by the presence of A 23187 and 2.7-fold
   by electrical stimulation. However, electrically evoked increase in
   H-3-L-citrulline was not prevented by tetrodotoxin, in contrast to
   observation on tissue levels.
   In conclusion, during incubation with H-3-L-arginine tissue levels of
   H-3-L-citrulline in rat isolated longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus
   preparations, but not accumulation in incubation media may be used as a
   biochemical marker of the activity of nitrergic intestinal neurons which

Abstract = {{Granzyme B and perforin are cytoplasmic granule-associated proteins used
   by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells to kill their
   targets. However, granzyme B gene expression has also been detected in a
   non-cytotoxic hematopoietic murine multipotent stem cell line, FDCP-Mix.
   The objective of the present study was to investigate whether granzyme B
   and perforin could be expressed in human hematopoietic CD34(+) cells and
   if present, discover what their physiologic relevance could be. The
   primitive CD34(+) human cell line KG1a was investigated first and was
   found to express granzyme B and perforin. Highly purified hematopoietic
   stem/progenitor cells were then selected using the CD34 surface antigen
   as marker. Steady-state bone marrow (BM) CD34(+) cells did not contain
   these proteins, Peripheral blood (PB) CD34(+) cells, which had been
   induced to circulate, were also analyzed. After chemotherapy (CT) and
   granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment, CD34(+) cells
   strongly expressed mRNAs and proteins of granzyme B and perforin, In
   contrast, CD34(+) cells mobilized by G-CSF alone were negative. Western
   blot analysis further showed that granzyme B and perforin proteins were
   identical in CD34(+) cells and activated PBLs, Such proteins might be
   implicated in the highly efficient migration of CD34(+) stem/progenitor
   cells from BM to PB after CT and G-CSF treatment. The cellular adhesion
   mechanisms involved in the BM homing of CD34(+) cells are disrupted at
   least temporarily after CT. The Asp-ase proteolytic activity of granzyme
   B on extracellular matrix proteins could be used by progenitor cells for
   their rapid detachment from BM stromal cells and perforin might
   facilitate their migration across the endothelial cell barrier. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Flow regime maps are presented for gas-solids fluidized beds and
   gas-solids upward transport lines. For conventional gas-solids
   fluidization, the flow regimes include the fixed bed, bubbling
   fluidization, slugging fluidization and turbulent fluidization. For
   gas-solids vertical transport operation, solids flux must be
   incorporated in the flow regime diagrams. The how regimes then include
   dilute-phase transport, fast fluidization or turbulent flow, slug/bubbly
   flow, bubble-free dense-phase flow and packed bed flow. In practical
   circulating fluidized beds and transport risers, operation below the
   fast fluidization regime is commonly impossible due to equipment
   limitations. Practical how regime maps are proposed with the flow
   regimes, including homogeneous dilute-phase flow, core-annular
   dilute-phase flow (where there are appreciable lateral gradients but
   small axial gradients) and fast fluidization (where there are both
   lateral and axial gradients). The boundary between fast fluidization and
   dilute-phase pneumatic transport is set by the type A choking velocity,
   at which the uniform suspension collapses and particles start to
   accumulate in the bottom region of the transport line, while the
   mechanism of transition from fast fluidization to dense-phase how
   depends on the column and particle diameters.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine retrospectively consecutive patients treated with
   carbon dioxide laser excision of intraoral squamous cell carcinoma for
   the patterns of recurrence based on the location of the initial primary
   tumor and on the tumor stage.
   Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Setting: Tertiary care center including a university hospital and a
   Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
   Procedures and Patients: Sixty-one procedures performed on 51
   consecutive patients. The only patients not included were three who were
   unavailable for followup. The average follow-up was 32 months. If the
   patients whose follow-up was limited because of death are excluded, the
   average follow-up was 40 months.
   Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of recurrence, time to recurrence,
   development of second intraoral primary lesions or pulmonary metastases,
   and cause of death.
   Results: A nearly equal incidence of recurrence irrespective of site of
   lesion (tongue, 42\%; floor of mouth, 40\%; and other oral cavity sites,
   45\%). Determinate survival differed by stage. Patients with T1 lesions
   showed a determinate survival rate of 80\%; those with T2 or T3 lesions
   had a determinate survival rate of 57\%; and those treated for recurrent
   disease had a determinate survival rate of 44\%.
   Conclusions: Carbon dioxide laser excision of intraoral squamous cell
   carcinoma is a useful, advantageous method, but it appears to offer no
   advantage for recurrence over standard methods. Appropriate management
   of neck disease in patients with intraoral squamous cell carcinoma must
   be carefully considered. Patients with this potentially aggressive form
   of cancer deserve long-term follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Spread monolayers of diblock copolymers of styrene and ethylene oxide at
   the air-water interface were studied by surface pressure measurements
   and neutron reflectivity, as a function of coverage sigma and chain
   length N. The surface pressure data have three regions, one at low
   coverage, where a relatively sharp increase due to increasing
   intermolecular interaction is found, a more gently increasing part at
   intermediate coverage, where the poly(ethylene oxide) block gradually
   desorbs to form a blush, and a sharply increasing part at high coverage,
   where the blush is compressed. The neutron reflectivity measurements,
   taken in the intermediate and high coverage regions, confirm the
   presence of a brush with a thickness scaling, by approximation as
   sigma(1/3). These brushes could be compressed by a factor of about 5
   without desorption occurring. The observations are in good agreement
   with numerical calculations based on a mean field lattice model for
   terminally anchored, adsorbing chains. These calculations predict a
   gradual change in the average configuration from a flat, adsorbed state
   to a brush consisting of stretched chains.}},

   in the open season they made up about 70\% of the diet. Differences in
   the diets of birds from areas open and closed to fishing were less
   marked, probably because birds from the closed zone can forage in
   adjacent areas open to trawling. About half the bycatch discarded by the
   trawlers is of a size suitable for one or more of the seabirds, and most
   of this half floats, some of it for up to 6 h. S. bergii, S. leucogaster
   and F ariel are actively opportunistic, feeding around trawlers, but S.
   anaetheta and S. dougallii may be passive discard feeders, feeding on
   floating discards away from the site of dumping. The provision of
   discards has not changed the size ranges of prey taken by any of the
   species. It may, however, have increased overlap in the diets of the
   various seabirds and changed some feeding strategies. There is little
   evidence that discards have directly affected breeding cycles or nesting
   periodicity. Nevertheless, most species breed mainly in late summer and
   the largest quantities of bycatch are discarded in March, immediately
   post-fledging. This may lead to juvenile birds becoming conditioned to
   feeding on discards and may also reduce juvenile mortality rates.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. The purpose of the work is to study the adsorption of Oleic
   acid and Span 85 (materials frequently used in aerosols as surfactants)
   onto partially amorphous and essentially crystalline salbutamol
   sulphate, attempting to understand the behaviour of metered dose
   inhalers (MDIs) and observing whether there were any differences in
   adsorption behaviour and if this could be related to the surface
   properties of the powder.
   Methods. isothermal titration microcalorimetry was the principal
   technique used to measure the adsorption behaviour of surfactants to
   salbutamol sulphate. A Malvern particle size analyzer was also employed
   to provide size data on the interactions between the surfactant and
   powder suspensions.
   Results. The calorimetric data revealed that surfactant adsorption to
   the crystalline micronised powder (78\% RH and aged dry sample) produced
   significant exotherms, whereas adsorption to the partially amorphous
   micronised powder resulted in small heat responses. The differences in
   adsorption behaviour to the partially crystalline and crystalline
   surfaces resulted in changes in aggregation behaviour.
   Conclusions. The stability of MDIs varies depending on the water
   content, crystallinity and surface composition of the powder. The
   advantages of using isothermal titration microcalorimetry to evaluate
   this surface behaviour in such difficult systems was demonstrated.}},

   counties of Florida were surveyed for gregarine parasites during the

   containers (mainly tires) were dissected to determine the number of
   gregarine trophozoites present. Ascogregarina spp, were found at 70\% of
   the sites and occurred as frequently in Ae. aegypti populations as in
   Ae. albopictus. Within sites, parasite distributions were highly
   variable and aggregated in host populations. Parasite loads ranged from
   1 to 486 trophozoites per host. Mean parasite load was significantly
   higher in Ae. aegypti larvae (52.5 per host) than in Ae. albopictus
   (33.5 per host). Parasite prevalence was significantly higher in Ae.
   aegypti populations that were not sympatric with Ae. albopictus compared
   with allopatric Ae. albopictus or sympatric populations of either
   species. In sympatric populations, Ae. aegypti tended to have equal or
   higher parasite prevalence than the cohabiting Ae. albopictus.
   Ascogregarina taiwanensis (Lien \& Levine) prevalence in Ae. albopictus
   was significantly higher in areas where these hosts have been present
   for at least 3 yr. These data contribute to the hypothesis that parasite
   mediated competition may be a factor in the apparent displacement of Ae.
   aegypti by Ae. albopictus in Florida.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the effects a hospital-based managed care
   intervention has on the cost and quality of care.
   Methods: The intervention consisted of a CareMap and a nurse case
   manager. The CareMap contained both a critical path and a set of
   expected patient outcomes. The study population comprised all women who
   delivered by cesarean during the 18 months of the study and who were
   cared for in the maternity unit at a tertiary-level university hospital.
   The effects of the intervention were determined by comparing the after
   group with the before group in regard to length of stay and costs of
   care post-cesarean delivery, patient ratings of quality of care, and the
   physical recovery of the patients by discharge and 1 month later.
   Results: After the implementation of hospital-based managed care, the
   average length of stay decreased 13.5\% (0.7 days) and the average costs
   decreased 13.1\% (\$518). These decreases were statistically significant
   and remained so after controlling for co-morbid and complicating
   conditions. Patients perception of the quality of care increased from
   4.26 to 4.41 on a 1-5 scale, a statistically significant increase. In
   particular, patients believed that they had an increased level of
   participation in their care. The physical recovery scores obtained at
   discharge did not change.
   Conclusion: Hospital-based managed care can reduce resource use, length
   of stay, and cost associated with hospital care while maintaining or
   improving the quality of care. Whether these effects are reproducible
   and generalizable to other conditions should be addressed in future
   studies; the duration of these effects should also be examined.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife management in tropical areas inhabited by rural people requires
   an understanding of the interactions between game choice of hunters and
   the biology of game species. This paper presents an analysis that
   combines information on game use and game biology in an attempt to
   understand better the game hunting system and its effect on mammalian
   populations. Game choice by non-tribal inhabitants was studied in the
   northeastern Peruvian Amazon within the Reserva Comunal
   Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo (RCTT). The correlation between game preferences and
   actual harvests was calculated using Ivlev's index of selectivity.
   Hunters preferred large-bodied mammals and mammals with high economic
   value. Actual harvests did not reflect preferences of hunters, but were
   correlated with reproductive productivity of game species, measured as
   the species r(max). Impact of hunting on the biomass of game was not
   correlated with preferences of hunters or actual harvests. Both game
   choice by hunters and susceptibility of species to hunting depended
   mainly on the reproductive productivities of game species. Thus, game
   management in the RCTT must consider the dominating effects of
   reproductive biology and consider variance in r(max) when determining
   harvests.}},

   object-oriented paradigm where the message-method mechanism is replaced

   with the real-time, cyclic nature of PLC software. Software re-usability
   is pursued by identifying independent control modules through a proper
   bedded encapsulation mechanism, representing system dynamics by means of
   synchronized state diagrams, expressing context-free behaviour of system
   components by introducing virtual objects. The EASIER approach is
   presently validated with respect to relevant reverse and forward

Abstract = {{Previously it has been suggested that Li+/Na+ exchange is a mode of
   operation of Na+/H+ exchange, with arguments pro and contra. In the
   present experiments this question was studied by measuring Li+ effluxes
   from Li+-loaded trout erythrocytes under various conditions. Trout
   erythrocytes were loaded with Li+ by incubation in a lithium
   carbonate-containing solution and the efflux of Li+ was determined in
   both Na+-free and 150 mM Na+-containing media. The presence of Na+
   enhanced the Lif efflux. The Naf effect was neither sensitive to
   amiloride nor to 5-N,N-dimethylamiloride (DMA), both inhibitors of the
   Na+/H+ exchanger. Activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger by isoproterenol
   was demonstrated by an increased Lif efflux (Li+/H+ exchange mode of the
   Na+/H+ exchanger). This effect was eliminated by DMA and amiloride, and
   by the presence of O-2 which also inhibits the Na+/H+ exchanger in trout
   erythrocytes. However, the activation of the Lif efflux by Na+ was not
   affected by O-2. The finding that the stimulating effect of Na+ on Lif
   efflux persists to occur in the presence of amiloride, DMA, or O-2,
   supports the idea that the trout erythrocyte possesses a Li+/Na+
   exchanger that is different from the Na+/H+ exchanger.}},

Abstract = {{Delayed reproductive death, the appearance of colonies with a reduced
   cell density (impaired colonies) and the number of giant cells per
   colony were investigated in murine fibrosarcoma cells after irradiation
   with 3 to 9 Gy of x-rays. Radiation survivors were replated after
   reaching confluence, which occurred after 13 to 15 doublings; this
   procedure was repeated three times. The replating efficiency decreased
   in a dose-dependent manner, the survivors of 9 Gy achieving only 30\% of
   the plating efficiency of unirradiated cells. After the third replating,
   i.e. after 40 to 45 doublings, the plating efficiency of the survivors
   approached that of the controls. The median colony size of the survivors
   showed a similar dose-dependent decrease, which was pronounced after the
   first replating but still remained significant after the third
   replating. The fraction of impaired colonies was increased to more than
   30\% in 9-Gy survivors, and though abating, the increase was still
   significant even after the third replating. Evidence of residual damage
   was also provided by the presence of giant cells. For instance, after 6
   Gy irradiation and 13 to 15 doublings, the proportion of colonies with
   giant cells was 60\%, decreasing only to 45\% after 40 to 45 doublings.
   The number of giant cells per colony was 1.4 in colonies arising
   immediately after 6 Gy, decreasing to 0.9 after the third replating.
   These results suggest that the proliferative capacity of surviving cells
   is depressed even longer than their clonogenic capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Regulation of virulence factor expression in Bordetella pertussis is
   mediated by the BvgAS two-component regulatory system. Although previous
   studies have demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation of the
   filamentous hemagglutinin gene (fhaB) involves binding of the BvgA
   activator directly to the fhaB promoter region, the mechanism of
   pertussis toxin operon (ptx) regulation by BvgA has remained unclear. We
   demonstrate in vitro the specific binding of BvgA to a region upstream
   of the pa promoter that encompasses a 20-bp directly repeated sequence
   (positions -157 to -117) previously shown to be critical for
   BvgA-dependent activation. This binding is strictly dependent on the
   phosphorylation of BvgA, which can be obtained by incubation of BvgA
   with acetyl phosphate. By DNase I protection studies, we demonstrate the
   synergistic binding of BvgA-phosphate and purified Escherichia coli RNA
   polymerase to the ptx promoter. In the presence of the polymerase
   holoenzyme, a greatly extended footprint encompassing the region between
   -163 and the putative polymerase binding site was observed. The
   implications of these observations for pertussis toxin expression and
   regulation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of the mendelian dominant inherited syndrome of familial
   polyposis coli in the 1930s has been followed by the recognition of many
   inherited colonic polyposis syndromes. The recognition of different
   histological types of colon polyps was associated by the gradual
   recognition that some, such as the hamartomatous polyps, do not progress
   into adenocarcinoma, and others, such as various adenomas have a greater
   or lesser propensity to eventually give rise to invasive cancer.
   As the host of inherited syndromes expanded and were more widely
   recognized, additional inherited characteristics became apparent: such
   tumors as breast and thyroid associated with Cowden's syndrome, ovarian
   cysts and sex cord tumors with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and, of course,
   the soft tissue, bony tumors, ampullary cancers, and fibroadenomas
   associated with Gardner's syndrome.
   In recent years, genetic markers for the various syndromes have been
   studied, and in some cases confirmed. This whole field is rapidly
   developing and is briefly covered. All the steps and influencing factors
   in cancer development are shown in one phase or another of the
   polyp-cancer sequence in these inherited syndromes. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Plasma membrane solute transport may be regulated in
   many epithelial cells by vesicle traffic to and from the site of
   residence of the transporter. The aim of this study was to determine if
   this phenomenon may also play a role in the regulation of canalicular
   transport of bile acids. Methods: Confocal microscopy and image analysis
   were performed to quantitatively assess changes in secretory capacity
   and vesicle targeting in isolated rat hepatocyte couplets that had been
   exposed to fluorescent bile acid after pretreatment with dibutyryl
   adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP) and/or nocodazole.
   Results: DBcAMP stimulated bile acid secretion by 240\% while
   significantly increasing canalicular circumference. Nocodazole decreased
   secretion by 410\% and significantly decreased canalicular
   circumference. When DBcAMP was added to nocodazole-treated couplets, a
   slight but significant increase was found in both fluorescent bile acid
   secretion and canalicular circumference as compared with nocodazole
   alone. Finally, DBcAMP stimulated translocation of vesicles to the
   canalicular membrane as determined by immunocytochemical localization of
   a putative bile acid transporter, Ca2+, Mg2+-ecto-adenosine
   triphosphatase. Conclusions: The findings support the view that apical
   membrane transport activity in the rat hepatocyte is highly regulated by
   the insertion of vesicles into this domain and that this process
   involves both microtubule-dependent and -independent mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was designed to investigate whether nitric oxide (NO)
   antagonizes angiotensin II (Ang II) in modulating the tubuloglomerular
   feedback (TGF) system. Maximum TGF responses were assessed by evaluating
   stop-flow pressure (SFP) responses to late proximal perfusion with
   artificial tubular fluid (40 nl/min). Peritubular capillary (PTC)
   infusion of 10(-3) M N-G-L-arginine (NLA) at a rate of 20 nl/min, and
   infusion of 10(-7) and 10(-6) M Ang II at rates that did not decrease
   SFP under conditions of zero flow to the macula densa (resting SFP),
   augmented maximum SFP feedback responses to 12.0 +/- 1.7, 12.1 +/- 2.4
   and 16.9 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, respectively (all P < 0.01 vs. control
   response). Combined PTC infusion of NLA and 10(-7) M Ang II at a rate of
   20 nl/min resulted in decreases in resting SFP in 7 of the 12 nephrons
   studied. When the infusion rate was decreased to 15 +/- 3 nl/min,
   concomitant PTC infusion of NLA and 10(-7) M Ang II was associated with
   a tremendous increase in maximum TGF responses (23.8 +/- 3.9 mm Hg; P <
   0.01 vs. responses during PTC NLA or Ang II) in the absence of a
   decrease in resting SFP. During AT(1) receptor blockade using losartan,
   SFP feedback responses were attenuated to 1.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg and PTC
   infusion of NLA only augmented TGF responses to 3.8 +/- 1.0 mm Hg. These
   results strongly suggest that local NO antagonizes Ang II with respect
   to the regulation of TGF responsiveness. Disruption of this balance by
   NO synthesis inhibition strongly potentiates TGF-independent and
   TGF-dependent actions of Ang II on the preglomerular vasculature.}},

Abstract = {{Aerospatiale Avions uses a method, a language and tools to obtain
   detailed specifications of the Airbus onboard flight control systems
   under its responsibility. The origins of this workshop developed by
   Aerospatiale lie in the SAO (computer assisted specification) language
   based on a graphics formalism, known to all electronics and automation
   experts, which covers the field of flight control laws and operational
   logics. The possibility of automatically generating software from this
   formalism has allowed Aerospatiale to develop tools for real-rime
   simulation and critical system specification validation as early as the
   design stage. The specifications thus validated are then automatically
   translated into `aircraft' software, guaranteeing that the behaviour of
   the onboard system will be identical to the behaviour observed during
   simulation. This method and these tools were put to the test and proven
   within the scope of the Airbus A340 development. The quality of the
   specifications thus obtained enabled a significant reduction in the
   number of modifications to the onboard systems and led to substantial
   cuts in cost and debugging times.
   The example of debugging the Airbus A340 fly-by-wire specifications is
   used to back up the paper, which will also present the future
   specification integrated workshop, CSAO (computer-aided specification
   and design), developed by Aerospatiale Avions and Verilog.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. We evaluated children less than 16 years of age who had dog
   bite injuries that resulted in hospitalization or death to determine the
   typical characteristics of the children, the dogs, and the injuries
   suffered.
   Design. Retrospective chart review.
   Setting. Three large city hospitals including Harbor-view Medical
   Center, Seattle, Washington; Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City,
   Missouri; and Mary Bridge Hospital, Tacoma, Washington.
   Methods. Charts were reviewed for patient demographic data and canine
   data. Hospitalization data included total length of stay, need for
   intensive care, Injury Severity Score, the nature and extent of the
   injuries, procedures performed, complications, and outcome.
   Results. Forty cases were reviewed. Most children were boys (60\%) and
   were white (87\%). The median age was 50 months. There were three
   deaths. Most dogs were medium-sized or large breeds and were familiar to
   the victim. The average hospital stay was 6 days (SD = 5), and 12 (30\%)
   patients required a stay in the intensive care unit. Injuries to the
   face, head, and neck area were most common (82\%). Major surgical
   procedures included craniotomy, exploration of the neck or abdomen,
   ocular procedures, and repair of fractures.
   Conclusions. Severe dog bites in children occur most frequently in those
   younger than 5 years old and involve the head and neck. Large dogs that
   are familiar to the child are usually involved. Young children should be
   closely supervised when around any dog.}},

Abstract = {{In ektacytometry (or laser-diffractometry), the deformation of red blood
   cells subjected to a series of shear stresses in Couette flow (high to
   low) is measured. The shear stress dependency of the measured
   deformation index DI is called a `'deformation curve'' and depends upon
   membrane and cell properties.
   We studied the relation between red cell theology and the various stages
   of the deformation curve. We used this insight to introduce an empirical
   model to describe the deformation curve in parameters that represent
   characteristics of the curve.
   The Deformation Curve is an S-shaped curve when the shear stress is
   plotted on a logarithmic scale, and found to be accurately described by:
   DI(tau) = DImin + (DImax - DImin) (tau/tau(i))(m)/{[}(tau/tau(i))(m) +
   1].
   The minimum deformation (DImin) at low stress is determined by the
   orientation of undeformed cells. At intermediate stresses the DI is
   determined by both the orientation and the deformation. At these
   stresses the tank-treading is commonly believed to be important and is
   reflected in tau(i). This is confirmed by the sensitivity of tau i to
   membrane deformability. At high stresses the orientation angle is small
   and DImax is mainly determined by the constant surface area-to-volume
   ratio of the cells. Parameter m determines the slope at intermediate
   stresses but the relation with cell theology is yet unclear.
   Although the parameters cannot be independently linked to membrane or
   cell properties, the empirical model proved to be useful in describing
   deformation curves over a large range of red cell deformabilities. We
   think that such parametrization of the deformation curve will prove to
   be very useful in standardization of ektacytometric measurements for
   clinical purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The secondary structure in mRNA is essential for many processes, but it
   can present a technical problem in making full-length cDNA with reverse
   transcriptases. Furthermore, different reverse transcriptases have
   differing abilities to transcribe through regions with secondary
   structure, which can alter the products obtained by reverse-transcribing
   RNA and then PCR-amplifying the product (RT-PCR). We have been
   interested in studying the posttranscriptional regulation of epidermal
   growth factor by RT-PCR and have rested the ability of several reverse
   transcriptases to reverse transcribe the 3'-untranslated region (3'
   UTR), a region that contains substantial secondary structure. when low
   levels of either total RNA or poly (A)(+) mRNA were used,,ve Sound avian
   myeloblastosis vints reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) to be the most
   robust of all the enzymes tested. Furthermore, contrary to reports that
   AMV-RT is inhibited by tRNA - which should make it less effective than
   Moloney murine leukemia vints reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT) al
   reverse-transcribing total RNA - adding tRNA to poly(A)(+) RNA actually
   increased the amount of specific RT-PCR product obtained with AMV-RT
   while it decreased the amount of product and enhanced mispriming with
   MMLV-RT. We found that pre-incubation of the oligo(dT) primer with total
   RNA at elevated temperature prior to reverse transcription improved the
   efficiency of both native and modified MMLV-RTs. These findings support
   the concept that secondary structures in RNA differentially affect the
   abilities of different, reverse transcriptases to detect transcript
   diversity and mise the possibility that such structures could affect
   quantitation using RT-PCR with internal mRNA standards.}},

Abstract = {{Unsorted, mixed waste office paper (MWOP) is an excellent substrate for
   conversion into fuel ethanol using a recombinant strain of Klebsiella
   oxytoca which ferments cellobiose and cellotriose to ethanol at near
   theoretical yields, eliminating the need for supplemental
   beta-glucosidase. This organism was tested with commercial fungal
   cellulase in optimized simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
   experiments (SSF) using MWOP as a substrate (pH 5-5.2, 35 degrees C).
   Similar rates and yields were obtained with dilute acid-pulped
   (hydrolysis of hemicellulose) and water-pulped MWOP on a dry weight
   basis although viscosity was reduced by the acid pretreatment. In simple
   batch fermentations, 40 g/L ethanol was produced after 48-72 h with 100
   g/L MWOP and 1000 filter paper units (FPU) of cellulase/L, a yield of
   550 L of ethanol metric ton. Cellulase usage was further reduced by
   recycling SSF residues containing bound enzymes in multistage
   fermentations. This approach reduced the requirement for fungal
   cellulase while retaining rapid ethanol production and high ethanol
   yield. In our optimal design, broths containing an average of 39.6 g/L
   ethanol were produced in three successive stages with an average
   fermentation time of 80 h (567 FPU of fungal cellulase/L; 6.1 FPU/g of
   substrate). This represents a yield of 0.426 g of ethanol/g of
   substrate, 539 L/metric ton, 129 gal/U.S. ton. MWOP contains
   approximately 90\% carbohydrate. Thus the combined efficiency for
   saccharification and fermentation to ethanol was 83.3\% of the
   theoretical maximum.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work demonstrated that a herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)
   immediate-early function upregulates beta interferon but not
   chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes driven by the strong
   simian virus 40 (SV40) or cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer regions in
   both transient assays and stable cell lines. The different 3' mRNA
   stabilization and RNA-processing signals from these two reporter genes
   appeared to be primarily responsible for this phenomenon. We now report
   that the HSV-1 ICP27 itself is sufficient to stimulate both steady-state
   accumulation and increased half-life of beta interferon reporter gene
   mRNA. Furthermore, the ability to respond directly to cotransfected
   ICP27 can be transferred to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter
   genes by replacement of their SV40 derived splicing and poly(A) signals
   with the 3' AU-rich and poly(A) RNA-processing signals from the normally
   highly labile beta interferon and c-myc mRNA species. ICP27 expressed in
   bacteria bound specifically to in vitro-generated RNA from both the beta
   interferon and c-myc intronless AU-rich 3' RNA-processing regions, but
   not to the SV40-derived early-region splice signal and poly(A)
   sequences. By site-specific mutagenesis, we also show that individual
   ICP27 C-terminal amino acid residues that are positionally conserved in
   ICP27 homologs in other herpesviruses (D-357, E-358, H-479, C-400, C-483
   and C-488) are critical for trans-regulatory activity. Importantly,
   several of these positions match mutations that are known to be
   essential for the role of ICP27 in the early-to-late switch during the
   virus lytic cycle. Therefore, our findings support the notion that HSV
   ICP27 modulates gene expression posttranscriptionally in part by
   targeting RNA.}},

Abstract = {{Electron microscopy was used to examine the responses of pepper
   mesophyll cells to strains of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria
   with insertion mutations in each of the clustered hrp loci hrpA, B, C,
   D, E, and F, All hrp mutants caused the localized formation of large
   papillae in adjacent cells, Similar deposits also accumulated after
   inoculation with the saprophytic strain T55 of X. campestris, which
   lacks the entire hrp cluster, Immunocytochemistry with antibodies to
   tomato extensin revealed the accumulation of hydroxyproline-rich
   glycoproteins in the amorphous electron-dense matrix that encapsulated
   hrp mutant bacteria onto the plant cell wall and also within paramural
   deposits, Callose was also detected at reaction sites, By contrast, only
   minor cell wall alterations were observed in response to inoculation
   with wild-type strain 85-10 or a mutant deficient in extracellular
   polysaccharide production (85-10::454), Unlike other hrp mutants, the
   hrpE(-) strain 85-10::E75, when harboring plasmids overexpressing the
   avirulence gene avrBs3, caused the hypersensitive reaction in pepper cv,
   ECW30-R in addition to inducing deposition of large papillae, If cells
   of strains 85-10 or 85-10::454 were heat-killed or treated with
   chloramphenicol (Cm) before inoculation they also caused formation of
   large papillae, Treatment with Cm in the plant, 1 to 4 h after
   inoculation, also led to papilla deposition adjacent to cells of 85-10
   or 85-10::454 but if antibiotic treatment was delayed for 8 h, although
   bacterial cells were killed, no papillae developed, An hrp also induced
   papilla formation in Arabidopsis, bean, and lettuce mesophyll cells, Our
   results suggest that localized cell wall modification and associated
   papilla deposition represent a defense response of plant cells to
   strains of X. campestris and that suppression of the reaction by X. c.
   pv. vesicatoria requires each of the clustered hrp loci.}},

Abstract = {{The dispersion of aerosol boluses in the human lungs has been studied in
   health and disease, usually as a means of investigating convective
   mixing. However, there are limited data on the roles of critical
   factors, such as the volume of inhaled boluses, lung inflation, and
   gender on dispersion. To examine these factors, we measured the
   difference in volume variance between exhaled and inhaled boluses
   (sigma(V)(2)) of a 0.5-mu m aerosol in 11 healthy male and 12 healthy
   female subjects as a function of tidal volume (V-T = 1,000 and 1,500 ml
   in females and 1,000 and 2,000 ml in males), bolus penetration volume
   ((V) over bar(i) at 250-ml increments over each V-T), and bolus volume
   (target V-Bol = 75, 150, and 300 ml). Analysis of variance showed
   marginally significant gender effects (P = 0.073) on sigma(V)(2), with
   sigma(V)(2) greater in males than in females. There was also a
   significant effect of V-Bol,1 on sigma(V)(2) (P < 0.001). A (V) over
   bar(i)-dependent mean volume shift between inhaled and exhaled boluses
   (Delta (V) over bar) was observed at all (V) over bar i except 500 ml.
   The observation of gender and V-Bol effects and the existence of a
   nonzero Delta (V) over bar suggest that convective mixing mechanisms
   other than longitudinal dispersion alone occur in the healthy lung. The
   lack of V-T dependence suggests a minimal role of lung inflation above
   functional residual capacity on dispersion. The dependence of
   sigma(V)(2) on (V) over bar(i)(2) up to 1,750 ml and minimal V-Bol
   effects demonstrates that convective mixing processes continue far into
   the gas exchange regions of the lung and support a significant role for
   axial streaming.}},

Abstract = {{At an early stage in the lives of stars and galaxies when they are
   surrounded by discs, vorticity in the disc concentrates into a central
   vortex, thus converting a Keplerian velocity field u(phi) proportional
   to r(-1/2) into an irrotational velocity field u(phi) proportional to
   r(-1), implies inward transfer of angular momentum. Centrifugal forces
   due to spin-up of the inner region and gravity dominant in the outer
   region then squeeze gas at intermediate layers, increasing pressure
   gradient in the axial direction sufficiently to drive a wide-angle
   low-velocity bipolar outflow from the disc. A logarithmic singularity of
   vorticity at the axis implies strong centrifugal forces which expand
   plasma to radius R where pressure gradient balances centrifugal force
   density of ions; the much weaker centrifugal force density of electrons
   cannot balance pressure gradient, so that electrons are driven inwards
   relative to ions until charge separation limits the relative
   displacement. Now the radial gradient of u(phi) causes ions to rotate at
   a different rate to electrons, generating an azimuthal current density
   j(phi) which is the source of an axial magnetic field B-z in the core of
   the central vortex. Centrifuging carries lines of B to the core wall,
   where they are wound into helical force-free configuration with B
   proportional to j. An annular channel of radius R and thickness Delta R
   into which parallel helical lines of j and B are compressed constitutes
   a `'magnetic vortex tube'' (MVT). An MVT separates an inner
   high-velocity highly collimated outflow from the outer low-velocity
   wide-angle outflow, and is responsible for jets. Magnetic pinches in the
   MVT may constrict the core flow at HH objects.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-To improve the reproducibility and accuracy of joint space
   width (JSW) measurement as an assessment of cartilage loss in patients
   with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee by determining how precision and
   accuracy of JSW measurement were altered by a computerised method of
   measurement, correction for radiographic magnification, radiography of
   the knee in the standing semiflexed view, and high definition
   macroradiography of the knee in the semiflexed view-taking JSW
   measurements from standard radiographs of OA knees in the extended view
   as the standard for comparison.
   Methods-Twenty five OA and 10 non-arthritic knees were radiographed in
   the extended view and minimum JSW was measured manually. Conventional
   and x 5 macroradiographs were taken in the semiflexed view. All
   radiographs were taken twice on the same day and repeated two weeks
   later. Automated computerised measurement of minimum JSW was obtained
   from digitally stored images of all radiographs.
   Results-For medial compartment JSW measurements, computerised was more
   accurate than manual, correction for radiographic magnification improved
   precision and accuracy, measurements in the semiflexed view were more
   precise and accurate, and macroradiography increased measurement
   precision. For the lateral compartment JSW measurements, correction for
   radiographic magnification improved precision and accuracy, and the
   semiflexed view improved precision only.
   Conclusions-Protocols defining radiographic and mensural procedures are
   essential for quality control of knee radiography in the semiflexed view
   to permit accurate and reproducible measurement of JSW. Macroradiography
   provides greater precision of JSW measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of reactive red 2 and its parent compound acid red 33 were
   studied in rat vas deferens and guinea-pig taenia coli. In rat vas
   deferens, reactive red 2 (1 to 10 mu M) shifted the
   concentration-response curve for the P-2X-purinoceptor-mediated
   contraction effect of alpha, beta-methylene ATP slightly to the right
   and progressively decreased the maximum (apparent antagonist K-d value
   0.42 mu M). Acid red 33 (1000 mu M) shifted the curve to the right
   without changing the maximum (apparent K-d 386 mu M). The
   concentration-contraction curve of noradrenaline was not altered by
   reactive red 2. In the carbachol-precontracted guinea-pig taenia coli,
   reactive red 2 (0.1 to 10 mu M) shifted the concentration-response curve
   for the P-2Y-purinoceptor-mediated relaxation effect of adenosine
   5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (ADP beta S) progressively to the right; only
   at the highest concentration of antagonist (10 mu M) was the maximum
   slightly depressed; a pA(2) value of 7.55 (K-d 0.028 mu M) was derived
   from the shift. Acid red 33 (1000 mu M) shifted the
   concentration-relaxation curve of ADP beta S to the right without
   changing the maximum (apparent K-d 171 mu M). Reactive red 2 (1 to 10 mu
   M) also shifted the concentration-response curve for the relaxation
   effect of alpha, beta-methylene ATP, which is mediated by an
   unclassified P-2-purinoceptor, progressively to the right but
   simultaneously decreased the maximum (apparent K-d 1.61 mu M). The
   concentration-relaxation curve of 2-chloroadenosine was not altered by
   reactive red 2. Pieces of vas deferens and taenia coli degraded 76 and
   66\% of added ATP (10 mu M) within 30 min, respectively. Reactive red 2
   (0.1 to 100 mu M) progressively reduced this degradation by up to 95\%,
   with IC50 values of 3.9 +/- 0.6 and 3.9 +/- 2.3 mu M, respectively. Acid
   red 33 (1000 mu M) reduced the degradation by 30 and 20\%, respectively.
   The results indicate that reactive red 2 is a relatively potent
   antagonist at both P-2X-purinoceptors in rat vas deferens and
   P-2Y-purinoceptors in guinea-pig taenia coli, with a 15 fold selectivity
   for the P-2Y-purinoceptor. It inhibits ecto-nucleotidase in both
   tissues. The dichloro-triazine residue that distinguishes the compound
   from acid red 33 greatly enhances the potency at both receptor subtypes
   as well as at the nucleotidase. As regards P-2-purinoceptor subtypes,
   the results confirm the existence of two relaxation-mediating
   P-2-purinoceptors in guinea-pig taenia coli.}},

   psychology respectively depth psychology. Two fundamental problems,
   resulting from this historical context of philosophy, should be
   described: Firstly the consciousness, which is objectivated and hardened
   as psyche by the influence of reflection. Secondly the unconsciousness,
   which seems like a hidden psychological entity with an indifferent
   essence. The effort to revise those two problems should be made by the
   use of phenomenological and existential philosophy. The intention of
   this revision is firstly to reintegrate the isolated reflexive
   consciousness in a field of consciousness and secondly to replace the
   confrontation with the unconsciousness by the dialogue with the fellow
   being.}},

Abstract = {{Flat tabs of cast gold alloy (n = 156) were subjected to either of three
   surface treatments: (1) roughening with diamond bur, (2) aluminum oxide
   sandblasting, and (3) sandblasting plus tin electroplating. Mandibular
   incisor edgewise brackets were bonded with Concise (BIS-GMA resin)
   (Unitek, Monrovia, Calif.) or Superbond C\&B (4-META metal bonding
   resin) (Sun Medical Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), or with Concise after
   application of an intermediate resin. All-Bond 2 Primers A and B (Bisco
   Dental Products, Itasca, III.), or B alone. All specimens were stored in
   water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and 60 were then thermocycled 1000
   times from 5 degrees C to 55 degrees C and back. The tensile bond
   strength testing was performed in a Lloyd 1000R machine (Fareham, Hants,
   England). Alignment and uniform loading during testing were secured by
   engaging a hook in a circular ring soldered onto the bracket slot before
   bonding. Similar control brackets (n = 24) were bonded with Concise to
   extracted human premolars and lower incisors according to a routine
   procedure. Bond failure sites were classified by a modified ARI system.
   The results showed that sandblasting produced significantly stronger
   bonds to gold alloy than roughening with diamond bur. Superbond C\&B
   provided significantly stronger bonds to gold allay than Concise. There
   were generally insignificant differences in bond strengths between the
   water stored and the thermocycled specimens. Bond failures of Concise to
   sandblasted plus tin-plated gold alloy invariably occurred at the
   gold/adhesive interface, whereas those of Superbond C\&B occurred within
   the adhesive or in the adhesive/bracket interface. The bond strengths
   obtained with Superbond C\&B and sandblasted gold alloy surfaces were
   comparable to those of the brackets bonded to conventionally etched
   human teeth with Concise. Tin-plating improved the orthodontic bond
   strengths to sandblasted gold alloy only marginally. The bond strength
   of Concise to sandblasted gold alloy was significantly improved with the
   intermediate application of A1l-Bond 2 primers A and B. It is concluded
   that successful bonding to gold alloys is feasible with several
   combinations and clinical recommendations for bonding brackets and
   lingual retainer wires to high-noble alloy surfaces are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A stable electroactive thin film of cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) was
   electrochemically deposited on the surface of a microband gold
   electrode. The cyclic voltammograms of CoHCF film indicate the presence
   of two redox peaks corresponding to the hexacyanoferrate(II/III) redox
   couple. The electrochemical behaviour of CoHCF is related to the
   concentration of supporting electrolyte and counter-ions. The modified
   electrode shows excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the
   oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in
   phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0), with an overpotential ca.310-370 mV
   lower than that of the bare microband cold electrode. The catalytic peak
   current is proportional to NADH concentration in the range 0.5-6.0 mM
   with a correlation coefficient of 0.98. The catalytic rate constant of
   the modified electrode for the oxidation of NADH is determined using a
   rotating-disc electrode. The mechanism of the oxidation of NADH

Abstract = {{Whatever the method, the biologic price of restitution of arterial flow
   through or around an obstructed artery is injury to the arterial wall.
   The artery mounts a healing response that in 30\% to 60\% of procedures
   exceeds the need. The result is formation of a lumen-narrowing lesion
   composed of smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix with varying
   amounts of atherosclerotic components. The primary player appears to be
   the smooth muscle cell. For four decades the standard model for studying
   these events has been catheter denudation of arterial endothelium in
   small animals. Molecular biology has provided an enormous amount of new
   information including growth factors, adhesion molecules, receptor
   binding sites, and molecules that up- or down-regulate or maintain a
   steady state of expression of numberless genes in the arterial wall.
   Predictably, means of inhibiting these molecular events have been found.
   That their clinical trials have been universally disappointing should
   not be surprising given that the animal in which the discoveries were
   made-the rat-is not normally susceptible to atherosclerosis and the
   histology of the rat artery only approximates that of the human.
   Nevertheless, reason for optimism exists because of our increasing
   understanding of the injury response. Recent developments include the
   use of blocking antisense oligonucleotides, blocking antibodies, gene
   transfer trials, and early investigations into the role of the immune
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Barrett's esophagus is associated with
   adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The aim of this study was to find the
   prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in patients with adenocarcinoma of the
   esophagogastric junction. Methods: Consecutive, freshly resected
   surgical esophagogastrectomy specimens were examined, and multiple
   histological sections were made around the tumor periphery. Barrett's
   esophagus was defined as specialized columnar epithelium above the
   esophagogastric junction. Tumors centered less than or equal to 2 cm
   from the junction were defined as junction cancers. Results: Barrett's
   esophagus was found in 9 of 9 (100\%) esophageal adenocarcinomas
   compared with 0 of 8 (0\%) squamous carcinoma controls (P < 0.001). Ten
   of 24 (42\%) junction adenocarcinomas had a Barrett's esophagus. A
   Barrett's esophagus was found in 8 of 12 (67\%) junction cancers less
   than or equal to 6 cm in length but only 2 of 12 (17\%) larger tumors (P
   < 0.05). Barrett's esophagus was significantly associated with junction
   tumors; <6 cm compared with squamous carcinoma controls (P < 0.02). In 5
   specimens with junction cancer, the length of Barrett's esophagus was <3
   cm, and in 5 specimens it was greater than or equal to 3 cm. Specialized
   epithelium was often found below the esophagogastric junction in
   controls. Conclusions: Adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction
   are associated with short and long segments of Barrett's esophagus.
   Larger cancers probably overgrow and conceal the underlying specialized
   columnar epithelium from which they arise.}},

   that subsequently express resolvase within the host environment, The
   latter subset was recognized as recombinants that had deleted a

Abstract = {{Single crystals of GdNi2B2C have been grown out of Ni2B flux at high
   temperatures. Temperature and field dependent magnetization measurements
   on these crystals show that in low fields (1 kG) there are two phase
   transitions: at 20 K there is a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase
   transition and at 14 K there is another transition which we infer to be
   a spin reorientation transition. The lower temperature transition
   manifests itself clearly in the anisotropic magnetization data, but is
   effectively averaged out in measurements of a powdered sample as well as
   in the polycrystalline average of the anisotropic magnetization data.
   Both of these transitions are also conspicuous in the temperature
   dependent electrical resistivity. GdB2C2 single crystals were also grown

Abstract = {{Head injury associated with bicycle-related crashes is experienced
   disproportionately by children under age 20. Helmets are effective, but
   usage of helmets by children is minimal. This descriptive study,
   conducted in a small academic community with an ordinance requiring
   helmet use by children under 16, examined the views of parents and
   guardians about a bicycle helmet law and reports of helmet use in their
   families. Telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of
   parents/guardians of third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade children (n = 142,
   73\% response rate). Sixty-five percent of those surveyed were aware of
   the ordinance. The vast majority (90\%) agreed that bicycle helmet laws
   are `'a good idea.'' Since the community helmet law was implemented,
   reported child helmet use increased, most notably among children who had
   never worn a helmet before the ordinance. Seventy percent of children
   who had never worn a helmet wore one most or all of the time since the
   ordinance. The ordinance also appears to have prompted parents to make
   helmet use rules for their children. Before the ordinance, families with
   rules reported helmet use by 79\% of youths at least most of the time.
   This figure increased to 86\% in families with rules after the ordinance
   was implemented. Even among the families without rules, helmet use
   increased from 7\% before the ordinance to 60\% after the law was
   enacted, indicating that both the ordinance and family rules are
   influential.}},

Abstract = {{The interpretation of subfossil records of wild plant species with
   respect to both environmental conditions and past vegetation is
   complicated by the following: (1) production and dispersal of plant
   remains including diaspores, (2) the formation of the soil flora, (3)
   taphonomic processes and differential preservation that act on subfossil
   assemblages and (4) methods applied to produce subfossil records.
   Whereas the similarity between recent plant communities and seed banks
   is often weak, the relationship between past vegetation and subfossil
   assemblages is still more complicated. It is therefore unlikely that
   macrofossil assemblages derived from soil samples can be considered as
   pure samples representing particular palaeobiocoenoses. The assumption
   that plant communities, in the past, may have been in some way aberrant
   with respect to composition and that the ecological ranges of species
   varied during the Quaternary has to be rejected, if not based on well
   considered assumptions or evidence from pure samples. Only if a
   sufficient number of suitable studies is available, which enable
   evaluation between all kinds of plant communities and their respective
   seed floras, can progress be made with regard to the reconstruction of
   past vegetation and environmental conditions. As long as these data are
   not available, the ecological interpretation of particular subfossil
   assemblages isolated from soil samples has to be carefully evaluated
   within their particular context.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of the study were to assess whether the epidemiologic
   data support a relation between dietary calcium intake and blood
   pressure, to obtain a quantitative estimate of the difference in blood
   pressure for a given difference in dietary calcium intake, and to assess
   the public health implications. A meta-analysis of published data
   (January 1983 to November 1993) that investigated the association
   between dietary calcium intake and blood pressure in different
   populations around the world was performed. Of 63 population studies
   identified, 23 were suitable for a quantitative overview (total n =
   38,950). Unadjusted regression coefficients (95\% confidence intervals)
   were obtained. Pooled unadjusted regression coefficients (95\%
   confidence intervals) were then computed weighting each individual study
   by the inverse of its variance. Tests of heterogeneity and sensitivity
   analysis were carried out, and the possibility of publication bias was
   assessed. The regression coefficients ranged between -9.40 and 1.63
   mmHg/100 mg calcium for systolic blood pressure and between -4.90 and
   0.47 for diastolic blood pressure. in men (II studies, n = 7,271), the
   pooled regression coefficients were -0.010 and -0.009 mmHg/100 mg
   calcium for systolic and diastolic pressures, respectively (p < 0.001
   and p < 0.05). In women (six studies, n = 8,507), they were -0.15 and
   -0.057 mmHg/100 mg calcium (p < 0.001 and p < 0.02), and in men and
   women combined (six studies, n = 23,172 for systolic pressure and four
   studies, n =3,215 for diastolic pressure) they were -0.061 and -0.061
   mmHg/100 mg calcium (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05). In those studies that used
   the 24-hour recall method, the pooled regression coefficients were -0.06
   and -0.09 mmHg/100 mg calcium (p < 0.005 and p = 0.07), whereas in those
   that used the food frequency questionnaire, they were -0.15 and -0.05
   mmHg/100 mg calcium (p < 0.001 and p < 0.03). These data are consistent
   with an inverse association between dietary calcium intake and blood
   pressure. However, the size of the estimate, the observed heterogeneity
   among studies, and the possibility of confounding and publication bias
   indicate that an increase in calcium intake above the Recommended
   Dietary Allowance is not recommended at population level for the
   prevention and treatment of high blood pressure,}},

Abstract = {{A study has been made of the motion of long bubbles in inclined pipes
   containing viscous Newtonian and non-Newtonian liquids. A
   semi-theoretical expression for the rise velocity of air bubbles in

   momentum exchange of the bubble underflow, i.e. the bubble nose shape.
   The correlation calls on empirical inputs from established literature on
   bubble rise speeds at high Reynolds number. The effects of increasing
   Newtonian viscosity are analysed with reference to the momentum exchange
   and it is shown how viscosity reduces the inclination dependence of the
   bubble Froude number. Results from an experimental survey in seven
   different non-Newtonian liquids in three different diameter pipes are
   presented. These data are correlated so as to decouple the effects of
   surface tension and viscosity. An empirical relation is proposed for the
   effective shear rate in the fluid travelling around the bubble nose. Our
   correlation is compared to literature data from a broad range of
   Reynolds numbers with excellent agreement except at shallow angles.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In this phase II study, the efficacy and tolerability of
   gemcitabine were studied in 44 patients with locally advanced or
   metastatic breast cancer.
   Patients and Methods: Of 40 patients assessable for response, 14 were
   chemotherapy-naive, seven had received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 19 had
   received one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease.
   Gemcitabine was administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once a
   week for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest every 4 weeks. The mean
   number of completed cycles administered was 2.7 and the mean dosage
   delivered was 725 mg/m(2) per injection. Eighty-one percent of doses
   were delivered as scheduled.
   Results: There were three complete responses and seven partial
   responses, for an overall response rate of 25.0\% (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], 12.7\% to 41.2\%). Four patients were not assessable
   for efficacy (one had insufficient therapy, two had no bidimensionally
   measurable disease, and one had neither). All responses were
   independently validated by an external oncology review board. Responses
   were observed early in treatment, with a median time to response of 1.9
   months. The median survival duration for all 40 assessable patients was
   11.5 months. Hematologic toxicity was generally mild, with World Health
   Organization (WHO) grade 3 and 4 leukopenia occurring in 6.8\% and 2.3\%
   of patients and neutropenia in 23.3\% and 7.0\%, of patients,
   respectively. The only other grade 4 toxicities were infection and
   nausea and vomiting in one patient each. One patient was withdrawn due
   to shortness of breath, possibly drug-related. Flu-like symptoms, which
   were mild, transient, and treatable with acetominophen, were reported in
   6.8\% of patients. Only one patient developed alopecia of severity
   greater than WHO grade 2.
   Conclusion: In view of the single-agent activity seen in advanced breast
   cancer, modest toxicity profile, and novel mechanism of action,
   gemcitabine deserves evaluation in breast cancer and is an ideal
   candidate for combination therapy.

   responded (Experiment 1), for 104 msec (Experiment 2), or for 62 msec
   (Experiment 3). Target eccentricity critically affected performance: A
   pronounced eccentricity effect was very similar for all three
   experiments; as eccentricity increased, reaction times and errors
   increased gradually. Furthermore, the set-size effect became more
   pronounced as target eccentricity increased, and the extent of the
   eccentricity effect increased for larger set sizes. In addition,
   according to stepwise regressions, target eccentricity as well as its
   interaction with set size were good predictors of performance. We
   suggest that these findings could be explained by spatial-resolution and
   lateral-inhibition factors. The serial self-terminating hypothesis for
   orientation X color conjunction searches was evaluated and rejected. We
   compared the eccentricity effect as well as the extent of the
   orientation asymmetry in these three conjunction experiments with those
   found in feature experiments (Carrasco \& Katz, 1992). The roles of eye
   movements, spatial resolution, and covert attention in the eccentricity
   effect, as well as their implications, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Subjects performed 9 wk of isokinetic knee extensions twice weekly.
   Albuterol (N = 13) or placebo (N = 9) was administered for 6 wk; groups
   received 16 mg . d(-1) of either treatment. Training consisted of three
   sets of 10 repetitions at 45 degrees . s(-1). Data were collected at
   weeks 0, 6, and 9. Concentric and eccentric variables examined included:
   peak torque (CPT, EPT), total work (CTW, ETW), average power (CAP, EAP),
   time to peak torque (CTTPT, ETTPT), peak torque to body weight ratio
   (CPT/BW, EPT/BW), and work to body weight ratio (CW/BW, EW/BW). Other
   variables included: thigh circumference (CIRC), thigh cross-sectional
   area (CSA), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume
   (FEV(1)). MANOVA and the Dunn-Bonferroni post-hoc found differences
   within groups for CPT, CTW, CAP, CPT/BW, EFT, ETTPT, and CSA.
   Interactions were noted for CW/BW, ETW, EAF, EPT/BW, and ETW/BW; with
   persons administered albuterol yielding superior values. CW/BW, ETW, and
   EAP showed interactions at post-testing, while EPT/BW and EW/BW
   interacted at both midtesting and post-testing. Results indicate
   therapeutic doses of albuterol administered with resistance exercise may
   augment strength gains.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, a method for the accurate quantitative
   determination of net proton production or consumption in biological
   cultures has been devised. Cells are cultured under constant pH
   conditions. The specific rate of proton production or consumption by the
   culture (qH(+), mmol h(-1) per g biomass) is proportional to the mmol of
   base or acid required to maintain constant pH per unit time, and this
   equivalence is independent of the buffering capacity of the culture
   medium.
   The above method has been applied to chemostat cultures of Candida
   utilis growing on glucose or glycerol as carbon source, and different
   nitrogen sources. The results indicate that the nitrogen assimilation
   pathway alone determines the value of qH(+), and a fixed stoichiometric
   relationship between nitrogen uptake rate qN (meg h(-1) per g biomass)
   and qH(+) has been found for each nitrogen source employed. Thus,
   qH(+)/qN values of +1, 0 and -1 were found for ammonium ions, urea and
   nitrate respectively. Under oxidative metabolism, the contribution of
   carbon catabolism to the value of qH(+) was undetectable.
   Since qN may be related to growth and production of type 1 compounds in
   fermentation processes, the parameter qH(+) was incorporated into a
   model of growth and energy metabolism in chemostat culture (Castrillo
   and Ugalde, Yeast 10, 185-197, 1994), resulting in adequate simulations
   of experimentally observed culture performance. Thus, it is suggested
   that qH(+) may be employed as a simple and effective control parameter
   for biotechnological processes involving biomass-related products.}},

   length is a physical gauge-invariant quantity. We put out a simple
   relation between the penetration length and the square root of the

Abstract = {{Changes in tension of slow motor units in the medial gastrocnemius
   muscle of the rat were measured and compared in three fatigue tests,
   each of 4 min duration. In one of these tests motor unit tetani were
   evoked by repeated trains of stimuli of the standard frequency, 40 Hz,
   while in other tests frequencies of 20 and 60 Hz were used. Tetanic
   tension initially decreased in the majority of units during these three
   tests, then potentiated and, in the last part of the fatigue test, the
   tension was normally stable. Initial changes in tension were greatest in
   the fatigue tests with the lowest stimulation frequency (20 Hz) and
   smallest or even absent during tests with the stimulation frequency of
   60 Hz. Moreover, initial changes in tension occurred for the longest
   period of time when the lowest frequency of stimulation (20 Hz) was
   used. Some of the motor units showed a slow decrease in tension in the
   last part of tests, especially when frequencies of 60 and 40 Hz were
   used. These results show that the tension of repeated unfused tetani of
   a slow motor unit is not constant, even during constant frequency
   stimulation, and changes in tension are greater in less fused tetani.}},

   despite some distortion of particles during specimen preparation and
   viewing in the microscope, the images obtained by cryo-HRSEM exhibited a
   level of interpretable detail not routinely achieved by other methods
   without image averaging. Cryo-HRSEM images of discrete reovirus
   particles were used to characterize and confirm features of the outer
   protein capsid of this virus by comparison with image reconstructions
   previously derived from cryotransmission electron microscopy. Distinct
   surface features attributable to each of the four outer-capsid proteins
   were identified. In addition, cryo-HRSEM images confirmed that
   significant changes occur on the surfaces of individual reovirus
   particles during disassembly and entry of cells and that the reovirus
   outer capsid is organized as a left-handed T=13 icosahedron. Several
   unique capabilities and potential uses suggest that cryo-HRSEM has a

Abstract = {{Andalusite-bearing veins formed during contact metamorphism in the
   aureole of the Vedrette di Ries tonalite. In the veins, quartz crystals
   that are completely armoured by andalusite or that occur in strain
   shadow areas contain three generations of fluid inclusions: low-salinity
   H2O-CO2-CH4 mixtures with CH4/(CO2 + CH4) less than or equal to 0.35
   (type A); low-salinity aqueous fluids (type B); H2O-free, CO2-CH4 fluids
   with the same carbonic speciation as A (type C). Carbonic types A and C
   typically have a dark appearance, which is attributed to graphite
   coatings on inclusion walls. Microstructural analysis of the host quartz
   and calculated densities indicate that type A inclusions were likely
   trapped during vein formation. These inclusions underwent
   strain-assisted re-equilibration during cooling that resulted in density
   increases without change of composition. After the rocks had cooled
   below about 350 degrees C, type C inclusions appear to have formed from
   one of the immiscible fractions after unmixing of the H2O-CO2-CH4 fluid
   mixtures. Aqueous type B inclusions, apparently trapped between 225 and
   350 degrees C; cold represent an independent fluid, or could be the
   H2O-rich fraction of unmixed type A fluids. Taking account of the
   uncertainties, the composition and density of the complex type A
   inclusion fluids are in good agreement with the properties of primary
   fluids calculated from the petrological data. The fluid inclusion data
   support the model of vein formation by hydrofracturing as a result of
   dehydration of graphitic metapelites. These new results also demonstrate
   the importance of considering strain in the interpretation of
   metamorphic fluid inclusions.}},

Abstract = {{During equiaxed dendritic solidification, dendritic grains form at the
   point where primary dendritic crystals become coherent (or impinge on

   gain size in the alloys is proposed, using thermal and constitutional
   parameters, and the parameters at the dendrite coherency point. For an
   alloy with a solute concentration below the solid solubility limit, the
   grain size is inversely proportional to (dT/dt)(1/2) Sigma
   m(i)C(oi)(k(i) - 1) and the coherency parameters (T is the temperature,
   t is the time, m is the liquid line slope, C-o is the original solute
   concentration, k is the solute distribution, and subscript i is the ith
   alloying element). For an alloy with a solute concentration above the
   solid solubility limit, the grain size can be calculated using the
   dendritic growth interval Sigma k(i)(T-Li - T-eui), where T-L and T-eu
   are the liquidus and eutectic temperatures, respectively, instead of the
   dendritic restriction factor Sigma m(i) C-oi(k(i) - 1). For commercial

Abstract = {{Laboratory and field feeding experiments were conducted to assess the
   palatability to predatory reef fish of prepared foods containing natural
   concentrations of glass spicules from 8 species of Caribbean reef
   sponges. Sponge species with high concentrations of spicules in their
   tissues, and with variable spicule morphologies, were chosen for the
   experiments. The presence of spicules did not alter food palatability
   relative to controls for any of the sponges tested. Analyses of ash
   content, tensile strength, protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content, and
   total energy content were conducted on tissue samples from 71 species of
   Caribbean demosponges from reef, mangrove, and grassbed habitats, and
   compared to previously reported data on the chemical defenses of the
   same species. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that
   sponge species with palatable extracts have higher concentrations of
   inorganic structural elements, as measured by the mean ash content of
   their tissues. In addition, the tissues of palatable sponges were not
   different from those of chemically deterrent species with regard to mean
   tensile strength, protein content, carbohydrate content, and total
   energy content, but the tissues of chemically defended species did have
   a higher mean lipid content than those of palatable species. Sponges
   that lack chemical antipredatory defenses do not appear to compensate
   with structural or nutritional defenses, but may instead direct energy
   otherwise used for the production and storage of secondary metabolites
   to increased growth and reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolism of equilin sulfate was determined in female dogs
   receiving 2.5 mg/kg of {[}H-3]equilin sulfate alone or in a preparation
   that contained all the components that are present in the conjugated
   equine estrogen product Premarin(R). The pharmacokinetic parameters of
   total radioactivity indicated that the drug is rapidly absorbed and it
   has a moderate half-life in plasma. The total radioactivity in plasma
   following administration of {[}H-3]equilin sulfate as part of a mixture
   of conjugated equine estrogens had significantly lower peak
   concentration (C-max), a lower area under the curve (AUC), a longer
   terminal half-life (t(1/2)) and a longer mean residence time (MRT) than
   when {[}H-3]equilin sulfate was given alone, indicating that the other
   components in the conjugated equine estrogen preparation altered the
   pharmacokinetics of equilin sulfate. An average of 26.7 +/- 4.4\% of the
   administered radioactive dose was excreted in urine of dogs receiving
   {[}H-3]equilin sulfate. Again, a significantly lower percentage (21.4
   +/- 6.3\%, P = 0.023) was eliminated in urine of dogs receiving
   {[}H-3]equilin sulfate in the conjugated equine estrogen preparation,
   indicating that the absorption of equilin sulfate was perhaps altered by
   the other components in the conjugated equine estrogen preparation.
   Metabolite profiles of plasma and urine were similar. Equilin,
   equilenin, 17 beta-dihydroequilenin, 17 beta-dihydroequilin, 17
   alpha-dihydroequilenin and 17 alpha-dihydroequilin were present in both
   matrices. 17 beta-Dihydroequilin and equilin were the two major
   chromatographic peaks in plasma samples. 17 beta-Dihydroequilenin and 17
   beta-dihydroequilin were the major metabolites in urine. In conclusion,
   following oral administration of {[}H-3]equilin sulfate to dogs, the
   radioactivity is rapidly absorbed. The disposition of equilin sulfate is
   altered by the other components that are present in the conjugated
   equine estrogen preparation Premarin(R). The reduction of the 17-keto
   group and aromatization of ring-B are the major metabolic pathways of
   equilin in the dog.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses thermodynamics of phase-change storage elements in
   series with heat engines. It is assumed that the duration of the heat
   storage and the discharge are equal. It is also assumed that the same
   hear transfer fluid (HTF) with a constant flow rate is used for the
   whole cycle. The major constraint imposed on these systems is the
   stability of the temperature of the HTF supplied to the engine during
   the storage-discharge cycle. It is shown, for this setup, that the
   freezing point of the phase-change material (PCM) is defined by the
   First Law. Maximal stability corresponds to the freezing point equal to
   the arithmetic mean of the inlet temperatures of the hot and the cold
   streams, An analytic expression is developed for the Second Law
   efficiency of the heat storage-removal cycle for the phase-change
   element in series with an engine. It yields maximal entropy production
   in the absolute stability limit. Two analytically tractable models of a
   phase-change storage in series with a heat engine are studied in detail.
   One involves a PCM slab, and the second involves a PCM tube-and-shell
   heat exchanger.}},

Abstract = {{Hematologic toxicity of carboplatin is largely dependent on its
   pharmacokinetics. Its seems likely that therapeutic efficacy is also
   related to plasma drug exposure. Dosage adjustments based on isotopic
   determination of glomerular filtration rate have been proposed but their
   ambulatory use is not conceivable. A population pharmacokinetic study
   was undertaken to determine a relationship between patient
   characteristics and carboplatin clearance. Plasma carboplatin
   pharmacokinetics were determined as ultrafilterable platinum in 70
   patients (23 to 84 years old) treated with different combination
   regimens including carboplatin at doses ranging from 184 to 950 mg (1-hr
   iv infusion) for various tumor types. Data were analysed using Nonlinear
   Mixed Effects Model (NONMEM). The data from 34 patients (46 cycles) were
   used to obtain the most predictive formula for the carboplatin clearance
   (ml/min):
   0.134 weight + 218 weight (1 -0.00457 x age) (1 -0.314 sex)/
   creatinine(mu M)
   The obtained formula was prospectively evaluated with the data from 36
   other patients (43 cycles) and compared to other methods available to
   predict carboplatin clearance. Prospectively this formula predicted the
   clearance with a good precision (median absolute percent error of 10\%
   range 0-30\%) and minimal bias (median percent error: 2\% range
   -25-30\%). This method of prediction was as accurate as the one which
   requires the glomerular filtration rate to be measured by 51Cr-EDTA
   injection. This formula should allow to individualize very easily the
   carboplatin dosage in adults by multiplying the calculated carboplatin
   clearance by the area under the curve desired for administration {[}J

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism for higher
   pregnancy rates in oocyte recipients by comparing the pregnancy rates
   following fresh and frozen embryo transfers in a shared oocyte
   programme, A prospective study was carried out of 135 matched pairs of
   donors and recipients who equally share the donors' pool of oocytes,
   Recipients were subclassified by ovarian function: 69 were in ovarian
   failure and 66 retained ovarian function, A total of 474 standard
   in-vitro fertilization cycles using the same ovarian stimulation
   protocol as the donors were also evaluated, The main outcome measures
   were the clinical pregnancy and implantation rates for donors and
   recipients following fresh and frozen embryo transfers, The clinical
   pregnancy rates per transfer for fresh embryo transfers were 17.5\% for
   donors, 20.4\% for recipients with ovarian function and 46.3\% for
   recipients in ovarian failure (P < 0.05), The pregnancy rates for frozen
   embryo transfers were 15.3\% for donors, 17.2\% for recipients with
   ovarian function and 23.8\% for recipients in ovarian failure (not
   significantly different), The implantation rates for fresh transfers
   were 7.5\% for donors, 8.6\% for recipients with ovarian function and
   15.6\% for recipients in ovarian failure (P < 0.05); for frozen cycles,
   the implantation rates were 5.1, 5.2 and 7.1\% respectively (not
   significantly different). When classified by age and ovarian function,
   the clinical pregnancy rates per transfer for recipients with ovarian
   function were 14.0\% for those aged greater than or equal to 40 and
   22.2\% for those aged <40 years, For recipients in ovarian failure, the
   pregnancy rates were 33.3\% for the older group of women and 39.4\% for
   the younger group, A logistic regression analysis found that ovarian
   function was the only factor to have an independent effect on outcome,
   The demonstration of higher pregnancy and implantation rates in
   recipients versus donors following fresh embryo transfer, despite the
   use of a common pool of oocytes, strongly suggests that the well-known
   higher fecundity found in recipients is not predominantly related to the
   use of better quality oocytes. The demonstration of an implantation rate
   twice as high following fresh versus frozen embryo transfer in
   recipients with ovarian failure suggests that the frozen embryo Is not
   as hardy as the fresh embryo, Thus, the fact that both the pregnancy and
   implantation rates in donors were the same with fresh versus frozen
   embryo transfer suggests that the ovarian stimulation regimen has a
   negative effect on outcome, However, the clear demonstration of higher
   pregnancy rates in recipients with ovarian failure compared with those
   with ovarian function suggests that, in addition, these higher rates may
   be linked to a superior uterine environment in patients with ovarian
   failure, Alternatively, the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone
   agonists may have a negative effect on implantation in patients with
   ovarian function.}},

Abstract = {{Subjects made a horizontal or vertical saccade in response to a

   the detection of light targets at extrafoveal locations was modulated by
   the intention to make the saccade insofar as RT to targets presented at
   the saccadic goal location or in the hemifield containing that location
   was faster than RT to targets presented at the opposite,
   mirror-symmetric location. This RT difference was maximal prior to the
   beginning of the saccade and vanished after saccade termination,
   indicating that the effect was caused by the neural activity leading to
   the saccade rather than to the eye movement or the eye position per se.
   The results have implications for the understanding of the relations

   regard to inhibitory phenomena arising from the non-correspondence

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new genetic approach for solving the economic
   dispatch problem in large-scale systems. A new encoding technique is
   developed. The chromosome contains only an encoding of the normalized
   system incremental cost in this encoding technique. Therefore, the total
   number of bits of chromosome is entirely independent of the number of
   units. The salient feature makes the proposed genetic approach
   attractive in large and complex systems which other methodologies may
   fail to achieve. Moreover, the approach can take network losses, ramp
   rate limits, and prohibited zone avoidance into account because of
   genetic algorithm's flexibility. Numerical results on an actual utility
   system of up to 40 units show that the proposed approach is faster and
   more robust than the well-known lambda-iteration method in large-scale
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical management of the sacral defect using the gluteal muscle or
   musculocutaneous flap has been well accepted over the years. In this
   study, refinements in the bilateral gluteus maximus V-Y advancement
   musculocutaneous flaps were made, These refinements include having
   sharper angle (60 degrees or less) at the donor sites of the flap,
   cutting the edges of the gluteal muscle of 3 cm beyond the skin flap,
   and cutting most parts of the gluteal muscle at a depth of only 2.5 cm
   (at the level of upper third portion). These improvements result in less
   tension closure of the donor site, easier closure of the advanced flaps
   in two planes without tension, and better preservation of most parts of
   the gluteal muscular insertions to the femur and their functions. The
   design of V-Y advancement has successfully maintained the superior and
   inferior gluteal vessels and inferior gluteal nerve. In this study, the
   average sacral defect was more than 12 cm in diameter, and each advanced
   flap was 15 x 12 x 3 cm in size. Of the 63 consecutive patients
   undergoing bilateral gluteus maximus V-Y advancement musculocutaneous
   flaps with refinements for coverage of large sacral pressure sores, 59
   (93\%) achieved complete healing after an average follow-up period of 28
   months. Only 4 patients had recurrences of sacral sore, In this study,
   the duration of hospital stay for flap coverage averaged 38.5 days. Four
   patients (6\%) had superficial dehiscences of the donor site requiring
   skin grafting. Ten patients (16\%) developed stitch abscesses and 9
   patients (14\%) had wound infections, but no flap was lost. No
   significant functional impairment related to the flap procedure was
   noted, The operative technique described in this paper is not only
   simple and noninvasive, but with our refinements of flap design, the
   bilateral gluteus maximus V-Y advancement musculocutaneous flaps also
   provide reliable and durable coverage for large sacral pressure sores.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of genetic factors to blood pressure levels is well
   established. The contribution of genes to the longitudinal change in
   blood pressure has been less well studied, because of the lack of
   longitudinal family data. The present study investigated a possible
   major-gene effect on the observed increase with age in diastolic blood
   pressure (DBP) levels. Subjects included 965 unmedicated adults (age
   greater than or equal to 18 years) in 73 pedigrees collected in Utah as
   part of a longitudinal cardiovascular family study. Segregation analysis
   of DBP change over 7.2 years of follow-up identified a recessive
   major-gene effect with a gene frequency of p = .23. There was also a
   significant age effect on the genotypic means, which decreased
   expression of the major gene at older ages. For those inferred to have
   the genotype responsible for large DBP increases, DBP increased 32.3\%,
   compared with a 1.5\% increase in the nonsusceptible group (P < .0001).
   The relative risk of developing hypertension between the susceptible and
   nonsusceptible groups after 7.2 years was 2.4 (P = .006). Baseline DBP
   reactivities to mental arithmetic (P < .0001), and isometric handgrip (P
   < .0001) stress tests were greatest in those assigned to the susceptible
   genotype. We conclude that age-related changes in DBP are influenced by
   a major gene. Characteristics of this major-gene effect for greater
   age-related blood pressure increases include greater reactivity to
   mental and physical stressors. The present study thus provides evidence
   for genetic control of changes in blood pressure, in addition to the
   previously suggested genetic control of absolute blood pressure level.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers a preliminary analysis of the relationship between
   ethnic politics and party politics in Taiwan as manifested in the 1994
   mayoral and gubernatorial elections. Irt has been argued that the role
   of ethnicity was a contributing factor in the democratization of Taiwan
   as a multiethnic society. However, Taiwan is an ethnically segmented
   rather than ethnically divided society. Vague ethnic lines and weak
   interethnic hostility are cited as distinctive features of Taiwan's
   ethnic relations. Nevertheless, indigenization policies have paralleled
   the development and mobilization of the mainlanders' sense of crisis
   leading to the emergence of defensive ethnic voting in the 1994
   elections. Though Taiwan's ethnic voting and ethnic political parties
   are emerging at a relatively slow pace, the author warns against the
   negative effects of polarized ethnic politics and also analyzes
   alternative solutions to avoid these problems.}},

Abstract = {{Representative kaolinite and/or halloysite bearing-bentonites from Miles
   island, Greece were examined in order to establish the possible
   relationships holding between smectite and kaolinite/halloysite. The
   data suggest that kaolinite and halloysite have been formed at the
   expense of smectite. The replacement of smectite by kaolinite/halloysite
   rejects the possibility for precipitation of the two minerals during the
   same geological event. The proposed mechanisms for kaolinite/halloysite
   formation involve: a) dissolution of smectite and neoformation of
   kaolinite/halloysite, and b) precipitation of kaolinite as a by-product
   of solid state transformation of smectite with higher layer charge to
   one with lower layer charge, which is triggered by supply of Si. The
   dissolution mechanism involves provision of H+ i.e. acidic pH. On the
   contrary the role of pH does not seem to be important in the solid state
   transformation mechanism. Cheto and Wyoming montmorillonites dissolve at
   a similar pH while beidellite is more susceptible to acidic condition
   than montmorillonite, dissolving at a higher pH.}},

Abstract = {{Passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974 and its Amendments in
   1986 (SDWAA) is changing the way water is treated and delivered in the
   United States. Under the SDWAA the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA) is required to regulate chemical contaminants and pathogenic
   microorganisms in drinking water. Emphasis has shifted from a primary
   concern with treated drinking water to attainment of standards at the
   point of consumption. Two regulations promulgated under the SDWAA, the
   Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR) and the Total Coliform Rule (TCR)
   specify treatment and monitoring requirements that must be met by all
   public water suppliers. This paper will examine the effect of various
   system variables on chlorine residual propagation. A recently proposed
   model (EPANET) will be utilized to examine the extent of fluid velocity
   and pipe radius on chlorine demand. The effect of these variables on the
   maintenance of chlorine residuals will be demonstrated. It will be shown
   that the same variables that affect the propagation of chlorine residual

   pairs of regions, which are all logically defined from two primitive
   (but axiomatized) notions. The first primitive is the notion of two
   regions being connected, which allows eight jointly exhaustive and
   pairwise disjoint relations to be defined. The second primitive is the
   convex hull of a region which allows many more relations to be defined.
   We also consider the development of the useful notions of composition
   tables for the defined relations and networks specifying continuous
   transitions between pairs of regions. We conclude by discussing what
   kind of criteria to apply when deciding how fine grained a taxonomy to
   create. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{In the gerbil, brief global forebrain ischemia induces profound
   habituation and working memory impairments that stem from delayed
   hippocampal CA1 death, Short duration postischemic hypothermia has been
   shown to reduce CA1 loss, but such reports are controversial, as it is
   thought that protection may be transient. The purpose of this study was
   to investigate whether prolonged postischemic hypothermia provided
   long-term CA1 and functional neuroprotection.
   Previously, 90\% of anterior CA1 neurons were rescued (30 d survival)
   when 24 hr of hypothermia (32 degrees C) was induced 1 hr following a 5
   min occlusion that otherwise produced more than 95\% loss (Colbourne and
   Corbett, 1994). We now find about 70\% CA1 savings with this same
   hypothermic treatment in gerbils that survived for 6 months
   postischemia. While this is a significant reduction from 30 day survival
   (medial CA1 only), it nonetheless shows, for the first time, persistent,
   if not permanent neuroprotection, especially in middle and lateral CA1,
   In addition, in nontreated animals, ischemia impaired learning in an
   open field and T-maze for up to 6 months. Postischemic hypothermia
   significantly reduced these deficits, Hypothermia (32 degrees), when
   initiated 4 hr after ischemia, rescued approximate to 12\% of CA1
   neurons at 6 months with a slight behavioral benefit. Milder hypothermia
   (34 degrees C, 1-25 hr postischemia, 30 d survival) also reduced
   habituation impairments and saved approximate to 60\% of CA1 neurons.
   Similar trends were found at more caudal CA1 levels.
   These results clearly show that postischemic hypothermia provides
   effective and long-lasting neuroprotection, which depends upon the delay
   to initiation, duration, and degree of cooling and survival time. The
   protracted functional and histological benefit observed justifies
   further basic and clinical investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system demyelinating disease.
   Significant evidence, including similarities with its animal model,
   experimental autoimmmune encephalomyelitis, supports an autoimmune
   mechanism, activated by putative environmental factors in genetically
   predisposed individuals. Genetic factors strongly influence the
   susceptibility to demyelinating diseases in humans and rodents.
   Understanding the mechanisms governing susceptibility versus resistance
   may help to identify individuals at risk or design therapeutic
   strategies. The hypothesis formulated here is based on the observation
   that resistance to multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune
   encephalomyelitis is associated with dark skin pigmentation. While this
   may signify a protective role for melanin against environmental factors
   producing oxidative damage, the mechanism postulated here is that
   susceptibility to autoimmune demyelination is influenced by hormonal
   factors, i.e. the neurohormones melatonin and melanocyte stimulating
   hormone, which have opposing effects on immune functions and, at the
   same time, are important determinants of the individual's production of
   melanin.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Greer DermaPIK is a plastic disposable device used for
   epicutaneous allergy skin testing. Various methods have been proposed
   for applying this device. The recommended methods are to use it as
   either a punch or scratch device. A third method- the prick, uses the
   device similarly to standard prick testing with the bifurcated needle.
   Objective: To compare three methods of using the DermaPIK for
   epicutaneous skin testing with the bifurcated needle,
   Methods: Twenty volunteers with a mean age of 30 years (range 6 to 45)
   were skin tested using saline and histamine. Each test was done in
   triplicate on the back. Discomfort for each technique was rated on a
   scale from 0 to 100. Wheal and erythema were measured at 15 minutes and
   a photograph was taken.
   Results: The scratch method was rated highest in discomfort. The mean
   coefficient of variation for the punch method was 39.2\% for erythema
   which was significantly higher than for the other methods (P < .0001).
   The scratch method had a mean wheal and erythema to saline of 3.85 +/-
   1.3 and 6.23 +/- 2.2 that was significantly larger than the other
   methods (P < .001). There was no difference between the prick method and
   the bifurcated needle for discomfort or size of wheal/erythema to saline
   or histamine.
   Conclusions: The punch method is too imprecise and the scratch method
   produces considerable dermatographism. The prick method was comparable
   to the bifurcated needle in discomfort, sensitivity and precision.}},

   units (L = Br and O), in which the Ta-6 cluster is very distorted, are
   linked together by four bridging bromines to form pseudo-helices of
   units. The lutetium is five-coordinated at a small site formed by three
   oxygen and two bromine atoms belonging to three adjacent units. The
   formula developed for this compound is
   Lu((Ta6Br9O3i)-O-i)(Br2Br4/2a-a)-Br-a. These structural results allow

Abstract = {{Shoulder impingement syndrome, a common disorder directly related to the
   unique anatomy, mobility, and biomechanics oi the shoulder girdle
   complex, is a condition that results from repetitive microtrauma to the
   structures within the subacromial space, primarily the supraspinatus,
   the long head oi the biceps, and the subacromial bursa. Several factors
   contribute to shoulder impingement syndrome, including rotator cuff
   weakness, capsular tightness, poor scapulohumeral rhythm, and muscle
   imbalance oi the scapular upward rotation force couple. This article
   briefly reviews the biomechanics of the shoulder girdle complex and the
   pathology of shoulder impingement syndrome. The author introduces an
   adjunctive assessment procedure that assists the clinician in isolating
   the primary tissue and the structures involved with shoulder impingement
   syndrome. Conservative treatment management can then be directed to the
   involved contractile and/or noncontractile tissue involved with shoulder
   impingement syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the prognostic value of tumor angiogenesis in node negative
   breast cancer (NNBC). Paraffin-embedded tissues from 87 patients: with
   NNBC were immunostained for factor VIII-related antigen, using one
   tissue block representative of the invasive edge of the tumor. Sections
   were scanned at low power to identify `'hotspots'' of angiogenesis.
   Microvessel (MV) counts were performed at X200 magnification, using a
   grid eyepiece graticule. Within each hot spot, three fields (area of
   field = 0.22 mm(2)) were counted and averaged. The highest average for a
   hot spot and the highest single held value was recorded for each case.
   Patients were stratified into low and high MV groups and their survival
   compared. There were no differences in disease-free or overall survival
   between the two groups whether the highest average or the highest single
   value was used. Microvessel counts did not correlate with other
   prognostic features, ie, grade, size, estrogen receptor status, c-erb
   B-2 or accumulated P53 status. Because of the difficulty in assessing
   angiogenesis that is heterogenous throughout tumors, MV counting may not
   be suitable for clinical use as a prognostic factor in NNBC. This
   problem could be addressed in a prospective study involving more
   extensive tumor sampling. HUM PATHOL 26:1181-1184. Copyright (C) 1995 by

   We show that proton-induced changes in HIR single-channel conductance
   underlie the HIR pH sensitivity seen on the macroscopic level. We used
   chimeric and mutant channels to localize the molecular determinant of
   HIR pH sensitivity to a single residue, H117, in the M1-to-H5 linker
   region. This residue provides a molecular context that allows a
   titratable group to influence pore properties. We present evidence that
   this titratable group is one of two cysteines located in the M1-to-H5

Abstract = {{The purpose of this review is to provide a biochemical characterization
   of recombinant prourokinase (r-ProUK {[}ABT-187]), including a
   description of its clot-specific fibrinolytic mechanism, In addition,
   the preclinical data will be briefly reviewed, demonstrating the
   efficacy of r-ProUK as a potent therapeutic plasminogen activator,
   r-ProUK was purified to homogeneity from the culture medium of SP2/0
   mouse hybridoma cells, The fibrinolytic potency of r-ProUK was
   characterized by both in vitro clot lysis experiments in human plasma
   and a canine femoral artery thrombosis model, In the in vitro clot lysis
   system, with use of clots prepared from fresh frozen human plasma,
   r-ProUK exhibits a lag phase to the onset of lysis and a
   concentration-dependent threshold effect due to the presence of the
   inhibitors alpha(2)-antiplasmin and plasminogen activator inhibitor
   (PAI-1). Effective clot lysis can be achieved without degradation of the
   fibrinogen in the surrounding plasma, Over a dose range of
   50,000-220,000 IU,the canine femoral artery thrombosis model shows a
   dose-dependent relationship for r-ProUK and effective clot lysis, The
   lyric activity of r-ProUK is significantly enhanced in this model by the
   concomitant administration of heparin as an adjunctive agent for
   thrombolytic treatment, Fibrinogen, plasminogen, and
   alpha(2)-antiplasmin levels in the systemic circulation were unaltered
   during the 30-minute infusion period and a 4-hour observation period, in
   which 85\% lysis was achieved with r-ProUK (100,000 TCT) and heparin,
   Moreover, restoration of blood flow in the previously fully occluded
   femoral artery was achieved within minutes of the start of the r-ProUK
   infusion, The experimental findings presented here are consistent with
   the clot-specific fibrinolytic mechanism of r-ProUK, Effective clot
   lysis can be achieved without alteration of the systemic coagulation and
   fibrinolytic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating antibodies from human and murine chagasic sera are able to
   interact with myocardium, activating neurotransmitter receptors, Here,
   we studied the effects of a monoclonal antibody (Mab CAK20.12), which
   recognizes a 150 kilodalton antigen of Trypanosoma cruzi and reacts with
   normal human and murine striated muscles and with cardiac tissue, The
   MAb CAK20.12 binds to purified cardiac membranes and interferes with the
   binding of beta-adrenergic receptor radioligand ({[}I-125]CYP) and
   muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR) radioligand ({[}H-3]QNB) in a
   noncompetitive way, As a consequence of this interaction,
   beta-adrenergic receptor and mAChR were activated, leading to increased
   intracellular levels of cyclic AMP as a result of beta-adrenergic
   receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase triggering, When its sympathetic
   action was abrogated, it also induced an mAChR-mediated increase in
   cyclic GMP. Furthermore, cardiac physiology was modified by MAb
   CAK20.12, as it was able to increase cardiac contractility through
   beta-adrenoceptor activation and to decrease atrial frequency as a
   result of mAChR activation, The fact that this MAb modalates and
   modifies the mechanical and biochemical activity of normal murine heart
   established an important basis for future research and understanding of
   how the host's humoral immune response acts on the course and
   development of the chronic chagasic myocardiopathy.}},

   stents. They were 33 to 86 years old, 55\% being 70 years or older.
   Twenty patients were male. Twenty patients (65\%) had squamous cell
   carcinoma, 10 (32\%) had adenocarcinoma and one (3\%) had
   undifferentiated carcinoma. Twenty-five patients (81\%) required
   prestenting dilatation with balloons, bougies or laser. Stent
   implantation was successful in 30 patients (97\%) but failed in one. Two
   patients had minor complications and one patient with advanced disease
   died in the hospital one week after the procedure. All stented patients
   experienced significant short-term relief of dysphagia. Twenty-two
   patients (73\%) were seen at least once after discharge in a follow-up
   visit. Twenty (66\%) were still swallowing satisfactorily when last seen
   four to 32 weeks after stenting. We conclude that the new nitinol stent

Abstract = {{Objective. To evaluate the HCV genotype distribution in subjects
   affected by cryoglobulinemia in order to verify, its possible role in
   the pathogenesis of the disease and to provide the clinician with a
   useful datum for therapy.
   Methods. Nested PCR with universal and type-specific primers was used
   for the genotyping.
   Results. Genotype I (1a) was never present in cryoglobulinemia, while it
   was present in 7 (4.3\%) patients with chronic hepatopathy and in 4
   (10.8\%) asymptomatic patients. Type II (1b) was present in 28 (58.3\%)
   and in 8 (47.1\%) cryoglobulinemic patients with and without
   hepatopathy, respectively; in 106 (64.6\%) patients with chronic
   hepatitis; in one patient with acute hepatitis; and in 14 (37.9\%)
   asymptomatic patients. Type III (2a) was present in 2 (4.2\%) and 2
   (11.8\%) cryoglobulinemic patients with and without hepatopathy,
   respectively; in 1 (0.6\%) patient with chronic hepatopathy; and in 2
   (5.4\%) asymptomatic subjects. Type IV (2b) was present in 1 (2.1\%) and
   in 2 (11.8\%) cryoglobulinemic patients with and without hepatopathy,
   respectively; in 5 (3\%) patients with chronic hepatopathy; and in 1
   (2.7\%) asymptomatic subject. Coinfections were present in 42 cases: 6
   (12.5\%) cryoglobulinemia with hepatopathy, 4 (23.5\%) cryoglobulinemia
   without hepatopathy, 25 (15.3\%) chronic hepatopathy, and in 7 (18.9\%)
   asymptomatic subjects. For 41 (15.4\%) strains typing was not possible.
   Eight of the `'untypable'' strains and 3 strains from patients with
   coinfection proved to belong to a new genotype.
   Conclusions. Genotype II (1b) was the most frequent in patients with and
   without cryoglobulinemia; genotype I (1a) was absent in all 65 patients
   with cryoglobulinemia, in whom however, as in the subjects without
   cryoglobulinemia, all the other genotypes could be found An
   interferon-resistant genotype characterized by an elevated homology with
   Simmonds' type 2c (rare genotype) was present.}},

Abstract = {{Background Cardiac catheterization is the only practical method of
   assessing internal mammary artery graft patency. A noninvasive method
   would be useful in patients with recurrence of anginal symptoms after
   coronary artery bypass graft surgery. We hypothesized that transthoracic
   echocardiography could provide information on blood velocity and anatomy
   and therefore has the potential to allow measurement of blood flow.
   Methods and Results High-frequency (5 MHz) transthoracic
   echocardiography was performed on 41 consecutive patients (mean age,
   67+/-6 years) who had had left internal mammary artery grafts to the
   left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and were undergoing
   coronary angiography because of recurrence of anginal symptoms. The
   results were compared with those from 19 patients (mean age, 58+/-11
   years) in whom an ungrafted left internal mammary artery was assessed
   and with those from 15 patients (mean age, 61+/-12 years) who had
   angiographically normal coronary arteries in whom the LAD was studied.
   Doppler velocity profiles of the left internal mammary graft were
   obtained in 35 of the 41 study patients (81\%). In all cases, a biphasic
   pattern of blood flow was recorded that corresponded to systole and
   diastole. Two different flow patterns were observed. In 25 patients with
   a normal graft or moderate (<70\%) stenosis (group A), blood flow
   velocity was maximal during diastole. This pattern was also seen in the
   LAD control group. In 10 patients with severe (>70\%) graft stenosis
   (group B), blood velocity was maximal during systole, and low velocities
   were recorded during diastole. This pattern was also seen in the
   ungrafted internal mammary artery control group. The diastolic fraction
   of the velocity lime integrals for group A was 0.77+/-0.07, and for
   group B was 0.27+/-0.01 (P<.05). A diastolic velocity time integral
   fraction <0.5 predicted severe stenosis with a sensitivity and
   specificity of 100\%. The ratio of systolic-to-diastolic peak velocities
   for group A was 0.54+/-0.26 and for group B was 3.45+/-0.74 (P<.05). A
   systolic-to-diastolic peak velocity ratio >1 predicted severe stenosis
   with a sensitivity of 100\% and specificity of 85\%. Mean graft blood
   flow was 63+/-21 mL/min. There was no significant difference in mean
   blood flow between any of the patient groups studied.
   Conclusions High-frequency transthoracic echocardiography allows
   identification of the left internal mammary grafts and measurement of
   blood flow. Compared with patent grafts or those with moderate lesions,
   severe stenoses demonstrated different Doppler velocity patterns. Use of
   this technique may allow noninvasive detection of significant stenoses
   of the left internal mammary artery graft.}},

Abstract = {{Local release of mitogenic and chemotactic signals during
   angioplasty-induced vascular injury may initiate restenosis. We
   investigated whether mechanical injury to vascular smooth muscle cells
   (VSMC) results in the release of biologically active peptide growth
   factors. Monolayers of bovine SMC cultures were mechanically injured by
   cell scraping. Conditioned medium (CM) from control and injured SMC
   cultures was collected, and the mitogenic activity was measured by
   {[}H-3]thymidine incorporation in recipient SMC cultures. Mitogenic
   activity from injured CM was detected within 15 min after injury. When
   the CM from injured cells was removed 15 min after injury and replaced
   with serum-free media, there was no detectabe mitogenic activity in the
   replacement CM assessed 1-6 days postinjury. Suramin, a nonspecific
   peptide growth factor antagonist, significantly inhibited the mitogenic
   activity of injured CM. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),
   platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF A chain), and epidermal growth
   factor (EGF) were detected in CM from injured cells by immunoblot
   analysis. The mitogenic activity of injured CM was significantly
   inhibited with neutralizing antibodies to bFGF (34\%), PDGF-AA (32\%),
   PDGF-BB (25\%), and EGF (25\%). A neutralizing antibody to tranforming
   growth factor (TGF)-beta had no effect. In conclusion, bFGF, PDGF, and
   EGF are immediately released from mechanically injured VSMC. VSMC Likely
   contain preformed, biologically active growth factors that are
   efficiently released from the cell cytoplasm following mechanical
   injury. Conditioned medium from injured VSMC is highly mitogenic, and
   this activity is probably due to multiple growth factors interacting
   synergistically.}},

Abstract = {{A low Reynolds number (LRN) k-epsilon turbulence model has been
   implemented in a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow solver such that
   laminar-turbulent boundary-layer transition can be simulated, This was
   done in an attempt to improve the loss prediction of the code that had
   previously used wall functions and assumed fully turbulent flow, These
   assumptions can lead to an overprediction of the loss for turbomachinery
   blade rows containing significant regions of transitional flow. This
   article details the problems associated with implementing a LRN
   k-epsilon model in an explicit Navier-Stokes flow solver and presents
   results from testing the model on zero pressure gradient nat plate flow
   at various freestream turbulence intensities and length scales, The
   results are compared to experimental data and a two-dimensional
   boundary-layer code that utilizes the same turbulence model. The
   addition of the LRN turbulence model improved the loss prediction
   capability of the Navier-Stokes (NS) code, and the chosen length scale
   had a large effect on the predicted loss, The sensitivity to the
   near-wall grid, convergence and stability problems, and excessive run
   times make the LRN k-epsilon model in an explicit NS code impractical
   for design applications at this time.}},

Abstract = {{A few examples of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are cited in the
   classic text of Lewis and Randall {[}Thermodynamics (McGraw-Hill, New
   York, 1960)] which are problematic in that classical thermodynamics
   predicts the presence of a very small fraction of a single atom in a
   given form, e.g., tungsten vapor present in equilibrium with solid at
   100 degrees C (p congruent to 10(-105) atmosphere). Lewis and Randall
   state, however, that the vapor pressure of a normal system, e.g., water
   at room temperature and that of tungsten at 100 degrees C, can be used
   `'with the same sense of security.'' They do not elaborate further. The
   problem is analyzed from first principles and it is pointed out that the
   apparent incongruity in having a fractional atom is removed in the
   density matrix description of the equilibrium state. A description of
   the equilibrium state that avoids the concept of a `'fractional atom''
   has to identify the equilibrium property as a time average. The
   shortcoming of such a description is pointed out. (C) 1995 American

Abstract = {{Two interesting features emerge from this study of fertility behaviour
   in Punjab. First, it brings out the common features of peasant life and
   demographic behaviour found in this developing-country setting and in
   historical Europe. As in much of Europe, marriage was regulated to
   adjust to the availability of land and other resources. It is
   interesting to note that the operation of this `nuptiality valve' was
   quite consistent with a system of joint families and partible
   inheritance. Secondly, the findings suggest that we need to re-define
   what we understand to be the features of socio-economic development
   which are crucial for fertility decline. Fertility began to decline
   steadily in this part of Punjab as early as 1940, at a time when the
   society was overwhelmingly agrarian, illiterate, and infant mortality
   was high with no access to modern contraceptive technology, as in
   historical Europe. The onset of the decline was brought about by
   development interventions which stabilized fluctuations in crop yields
   and mortality, thus radically improving stability of people's
   expectations. This study also points out the inapplicability of
   Mamdani's theories of fertility behaviour to the people he studied.}},

   preferential inward growth of the scale and the development of a very

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the efficacy of a cystoscopic approach, as
   definitive treatment of ureteral fistulae, after failure of antegrade
   ureteral stent insertion.
   Methods: Of 43 ureter fistulae encountered over 4 years, 10
   postoperative and/or postradiotherapy fistulae could not be stented via
   an antegrade approach alone, A cystoscopic approach was used, with the
   antegrade approach available as back-up, if necessary.
   Results: In two patients the ureteral orifice could not be visualized
   cystoscopically, thus precluding the retrograde approach, In the eight
   remaining patients, the retrograde approach alone never allowed
   successful stenting. In six patients, combined antegrade and ret regrade
   approaches permitted stent insertions. In three of those six patients, a
   complex catheterization procedure was necessary, In two patients the
   combined approach failed altogether. Therefore, 6 of 10 patients
   underwent a successful stenting procedure with the combined approach;
   all ultimately closed the fistula.
   Conclusion: Antegrade stent insertion remains the treatment of choice
   for ureteral leaks, If the antegrade approach fails, the retrograde
   approach alone is not likely to be successful, Instead, a combination of
   both approaches often does succeed.}},

   the presence of subunit 8 of the ATPase gene and the secondary structure
   of SSU rRNA which is close to that of Aspergillus nidulans. On the basis

   influx, as well as in the physical nature of tar contamination. On

   Lowest influx rates were in October-December, corresponding largely with

Abstract = {{Background: Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare acute or subacute
   membranous conjunctivitis of unknown etiology for which no generally
   accepted form of treatment is available.
   Methods: Between 1972 and 1993, 17 patients with ligneous conjunctivitis
   were treated with excision biopsy, meticulous hemostasis, and immediate,
   intensive topical treatment with heparin, steroids, and, in 12 patients,
   alpha-chymotrypsin until all signs of conjunctival inflammation had
   subsided.
   Results: On histologic examination, the lesions consisted of
   subepithelial deposits of fibrin in all patients. Eight patients had no
   recurrence (mean follow-up, 33.1 months), and in four patients the
   conjunctivitis was controlled after one repeat excision and topical
   treatment (mean follow-up, 40.3 months). One patient had three
   recurrences before responding to treatment (follow-up, 24 months). In
   four patients, treatment was unsuccessful, although lesion-free
   intervals were longer than usually seen in this condition (mean, 7.8
   months).
   Conclusion: These results suggest that intensive and early use of
   topical heparin may improve therapy results in ligneous conjunctivitis.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is an abundant autocrine and
   paracrine growth factor secreted by osteoblasts. It promotes osteoblast
   proliferation and expression of their differentiated phenotype.
   Glucocorticoids decrease IGF-I production by osteoblasts, which may
   mediate some actions of the steroid on bone in both normal and
   pathological states. The mechanisms by which the glucocorticoid cortisol
   down-regulates IGF-I transcripts were explored using cultures of
   osteoblast-enriched cells derived from fetal rat calvaria (Ob cells).
   Repression of IGF-I transcripts was apparent after 8 h of treatment, was
   sustained for at least 24 h, and was not altered by cotreatment with
   cycloheximide. Cortisol did not alter the stability of IGF-I messenger
   RNAs in transcriptionally arrested Ob cells. Cortisol decreased IGF-I
   heterogeneous nuclear RNA and gene transcription, as determined by
   reverse transcription-linked polymerase chain reaction and nuclear
   run-on assay, respectively. Transient transfection of Ob cells with
   constructs containing portions of the rat IGF-I exon 1 promoter and
   5'-flanking DNA linked to the reporter gene luciferase were performed to
   determine glucocorticoid-responsive regions of the gene. A
   glucocorticoid-responsive region of the rat IGF-I exon 1 promoter was
   localized to 34 to 192 relative to the first start site of
   transcription. In conclusion, cortisol inhibits the transcription of
   IGF-I in osteoblasts, an effect that may be relevant to the actions of
   cortisol in bone.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: To evaluate the effect of an outbreak of Escherichia
   coli O157:H7 colitis, and media coverage of the outbreak, on use of an
   emergency department.
   Design: Review of pediatric ED use and charges for gastrointestinal
   illness during the epidemic and during a control period.
   Setting: Pediatric ED in Seattle, Washington.
   Participants: All children seen in the ED with a gastrointestinal
   illness during the epidemic period (January and February 1993) and
   during a control period (January and February 1992).
   Results: During the epidemic, 31 patients with E coli O157:H7 infection
   had 45 visits to the ED. The number of visits for gastro intestinal
   illness not caused by E coli O157:H7 was 103\% higher in the epidemic
   period than in the control period (653 in 1992, 1,327 in 1993). The
   number of visits was closely associated with the number of newspaper
   stories about E coli O157:H7 illness (correlation coefficient, .88; P =
   .002). The increased number of Evaluations for gastrointestinal illness
   not caused by E coli O157:H7 infection during the epidemic period was
   associated with an additional \$101,193 in charges per month compared
   with the control period. There were no important differences in the
   Evaluation of gastrointestinal illness between 1992 and 1993 except for
   an increase in the proportion of patients with stool cultures (13.1\%
   versus 26.4\%, P<.001).
   Conclusion: For every visit by a patient with E coli O157:H7 infection,
   there were 15 additional visits (above the baseline from the control
   period) by patients with other gastrointestinal illness. The true cast
   of this epidemic included not only the evaluation of patients with
   disease but also the evaluation of those who presented because they were
   worried they had the disease. The intensity of media coverage of a
   disaster may correlate with the number of visits to the ED, and
   understanding of this fact may help in disaster planning.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the Ross procedure in young patients is gaining wider

   patients (ages 12, 15, 15 and 17 years old) operated on utilizing the
   Ross procedure for aortic insufficiency, One patient had congenital and
   three isolated rheumatic aortic insufficiency, The root replacement
   technique with coronary artery reimplantation was used, All patients did
   well initially with marked reduction of left ventricular dilatation and
   good function of the reimplanted native aortic valve, One patient,
   however, died a month later from rupture of a false aneurysm that
   developed at the pulmonary autograft to ascending aorta anastomosis, We
   feel that the use of the native aortic valve in the pulmonary position
   makes the Ross procedure more attractive and potentially curative, The

   Fledging success per pair varied between 1 and 4 fledged young per pair

   cupture-resighting model using a colour-ringed population (n = 315
   adults) which used human food sources. Adult survival rate varied from
   83 to 92\%, depending on the flock. This difference could be a
   consequence of differences in flock composition. No significant
   difference was detected between male and female survival. Survival of
   first-year birds (77\%) was lower than that of adults. In order to
   analyse the effect of human food supplied by tourist activities,
   breeding success land flock structure were compared between 2 alpine

Abstract = {{The yeast Sen1 protein was discovered by virtue of its role in tRNA
   splicing in vitro. To help determine the role of Sen1 in vivo, we
   attempted to overexpress the protein in yeast cells. However, cells with
   a high-copy SEN1-bearing plasmid, although expressing elevated amounts
   of SEN1 mRNA, show little increase in the level of the encoded protein,
   indicating that a posttranscriptional mechanism limits SEN1 expression.
   This control depends on an amino-terminal element of Sen1. Using
   agenetic selection for mutants with increased expression of Sen1-derived
   fusion proteins, we identified mutations in a novel gene, designated
   SEN3. SEN3 is essential and encodes a 945-residue protein with sequence
   similarity to a subunit of an activator of the 20S proteasome from
   bovine erythrocytes, called PA700. Earlier work indicated that the 20S
   proteasome associates with a multisubunit regulatory factor, resulting
   in a 26S proteasome complex that degrades substrates of the ubiquitin
   system. Mutant sen3-1 cells have severe defects in the degradation of
   such substrates and accumulate ubiquitin-protein conjugates. Most
   importantly, we show biochemically that Sen3 is a subunit of the 26S
   proteasome. These data provide evidence for the involvement of the 26S
   proteasome in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins in vivo and for
   a close relationship between PA700 and the regulatory complexes within
   the 26S proteasome, and they directly demonstrate that Sen3 is a
   component of the yeast 26S proteasome.}},

Abstract = {{A physical map of the chromosome of N, meningitidis Z2491 (serogroup A,
   subgroup IV-l) has been constructed, Z2491 DNA was digested with NheI,
   SpeI, SgfI, PacI, BglII, or PmeI, resulting in a limited number of
   fragments that were resolved by contour-clamped homogeneous electric
   field (CHEF) electrophoresis. The estimated genome size for this strain
   was 2,226 kb. To construct the map, probes corresponding to single-copy
   genes or sequences were used on Southern blots of chromosomal DNA
   digested with the different mapping enzymes and subjected to CHEF
   electrophoresis. By determining which fragments from different digests
   hybridized to each specific probe, it was possible to walk back and
   forth between digests to form a circular macrorestriction map. The
   intervals between mapped restriction sites range from 10 to 143 kb in
   size, A total of 117 markers have been placed on the map; 75 represent
   identified genes, with the remaining markers defined by anonymous cloned
   fragments of neisserial DNA, Comparison of the arrangement of genetic
   loci in Z2491 with that in gonococcal strain FA1090, for which a
   physical map was previously constructed, revealed complex genomic
   rearrangements between the two strains, Although gene order is generally
   conserved over much of the chromosome, a region of approximately 500 kb
   shows translocation and/or inversion of multiple blocks of markers
   between the two Strains, Even within the relatively conserved portions
   of the maps, several genetic markers are in different positions in Z2491
   and FA1090.}},

Abstract = {{Geographical clustering of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1
   (HTLV-1) infection has been identified in the nonmestizo communities in
   several cities along the Atlantic coast of Honduras. Of the 2,651 serum
   samples tested, 122 samples were repeatedly reactive for HTLV-1
   antibodies in two different enzyme immunoassays and 3 were
   indeterminate. These sera did not react in the HTLV-2-specific antibody
   tests. The presence pf HTLV-1 antibodies was confirmed by HTLV-1
   immunoblots or Western blots (immunoblots), and the infection was
   verified by the detection df HTLV-1-specific genetic sequences in the
   cellular DNA by PCR; Genomic DNA from the peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells was first tested with generic primers and probes that identified
   both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. Next, all DNA samples that showed HTLV
   reactivity were tested by PCR with specific primers and probes that
   distinguished HTLV-1 sequences from those of HTLV-2 Our results indicate
   that only HTLV-1 infection was present in the blood of both mestizo and
   nonmestizo residents of 15 cities in the Republic of Honduras. The
   overall prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in the nonmestizo population was
   8.1\% (95\% confidence limit, 6.6 to 9.7\%). The mestizo population
   residing in the same geographical vicinities showed HTLV-1 antibodies in
   0.5\% of serum samples tested (95\% confidence limit, 0.6 to 1.7\%),
   indicating a significantly greater prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in the
   nonmestizo population than in the mestizo ethnic groups living in
   Honduras (P = <0.0001). Since no HTLV-2 antibody reactivity or
   HTLV-2-specific genetic sequences were detected by PCR with different
   primers and probes, it was concluded that HTLV-2 infection was not
   present in the Honduran population groups we tested. Our study also
   suggested an endemic nature for this virus because there was no
   difference in the prevalence rate of HTLV-1 antibodies in the nonmestizo
   community living in the coastal towns of Honduras between 1989 and 1993.
   This is the first report of HTLV-1 cluster identification in Honduras,

Abstract = {{The pattern and frequency of patient encounters during the Boston (Mass)
   University adult neurology residency program (1988 to 1991) for one
   resident was compared with that in general neurology practice as well as
   with the frequency of neurologic disorders in the US population. A total
   of 1332 new patients (85\% adult, 15\% pediatric) were seen during a
   3-year period. This total represented 970 inpatients (73\% of all
   patients) and 362 outpatients (27\%). The resident encountered more
   patients in the hospital (7.5 admissions or 13 consultations per week)
   and fewer patients in the clinic (2.5 new outpatients per week) than
   does the average community neurologist (two admissions, 8.7
   consultations, and 13.2 new outpatients). The most common diagnosis for
   an admission encounter was acute ischemic infarct; for a consultation,
   metabolic encephalopathy; and for an outpatient encounter,
   radiculopathy. Less prevalent neurologic disorders in the United States
   (eg, cognitive, demyelinating, movement, and neoplastic disorders) were
   encountered more frequently in residency than were very prevalent
   neurologic disorders (eg, headache and trauma). This is the first
   reported summary of all patients one resident actually encountered
   during neurology training. The patient encounter profile suggests that
   this residency training overemphasized acute inpatient care of less
   prevalent neurologic disorders compared with outpatient care of more
   prevalent disorders commonly seen in a neurology practice. Accumulation
   of similar data from other residencies and practicing neurologists can
   help residency directors assess the changing needs of residents in
   training and guide curriculum in response to changes in practice
   patterns.}},

   spectra of copper. As the contribution of spectator hole satellites was

   calculated transition array, the widths and yields obtained pertain to
   pure one-hole states and single-electron diagram transitions. A
   considerable improvement in the agreement with theoretical widths and

   Coster-Kronig transitions to the L(2) level width is confirmed.
   Individual M(2) and M(3) widths and yields are derived from x-ray
   spectra. They are in good agreement with recent theoretical
   Dirac-Hartree-Slater calculations, but the widths are consistently
   larger than those measured for the same subshells by photoelectron
   spectroscopy. 3d spectator holes are found to broaden the widths of the

Abstract = {{In Papuan languages like Wambon and Urim demonstrative forms are used
   both in contexts of referent identification, e.g. as demonstrative
   operators in noun phrases, and in topicality contexts, e.g. as topic
   markers with adverbial clauses and phrases, recapitulative clauses, new
   topic NPs and given topic NPs.
   Using notions from the Functional Grammar framework (Dik, 1989), I
   present a non-unified account of the demonstrative forms: helping the
   addressee to identify referents by giving deictic hints like `close to
   speaker' and orienting the addressee about the topical cohesion of the
   discourse are two separate functional domains in language.
   This `two-domain' hypothesis, which views the demonstrative forms as
   having two synchronically unrelated functions, explains the fact that in
   Wambon and Urim the demonstratives show important differences in form
   and behaviour depending on whether they are used for referent
   identification or for expressing topicality distinctions.
   The `two-domain' hypothesis explains such formal differences but cannot
   explain the formal similarities between topic markers and demonstrative
   operators in Papuan languages like Wambon and Urim. To explain these
   formal similarities I suggest a diachronic development: in several
   Papuan languages topic markers developed from demonstrative operators.
   In the relatively well-documented Awyu-family of Papuan languages this
   process can be traced: in Wambon, the resumptive demonstrative pronoun
   -eve integrated in the preceding NP as a topic marker in stative clauses
   with a very transparant dichotomous topic-comment structure. In Korowai,
   also of the Awyu-family, the clitic -efe, the cognate of Wambon -eve
   `that', completely lost its function as a demonstrative operator and
   functions solely as a topic marker.}},

Abstract = {{Biological early warning systems (BEWS) for water pollution involve
   organisms as sentinels for the quality of the environment. The organisms
   are usually fast in their response (minutes) to a multitude of
   pollutants. BEWS devices are very useful for continuous monitoring of
   (industrial) effluents, water intake, and river or seawater quality
   control.
   The `'Mosselmonitor'' is a commercially available BEWS that uses the
   behavioral valve movement response of freshwater or marine mussels
   (e.g., Dreissena polymorpha or Mytilus edulis). As an indication of
   unfavorable conditions in the water, the closure of the shells, or a
   marked increase in the valve movement frequency, is automatically
   evaluated.
   During the last few years the authors have gained practical experience
   with the Mosselmonitor in a number of field experiments. Examples of
   monitoring practice will be presented that involve the following
   monitoring situations:
   intake of drinking water from a river system;
   continuous monitoring of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, partly in
   combination with other BEWS devices and physicochemical monitoring;
   monitoring of industrial effluents in a tidal estuary; and
   control of cooling water chlorination for antifouling purposes.
   In addition,
   the system has been used for toxicological laboratory studies on
   selected compounds. (C) 1995 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Civil engineers are valued by society for their knowledge and skills
   which, though based on theory, are forged through experience. Indeed,
   the real world is a messy place of complex, interacting systems which
   time and time again demonstrate the inadequacies of engineering theory.
   The scientific approach to engineering education does not equip
   graduates effectively for professional practice. This paper introduces
   the concept of `reflective practice', explains how it can be formalized
   and suggests that it should be adopted alongside the traditional
   technical rationality approach to teaching engineering design. It
   involves analysing past failures, using artificial intelligence and,
   above all, looking at the big picture.}},

   2, and capable of inducing nitrite production by chicken macrophages,
   These properties clearly distinguish it from chicken and mammalian type

   shares significant amino acid homology with mammalian IFN-gamma

   arise as a weakly nonlinear interaction between modes which destabilize
   the motionless solution as the Marangoni number Ma is increased. It
   turns out to be interesting to follow the morphogenesis of these
   patterns, at fixed Ma, as the aspect ratio is increased. The hexagonal
   flow patterns then arise in two steps, both which involve regulative and
   generative processes at the lateral (no-slip) boundaries. The results
   provide a mechanistic description of the formation of successive layers
   of hexagons in which the presence and properties of the lateral walls
   play a crucial role.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses ethnographic data to examine ethical dilemmas in
   discharging elderly persons from the hospital. The focus is on two
   elements significantly influencing that process, the patient's
   decisional capacity and the involvement of family members in
   decision-making. Within the field of bioethics these issues have been
   discussed in terms of factor compromising the autonomy of the patient
   and the interdependency of family members. An ethnographic analysis
   demonstrates how several assumptions in bioethical approaches to these
   issues are problematic. First, bioethical discussions generally neglect
   social and structural factors that condition discharge decision-making.
   The rationality and mental capability of the individuals making
   decisions are presumed to exist independently of those persons' social
   contexts; they are also assumed to be concrete properties amenable to
   objective assessment. Bioethical models further assume that `the family'
   is an identifiable ontological unit that exists independently of the
   setting in which decisions are made and that interdependency is a
   concrete attribute of familial relations. In contrast, this study shows
   how discharge planning is an event produced by the interplay among
   diverse interests. The structure of the discharge planner's role and
   processes of collective decision-making shape how medical staff perceive
   and define patients' decisional capacity and the involvement of
   families. This points to unintentional and unrecognized ways in which
   the patient's choices and control over decisions can be restricted. The
   analysis supports attempts to develop bioethical models based on
   socially grounded principles recognizing the importance of both autonomy
   and interdependence in long term care decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory epithelial cells play a crucial role in the inflammatory
   response during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the lungs of
   patients with cystic fibrosis. In this study, we determined whether the
   binding of specific Pseudomonas gene products (pilin, flagellin) to
   their receptors on respiratory epithelial cells would result in
   production of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8, Piliated wild-type
   organisms, purified pill, or antibody to the pilin receptor (asialoGM1)
   evoked significant production of IL-8 by immortalized airway epithelial
   cells, whereas nonpiliated organisms were less able to bind to
   respiratory epithelial cells and stimulated much less IL-8 secretion (P
   < 0.01), A piliated, nonflagellated strain was also associated with
   decreased binding and a diminished level of IL-8 production when
   compared to wild-type organisms, Isogenic, nonadherent rpoN mutants,
   lacking pilin and flagellin, did not bind or elicit an IL-8 response, In
   addition, the IL-8 response was four-fold higher in a cystic fibrosis
   cell line compared with its corrected cell line. The Pseudomonas
   autoinducer, an exoproduct secreted during chronic infection, was found
   to stimulate IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner, P. aeruginosa adhesins,
   which are necessary for initial infection, directly stimulate IL-8
   production by respiratory epithelial cells and therefore play a major
   role in the pathogenesis of Pseudomonas infection in patients with
   cystic fibrosis, The inflammatory response is subsequently perpetuated
   by Pseudomonas autoinducer which is secreted during chronic infection.}},

Abstract = {{It is argued that an equilibrium theory of the glass transition is
   required before a full understanding of the glass transition, as

   basis for such a theory and predicts that vitrification occurs as the
   configurational entropy S-c approaches zero. Comparison with nine
   different classes of polymer experiments shows semiquantitative
   agreement in each case. An important aspect of glass formation in
   polymers is that the crystal phase is not ubiquitous so that amorphous
   polymer material exists necessarily at low temperatures. A
   low-temperature equilibrium theory for these materials is required.
   Using equilibrium theory as a base, a kinetic theory is developed and an
   equation for the relaxation function is derived which predicts the
   proper temperature dependence of the viscosity and shows stretched
   exponential-like behavior for the relaxation.}},

Abstract = {{Simulated cider fermentations were carried out using a monoculture of a
   cider strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a sterile apple juice-based

   different ways: firstly by using the fluorescent dyes oxonol and
   rhodamine 123 and visualising the yeast with flow cytometry and
   fluorescent microscopy, and secondly by using the acidification power
   test.
   These techniques were used on yeast at various stages of a simulated
   cider fermentation and also on freshly grown yeast (3 days after
   inoculation) after the addition of an alcohol mixture similar to that
   accumulating in mature cider (10\% ethanol, 200 ppm propan-1-ol, 32 ppm
   butan-1-ol, 70 ppm butan-2-ol, 190 ppm amyl alcohol, 17 ppm hexan-1-ol
   and 260 ppm S-phenyl ethanol).
   Little change was observed to the plasma membrane transmembrane
   potential as indicated by oxonol exclusion over a 4 week fermentation
   period, but rhodamine 123 staining which indicates mitochondrial
   membrane potential showed a drastic decline during the first 3 days. The
   total acidification power index remained almost constant with

Abstract = {{We have compared the anticoagulant and the antithrombotic effects of
   unfractionated heparin (Calciparine(R)) and low molecular weight heparin
   (Fraxiparine(R)) in an experimental human venous thrombosis model. One
   single subcutaneous injection of Calciparine(R) or Fraxiparine(R) was
   administered to healthy male volunteers at one month interval in a
   randomised and cross-over design. Ten subjects received doses used in
   man for preventing venous thrombosis (5,000 IU and 3,075 IU,
   respectively), and seven other subjects received curative doses (12,500
   IU and 6,150 IU, respectively). Thrombus formation was measured 3 h and
   8 h after drug administration. Non-anticoagulated human blood was drawn
   for 5 min directly from an antecubital vein over confluent cultured
   endothelial cells positioned in a parallel-plate perfusion chamber. The
   cells were previously stimulated for 4 h with lipopolysaccharides (10 mu
   g/ml) and interleukin 1 beta (50 U/ml), resulting in optimal expression
   of biological active tissue factor. The wall shear rate at the cell
   surface was 50 s(-1) and mimicked venous blood flow conditions.
   Immunologically quantified fibrin deposition on the stimulated cells was
   reduced only by curative doses of Calciparine(R) and Fraxiparine(R) at 3
   h (3.4 +/- 0.8 versus 1.0 +/- 0.2 mu g/cm(2) and 2.6 +/- 0.8 versus 1.0
   +/- 0.1 mu g/cm(2), respectively, p less than or equal to 0.05). The
   influence of Calciparine(R) and Fraxiparine(R) on the formation of
   thrombin and fibrin was determined by measuring the plasma levels of
   thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) in blood
   samples collected distally to the perfusion chamber. The generation of
   these markers was significantly inhibited (50-83\%) by both prophylactic
   and curative doses of Calciparine(R) and Fraxiparine(R) (p less than or
   equal to 0.05). However, Fraxiparine(R) still significantly inhibited
   the thrombin and fibrin generation at 8 h (p less than or equal to
   0.05), whereas Calciparine(R) did nor. The antithrombotic effects of
   both heparins were correlated with their plasma activities as measured
   by the antifactor Xa or the antithrombin assays. Thus, it appears in
   this model that Calciparine(R) and Fraxiparine(R) produce comparable
   antithrombotic effects at clinically comparable doses. However
   Fraxiparine(R) has a longer-lasting anticoagulant activity than
   Calciparine(R) These results are in good agreement with clinical
   observations in man, and thus in favour of our model of human venous
   thrombogenesis for further studies of antithrombotic molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration is one of the processes of the hydrologic cycle that has
   been studied and reported very extensively. The various theories and
   models proposed for the description of this process are usually
   applicable to small plots, subjected to rainfall intensities that are
   higher than the infiltration capacity of the plots. The resulting
   equations are thus applicable only to infiltration at capacity rate. The
   model presented herein is not restricted to capacity infiltration only.
   It can be used for computing the variations in the infiltration capacity
   rate and the production of rainfall excess for any given rainfall
   hyetograph and a specified value of the initial moisture content of the
   upper soil layer. The model comprises two elements, a linear reservoir
   with a regulated inlet and a regulating element linked to the reservoir
   element by a feedback loop. The definition of the two elements requires
   three parameters. One is the minimum rate of infiltration capacity,
   f(e), obtained when the moisture contents of the upper soil layer is at
   its maximum value, S-m, which is the second parameter of the model. The
   third parameter is the initial infiltration capacity, f(o), when the
   soil moisture is completely depleted.}},

Abstract = {{A three step decision-making process is advocated for coral reef
   managers which (1) evaluates an area at risk, (2) quantifies the risk,
   and (3) assesses recoverability and consequences in terms of ecological
   succession and bioconstruction. The judgements required at each stage of
   the decision-making process should be based on a clear understanding of
   their ecological and geomorphological implications. `Biodiversity' and
   `bioconstruction' criteria are used to evaluate locations on a five
   point scale. Ecological risk assessment assigns likelihoods for various
   damage scenarios. Acceptable change is scale and context dependent and
   ranges from zero to complete, depending on ecological value and
   alternate values. Three questions need to be addressed in relation to
   recoverability of damaged sites: (1) effects on future suitability for
   settlement, growth and/or repair, (2) certainty of supply of appropriate
   propagules; and (3) identifiable, `on site ecological factors' (such as
   predators, competitors, diseases) which may prevent recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of wear patterns on engine cylinder liners show that radial wear
   is greatest on the anti-thrust side, and close to top dead centre. As a
   result of this wear, surface topography features at different positions
   exhibit different characteristics. Quantitative representation of the
   features is helpful for functional analysis and functional control of
   cylinder liner manufacture. In this paper three-dimensional
   characterization techniques are applied to produce a comprehensive
   characterization of cylinder liner wear at different longitudinal
   positions. The areal autocorrelation function and the areal power
   spectrum reveal the changes in topographic features. The different
   topographic features of newly created, after running-in, severely worn
   and bore polished surfaces of cylinder liners are identified by
   quantitative functional indices. The characterization techniques and
   parameters used in the paper constitute an effective approach to the
   characterization of surface topography of cylinder liners and other

Abstract = {{The bone marrow microenvironment consists of stromal cells and
   extracellular matrix components which act in concert to regulate the
   growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. There is little
   understanding of the mechanisms which modulate the regulatory role of
   stromal cells. This study examined the hypothesis that mesenchymal
   growth factors such as basic Fibroblast growth factor (bFCF) and
   epidermal growth factor (ECF) modulate stromal cell activities and
   thereby influence the course of hematopoiesis. Both bFGF and EGF were
   potent mitogens for marrow stroma. However, both factors proved to be
   inhibitory to hematopoiesis in primary long-term marrow cultures.
   Inhibition was also observed when hematopoietic cells and bFGF or EGF
   were added to subconfluent irradiated stromal layers, demonstrating that
   the decline of hematopoiesis was not due to overgrowth of the stromal
   layer. Loss of hematopoietic support in bFGF and ECF was dose-dependent.
   Removal of bFGF and EGF permitted stromal layers to regain their normal
   capacity to support hematopoiesis. In stroma-free long-term cultures,
   neither factor affected CFU-CM expansion. Basic FGF slightly enhanced
   granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit (CFU-SM) cloning efficiency
   in short-term agarose culture. Basic FGF did not reduce the levels of
   interleukin-6 (IL-6), CM-CSF, or C-CSF released by steady state or
   IL-1-stimulated stroma. Similarly, the constitutive levels of steel
   factor (SF) mRNA and protein were not affected by bFGF. Basic FGF did
   not alter the level of TGF-beta 1 in stromal cultures. We conclude that
   bFGF and EGF can act as indirect negative modulators of hematopoietic
   growth in stromal cultures. The actual mediators of regulation, whether
   bound or soluble, remain to be identified. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{To determine whether tachykinins induce gelatinase production by guinea

   involved, we incubated AM with substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), or
   the NH2-terminal fragment of SP, SP(1-7). The effects of increasing
   concentrations of selective NK1 and NK2 agonists on tachykinin-induced
   gelatinase production were also evaluated, as were the effects of a
   selective NK2 antagonist. Gelatinase activity in conditioned culture
   media (CCM) was assessed by zymography and quantified by image analysis.
   SP increased 92-kDa gelatinase activity in CCM of AM in a
   concentration-dependent manner, with a maximum increase at 10(-4) M.
   NKA, the NH2-terminal fragment of SP, and an NK1-selective agonist had
   no effect. In contrast, a selective NK2 agonist induced a
   concentration-dependent increase in gelatinase activity. The increase in
   this activity induced by SP and the selective NK2 agonist was inhibited
   by a selective NK2 antagonist. We conclude that SP induces gelatinase
   production by AM through NK2 receptor activation. The release of
   gelatinase may constitute one mechanism through which SP contributes to
   the epithelial lesions observed in bronchial hyperreactivity and asthma.}},

   prey for flatfishes: Alpheus japonicus, Oratosquilla oratoria, Alpheus
   distinguendus, Loligo japonicus and Crangon affinis. Among the
   flatfishes, Paralichthys olivaceus was piscivorous, whereas
   Pseodopleuronectes yokohamae and Pseudopleuronectes herzensteini both
   had polychaetes and molluscs as their main prey groups. Pleuronichthys
   cornutus was classified as a polychaete-mollusc eater, with a strong
   preference for crustaceans. Verasper variegatus, Cynoglossus semilaevis,
   Eopsetta grigorjewi and Cleisthenes herzensteini ate crustaceans.
   Kareius bicoloratus was classified as a mollusc-crustacean eater:
   Cynoglossus abbreviatus, Cynoglossus joyneri and Zebrias zebra were
   grouped as crustacean-fish eaters. However, Z. zebra also took
   polychaetes and C. abbreviatus and C. joyneri preyed on some molluscs.
   Trophic relationships among the flatfishes were complicated, but they
   occupied distinctive microhabitats in different seasons and selected
   their specific prey items, which was favourable to the stability of the

Abstract = {{The complete 12S rRNA gene has been sequenced in 4 Ungulata (hoofed
   eutherians) and 1 marsupial and compared to 38 available mammalian
   sequences in order to investigate the molecular evolution of the
   mitochondrial small-subunit ribosomal RNA molecule. Ungulata were
   represented by one artiodactyl (the collared peccary, Tayassu tajacu,
   suborder Suiformes), two perissodactyls (the Grevy's zebra, Equus
   grevyi, suborder Hippomorpha; the white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum,
   suborder Ceratomorpha), and one hyracoid (the tree hyrax, Dendrohyrax
   dorsalis). The fifth species was a marsupial, the eastern gray kangaroo
   (Macropus giganteus). Several transition/transversion biases
   characterized the pattern of changes between mammalian 12S rRNA
   molecules. A bias toward transitions was found among 12S rRNA sequences
   of Ungulata, illustrating the general bias exhibited by ribosomal and
   protein-encoding genes of the mitochondrial genome. The derivation of a
   mammalian 12S rRNA secondary structure model from the comparison of 43
   eutherian and marsupial sequences evidenced a pronounced bias against
   transversions in stems. Moreover, transversional compensatory changes
   were rare events within double-stranded regions of the ribosomal RNA.
   Evolutionary characteristics of the 12S rRNA were compared with those of
   the nuclear 18S and 28S rRNAs. From a phylogenetic point of view,
   transitions, transversions and indels in stems as well as transversional
   and indels events in loops gave congruent results for comparisons within
   orders. Some compensatory changes in double-stranded regions and some
   indels in single-stranded regions also constituted diagnostic events,
   The 12S rRNA molecule confirmed the monophyly of infraorder Pecora and
   order Cetacea and demonstrated the monophyly of suborder Suiformes,
   However, the monophyly of the suborder Ruminantia was not supported, and
   the branching pattern between Cetacea and the artiodactyl suborders
   Ruminantia and Suiformes was not established. The monophyly of the order
   Perissodactyla was evidenced, but the relationships between
   Artiodactyla, Cetacea, and Perissodactyla remained un resolved.
   Nevertheless, we found no support for a Perissodactyla + Hyracoidea
   clade, neither with distance approach, nor with parsimony
   reconstruction. The 12S rRNA was useful to solve intraordinal
   relationships among Ungulata, but it seemed to harbor too few
   informative positions to decipher the bushlike radiation of some
   Ungulata orders, an event which has most probably occurred in a short
   span of time between 55 and 70 MYA.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: The mechanism(s) of preterm premature rupture of fetal
   membranes resulting in preterm birth remains unknown. Studies suggest
   that fetal membranes are susceptible to weakening by protease attack and
   that collagenases may be active at the site of rupture. In this study
   fetal membranes from women delivered after preterm premature rupture of
   membranes were compared with control membranes and analyzed
   qualitatively and quantitatively for protease activities.
   STUDY DESIGN: Fourteen membranes from women with preterm premature
   rupture of membranes and nine membranes from women delivered preterm
   without premature rupture of membranes or otherwise normal women
   delivered at term vaginally or by cesarean section were studied.
   Zymogram gel electrophoresis with gelatin incorporation was used to
   assess the number and apparent molecular weights of protease activities.
   Functional and quantitative studies of protease activity were measured
   by fluorescent substrate cleavage.
   RESULTS: Zymogram gel electrophoresis studies demonstrated the presence
   of five to seven different protease bands in preterm premature rupture
   of membranes samples, whereas control membranes demonstrated only one to
   three protease bands. Fluorescent studies of protease activity
   demonstrated a 10- to 40-fold increase in activity in membranes from
   women with preterm premature rupture of membranes compared with normal
   control membranes. Studies with protease inhibitors suggest that most of
   the activity is due to metalloproteinases.
   CONCLUSION: In membranes from women with preterm premature rupture of
   membranes there appears to be a general increase in the amount of
   protease activity and increased numbers of putatively different
   proteases. Increased activity or deregulated protease control may
   mediate preterm premature rupture of membranes and be a potentially
   remediable cause of preterm birth.}},

Abstract = {{Three experiments, using 344 pigs, were conducted to evaluate the
   influence of beta-glucan on growth performance, neutrophil and
   macrophage function, haptoglobin production, and resistance to
   Streptococus suis challenge in weanling pigs. In Exp. 1,144 pigs were
   used to evaluate the influence of .1\% dietary beta-glucan in a soybean
   meal- or milk protein-based diet on growth performance and neutrophil
   function. Pigs fed beta-glucan from d 7 to 14 after weaning had lower
   ADFI (P <.01) and, although not significant, ADG was lower for pigs fed
   beta-glucan than for pigs fed control diets. However, no differences
   were observed in growth performance or neutrophil function for pigs fed
   control or diets containing beta-glucan from d 7 to 35 after weaning.
   Experiment 2 was 28-d growth assay in which pigs were fed a diet with or
   without .1\% beta-glucan, containing 7.5\% spray-dried plasma protein
   and 25\% dried whey from d 0 to 14 after weaning. Pigs then were fed
   corn-soybean meal-based diets containing 2.5\% spray-dried blood meal
   and 10\% dried whey. No differences in growth performance were observed.
   Experiment 3 was a 35-d assay to evaluate growth performance, neutrophil
   and macrophage function, and plasma haptoglobin concentration. Pigs were
   challenged on d 28 postweaning with intravenous S. suis. In Exp. 3, pigs
   were fed diets without or with .025 or .05\% beta-glucan. Dietary
   beta-glucan did not influence neutrophil or macrophage function.
   However, pigs fed diets containing .025\% beta-glucan had increased (P
   <.05) ADG and ADFI and were heavier (P <.05) on d 28 after weaning than
   pigs fed the control diet. No differences in feed efficiency (G/F) were
   detected between treatments. Pigs fed beta-glucan had decreased (P <.10)
   plasma haptoglobin on d 14, 21, and 28 after weaning. However, Fisher's
   Exact test revealed that more (P < .04) pigs fed a diet containing
   .025\% beta-glucan died by d 12 after challenge with S. suis. In
   conclusion, these data suggest the existence of a complex interaction
   involving growth performance and resistance to S. suis in pigs fed
   .025\% beta-glucan.}},

Abstract = {{This introductory article provides an overview of the concept of
   flexibility and the articles to follow. Both positive and problematic
   aspects of flexibility for conflict resolution are discussed: if
   manifest in joint problem-solving behavior, flexibility can contribute
   to improved negotiated outcomes; if used tactically by one or another
   party, it can lead to unfavorable outcomes for at least one of the
   parties. Flexibility can be understood at each of three levels of
   analysis-individual, small group, and organizational behavior-and the
   articles in this collection reflect these different levels. A variety of
   factors have been shown to influence flexible behavior, including the
   way negotiators plan, their orientations, tactics, and a number of
   aspects of the negotiating situation. These and other factors are
   treated in the articles to follow, each of which is summarized in this
   article. The articles in this collection are intended to contribute to
   our understanding of this concept, and the key lessons learned are

Abstract = {{Negotiated agreements often depend on the willingness of bargainers to
   change their positions. This willingness is shown to depend in large
   part on certain aspects of the negotiating situation. This article
   reports the results of simulation experiments that demonstrate increased
   flexibility when the negotiations are held in private at remote
   locations. Talks under such conditions have a stronger impact on
   bargaining behavior than do suggestions made by a mediator. Bargainers
   were also responsive to the timing of their opponent's moves: more
   agreements occurred when their opponent demonstrated early firmness
   followed by later flexibility. The variables explored in the experiments
   were also used to diagnose outcomes of historical and contemporary
   cases. Correspondences found between the diagnosed and actual outcomes
   provide support for the relevance of these variables as influences on
   the flexibility of international negotiators.}},

Abstract = {{In vitro models of hypoxic/hypoglycemic injury reveal common mechanisms
   with glutamate excitotoxicity, but glutamate-induced toxicity in the
   absence of oxygen has never been directly addressed. Therefore, we
   assessed neuronal survival and intracellular calcium concentrations
   ({[}Ca2+](l)) in neonatal hippocampal cultures in response to glutamate
   in the presence and absence of oxygen. Twenty-four hours of hypoxia
   alone killed 40\% of the initial population, attributable to glutamate
   receptor-stimulated osmotic lysis. A 5 min glutamate exposure in ambient
   air killed 80\% of the initial population by 24 hr later. When cultures
   were deprived of oxygen during and for 2-24 hr after excitotoxin
   exposure, glutamate did not cause additional neuronal death beyond that
   induced by oxygen depletion alone. Toxicities caused by activation of
   NMDA, AMPA, or kainate receptors were each ameliorated by oxygen
   depletion. In the absence of oxygen, glutamate evoked normal increases
   in {[}Ca2+](l), indicating that glutamate receptors functioned normally.
   The glutamate-induced increases in {[}Ca2+](l) were not toxic in the
   absence of oxygen. In a similar manner, oxygen-depletion prevented
   neuronal killing by the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. Neuronal death
   produced by hydrogen peroxide or iron sulfate was not ameliorated by
   oxygen removal. These oxidants maximally produced only a slow increase
   in {[}Ca2+](l) as the plasma membrane permeability increased
   nonspecifically. Therefore, oxygen-based reactions were an essential
   component of calcium-mediated, delayed neuronal death.}},

Abstract = {{The casemix funding arrangements introduced in Victoria on 1 July 1993
   represent a significant departure from the previous approaches to public
   hospital funding in Australia. They are designed to change the economic
   incentives on hospitals by linking payment to the number and case
   complexity of patients treated, The new funding arrangements include a
   combination of fixed and variable payments to hospitals for inpatient
   services. Outpatient services remain funded on a historical basis.
   Special payments are made for teaching and research functions. Total
   payments to hospitals are capped through operation of an `Additional
   Throughput Pool' which allows price to fluctuate inversely with volume
   to ensure an expenditure limit. Because of operations of specific
   conditions on the Additional Throughput Pool, hospitals were given an
   incentive to reduce waiting lists. Despite the success in reducing
   waiting lists and budgets, there are a number of problems with the
   casemix approach including both technical issues (how are payment rates
   to be updated?; the failure to address problems of capital) and ethical
   issues. These are discussed in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Among fossil primates, thick enamel has been interpreted as an
   adaptation to hard-object feeding. However, correlations between
   thickness of enamel and diet have not been investigated rigorously among
   extant taxa. Thickness of enamel was compared within and between
   congeneric pairs that feed on hard and soft objects from two primate and
   three chiropteran families. Within each pair, the hard-object feeder
   exhibits relatively thicker enamel than its congener that feeds on
   softer items. However, there is overlap in both types of feeders, and
   the hypothesis that a specific value of enamel thickness be used to
   separate hard- and soft-object feeders is rejected. Dietary inferences
   based on thickness of enamel should be made only within an appropriate
   taxonomic context.}},

   The survey images reveal a large amount of structure and detail,
   including a considerable number of low surface brightness loops and
   spurs and an impressive loop complex in the region of Galactic longitude
   342 degrees. Over 30 possible supernova remnant (SNR) candidates appear

Abstract = {{We fabricated `'ligament analogs'' in vitro by seeding high-strength
   resorbable collagen fiber scaffolds with intraarticular (anterior
   cruciate ligament, ACL) or extraarticular (patellar tendon, PT) rabbit
   fibroblasts. Fibroblasts attached, proliferated, and secreted new
   collagen on the ligament analogs in vitro. Fibroblast function depended
   on the tissue culture substrate (ligament analog vs. tissue culture
   plate) and the origin of the fibroblasts (ACL vs. PT). PT fibroblasts
   proliferated more rapidly than ACL fibroblasts when cultured on ligament
   analogs. Collagen synthesis by ACL and PT fibroblasts was approximately
   tenfold greater on ligament analogs than on tissue culture plates. The
   composition, structure, and geometry of the collagen fiber scaffolds may
   promote collagen synthesis within ligament analogs in vitro. Ligament
   analogs roughly approximate the structure and strength of native
   ligament tissue. Ongoing in vivo studies suggest that autogenous
   fibroblast-seeded ligament analogs remain viable after implantation into
   the knee joint. With further development, ligament analogs may be useful
   as implants for ACL reconstruction surgery. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons,

   SUBJECTS: Caucasian, 121 women and 109 men, participating in a

   MEASUREMENTS: Evaluations of body weight, waist and hip circumferences,
   dietary intake, physical activity, cigarette smoking, and alcohol intake
   were performed annually, Age was recorded and family history of disease
   was assessed,
   RESULTS: For women, covariates and modifiable predictors accounted for
   67\% of the variance in waist circumference change from Year 1 to Year
   3, Women with lower baseline waist girths, lower baseline hip girths,
   higher baseline body weight, and a greater change in body weight had
   larger increases in waist girth, For men, covariates and modifiable
   predictors accounted for 72\% of the variance in waist circumference
   change, Men with lower baseline waist girth, a greater change in hip
   girth, higher baseline body weight, greater increases in body weight,
   and less percent of fat in the diet at baseline had larger increases in
   waist girth, Other non-modifiable variables did not predict change in

   CONCLUSION: Reducing excess body weight and decreasing weight gain
   appear to be the most important factors in preventing the accumulation

Abstract = {{The first step of anaerobic benzoate degradation is the formation of
   benzoyl-coenzyme A by benzoate-coenzyme A ligase. This enzyme, purified
   from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, is maximally active with 5 mu M
   benzoate, To study the molecular basis for this reaction, the
   benzoate-coenzyme A ligase gene (badA) was cloned and sequenced, The
   deduced amino acid sequence of badA showed substantial similarity to
   other coenzyme A ligases, with the highest degree of similarity being
   that to 4-hydroxybenzoate-coenzyme A ligase (50\% amino acid identity)
   from R, palustris. A badA mutant that was constructed had barely
   detectable levels of Ligase activity when cell extracts were assayed at
   10 mu M benzoate, Despite this, the mutant grew at wild-type rates on
   benzoate under laboratory culture conditions (3 mM benzoate), and mutant
   cell extracts had high levels of ligase activity when assayed at a high
   concentration of benzoate (1 mM). This suggested that R. palustris
   expresses, in addition to BadA, a benzoate-activating enzyme(s),vith a
   relatively low affinity for benzoate, A possible role of
   4-hydroxybenzoate-coenzyme A ligase (encoded by hbaA) in this capacity
   was investigated by constructing a badA hbaA double mutant, Although the
   double mutant grew more slowly on benzoate than badA cells, growth rates
   were still significant, suggesting the involvement of a third enzyme in
   benzoate activation. Competition experiments involving the addition of a
   small amount of cyclohexanecarboxylate to ligase assay mixtures
   implicated cyclohexanecarboxylate-coenzyme A ligase as being this third
   enzyme, These results show that wild-type R. palustris cells synthesize
   at least three enzymes that can catalyze the initial step in anaerobic
   benzoate degradation during growth on benzoate, This observation
   supports previous suggestions that benzoyl-coenzyme A formation plays a
   central role in anaerobic aromatic compound biodegradation.}},

Abstract = {{The biological performance of titanium (Ti) particles has been
   investigated in vitro on murine peritoneal macrophages in a primary
   culture system. The ultrastructural study revealed an unchanged
   morphology with respect to controls and the presence of numerous
   phagocytic vacuoles containing Ti particles as confirmed by X-ray
   microprobe analyses. The activities of beta-glucuronidase, acid
   phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
   were determined. All of the enzymes were found to be activated after
   different exposure times to various Ti concentrations. These activations
   are qualified as the consequence of cell defence rather than a
   significant cytotoxic effect. Nevertheless, they indicate a possible
   inflammatory action of short duration. This investigation provides new
   arguments for the high biological performance of Ti.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel and practical way to integrate techniques from
   computer vision to low bit-rate coding systems for video
   teleconferencing applications. Our focus is to locate and track the
   faces and selected facial features of persons in typical
   head-and-shoulders video sequences, and to exploit the location
   information in a `classical' video coding/decoding system. The
   motivation is to enable the system to encode selectively various image
   areas and to produce perceptually pleasing coded images where faces are
   sharper. We refer to this approach-a mix of classical waveform coding
   and model-based coding-as model-assisted coding. We propose two totally
   automatic algorithms which, respectively, perform the detection of a
   head outline, and identify an `eyes-nose-mouth' region, both from
   downsampled binary thresholded edge images. The algorithms operate
   accurately and robustly, even in cases of significant head rotation or
   partial occlusion by moving objects. We show how the information about
   face and facial feature location can be advantageously exploited by low
   bit-rate waveform-based video coders. In particular, we describe a
   method of object-selective quantizer control in a standard coding system
   based on motion-compensated discrete cosine transform-CCITT's
   recommendation H.261. The approach is based on two novel algorithms,
   namely buffer rate modulation and buffer size modulation. By forcing the
   rate control algorithm to transfer a fraction of the total available
   bit-rate from the coding of the non-facial to that of the facial area,
   the coder produces images with better-rendered facial features, i.e.
   coding artefacts in the facial area are less pronounced and eye contact
   is preserved. The improvement was found to be perceptually significant
   on video sequences coded at the ISDN rate of 64 kbps, with 48 kbps for
   the input (color) video signal in QCIF format.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic theological method was used to follow transitions occurring
   during heating and cooling of starch-lipid gels that were prepared
   separately from the theological measurement. A decrease in storage
   modulus (G') and a simultaneous increase in phase shift (delta) were
   interpreted as due to a transition of the amylose-lipid complex. During
   cooling an increase in G' and a decrease in delta were observed. The
   temperature of this transition (T-m) was found to depend on the type of
   starch, chain length of complexing ligand, polar head group of the
   ligand, and salt concentration for ionic ligands. For a
   hydroxypropylated potato starch lower T-m values were observed than for
   the native potato starch. Surfactants with longer hydrocarbon chains
   gave higher T-m values. The polar head influenced the stability so that
   it increased in the following order: cationic < anionic < nonionic. For
   the charged ligands T-m increased with the concentration of NaCl. This
   was explained as due to a generic electrostatic effect of ions on the
   helix-coil transformation. Not only the transition of the amylose-lipid
   complex was affected as described. Also the theological properties of
   the starchlipid gel at room temperature were possible to change
   depending on the ligand used. By combining the proper starch and
   surfactant/emulsifier it was thus possible to obtain very strong and
   elastic gels (i.e., high G' and low delta values) or very weak and
   viscous gels (i.e., low G' and high delta values). (C) 1995 Society of

Abstract = {{Ca2+ channels display remarkable selectivity and permeability,
   traditionally attributed to multiple, discrete Ca2+ binding sites lining
   the pore. Each of the four pore-forming segments of Ca2+ channel al
   subunits contains a glutamate residue that contributes to high-affinity
   Ca2+ interactions. Replacement of all four P-region glutamates with
   glutamine or alanine abolished micromolar Ca2+ block of monovalent
   current without revealing any additional independent high-affinity Ca2+
   binding site. Pairwise replacements of the four glutamates excluded the
   hypothesis that they form two independent high-affinity sites.
   Systematic alterations of side-chain length, charge, and polarity by
   glutamate replacement with aspartate, glutamine, or alanine weakened the
   Ca2+ interaction, with considerable asymmetry from one repeat to
   another. The P-region glutamate in repeat I was unusual in its
   sensitivity to aspartate replacement but not glutamine substitution.
   While all four glutamates cooperate in supporting high-affinity
   interactions with single Ca2+ ions, they also influence the interaction

   show that if either bilateral monopoly or complementary monopoly emerge
   as a market structure the output of train services and their quality
   will generally fall. In the case of the emergence of both bilateral
   monopoly and complementary monopoly our analysis again suggests poor

Abstract = {{EXAFS spectroscopy was used to study the influence of various factors on
   the structure of PdCl2 completes with organic sulfides in organic
   solvents. Absolute interatomic distances in the first coordination
   sphere of Pd were determined for the complexes {[}PdCl2 . 2(C6H13)(2)S]
   (I), {[}PdCl2 .(C6H13)(2)S](2) (II) {[}PdCl2 . 2(C6H5)(2)S] (III), and
   {[}PdCl2 .(C4H9)S(C4H7)] (IV) and for their solutions in some organic
   solvents. Our hypothesis that aromatic solvent molecules are coordinated
   to palladium atoms through weak pi-bonds, which was proposed for complex
   (I) in benzene, is supported for benzene and pseudocumene solutions of
   complexes (I), (II), and (III). It is shown that the characteristic
   features of the specific solvation of the completes under study are
   determined by the electron properties and spatial structures of the
   molecules as well as by the donating abilities of the solvents.}},

Abstract = {{The polymerization of desaminotyrosinetyrosylhexyl ester (DTH) with
   phosgene gives rise to poly(DTH carbonate), a new pseudopoly(amino
   acid). To evaluate the performance of this bioabsorbable material in
   orthopedic applications, the tissue responses elicited by
   compression-molded pins of poly(DTH carbonate) and clinically used
   polydioxanone pins (PDS; Orthosorb(R)) were compared. The two types of
   pins were implanted in the paravertebral muscle and in the metaphyseal
   proximal tibia and distal femur of 10 White New Zealand Rabbits for 1,
   2, 4, and 26 weeks. The tissue response was evaluated using histologic
   staining of soft- and hard-tissue sections, fluorescent bone marker
   incorporation, and backscattered electron imaging. In soft tissue, both
   poly(DTH carbonate) and PDS elicited a mild inflammatory response
   resulting in encapsulation. During the disintegration phase, the PDS
   implants triggered a foreign body response involving the phagocytosis of
   polymeric debris by histiocytes and giant cells. No such response was
   observed for poly(DTH carbonate). In hard tissue, close bone apposition
   was observed throughout the 26-week test period for poly(DTH carbonate)
   implants. At the 26-week time point, the poly(DTH carbonate) implants
   exhibited surface erosion and were penetrated by new bone. In contrast,
   an intervening fibrous tissue layer was always present between the PDS
   pins and the bone. At 26 weeks, the PDS implants had partially resorbed
   and a foreign body response characterized by infiltration of
   inflammatory cells, and bone resorption was observed in several of the
   implantation sites. This study indicates that poly(DTH carbonate) and
   PDS exhibit fundamentally different interactions with hard tissue, and
   that poly(DTH carbonate) is a promising orthopedic implant material. (C)

   cysts. Immunoblot analysis of 81 selected sera with IHA titers ranging
   from 0 to 1, 028 showed that a titer of greater than or equal to 32 was
   suggestive of exposure to the parasite. Nine percent (9\%) of the 9, 254
   patients had titers of 32 or greater Of 3,503 sera from one clinic,
   which included sera from food handlers undergoing yearly physicals, 390
   (11\%) were positive. In addition, a correlation with age was seen in
   some, but not all, populations. In situations where age-related effects
   were noted, the highest incidence was seen in the youngest (0-20 years)
   and in the oldest (51-60 years) group. Thus, a resurgence of infection
   after a period of lower prevalence may be developing. Overall, this
   study shows that cysticercosis is relatively common and potentially a

Abstract = {{This study examined the organization of the Krebs tricarboxylic acid
   (TCA) cycle by metabolic engineering and high-resolution C-13 NMR, The
   oxidation of {[}1,2,3-C-13]propionate to glutamate via the TCA cycle was
   measured in wild-type (WT) and a citrate synthase mutant (CS-) strain of
   Escherichia coli transformed with allosteric E. coli citrate synthase
   (ECCS) or non-allosteric pig citrate synthase (PCS), The C-13 fractional
   enrichment in glutamate C-2, C-3, and C-4 in ECCS and PCS were similar;
   although quantitative differences in total citrate synthase activity and
   total C-4 labeling of glutamate were observed in ECCS and PCS,
   Allosteric ECCS cells contained 10-fold less total enzyme activity than
   PCS but only 50\% less total labeling in glutamate C-4 and equivalent
   doubling times, The observed spectra were mathematically fitted using an
   iterative procedure (TCACALC) and yielded an acetate/succinyl-CoA flux
   ratio of 10 for both ECCS and PCS, a result that is in agreement with
   the isotopomer analyses of the C-13 spectra of cells presented with
   {[}3-C-13]propionate or {[}2-C-13]propionate, The results are consistent
   with the presence of an allosteric citrate synthase in ECCS and a
   non-allosteric citrate synthase in PCS. The former maintains TCA cycle
   Bur via alternative propionate pathways activated by positive allosteric
   mechanisms and the latter via elevated enzyme levels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews a number of relatively new and promising psychometric
   approaches to the problem of modeling student achievement (the student
   model) within intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). A shared
   characteristic of most ITSs is their need to estimate a model of the
   student's understanding of the domain, and use this model to modify and
   adapt subsequent instructional content and sequence. Sound cognitive
   diagnosis and the need to advance ITS technology require the development
   of student models that are integrated with cognitive theory and
   instructional science. A number of cognitively oriented psychometric
   approaches - including latent-trait models, statistical pattern
   recognition methods, and causal probabilistic networks - are described
   and discussed within the current ITS framework. As measurement-based
   student models are refined, we anticipate their compatibility with
   future generations of intelligent tutoring systems.}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin (IL) 4 is a type 2 cytokine which has a negative
   immunoregulatory role in human infection. IL-4 suppresses the production
   of interferon-gamma and enhances IL-10 synthesis. However, the effect of
   IL-4 on proliferative response of lymphocytes remains to be elucidated.
   We have previously reported an increase in production of IL-4 in
   subjects with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. To evaluate
   whether the increased IL-4 is responsible for the down-regulation of
   immune responses in H. pylori infection, we observed the proliferative
   response of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) co-cultured with
   phythaemagglutinin (PHA) or H. pylori in the presence and absence of
   added IL-4. As we have previously shown, PHA and H. pylori may increase
   PBL proliferation (P < 0.001). An increase in PBL proliferation was
   observed when PBL were co-cultured with PHA (P < 0.001) or H. pylori (P
   < 0.001) in the presence of IL-4 compared to that in the absence of
   IL-4. The optimal dose of IL-4 to give maximal lymphocyte proliferation
   is 50 pg/ml for the PHA-stimulated group or 100 pg/ml for the H.
   pylori-stimulated group. The data suggest that the increased IL-4 does
   not directly contribute to suppressed lymphocyte proliferation in H.
   pylori infection. Further studies will be required to determine the role
   of IL-4 in other aspects of down-regulation of immune responses in H.
   pylori infection.}},

Abstract = {{The subjective forecasts used in decision analysis should, in principle,
   synthesize all available evidence about the subject in analysis. In this

   account the Bayesian methodologies outperformance and quasi-Bayes, as
   well as the classical model of optimal combination, all applied to the
   linear combination of petroleum price forecasts, generated by experts
   from Petrobras-the Brazilian oil company-for several international

   followed by a comparative analysis between performances of the best
   experts' forecasts and combinations. The performances and features of
   these combinations are also compared.}},

Abstract = {{A sensitive method for the measurement of individual Barkhausen events
   has been developed which enables the reconstruction of hysteresis loops
   to be performed with great accuracy. The examination of such loops
   reveals that for Bloch wall transitions a hard axis bias field, H-b, has
   little effect until Hb > 0.5 H-k. At this point, the Bloch walls give
   way to Neel type transitions, which are energetically more favourable.
   There is a decrease in the field required to cause nucleation and the
   loop narrows.
   A model of the Neel wall energy shows a linear decrease in energy as a
   bias field is applied. In this case, the wall energy is proportional to
   the field required to cause rotation in the plane of the material, and
   thus a linear decrease in switching field with bias field is also
   observed.
   Where Neel walls provide the rotation mechanism the loop is also
   observed to shear towards the saturation direction, causing a decrease
   in the permeability of the material. This is thought to be due to an
   increase in the wall stiffness; i.e.; a reluctance for the magnetisation
   in the centre of the walls to rotate away from the bias field direction.}},

Abstract = {{The exclusive rare radiative B decays are studied in the framework of
   the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach in
   quantum held theory. The large recoil momentum of the final vector meson
   allows for the expansion of the decay form factor in inverse powers of
   the b-quark mass. This considerably simplifies the analysis of these
   decays. The 1/m(b) expansion is carried out up to second order. The form
   factor of B --> K{*}gamma decay is found to be F-1(B-->K{*}gamma) (0) =
   0.32 +/- 0.03 and it leads to B(B --> K{*}gamma) = (4.5 +/- 1.5) x
   10(-5), which is in agreement with the recent CLEO data. The form
   factors of the decays B --> rho gamma, B-s --> phi gamma, and B-s -->
   K{*}gamma are also considered. The relation between rare radiative and
   semileptonic B decays into light vector mesons is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Cultured CD4(+) cells are responsible for transfer of adoptive murine
   experimental hypersensitivity pneumonitis (EHP)(ARRD 1992;146:1582-8),
   To characterize interactions that occur in vitro that result in cells
   able to transfer EHP, we added either antibody to IFN-gamma, antibody to
   IL-2, or 30 or 300 mu g/ml IFN-gamma at the onset of 72-hour culture of
   C3H/HeJ spleen cells from either M. faeni or ovalbumin (control)
   sensitized donors with 30 mu g/ml Micropolyspora faeni, We determined
   the phenotype of cells after culture and the amount of IL-2 or IFN-gamma
   in the culture supernatants, transferred cells to naive recipients,
   challenged the recipients intratracheally with M, faeni, and determined
   the extent of pulmonary inflammatory changes 4 days thereafter,
   Substantial amounts of IL-2 and IFN-gamma were detected in supernatants
   of cultures from M, faeni-sensitized animals, and lesser amounts were
   detected in culture supernatants from ovalbumin-sensitized donors.
   Treatment of cultures of M, faeni-sensitized cells with antibody to IL-2
   or IFN-gamma blocked or reduced measurable IL-2 or IFN-gamma for the
   duration of culture, Treatment with IFN-gamma blocked increased levels
   of IL-2 at 48 and 72 hours of culture, Cultured M, faeni-sensitized
   cells adoptively transfer EHP, Cells from cultures depleted of either
   IL-2 or lFN-gamma or supplemented with IFN-gamma could transfer EHP
   equally well, We conclude that in vitro maturation of cells capable of
   adoptive EHP is not dependent on soluble IL-2 or IFN-gamma and is not
   altered by exogenous IFN-gamma.}},

   on the nitrogen of the amido ligand to the tungsten center is reflected
   by the low IR stretching frequencies of the carbonyl ligands and their
   downfield carbon resonance in the C-13 NMR. NMR spectra and an X-ray
   structure of Tp'(CO)(2)W{[}N(CH(2)Ph)CH=CHPh] (1c) indicate that the

   older. In a limited number of studies in small patient groups, high
   mortality has been shown in patients undergoing AVR after CABG. We
   undertook this study to determine the mortality risk factors for
   patients who undergo AVR after CABG procedures.
   Methods and Results The outcome of 104 patients treated at our
   institution between January 1983 and December 1993 was retrospectively
   reviewed. The initial surgery was CABG in all patients. The patient
   population included 86 men (83\%) and 18 women (17\%); their mean age
   was 67 years. Overall, 70\% of patients had congestive heart failure,
   and 96\% had multivessel coronary artery disease. The diagnosis was
   aortic stenosis in 68\% of patients, aortic insufficiency in 16\%, and
   combined aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency in 16\%. Postoperative
   complications included worsening congestive heart failure (35\%),
   perioperative myocardial infarction (13\%), and bleeding (28\%). The
   early mortality was 14\%, and the late mortality was 17\% (mean
   follow-up, 35 months). The risk factors for early mortality were number
   of diseased vessels (P=.028), renal failure (0.000), and prior
   myocardial infarction (P=.028). A perioperative predictor of early
   mortality was cardiopulmonary bypass time (P=.000). The risk factors for
   late mortality included preoperative diabetes mellitus (P=.007),
   postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (P=.011), and
   ventricular arrhythmias (P=.0001). The survival dt 1, 5, and 10 years
   was 96\%, 75\%, and 49\%: respectively.
   Conclusions Risk factors were identified for early and late mortality in
   patients undergoing AVR after previous CABG. Although early morbidity
   and mortality were high, the long term outcome of the survivors was
   favorable.}},

Abstract = {{We have used an experimental model of continuous ambulatory peritoneal
   dialysis (CARD) to investigate the effect of dialysis on host defense
   mechanisms in the peritoneal cavity, Laboratory rats undergoing regular
   dialysis were challenged with a single bolus of Staphylococcus
   epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, Intraperitoneal challenges with all four microbial strains
   underwent a rapid clearance during the first 4 hours, irrespective of
   whether the host was undergoing dialysis, Studies using S epidermidis
   showed that the rapid clearance was not mediated by the diaphragmatic
   stomata as might have been expected, Dialysis did, however, cause delays
   over the following 48 hours with all of the pathogens except C albicans.
   Bacterial clearance over a 10-day period was strain dependant, and
   microbial persistence was related to adhesion formation around the
   cannula, Again C albicans was an exception, Our conclusions are that
   dialysis does not affect the innate defense mechanisms involved in the
   early clearance of a bolus challenge to the peritoneal cavity but can
   cause delays in eradicating microorganisms that survive this phase,
   Because these experiments were carried out using a bolus inoculum, it
   may be necessary to reevaluate the effect of dialysis on host defenses
   in the peritoneal cavity under conditions in which the challenge more
   closely approximates a touch contamination event. (C) 1995 by the

Abstract = {{A strong relationship between current vegetation and the opal phytolith
   content of surface soil was established. Opal phytoliths obtained from
   buried soil surface horizons 200-800 years old were then used to
   establish a profile of the vegetation present on four sites within
   Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, USA, prior to European settlement. The
   plant communities so reconstructed contained more forbs and/or shrubs
   than present-day communities and were dominated by cool-season rather
   than warm-season grasses. Although these differences could be due to
   climate change, the pattern of change from cool-season to warm-season
   grasses is not consistent with the accepted pattern of climate change.
   Grazing pressure could account for this change in plant community
   composition. Livestock tend to graze Capitol Reef in the cool season,
   and the area is rested from grazing during the warm season. This pattern
   could account for the decline in cool-season grasses. Phytolith analyses
   can serve as an alternative method for assessing the impact of
   management on grasslands. This method is particularly valuable when no
   comparable `'undisturbed'' control area exists.}},

Abstract = {{The objective appearance of negative symptoms in schizophrenia and other
   psychotic disorders may be a direct reflection of a primary neural
   abnormality or may be secondary to a variety of factors such as
   neuroleptic side effects, depression, positive symptoms, or
   environmental understimulation. Although there is a consensus that it is
   important to be able to disentangle `'primary'' versus `'secondary''
   negative symptoms, optimal strategies for doing so remain unclear.
   Concerns have been raised about making this distinction based on
   clinical judgment because of potential low reliability in the absence of
   extensive training and/or highly specialized rating scales. This is
   particularly important in terms of the application of DSM-IV criteria
   for schizophrenia, in which negative symptoms play a prominent role. In
   the context of the DSM IV schizophrenia field trial project, we examined
   the reliability of making the primary versus secondary distinction in a
   multicenter sample of 462 subjects with nonorganic psychotic disorders.
   Each subject was assessed by two raters, half in an interrater design
   (i.e., conjoint interviews) and half in a test-retest design (i.e.,
   independent interviews by two raters conducted 1 day apart). All raters
   used the same semistructured interview instrument, which included an
   abbreviated version of the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms
   (SANS). In addition to the usual SANS ratings, raters were asked to
   indicate their judgment as to whether the symptom was primary,
   secondary, or unknown (inadequate information to assess). No formal
   training was provided. Reliability, as quantified by kappa, indicated
   only a fair degree of agreement ranging from 0.48 to 0.68 for interrater
   reliability (median, 0.50) and 0.34 to 0.66 for test-retest reliability
   (median, 0.38). Negative symptoms were rated as primary approximately
   twice as often as secondary, and raters believed they had adequate
   information to make this distinction based only on cross-sectional
   evaluation in all but 10\% of the cases, These data suggest that the
   primary versus secondary distinction should not be incorporated into the
   application of operationalized diagnostic criteria. Implications are
   discussed in terms of balancing reliability and validity in the
   assessment of negative symptoms. Copyright (C) 1995 by W.B. Saunders

Abstract = {{Corrective maintenance Of pavements involves identifying the existing
   problems and selecting the most effective remedial measure to correct
   the deficiencies. Regular inspection and minor repairs ensure a
   satisfactory level of pavement performance, and it prevents the
   occurrence of future major problems. Due to the unbalanced proportion of
   too many pavements in need of repairs and too few experienced engineers
   to carry out the task of condition and treatment evaluation, pavement
   inspections acid necessary repairs are irregular and are not performed
   as often as needed. More often than not, methods of rehabilitation are
   more practically available than competent engineers. The dissemination
   of expert knowledge about pavement inspection and treatment evaluation
   by means of knowledge-based systems to a wider group of engineers (such
   as local maintenance personnel) is needed. This paper discusses the
   maintenance requirements in Ontario, Canada, and presents the
   development of a prototype object-oriented knowledge-based system for

Abstract = {{A case of primary lymphoma of the liver in a 72-year-old man is
   reported. The patient showed a three to four month history of abdominal
   ache, low grade fever, and weight loss. The presence of a large mass
   occupying the V and VT hepatic segments was demonstrated; no other
   organs were involved and no evidence of lymphoadenopathy was found.
   Laboratory tests showed a remarkable increase in ESR, LDH and alkaline
   phosphatase while CEA and alpha-1 fetoprotein were within the normal
   values. Two ultrasound-guided needle biopsies on the hepatic lesion did
   not produce any significant tissue for diagnosis. Therefore the V and VI
   hepatic segments were excised; a hard, greyish mass with the largest
   diameter of 6.5 cm, was found at laparatomy. Histology of the surgical
   specimen showed the presence of a malignant non-Hodgking's B-cell
   lymphoma, centroblastic-centrocytic, diffuse type (working formulation:
   G) of intermediate grade of malignancy. Staging was completed with
   lymphography, and bone marrow biopsy; both proved normal. After the
   operation adjuvant chemotherapy was commenced (COP for six cycles).
   Follow-up has so far shown no signs of recurrence after 24 months. In
   conclusion, the diagnosis of primary lymphoma of the liver is very
   difficult and is often reached only after histologic evaluation of the
   surgical specimen. Moreover, this disease has a much more favourable
   prognosis than the hepatocellular carcinoma and other primary or
   secondary liver cancers; therefore accurate investigations are important
   to reach the correct diagnosis.}},

   characteristics of ragweed (Ambrosia spp) pollen dispersal in the United
   States date back 60 years to work conducted with gravity slide samples.
   Objective: Volumetric pollen data from 23 sampling sites were used to
   study the ragweed pollen season.
   Methods: The date of first and final pollen capture and the date with
   maximum airborne pollen concentration (the `'peak date'') were used to
   compare the pollen seasons at locations ranging from approximately 30
   degrees N to 45 degrees N latitude.
   Results: Sixteen cities located north of 38 degrees N possessed similar
   peak dates (P = 1), generally achieving maximum airborne pollen
   concentration in late August or early September. Four cities located
   south of 38 degrees N experienced later peak dates, with the most
   southerly city reaching maximum pollen levels in mid-October. Three
   cities located in the Northwest did not recover ragweed pollen in air
   samples.
   Conclusion: This study confirms earlier reports and suggests what time
   of year source avoidance is most critical for ragweed sensitive
   individuals in various locations.}},

Abstract = {{Infection with Cryptococcus neoformans occurs with increased frequency
   in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite the
   lungs being the portal of entry for the fungus the commonest

   infection occurs less commonly, The chest radiographs of fourteen HIV
   positive patients with cryptococcal pneumonia were reviewed, The
   commonest radiographic abnormalities mere interstitial infiltrates,
   (nine patients) and focal or widespread alveolar consolidation (seven
   patients), Ground glass shadowing, not previously described in
   cryptococcal pneumonia, occurred in sis radiographs, miliary nodules in
   one, lymphadenopathy in four, and small pleural effusions in three. Two
   patients had a normal chest radiograph.
   In contrast to previous reports, we found alveolar consolidation and
   ground glass shadowing to be common and nodules and cavitation to be
   rare, Cryptococcal pneumonia should be considered in the differential

   Twenty tumors showed a positive reaction with the monoclonal antibody

   significantly correlated with a tumor size larger than 2 cm, a low
   estrogen receptor status and DNA-aneuploidy. Bcl-2 was demonstrated in
   51 breast cancers. Bcl-2 was preferably seen in low grade and hormone
   receptor positive tumors. We found a negative correlation between the
   immunoreactive scores of p53 and bcl-2, but in 17 carcinomas a
   coexpression of both proteins was seen. Cases with this coexpression did
   not differ significantly from the other tumors in clinicopathological

   and IGFBPs in rats. Am. J. Physiol. 269 (Endocrinol. Metab. 32):
   E840-E845, 1995.-Thyroid hormones are suggested to have a permissive
   role in growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
   action and a specific effect on plasma levels of some of the
   GH-independent IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). We have investigated the
   effect of thyroxine (T-4) administration on circulating levels of free
   and total (extractable) IGF-I and IGFBPs in 8-wk-old rats treated with
   0, 200, 400, and 600 mu g/kg T-4, respectively. Serum free IGF-I was
   determined by an ultrafiltration method, serum total IGF-I after
   acid-ethanol extraction, and serum IGFBPs using Western ligand blotting,
   which yielded four distinct molecular bands: two single bands at 24 and
   30 kDa and a double band at 38 and 42 kDa (38-32 kDa). After 13 days of
   hyperthyroidism, serum total IGF-I and the high-molecular 38-42-kDa
   IGFBP were unchanged, whereas the 24-kDa IGFBP and 30-kDa IGFBP
   increased significantly (P < 0.05). Serum free IGF-I was significantly
   (P < 0.05) decreased in animals treated with 400 and 600 mu g/kg T-4 In
   addition, free IGF-I correlated inversely (P < 0.005) with the 24-kDa
   IGFBP, 30-kDa IGFBP, and serum total triiodothyronine. We conclude that
   hyperthyroidism in rats increases the circulating low-molecular IGFBPs
   and induces a reduction in free IGF-I. This may provide an important
   regulation of IGF bioactivity by thyroid hormones.}},

   the measurement of the time resolution of the profile of H-beta

Abstract = {{All three well-studied subunits of the clotting protein fibrinogen
   (alpha, beta, gamma) share N-terminal structural homologies, but until
   recently only the beta and gamma chains were recognized as having
   similar globular C-termini. With the discovery of an extra exon in the
   human fibrinogen alpha gene (exon VI), a minor form of the alpha subunit
   (alpha(E)) with an extended beta- and gamma-like C-terminus has been
   identified (Fu et al., Biochemistry 31, 11968, 1992). In the present
   study, the polymerase chain reaction has been used to identify sequences
   that encode counterparts to alpha(E) in chicken, rabbit, rat, and
   baboon. The basic six-exon structure of the fibrinogen alpha genes is
   shown to be conserved among mammals and birds, as are the intron
   positions. Bipartite transcripts-still bearing an intron prior to the
   last exon-are found among the products of the various vertebrate
   fibrinogen alpha genes. The last exon represents the largest conserved
   segment of the gene and, in each species examined, encodes exactly 236
   amino acids. The C-termini of these alpha(E) chains align without a
   single gap and are between 76 and 99\% identical. Since the exon
   VI-encoded domain of alpha(E) is as well conserved as the corresponding
   regions of the beta and gamma chains, it follows that it is equally
   important and that alpha(E)-fibrinogen plays a vital, if as-yet
   unrecognized physiological role. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Peptide YY (PYY) release was studied by measuring radioimmunoassayable
   PYY in the arterial plasma of anaesthetized rats receiving into the
   duodenum, ileum or colon either a complete semi-liquid meal (3 mi, 21
   kJ) or elemental nutrients as isocaloric or isoosmolar solutions. PYY
   release induced by the intraduodenal meal peaked at 60 min and lasted
   more than 120 min. The integrated response of PYY over 120 min was
   larger when the meal was administered into the duodenum than into the
   ileum. The undigested meal induced no release of PYY over a 120-min
   period when administered into the colon. When injected into the duodenum
   in isocaloric amounts to the meal, glucose and amino acids led to the
   release of as much PYY as did the meal, whereas oleic acid led to the
   release of less PYY. Part of these responses were due to osmolarity,
   since administration of intraduodenal hyperosmolar saline led to the
   release of about half as much PYY as did hyperosmolar glucose. In
   moderate amounts, and injected as a solution isoosmolar to plasma, oleic
   acid was a major PYY releaser; the amounts released were at least two
   times larger when oleic acid was administered into the duodenum than
   into the ileum and colon, Isoosmolar glucose and amino acids led to the
   release of no PYY when injected into the duodenum, but were nearly as
   active as oleic acid in the colon. Short-chain fatty acids induced the
   release of PYY when injected into the colon, but not into the ileum.
   Hexamethonium suppressed PYY release induced by the intraduodenal meal,
   but did not change PYY release induced by glucose or oleic acid in the
   colon. Urethane anaesthesia did not reduce PYY release induced by the
   intraduodenal meal. These results suggest that two mechanisms at least
   contribute to PYY release in the rat, An indirect, neural mechanism,
   involving nicotinic synapses, is prominent in the proximal small
   intestine: the stimulation is transmitted to ileal and colonic L-cells
   by undetermined pathways, but contact of nutrients with L-cells is not
   needed. Another mechanism, probably direct and quantitatively smaller,
   occurs in the distal intestine when nutrients come into contact with the
   mucosa containing L-cells. Glucose, fatty acids and amino acids
   stimulate differentially the proximal and distal mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of two dipoles moving perpendicularly to the gradient of
   background vorticity is studied both numerically and experimentally. In
   the numerical computations the vorticity distribution is represented
   either by four point vortices (point-vortex model) or by thousands of
   them (vortex-in-cell method). The simplest model is used to study the
   dynamics and the advection of fluid particles in two kinds of
   interaction: coaxial couples of equal strength but different size, and
   equal parallel couples with a nonzero impact parameter (the distance
   between the dipoles' axis). As a result of the interaction fluid masses
   are exchanged between the two dipoles and between each dipole and the
   ambient fluid. In the case of equal coaxial couples the amount of fluid
   exchanged depends on the gradient of ambient vorticity, with the largest
   mass exchange occurring always between the eastward traveling dipole and
   the ambient fluid. The collision of parallel couples with nonzero impact
   parameter leads to a large mass exchange, either because several
   interactions may occur or because when two independent couples arise,
   they have a nonuniform motion. Laboratory experiments in a rotating
   fluid (with a flat sloping bottom providing the beta effect), confirm
   that an elastic interaction is a rare event. The unstable trajectory of
   the westward traveling dipole, as well as small perturbations
   unavoidable in the laboratory, invariably lead to collisions of
   nonaligned dipoles. The gross features of the vortex motion, as well as
   of the mass exchange, are well modeled using the point-vortex model,
   whereas the vortex-in-cell method reproduces many details of the vortex
   motion, the evolution of the vorticity field, and the exchange of mass.

   dependence is evidence of negligible surface migration both on the
   epilayer and mask surfaces. The growth rate enhancement produced by mask
   patterning increased and saturated as growth pressure increased. Our
   theory predicts, however, that enhancement is proportional to growth
   pressure when the growing probability on the mask surface is exactly
   zero, This contradiction suggests that chemical reaction at the mask
   surface reduces the vapor phase concentration of group III source
   materials. This assumption successfully quantitatively predicted the

Abstract = {{The clinical pharmacology and clinically important drug interactions of
   methotrexate (MTX) are reviewed. The points discussed are as follows.
   (a) The bioavailability of oral preparations of MTX is approximately
   15-20\% lower than that of intramuscular or intravenous MTX, although
   there is great variability in relative bioavailability. (b)
   Protein-binding displacements are unlikely to be of importance with this
   low-to-medium protein-binding drug. Because MTX is polyglutamated and
   remains within cells, dialysis is unlikely to be an effective mode of
   elimination. The principal excretory pathway of MTX is via the kidneys,
   although some is also excreted through the bile. These facts imply that:
   (i) MTX needs to be used with extreme caution, if at all, in the face of
   renal insufficiency; (ii) cholestyramine may be used to enhance the
   biliary excretion of MTX; and (iii) probenecid may be a cost-effective
   way to increase the efficacy of MTX. (c) Although aspirin inhibits MTX
   clearance more than other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
   (NSAIDs), clinical toxicity of aspirin is not significantly greater than
   that of other NSAIDs. In all cases this negative interaction is very
   rare (although, of course, it needs to be considered at all times). (d)
   It is possible that corticosteroids inhibit MTX metabolism, although
   this requires significant research. (e) Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole
   (TS) toxicity is well documented and may be related to synergistic
   anti-folate effects of MTX and TS. (f) Folic acid decreases MTX
   toxicity, possibly through an effect on dihydrofolate reductase.}},

   completely blocked by a hydroxide film. In the anodic polarization
   curves measured in the Watts electrolyte at pH 5.7, freshly deposited
   nickel demonstrates an anodic current peak, in the vicinity of which it
   is oxidized with the formation of a passivating film containing two to
   three atomic layers of nickel. As the concentration of H+ or Cl- ions in
   the electrolyte increases, the film thickness increases up to 10 times.
   Deposits with foreign inclusions are more active, are passivated more
   quickly than pure deposits, and demonstrate the anodic current peak of
   Ni oxidation only at a high rate of potential increase.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine whether adoption of dietary patterns consistent

   combined with exercise training, result in significant reductions in
   cardiovascular risk compared with a regimen of exercise therapy alone.
   Design A randomized trial to compare the effects of exercise alone (n =
   17) with the effects of exercise and dietary intervention (n = 15).
   Setting McClellan Air Force Base medical clinic (Sacramento, Calif).
   Subjects Thirty-two members of the Air Force (20 men and 12 women) were
   recruited at the time they entered a 90-day fitness improvement program.
   Mean age was 32 years.
   Intervention All subjects participated in a 90-day fitness program. Half
   of the group received individualized dietary counseling using the Food
   Guide Pyramid as a primary educational tool.
   Main outcome measures Changes in body mass index, plasma lipids and
   lipoprotein levels, aerobic capacity, and dietary intake were selected
   to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.
   Statistical analyses performed Outcome measures were evaluated by
   analysis of variance. A paired t test was performed to compare changes
   in food-group servings and food-group fat intake from baseline values
   for the exercise-plus-diet group.
   Results Percentage of energy from fat decreased from 39\% to 23\% for
   the exercise-plus-diet group, and servings from each of the food groups
   changed to reflect current guidelines. This group also had significant
   reductions in body mass index, total cholesterol level, and low-density
   Lipoprotein level: 2\% (P = .0001), 9\% (P = .003), and 13\% (P = .005),
   respectively. No change was observed for the exercise-only group.
   Additionally, a significant improvement in maximum oxygen consumption (P
   = .01) of 38\% (vs 14\% for the control group) was achieved.
   Conclusions Dietary modification in accordance with the Food Guide
   Pyramid and the US Dietary Guidelines results in significant reductions
   in known cardiovascular risk factors and improves the response to
   exercise training.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade more than 90\% of all melanoma patients in the
   German-speaking countries have been diagnosed with a primary tumour
   alone. Therefore, surgical intervention has been the most important
   element in the management of these patients. The present investigation
   was performed to analyse the different surgical procedures used in the
   treatment of primary melanoma during the years 1983-1993. The primary
   treatment of 15,054 patients with malignant melanoma and without
   recognizable metastasis has been examined. During the time period under
   investigation the percentage of cases treated with two-step surgical
   management increased from 30\% to 60\%. Primary excision was performed
   in local anaesthesia in 40\% of all patients in 1983, whereas in 1993
   surgical intervention under local anaesthesia had increased up to 80\%.
   Over the same time, the average safety margin decreased from 33 mm to 21
   mm for the final excision of primary melanomas, and this decrease was
   paralleled by marked decrease in the average thickness of the tumours
   excised from 2.1 to 1.5 mm. Elective node dissection was performed in
   5\% of all patients in 1983, whereas 9\% of patients underwent elective
   node dissection in 1993. The different centres participating were found
   to differ noticeably in the therapeutic procedures applied for similar
   Indications. In conclusion, the management of primary malignant melanoma
   has changed considerably during the years 1983-1993 in the German
   speaking area in favour of a two-step surgical procedure, local
   anaesthesia for the excision of the primary tumour and smaller safety
   margins. It seems that earlier diagnosis of the tumour and also ideas
   about treatment design may be responsible for these changes.}},

   elements was possible through the multielement capabilities of hydride
   generation, with in situ trapping and atomization in a graphite tube
   coated with zirconium and measurements using a dual channel atomic
   absorption spectrophotometer. The zirconium coating employed in this
   work was relatively stable; once formed it could stand approximate to 80
   firings without any significant change in the efficiency of hydride
   collection. This appears to be an advantage over the palladium coating,
   which is usually formed individually before each measurement because of
   its thermal instability during the atomization step of the furnace
   temperature programme. As a result, two determinations of the two
   elements could be performed in 2.5 min. Under the optimized conditions,
   concentration detection limits of 17 and 13 ng 1(-1) for a 7.1 ml sample
   volume were obtained for selenium and arsenic, respectively (absolute
   detection limits 120 and 92 pg for Se and As).}},

Title = {{Recurrences and second primary tumours in the head and neck region:
   Differentiation by p53 mutation analysis}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{933-939}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients with head and neck cancer are at high risk of
   developing additional primary tumours in the aerodigestive tract as a
   result of field cancerization phenomena. In this context, the appearance
   of a new neoplasm often poses a problem of differential diagnosis
   between recurrence and new primary tumour. The differentiation between
   the two entities is essentially clinical and conventionally based on the
   histological and spatio-temporal relations between the two lesions;
   however, the validity of these criteria has still to be assessed.
   Design: To evaluate whether field cancerization phenomena may affect the
   clinical diagnosis of relapse/metastasis in the head and neck region,
   p53 mutation pattern was analysed in a series of primary tumours and
   corresponding recurrences/metastases. The rationale was that, since p53
   mutations are a very early and polymorphic phenomenon, a
   recurrence/metastasis must retain the same mutation as the primary
   tumour, whereas independent tumours are likely to display a different
   p53 gene status.
   Results:Molecular analysis provided conclusive results in 9 of 12 case
   analysed. The clinical diagnosis of recurrence was confirmed by
   molecular analysis in 4 of these cases. In contrast, a differential p53
   mutation pattern supported an independent origin for 3 presumed local
   recurrences and 2 lung lesions.
   Conclusions: The use of p53 mutation analysis as a clonality marker
   allowed us to ascertain the inadequacy of the current diagnostic
   criteria for the differentiation between a new independent tumour and
   recurrence/metastasis. These findings substantiate the relevance of
   field cancerization phenomena in the head and neck region and prompt the
   use of p53 mutation analysis as a fundamental tool to improve the
   diagnosis and management of head and neck cancers.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for intrafollicular treatment with a transvaginal
   ultrasound-guided injection needle was developed using equine chorionic
   gonadotropin (eCG) as the test substance. An injection was made into one
   growing follicle of a wave when the follicles were 20 to 23 mm. The
   treated follicles were injected with 1000 iu of eCG in 0.2 ml saline
   solution and control follicles were injected with 0.2 ml of the saline
   vehicle (10 mares per group, 1 follicle per mare). The injection system
   used an inner 25-gauge needle and an outer 20-gauge needle inserted
   together through the needle-guide channel of a linear-array transvaginal
   transducer. The outer needle was pushed through the vaginal wall and the
   inner needle was then advanced into the follicle during monitoring on
   the ultrasound screen. The turbulence in the follicular fluid associated
   with injection was observable on the screen. Seven follicles were
   successfully injected in each group. The follicular fluid in the control
   follicles remained anechoic until the follicle was no longer
   identifiable or ovulated. All 7 follicles in the eCG group showed
   ultrasonic indications of luteinization, based on the formation of an
   echogenic, thickened wall or area. Five of the 7 developed a central
   area that had the ultrasonic appearance of a blood clot similar to the
   appearance of a corpus hemorrhagicum. Ovulation was not detected in any
   of the eCG-treated follicles. The maximum post-treatment diameter of
   follicles was greater (P<0.05) for the eCG group (32.7 +/- 3.8 mm) than
   for the control group (23.4 +/- 1.8 mm). The mean diameter for the first
   5 days post-treatment (before the occurrence of an ovulation in any
   mare) was also greater (P<0.002) in the eCG group (21.6 +/- 0.8 mm vs
   19.6 +/- 0.8 mm). Results indicated that this novel research approach is
   practical and has potential for studies on folliculogenesis. The
   technique provides a research model between the extremes of an in vitro
   culture system and treatment of the whole animal.}},

Abstract = {{A new system for long-term vascular access in the unrestrained rat (n =
   380) is described that combines low cost with high reliability and free
   movement. It consists of a polyurethane catheter that is placed in the
   right atrium via the external jugular vein. A leather harness is applied
   to the animal and the catheter passed subcutaneously to the neck into
   the harness. The harness is connected to the outside of a swivel joint
   via a silicone tube in which the catheter runs. The catheter is
   connected to the inside of the swivel. The swivel is a modified
   conventional 5-mL glass syringe and is positioned in ball bearings and
   Johnson joint. Swivel, ball bearings, and the Johnson joint are
   counterbalanced and can move up and down. With this system all catheter
   functioned well until they were electively removed after 28 days. Four
   catheter dislocations resulted from harness failure and three from a
   twisted catheter. Seven cases of septicemia and eight of thrombosis
   cccured. All animals gained weight (3.53 +/- 0.37 {[}SEM] g/d) during
   the time the system was in place. The entire apparatus is simple and
   inexpensive to construct. The rotary portion of the swivel and the
   Johnson joint avoid twisting of the catheter, and the counterbalance
   enables the animal to move up and down. The low thrombogenicity of
   polyurethane further reduced complications. This system reduces stress
   for the animal during long-term investigations.}},

   their proposal a monomolecular layer of a charge transfer species
   controls current flow between a pair of metal electrodes, allowing easy
   flow for only one polarity of the applied voltage. Such metal/molecular
   layer/metal structures have now been fabricated, utilising the
   self-ordering properties of Langmuir-Blodgett films to form the organic
   layer, with one dimension of the device being reduced to the molecular
   scale, The fabrication techniques involved in the generation of these
   M/LB/M junctions are now described along with the present understanding
   of conduction mechanisms through such nanoscale thickness junctions,
   These structures clearly show that the organic molecular layers can
   control current passage in electronic devices emulating some of the
   characteristics of an inorganic semiconducting p-n junction.}},

Abstract = {{Immunocytochemical studies examining the Ki-67 proliferation marker in
   paraffin-embedded material have recently been made possible by the
   availability of several antibodies, notably MIB-1, which are readily
   applicable to microwaved sections. Using breast cancer material, the
   present study examines correlations shown by these new paraffin assays
   and also by PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), an existing
   marker of proliferation, with the established Ki-67 cryosection assay.
   Paraffin sections were microwaved prior to incubation with Ki-67 or
   MIB-1 antibodies. Signal detection was carried out with a biotinylated
   secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, and DAB/H2O2
   chromogen. The results suggest that caution is required when studying
   proliferation in paraffin-embedded breast cancers by immunostaining
   using Ki-67 antibodies. Nuclear staining in wax sections (Ki-Par, MIB-1,
   PCNA) greatly exceeded that in cryosections (Ki-Froz) and thus
   correlations were notably absent between Ki-Par or PCNA immunostaining
   and the routine Ki-Froz assay. Immunostaining with MIB-1 or PCNA may,
   however, be useful to assess proliferation if cut-offs are applied to
   eliminate weak immunostaining associated with wax sections. Thus, an
   approximately linear relationship was seen between MIB-1/Ki-Froz, which
   was improved if only moderately or moderately/strongly MIB-1-positive
   cells were scored. Similarly, a significant correlation was also
   revealed between PCNA/Ki-Froz if such a cut-off was applied.}},

Abstract = {{Fish communities from four catchments in the Murray-Darling river system

   Using the annual proportional flow deviation as a measure of river

   Darling River catchment as mildly regulated and the Murrumbidgee River
   and River Murray catchments as highly regulated. A total of 11 010 fish,
   representing nine native and three alien species, was caught during high
   and low flow seasons in the four catchments. Native species, such as
   golden perch Macquaria ambigua (Percichthyidae), bony herring Nematalosa
   erebi (Clupeidae) and spangled perch Leiopotherapon unicolor
   (Teraponidae), dominated fish communities in the Paroo and Darling
   catchments, but alien species, mostly carp, Cyprinus carpio
   (Cyprinidae), were also abundant. Both native and alien species were
   more abundant in these catchments after flooding, but there was little
   change in species composition between high and low flow seasons at the
   catchment level. Carp dominated communities in the Murray and
   Murrumbidgee catchments. There was a significant trend for reduced
   species diversity in increasingly regulated catchments. River regulation
   may alter the relative abundance of native and alien fish by
   desynchronizing environmental cycles and the reproductive cycles of
   native species. Ordination of species abundances showed discrete fish
   communities that reflect the geographical separation between catchments.
   Differences between communities are related to opportunities for
   dispersal, the environmental tolerances of dominant species and the
   modifying effects of river regulation. Fish communities in lakes
   exhibited less seasonal variation than riverine communities within the
   same catchment, indicating the greater seasonal stability of lakes
   compared with regulated and unregulated river reaches. Management of
   fish resources needs to include catchment-specific strategies within
   current State and basin-wide management programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate whether the efficacy of naltrexone administration
   in patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea correlates to the response to
   an acute naloxone test.
   Design: Thirty patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea associated with
   weight loss were studied. After naloxone test (4 mg in bolus IV)
   patients were divided in two groups: group A, nonresponsive (n = 15) and
   group B, responsive (n = 15). Group A underwent two cycles of hormonal
   replacement therapy with E(2) patches and medroxyprogesterone acetate.
   Then all patients were administered naltrexone at the dosage 50 mg/d
   orally for 6 months. A third group of 10 amenorrheic patients were
   treated with oral placebo with the same schedule.
   Results: Plasma gonadal steroid levels increased in all patients and in
   24 of 30 patients the menstrual bleeding occurred within 90 days from
   the beginning of treatment. After 6 months from naltrexone
   discontinuation, 18 of 24 patients still showed the occurrence of
   menstrual cycles. Luteinizing hormone plasma levels and LH pulse
   amplitude increased after 3 months of treatment and remained unchanged 6
   months after naltrexone suspension. Plasma FSH levels did not show any
   change in any patient. The body mass index increased after 3 months in
   all patients who menstruated. Patients treated with placebo did not show
   any significant change in gonadotropins and gonadal steroid plasma
   levels.
   Conclusions: The present study supports the efficacy of naltrexone
   therapy for patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea either responsive or
   nonresponsive to naloxone test.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the conceptual part-whole relation as it occurs in
   language processing, visual perception, and general problem solving. One
   important long-term goal is to develop a naive or common sense theory of
   the mereological domain, that is the domain of parts and wholes and
   their relations. In this paper, we work towards such a theory by
   presenting a classification of part-whole relations that is suitable for
   different cognitive tasks and give proposals for the representation and
   processing of these relations. In order to be independent of specific
   tasks like language understanding or the recognition of objects, we use
   structural properties to develop our classification.
   The paper starts with a brief overview of the mereological research in
   different disciplines and two examples of the role of part-whole
   relations in linguistics (possessive constructions) and knowledge
   processing (reasoning about objects). In the second section, we discuss
   two important approaches to mereological problems: the `'Classical
   Extensional Mereology'' as presented by Simons and the meronymic system
   of part-whole relations proposed by Winston, Chaffin and Hermann. Our
   own work is described in the third and last section. First, we discuss
   different kinds of wholes according to their inherent compositional
   structure; complexes, collections, and masses. Then partitions induced
   by or independent of the compositional structure of a whole are
   described, accompanied by proposals for their processing. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Analyses of satellite-derived SSM/I winds and AVHRR sea surface
   temperatures are used to compute weekly estimates of global meridional
   ocean Ekman heat transport for the 4-year period 1987 - 1991. The heat
   transport is consistently poleward throughout the year over the Atlantic
   and much of the Pacific between 30 degrees S and 30 degrees N and
   equatorward at higher latitudes. The zonally integrated Ekman heat
   transport in the Pacific was weak and equatorward at 10 degrees N in
   September 1989 and 1990, whereas in other years it is poleward
   throughout the year. In the Indian Ocean, equatorward heat transport was
   Strongest in Northern Hemisphere summer 1990. The weekly time series
   provides better temporal resolution than previous studies that at best
   used monthly averages. The higher-frequency variations are explored
   through rotated empirical orthogonal functions (REOFs) of nonseasonal
   heat transport anomalies. The REOFs show large-scale coherence across
   the tropical and subtropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. The first REOF
   has a strong spectral peak at periods of 50-60 days and is dominated by
   the variability in the Southern Hemisphere Indian Ocean. The second REOF
   is dominated by the variance in the Northern Hemisphere Indian Ocean and
   western tropical North Pacific. The first four REOFs, which explain
   22.5\% of the nonseasonal variance, have spectral peaks at periods
   consistent with the 30-60 day atmospheric Madden-Julian oscillation.
   These periods were not resolved in the monthly averaged data from GOADS.
   Singular spectrum analysis has been used as a filter to show the long
   timescale variations. The early phase of the 1988-89 La Nina has a
   strong influence on the heat transport, indicating enhanced poleward
   heat transport in the eastern Indian Ocean, tropical North Pacific, and
   tropical and subtropical South Pacific and enhanced equatorward heat
   transport in the midlatitude North Pacific and western tropical Indian
   Ocean.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate differences among brain-derived microglia and other
   classes of immune cells, we compared the morphologies and growth
   properties of mononuclear phagocytes isolated from tissues of the
   newborn rat. Scanning EM shows that microglia from postnatal rat brain
   are covered with spines (typically >20 per cell body) in a distinctive
   manner which contrasts the smooth surfaces of bone marrow cells and the
   ruffled surfaces of tissue macrophages from spleen, liver, and
   peritoneum. The spine-bearing surface of microglia is a specific cell
   marker, for it does not change with age or after exposure to cytokines
   or other immunostimulants. Approximately 99\% of mononuclear phagocytes
   cultured from normal adult rat brain are spinous microglia. Five days
   after injury to rat brain, cells at sites of Wallerian degeneration are
   essentially all spinous ones while nearly 30\% of cells found within
   areas of infarction or penetrating trauma are invading macrophages. In a
   similar way, nearly all cells isolated from normal, postmortem adult
   human brain are spine-bearing microglia (>99\% homogeneity). Brains from
   patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis contain only spinous
   microglia whereas cells from HIV-1 infected brains include significant
   numbers of invading ruffled macrophages.
   Cultured microglia, unlike cultured bone marrow precursors, monocytes,
   or tissue macrophages, spontaneously develop long, thin processes that
   extend hundreds of microns in length. Microglia retract these processes
   after exposure to fetal bovine serum, laminin, or such immunostimulants
   as recombinant murine interferon gamma (rmIFN gamma) and
   lipopolysaccharide. Of all types of mononuclear phagocytes tested, only
   microglia differentiate into quiescent ramified cells when in Contact
   with astrocytes. Thus, microglia represent a unique class of cell
   maintained, in part, by astroglia as dormant, ramified mononuclear
   phagocytes in mature CNS. Application of cell surface criteria described
   here will allow study of distinct populations of mononuclear phagocytes
   associated with neurologic disorders.}},

   has been investigated. Mathematical simulations have been conducted for
   an experimental reactor comprising a thin but continuous layer of a

   hydrogen through the composite membrane were determined experimentally.
   A rate equation for ammonia decomposition over Ni/Al2O3 catalysts was
   coupled with the experimentally determined hydrogen permeation rate data
   to obtain results for various reactor configurations. The results
   presented here have demonstrated the superiority of such a composite
   membrane reactor system over other methods. Furthermore, complete
   destruction of the ammonia was achieved for the relatively short space
   times considered in this study and can also be applied in operations
   carried out under gasification conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Precision in femoral neck scans with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry
   (DXA) is affected by variability in positioning and subsequent
   repositioning of the femur for repeated scans. To study the in vitro
   effect of femoral rotation on the bone mineral density (BMD), four
   fresh-frozen cadaveric femurs were fixed in a specially designed jig
   which allows for rotation of the femurs. BMD measurements of the femurs
   were done in neutral position (0 degrees) i.e., with the femoral neck
   axis parallel to the surface of the couch and at 15 degrees, 30 degrees,
   and 45 degrees of internal and external rotation. In vivo precision of
   the femoral neck scan was determined in five normal male subjects. The
   scans were first done with the legs positioned using the manufacturer's
   foot block. Five scans were performed, with repositioning, on the left
   hip of each subject. The procedure was then repeated with the legs
   positioned using a custom-designed positioning jig to minimize the
   rotation of the hips during a scan. In the in vitro study, the femoral
   neck BMD value was minimum at neutral position (0 degrees) and increased
   when the femur was rotated internally or externally. In vivo precision
   error of the femoral neck scan was reduced by almost 50\% with the use
   of the positioning jig when compared with the manufacturer's foot block.
   Femoral rotation was shown to have a significant effect on BMD
   measurements, and proper positioning of the femur during a scan can
   improve precision significantly.}},

Abstract = {{A patient with complete cortical blindness after bilateral posterior
   cerebral artery infarctions denied her blindness. Her pretended visual
   experiences could frequently be traced back to synaesthetic translations
   of acoustic or tactile perceptions into mental visual images. Possibly,
   the belief to see resulted from a confusion of mental visual images with
   real percepts. The patient manifested preserved visual imagery also by
   correct responses to questions concerning the shapes of letters and the
   shapes and colours of objects. MRI showed an almost complete destruction
   of primary visual cortex with sparing of only small remainders of cortex
   at the occipital tip of the left upper calcarine lip. In the literature
   there are a few cases of denial of blindness with similarly severe
   damage to primary visual cortex but none with unequivocal evidence of
   complete destruction of primary visual cortex. We conclude that severe
   damage to primary visual cortex is compatible with visual imagery but
   that there is a possibility that islands of visual cortex must be spared
   to permit the generation of mental visual images.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of the potassium channel opener pinacidil on
   ATP-dependent K+ channels (K-ATP) in the relaxation of porcine and human
   coronary arteries by means of isometric contraction experiments in
   arterial rings. We also measured whole cell currents in freshly isolated
   porcine and human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells with
   patch clamp. We first characterized serotonin-induced precontractions in
   our vessels and proved that the contractions were mediated by Ca2+
   influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Similarly, we observed
   that serotonin-induced contractions were strongly enhanced by small
   K+-induced depolarizations. Pinacidil completely relaxed rings
   preconstricted with 5 mu M serotonin and produced dose-dependent
   relaxations of 5 mu M serotonin-preconstricted rings, with an IC50 of
   1.26 mu M. Similar results were observed (IC50 = 1.15 mu M) when the
   endothelium was removed. The K-ATP blocker glibenclamide (3 mu M),
   inhibited pinacidil-induced relaxations (5-10 mu M) by similar to 25\%
   although the K-ATP blocker tetrapentylammonium (10 mu M), inhibited
   pinacidil-induced (5-10 mu M) relaxations completely. Pinacidil 10 mu M
   had only a minimal effect on rings precontracted with a 50 mM external
   K+ concentration (IC50 = 60 mu M). Porcine and human arterial rings did
   not differ qualitatively in their responses. Moreover, in the patch
   clamp experiments pinacidil (1 mu M and 20 mu M) induced a large,
   nonrectifying, outward current in both human and porcine cells. The
   reversal potential was close to the K+ equilibrium potential, suggesting
   an induction of pinacidil-activated K+ current. The pinacidil-induced (1
   mu M) current was strongly inhibited by glibenclamide (3 mu M). These
   data show that the relaxation of porcine and human coronary arteries by
   pinacidil is primarily induced by an opening of K-ATP in smooth muscle
   cells. Furthermore, the vasorelaxant effect of pinacidil is not
   endothelium dependent.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MC), first described in 1959 by
   Lichtenstein and Bernstein, is an uncommon tumor of the soft tissues and
   bone defined by the coexistence of nests of well-defined cartilaginous
   tissue within a proliferation of primitive mesenchymal cells.
   CASE: A 27-year-old, white female consulted a physician for a left
   lumbar mass associated with sciatica-type pain, asthenia, anorexia and
   weight loss. Abdominal computed tomography showed a 20-cm,
   retroperitoneal neoplasm that occupied the lower half of the left
   abdominal flank. Fine needle aspiration biopsy showed clusters of small
   round cells mixed with islets of mature cartilage. Immunomarking for
   electron microscopy, carried out with 15 nm of A protein/colloidal gold,
   showed specific immunoreactivity to S-100 protein in the nuclear
   chromatin, nucleoli, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane and cytosol of
   cells with move developed organelles.
   CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of MC rests on recognition of the biphasic
   component of small, undifferentiated cells and cartilage islets. In
   aspirates with only undifferentiated cells, demonstration of
   ultrastructure specific immunoreactivity to S-100 protein may contribute
   to the final diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: This study analyzed the response of two selected groups
   of asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B patients, treated either with
   Interferon or with Prednisone pills the same regimen of Interferon, on
   finalizing treatment and after a longterm follow-zip.
   Patients and Methods: Twelve patients received Interferon over 6 months
   (group I) and 7 patients Prednisone plus Interferon with the same
   regimen (group II). Both groups were homogeneous in, age, sexual
   preferences, serum ALT levels, liver histology and Knodell's index.
   Patients with decompensated liver disease, ongoing drug abuse, active
   alcoholism or viral superinfections were excluded.
   Results: On finalizing treatment, no statistical differences were
   observed in either group, except for clearance of HBsAg, found to be
   better in group II. Both treatments improved hepatic histology. These
   results were comparable with those reported for both therapeutical
   regimens in the literature. After a mean follow-up period of 1.8 years
   for group I and 3.5 years for group II, no patient included in, group II
   relapsed and 2 additionally cleared their replication markers; thus, a
   complete response was achieved in 6 (86\%) out of 7 patients. In group
   I; however 3 patients relapsed and 4 presented no change, obtaining a
   complete response in 3 (27\%) out of 11 followed-up patients. When
   statistically studied, this improved response in the Prednisone plus
   Interferon group was significant in clearing HBV DNA, HBeAg and HBsAg
   and, also, in. normalizing ALT Levels.
   Conclusions: In spite of the few number of cases studied these results
   could indicate an improved long-term evolution after a short course of
   steroids prior to Interferon in selected chronic hepatitis B patients.}},

Abstract = {{We describe an improved enzyme-monitored stopped-flow method for
   determining rate constants' for peroxidase reactions that are too rapid
   to measure by conventional pseudo-first-order methods. Ascorbate will
   reduce many substrate radicals as rapidly as they are generated by a
   peroxidase. This ensures a constant substrate concentration during the
   peroxidase reaction. We investigated the reactions of horseradish
   peroxidase compound I (HRP-I) with three standard substrates
   (chlorpromazine (CPZ), 2,2'-azino - bis{[}3 - ethylbenzthiazoline - 6-
   sulfonic acid] (ABTS), and p-methoxyphenol) in the presence and absence
   of ascorbate. The rate of reaction of CPZ with HRP-I is slow enough that
   it can be measured using pseudo-first-order conditions maintained by a
   minimum 10-fold excess of CPZ, or by the addition of ascorbate at very
   low CPZ concentrations. The same rate constant was obtained with either
   method. The rate of reaction of ABTS with HRP-I at lower pH (5.0-3.3) is
   rapid; consequently, we were unable to obtain rate constants using

   However, using much lower ABTS concentrations with the addition of

   maintain pseudo-first order conditions for fast peroxidase reactions
   even at low substrate concentrations. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We have performed R-matrix calculations for the electron-impact
   excitation of a highly charged ion in which an optical potential is
   included to allow for radiative damping of intermediate resonance
   states. The present case considered is that of electrons incident on
   Ti20+ ions. Comparisons with undamped R-matrix calculations,
   distorted-wave calculations, and experimental measurement are made. The
   radiative optical potential accounts for significant damping of high-n
   resonances. Configuration interaction between resonances, which is
   automatically incorporated in the R-matrix method but usually omitted in
   the implementation of distorted-wave techniques, was found to increase
   the resonance contributions considerably. Our radiative-damped R-matrix
   cross sections show fairly good agreement with the resonance profile
   obtained from electron beam ion trap measurements {[}S. Chantrenne et
   al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 265 (1992)]. This system demonstrates the
   necessity for simultaneously including radiative-damping and
   interfering-resonance effects within electron-highly charged ion
   scattering calculations.}},

   yielded complex electrophoretic patterns where the major bands
   correspond to approximately 24,000 Da and 32,000 Da in the presence of
   sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic
   (PAGE) patterns did not differ by the year of sample collection (1986
   and 1992). Chromatographic analysis showed that protein characterization
   of cactus juices may be useful in cactus taxonomy at the family level,
   Fluorescence emission and FT-IR spectra of studied cacti species were
   measured to compare protein structure, Differences in the emission peak

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Collagen synthesis by smooth muscle cells plays an
   important role in intestinal fibrosis, Corticosteroids inhibit collagen
   synthesis in fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to examine the
   effect of corticosteroids on the expression of collagen by human
   intestinal smooth muscle (HISM) cells in vitro. Methods: Collagen
   synthesis was determined by the sensitivity of radiolabeled protein to
   collagenase, Secretion was determined by polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis of radiolabeled procollagen in the medium. Procollagen
   messenger RNA was determined by Northern blot analysis. Results:
   Collagen synthesis by confluent HISM cells was not affected by
   corticosteroids at 10(-10) to 10(-5) mol/L but, in subconfluent
   cultures, was nonspecifically increased 50\% at 10(-5) mol/L,
   Procollagen secretion was nonspecifically increased 60\% at 10(-6) mol/L
   dexamethasone without any effect on the type III/I ratio, Procollagen I
   and III messenger RNA levels responded in a biphasic manner: a 45\%-65\%
   increase at 10(-10) mol/L and a 15\% and 30\% decrease at 10(-8) and
   10(-6) mol/L, In fibroblasts, collagen synthesis was inhibited 85\% by
   dexamethasone, procollagen secretion was decreased 70\%, the type III/I
   ratio decreased from 70:1 to 18:1, and procollagen messenger RNA was
   inhibited 25\% and 60\% (types I and III). Conclusions: Collagen
   expression by HISM cells is refractory to corticosteroids and, at
   certain concentrations, is augmented.}},

Abstract = {{DSC thermograms of bovine Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (BSOD) have been
   recorded at different scan rates and protein concentrations in order to
   clarify the process of its unfolding. The lack of calorimetric
   reversibility made direct thermodynamic analysis of the thermograms
   impossible. The study of the effect of the scan rate on the shape of the
   heat capacity (C-p) profiles of BSOD has allowed the calculation of the
   apparent activation energy (E(app)) for the whole irreversible process.
   Extrapolation of the excess heat capacity curves (Cpexe) to infinite
   scan rate has provided the scan-rate-independent part of the
   thermograms. The protein concentration effect is explained by a change
   in molecularity that takes place before the kinetically-controlled step.
   The data collected suggest that, on thermal denaturation, BSOD
   dissociates during the thermally-induced transitions of the protein;
   this is followed by a kinetically controlled, exothermic step which is
   responsible for the global irreversibility of the entire process.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the relative attraction of hands-on, interactive
   science museum exhibits for females and males. Studies have demonstrated
   that such exhibits can be effective learning experiences for children,
   with both academic and affective benefits. Other studies have shown that
   girls and boys do not always experience the same science-related
   educational opportunities and that, even when they do, they do not
   necessarily receive the same benefits from them. These early differences
   can lead to more serious educational and professional disparities later
   in life. As interactive museum exhibits represent a science experience
   that is readily available to both girls and boys, the question arose as
   to whether they were being used similarly by the two groups as well as
   by adult women and men. It was found that both girls and boys used all
   types of exhibits, but that girls were more likely than boys to use
   puzzles and exhibits focusing on the human body; boys were more likely
   than girls to use computers and exhibits illustrating physical science
   principles. However, this was less true of children accompanied by
   adults (parents) than it was of unaccompanied children on school field
   trips who roamed the museum more freely.}},

Abstract = {{TETRACYCLINES ARE FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED during the treatment of clinical
   infections in medicine and dentistry, however, emergence of resistant
   bacterial strains has decreased the utility of these drugs. Accordingly,
   there is concern that indiscriminant administration of tetracyclines
   during periodontal therapy will further contribute to the development of
   additional resistant microorganisms which can complicate infectious
   disease therapy. This review paper briefly discusses the utility of
   tetracyclines as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of periodontal
   diseases. It then focuses on the clinical significance of bacterial
   resistance to tetracyclines. Patterns of resistance that may be
   associated with the following scenarios are addressed: short- and
   long-term antibiotic therapy, individuals with a history of prior
   tetracycline therapy, patients with refractory periodontitis, and
   following controlled local drug delivery. It appears that selection and
   development of bacterial resistant strains is an inevitable consequence
   of antibiotic therapy. Nevertheless, prudent administration of
   tetracyclines may help delay or prevent the emergence of resistant

Abstract = {{A method for the determination of non-, mono- and di-ortho substituted
   polychlorinated biphenyls in human blood plasma is presented. The
   non-ortho CBs are isolated from the bulk of PCBs by HPLC on a
   dinitroanilino-propyl silica column and collected as a heart-cut
   fraction that is transferred on-line to GC-MS utilizing concurrent
   solvent evaporation technique. The on-line coupling serves to lower the
   limit of determination and to partly automate the sample clean-up. The
   di- and mono-ortho CBs are analyzed by off-line GC-ECD using two
   different columns. Sample pre-treatment is performed by extraction with
   organic solvents and fractionation on silica gel. A high reproducibility
   and an absolute over-all recovery of approximately 70\% is demonstrated.
   The method is applied to samples of blood from 5 individuals. All the
   samples demonstrated a similar relative concentration profile. It was
   also shown that three CB congeners (CB 126, CB 156 and CB 170)
   contributed to the major part of the toxic equivalent quantity of the
   PCB content in the blood.}},

   rates that are amino acid-independent but vary among sites, Lastly,
   equation q = {[}In(1 + 2d)]/2d accounts for the general case where

Abstract = {{When an object is subjected to a flowing, participating medium at a
   different temperature, such as a flame, the thermal response of the
   object and the surrounding medium becomes coupled. The differences
   inherent in treating the medium as a blackbody at some approximate
   temperature as opposed to a participating medium are assessed and
   quantified in this work by solving the transient, coupled, radiation,
   and conduction heat transfer problem for the flow of an absorbing and
   emitting medium adjacent to a vertical flat plate. The results are
   presented in terms of nondimensional parameters and include both average
   and local heat fluxes as a function of time. Early in the transient, a
   reduction in net heat flux of up to 65\% was observed by accounting for
   absorption and emission in the medium. Accordingly, a longer time is
   required for the object to reach an equilibrium temperature (Icp to
   100\% for values of the radiation parameter, N-rad, of 5.0) than is
   predicted using the blackbody assumption. For radiation Blot numbers
   greater than 5 or values of N-rad less than 10(-2), the differences
   inherent in the two approaches are negligible, and the blackbody
   assumption is valid.}},

   the result that a large fraction of the nitrogen atoms occupy
   interstitial sites in these high-chromium clusters. The association of

Abstract = {{An adequate carbohydrate supply contributes to the survival of seeds
   under conditions of limited oxygen availability. The amount of soluble,
   readily fermentable carbohydrates in dry cereal seeds is usually very
   limited, with starch representing the main storage compound. Starch
   breakdown during the germination of cereal seeds is the result of the
   action of hydrolytic enzymes and only through the concerted action of
   alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1), beta-amylase (EC 3.2.1.2), debranching
   enzyme (EC 3.2.1.41), and alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) can starch be
   hydrolyzed completely. We present here data concerning the complete set
   of starch-degrading enzymes in three cereals, rice (Oryza sativa L.),
   which is tolerant to anaerobiosis, and wheat(Triticum aestivum L.) and
   barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), which are unable to germinate under anoxia.
   Among the cereal seeds tested under anoxia, only rice is able to degrade
   nonboiled, soluble starch, reflecting the ability to degrade the starch
   granules in vivo. This is explained by the presence of the complete set
   of enzymes needed to degrade starch completely either as the result of
   de novo synthesis (alpha-amylase, beta-amylase) or activation of
   preexisting, inactive forms of the enzyme (debranching enzyme,
   alpha-glucosidase). These enzymes are either absent or inactive in wheat
   and barley seeds kept under anaerobic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{According to a space-charge theory analysis, the space-charge potential
   of YSZ is negative, which corresponds to an Y-Zr' segregation and an
   V-O(..) depletion in the space-charge layers. Owing to the highly
   disordered structure of the grain-boundary interfaces, the resistance of
   the interfaces is considered to be negligible with respect to that of
   the space-charge layers, the intrinsic grain-boundary resistivity in
   stabilized-ZrO2 was thus considered to originate from the V-O(..)
   depletion in the space-charge layers, and an intrinsic grain-boundary
   resistivity model was developed. With this model, all the grain-boundary
   resistivity behaviors in stabilized-ZrO2 with high-purity described in
   the published litteratures were satisfactorily explained.}},

Abstract = {{Replacing fossil fuels with sustainably-produced biomass will reduce the
   net flow of CO2 to the atmosphere. We express the efficiency of this
   substitution in reduced emissions per unit of used land or biomass and
   in costs of the substitution per tonne of C. The substitution costs are
   calculated as the cost difference between continued use of fossil fuels
   at current prices and the use of biomass, assuming that the biomass
   technologies are implemented when reinvestments in existing technologies
   are required. Energy inputs into biomass production and conversion are
   biomass-based, resulting in a CO2-neutral fuel cycle, while CO2
   emissions from fossil fuels are estimated for the complete fuel cycles.
   Substituting biomass for fossil fuels in electricity and heat production
   is, in general, less costly and provides larger CO2 reduction per unit
   of biomass than substituting biomass for gasoline or diesel used in
   vehicles. For transportation, methanol or ethanol produced from
   short-rotation forests or logging residues provide larger CO2-emission
   reductions than rape methyl ester from rape seed, biogas from lucerne
   (alfalfa), or ethanol from wheat. Of these, methanol has the lowest
   emission-reduction costs. Increasing biomass used by 125 TWh/yr, the
   estimated potential for increased utilization of logging residues, straw
   and energy crops, would eliminate more than one-half of the Swedish CO2
   emissions from fossil fuels of 15 Mtonnes C in 1992.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the appropriateness of different superovulatory
   protocols in various breeds of sheep for obtaining a maximum of zygotes
   suitable for microinjection. Animals were mated either once or two to
   three times to fertile rams. In Experiment 1, a 24 h interval between a
   two to three times mating and egg recovery resulted in 42.2\% suitable
   zygotes whereas with single mating only 10.4\% fertilized eggs were
   obtained. The extension of the interval to 40 h associated with a two to
   three times mating resulted in a recovery of 42.9\% fertilized eggs but
   most (70\%) of these were already at the two-cell stage. In Experiment
   2, eCG resulted in similar superovulatory responses in Merino ewes as
   the more labour requiring FSH treatment (8.1 +/- 4.5 versus 7.5 +/- 4.1
   corpora lutea (CL); 6.3 +/- 3.0 versus 6.8 +/- 4.0 oocytes/zygotes;
   39.4\% versus 40.646 fertilization rate). In Experiment 3, following
   superovulation with pFSH (Folltropin(R)) the number of CL was not
   different among Merino, Finn, Crossbreds (Blackface X Finn) and Texel
   sheep (8.6 +/- 5.2; 10.3 +/- 4.5; 8.5 +/- 3.8; 8.2 +/- 2.8,
   respectively) as was the number of recovered oocytes/ zygotes (7.4 +/-
   5.6; 9.8 +/- 4.3; 7.3 +/- 3.8; 6.4 +/- 2.9, respectively). However, the
   number of unfertilized ova was higher (P < 0.05) in Finn sheep as
   compared with Crossbreds and Texel sheep (5.0 +/- 3.3 versus 2.2 +/- 2.3
   and 1.9 +/- 2.6). Similarly, the fertilization rate was higher (P <
   0.05) in Cross breds and Texel sheep (64.4\% and 65.5\%) as compared
   with Finn and Merino sheep (38.3\% and 42.5\%). In Experiment 4, it was
   shown that in Merino sheep purified FSH supplemented with 68.6\% LH
   resulted in lower (P < 0.05) superovulatory responses as compared with
   purified FSH supplemented with 133.1\% LH or Folltropin (LH
   contamination 0.1\%) (4.7 +/- 3.3 versus 8.8 +/- 3.8 and 8.6 +/- 5.2 CL;
   3.8 +/- 2.5 versus 7.4 +/- 3.6 and 7.4 +/- 5.6 oocytes/zygotes,
   respectively). A three times repeated superovulatory treatment and
   oviductal flush per animal at monthly intervals did reduce (P < 0.05)
   the number of CL, but had no deleterious effect on zygote yields and the
   percentage of microinjectable zygotes. We conclude that (1) at least a
   two to three times mating is required to obtain acceptable fertilization
   rates; (2) the interval between mating and recovery should be 24-26 h in
   order to obtain zygotes; (3) eCG results in similar superovulatory
   responses as FSH; (4) Folltropin(R) is a suitable drug to induce
   superovulation in sheep; (5) the LH content of the FSH preparation plays
   a significant role in the superovulatory response of sheep; (6)
   superovulation and embryo recoveries can be repeated at least three
   times per animal without decrease in efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Consider the problem of detecting and localizing a faint object moving
   in an `'essentially stationary'' background, using a sequence of
   two-dimensional low-SNR images of the scene. A natural approach consists
   of `'digitizing'' each snapshot into a discrete set of observations,
   sufficiently (perhaps not exactly) matched to the object in question,
   then tracking the object using an appropriate stochastic filter. The
   tracking would be expected to make up for the low signal-to-noise ratio,
   thus allowing one to `'coherently'' process successive images in order
   to beat down the noise and localize the object. Thus, `'tracking'' here
   does not refer to the ususal notion of detecting then tracking: rather,
   we track in order to detect. The problem then becomes one of choosing
   the appropriate image representation as well as the optimal (and
   necessarily nonlinear) filter. We propose exact and approximate
   solutions using wavelets and the Zakai equation. The smoothness of the
   wavelets used is required in the derivation of the evolution equation
   for the conditional density giving the filter, and their orthogonality
   makes it possible to carry out actual computations of the Ito- and
   change-of-gauge-terms in the algorithm effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background Beneficial hemodynamic effects after dynamic cardiomyoplasty
   have been inconsistently demonstrated, and the effects seen may be due
   to the wrap itself, to flap stimulation, or both. The aim of this study
   was to determine whether flap stimulation per se acts as a systolic
   active process after cardiomyoplasty.
   Methods and Results Catheterizations were performed in 13 patients
   14.4+/-7 months after cardiomyoplasty. New York Heart Association
   functional class decreased from 3.3 to 2.1 after the procedure
   (P=.0005). Hemodynamic evaluations were first performed with the
   stimulator on in the 2:1 mode and then after the stimulator had been off
   for at least 24 hours. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction increased
   from 25.1+/-6\% before surgery to 28.2+/-6.7\% with the stimulator on
   after cardiomyoplasty (P=.04). When stimulation was stopped, there was
   no change (P>.05) in indexes of systolic or diastolic LV function (peak
   systolic LV pressure, LV ejection fraction, peak positive dP/dt, peak
   negative dP/dt, or tau). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac
   index were unchanged when stimulated and nonstimulated settings were
   compared (P>.05). However, a remarkable heterogeneity of individual
   responses was observed. Ejection fraction and cardiac index decreased
   with the stimulator off in 3 patients, but peak positive dP/dt decreased
   in 6 patients; diastolic function deteriorated in 2 patients, but a
   slight improvement was noted in 3 patients. Cardiothoracic ratio,
   echocardiographic LV end-diastolic dimension, and fractional shortening
   remained unchanged between immediate (<1 month) and long-term
   (36.7+/-25.9 months) postoperative evaluations.
   Conclusions In the majority of our patients, there was no short-term
   hemodynamic benefit of flap stimulation; therefore, we conclude that the
   efficacy of cardiomyoplasty may be a consequence of a passive `'girdling
   effect,'' which limits the progression of ventricular enlargement and
   further deterioration of ejection fraction.}},

Abstract = {{The phenotype and frequency of cells in normal human peripheral blood
   spontaneously secreting IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN and TNF-alpha ex
   vivo was determined using ELIspot assays, CD4(+) T cells were the
   dominant source of IL-2 and IL-4 while multiple cell types (primarily
   CD8(+) lymphocytes) produced IFN. Fewer than 0.05\% of mononuclear cells
   were spontaneously secreting these T cell derived factors. By
   comparison, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha were produced by 0.7-20\% of PBMC.
   The primary sources of the latter cytokines were CD14(+)
   macrophages/monocytes. A significant positive correlation was found in
   the frequency of cells secreting IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha ex vivo,
   suggesting that the release of such factors was coordinately regulated,
   No such correlation was found among IL-2, IL-4 and IFN secreting cells,
   indicating that the production of predominantly T cell derived cytokines
   was regulated independently.}},

Abstract = {{Micronesian kingfishers (Halcyon cinnamomina cinnamomina) are a
   critically endangered species (n = 50 living birds), endemic to Guam,
   and recently extirpated from the wild, When the remnant population on
   Guam was taken from the wild, little was known about the 29 birds that
   founded the new captive population or what potential these birds held
   for forming viable populations, We used pedigree analyses and multilocus
   minisatellite DNA profiles to examine potential genetic relationships
   among these founders so that appropriate captive breeding strategies
   could be implemented and the species may one day be returned to the
   wild, Assuming founders were unrelated resulted in a significant
   correlation between relatedness calculated from a subsequent pedigree
   and DNA profile similarity (R(2) = 0.91, 2 df, P < .05), UPGMA cluster
   analyses of genetic distances (1 - DNA similarity) of all birds
   indicated further agreement between the pedigree and DNA data, However,
   UPGMA clustering of founders indicated that three groups of founders had
   unusually high similarity for unrelated birds, Comparison of these
   similarities with known relationships (i.e., unrelated birds and birds
   related by r = 0.5) suggested they fell within one standard deviation of
   the mean for related birds, but were also at the highest end of the
   range for unrelated birds. Unable to assign relatedness based on this
   analysis, we further proposed a series of hypotheses to explain
   relatedness among founders and used correlation analyses to evaluate the
   best fit of the data, One assumption that linked two sets of founders as
   siblings best described the relationship between similarity and
   relatedness (R(2) = 0.92, 3 df, P < .01) and is suggested for
   consideration in Micronesian kingfisher conservation, Similar approaches
   should be helpful in understanding relationships among unknown
   individuals in other populations, These analyses are best carried out
   when at least some pedigree information is known.}},

   Despite an similar to 30\% increase in total body lipid, no
   abnormalities were observed in 6-week-old transgenic animals, At the age
   of 22-26 weeks, marked obesity in transgenic mice was associated with
   significant increases in blood glucose and plasma insulin levels and an
   abnormal response to both intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance
   tests, Glucose transport in soleus muscle was reduced, with the response
   to insulin stimulation blunted by up to 85\% in males and 55\% in
   females. The total number of insulin receptors was decreased by 36\% in
   muscle and 59\% in adipose tissue of transgenic animals, Insulin
   receptor tyrosine kinase activity, which was assessed following maximal
   insulin stimulation in vivo, was reduced in transgenic animals by 59\%
   in muscle and 56\% in fat, GLUT4 mRNA and protein was unchanged in
   muscle of transgenic animals compared with in that of controls but was
   significantly reduced in adipose tissue, In conclusion, primary BAT
   deficiency results in the development of glucose intolerance or diabetes

Abstract = {{Background There have been few reports about coronary hemodynamics in
   children during the process of growth. In the present study, to assess
   the characteristics of coronary flow dynamics in children, we examined
   the phasic coronary flow-velocity (CFV) patterns at rest and during peak
   hyperemic responses in children with angiographically normal coronary
   arteries.
   Methods and Results Spectral Doppler phasic coronary flow velocity was
   recorded with a 0.018-in intracoronary Doppler guidewire at rest and
   during peak responses after intracoronary bolus injection of ATP in 30
   patients with Kawasaki's disease (age, 8.2+/-5.1 years; 24 boys and 6
   girls) without angiographic coronary lesions. Average peak velocity
   (APV), maximum peak velocity (MPV), and diastolic-to-systolic velocity
   ratio (DSVR) were evaluated in the left anterior descending coronary
   artery (LAD), left circumflex artery (LCx), and right coronary artery
   (RCA). Coronary vasodilator reserve (coronary flow reserve {[}CFR]) was
   calculated as the ratio of ATP-induced hyperemic to baseline APV.
   Flow-velocity parameters in RCA were significantly lower than those in
   the LAD and LCx in both proximal and distal portions. Although the
   distal LCx had significantly lower values of APV and MPV than did the
   proximal LCx, there was no significant difference between the and MPV.
   All three coronary vessels showed a diastolic dominant flow pattern in
   each segment. This coronary flow pattern was less marked in the RCA than
   in the LCA. All three coronary vessels showed a significant increase in
   APV and a significant decrease in DSVR after ATP administration. CFR was
   significantly lower in the LCx than in the LAD or RCA (P<.01:
   1.93+/-0.34 in LCx versus 2.32+/-0.42 in LAD and 2.37+/-0.44 in RCA).
   From the view of aging, it was revealed that APV values in three vessels
   were higher in the younger group than in the older group. CFR values in
   the LAD and LCx were significantly lower in the younger group than in
   the older group (P<.001 in LAD: 2.0+/-0.28 in the younger versus
   2.53+/-0.37 in the older; P<.01 in LCx: 1.61+/-0.15 in the younger
   versus 2.06+/-0.31 in the older). In addition, intracoronary injection
   of ATP did not increase the absolute angiographic coronary luminal
   diameter.
   Conclusions With the use of an intracoronary Doppler guidewire, we
   demonstrated that there are some characteristic findings in CFV dynamics
   in childhood. These physiological characteristics in CFV dynamics that
   occur with aging and occur in each vessel must be taken into
   consideration in the study of the coronary circulation in children.}},

Abstract = {{A great deal of data support the view that depression is frequently
   associated with a decrease in central serotonergic neurotransmission.
   Furthermore, this neurobiological alteration very probably contributes
   to depression because treatments known to increase the `serotonergic
   tone', such as the chronic administration of selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have antidepressant properties. Extensive
   studies of the mechanisms of action of SSRIs led to the discovery of the
   key role of somato-dendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in a negative control
   of serotonergic neurotransmission. From this finding, a new treatment of
   depression has been attempted which consists of the association of an
   SSRI with an antagonist (non-selective) of these autoreceptors. The
   potent antidepressant action of this association (with a shorter delay
   of action, even in depressed patients previously resistant to
   `classical' therapies) should promote novel therapeutic strategies
   consisting of raising the `serotonergic tone' by acting on different
   (but convergent) molecular targets.}},

Abstract = {{The present foraminiferal distribution (live + dead) in Freemansundet
   between Barentsoya and Edgeoya, Svalbard, has been compared with
   assemblages in raised marine Holocene deposits in Guldalen on Edgeoya.
   Four distinct foraminiferal assemblages were identified in
   Freemansundet, the Elphidium excavatum-Cassidulina reniforme assemblage,
   the Elphidium hallandense assemblage, the Cibicides lobatulus assemblage
   and the Elphidium incertum-Haynesina orbiculare assemblage. Four
   assemblage zones (Zones A-D) have been established in the glaciomarine
   to marine sediment sequence in Guldalen. Only two of the recent faunal
   types were represented here. The Elphidium excavatum-Cassidulina
   reniforme assemblage, which reflects a proximal glacier environment, was
   found in the lowermost Zone A (the Elphidium excavatum Zone) and in Zone
   C (the Elphidium excavatum-Cassidulina reniforme Zone) in the Guldalen
   stratigraphy; the Elphidium incertum-Haynesina orbiculare assemblage,
   which reflects ameliorated shallow water conditions, was found in the
   uppermost Zone D in Guldalen. The marine sequence in Guldalen represents
   a relatively short period of time during the Early Holocene (ca 9700 to
   8300 BP). The succession of the foraminiferal assemblages suggests that
   the deglaciation was interrupted by a cold period with glacial
   stagnation just after 9600 BP (Zone B, the Astrononion
   gallowayi-Nonionellina labradorica Zone).}},

Journal = {{GEOMORPHOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{99-107}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A simulation model that examines the development of valley
   cross-profiles as a result of glacial erosion has been constructed by
   placing a finite-element model for ice flow within an iterative program
   that modifies channel cross-section form on the basis of an erosion
   equation. The simulation model has previously been used to examine how
   different flow laws, erosion laws and ice discharge histories affect
   medium-scale landform development. This allows us to better understand
   the development of glacial landforms, and also provides a critical test
   for erosion and flow laws.
   Within the erosion component of the simulation program it is possible to
   specify spatial variations in bedrock erodibility in order to examine
   the effect of spatially variable lithologies on form development. As an
   initial test of form development under these conditions a central area
   of enhanced erodibility is placed in the valley center. In this case
   active glacial channels develop that are narrower and deeper than those
   which occur with homogenous bedrock. This change in form occurs as long
   as the weaker zone is small enough that the active channel does not
   eventually narrow to a stage such that it is entirely contained within
   the weaker material, and as long as it is large enough that it continues
   to have a significant impact on overall discharge through the section.
   Form variation occurs because the weaker central zone enhances the
   lateral gradient of the erosion rate, which is critical for form
   development. A central area of more erodible bedrock changes not only
   the form of the active glacial channel, but also the convexity of side
   slopes that are left above the glacier as it erodes downwards into the
   landscape.
   The absence of a classic U-shaped cross section should not be taken, a
   priori, to suggest either absence of glacial erosion or ineffective
   glacial erosion. Rather, the combination of active glacial and hillslope
   processes in a landscape with spatially and temporally variable ice
   discharge and rock characteristics can create a diverse set of
   cross-section forms.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence is presented for cotranslational folding of rhodanese or ricin
   during its synthesis on Escherichia coli ribosomes. During
   transcription-translation, full-length but enzymatically inactive
   polypeptides accumulated as peptidyl-tRNA on the ribosomes. These
   polypeptides were activated and released by subsequent incubation with
   the bacterial chaperones and with release factor (RF-2). Coumarin was
   incorporated cotranslationally at the N-terminus of the nascent protein
   from fluorophore-S-Ac-Met-tRNA(f) Changes in fluorescence indicated that
   DnaJ bound to the nascent proteins and to a fluorescently labeled
   synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 17 amino acids of
   bovine rhodanese. This peptide also bound to 70S ribosomes or 50S
   subunits but not to 30S subunits. It inhibited activation and
   RF-2-dependent release of the full-length ribosome-bound rhodanese. A
   deletion mutant of rhodanese lacking the N-terminal 23 amino acids was
   not accumulated on the ribosome but was synthesized very efficiently.
   However, the protein that was formed was enzymatically inactive. DnaJ
   did not bind to this deletion mutant on ribosomes. We conclude that the
   chaperone-mediated reactions facilitate binding of the N-terminal
   sequence of nascent proteins to a specific site on 50S ribosomal
   subunits where it blocks release. The ribosome-bound protein undergoes
   chaperone-mediated reactions that are required for folding into an
   enzymatically active conformation.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: To evaluate the role of microaspiration in
   gastroesophageal reflux-induced bronchoconstriction.
   Design: Prospective study blinded to the subject.
   Setting: Outpatient laboratory of a 908-bed university hospital.
   Participants: Thirty nonsmoking adults divided into two groups:
   asthmatics with reflux (AR), 20; and subjects with gastroesophageal
   reflux (R), 10.
   Interventions: Dual esophageal pH probe placed. Esophageal infusions of
   normal saline solution, 0.1N hydrochloric acid, then normal saline
   solution, each lasting 18 min, were followed by two 20-min recovery
   periods. Subjects remained in the supine position throughout. Spirometry
   and specific airway resistance (SRaw) performed at baseline, after each
   esophageal infusion and recovery period. Proximal esophageal acid
   exposure, a requirement for microaspiration, was assessed by the
   proximal esophageal pH probe.
   Results: Peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) decreased with esophageal acid
   in the AR group and did not recover immediately despite esophageal acid
   clearance with a significant main effect of subject groups (p<0.021) by
   repeated measures analysis of covariance. This decrease in PEF was not
   associated with the presence of proximal esophageal acid exposure
   (p=0.618). Specific airway resistance increased in the AR group with
   esophageal acid and worsened despite acid clearance, especially during
   the second recovery phase, with a significant phase (p<0.009) and group
   by treatment effect (p<0.009). The presence of proximal esophageal acid
   exposure was not associated with this deterioration in SRaw (p=1.0).
   Conclusions: Esophageal acid infusions given in the supine position
   caused a decrease in PEF and an increase in SRaw in the asthma with
   reflux group, which did not improve despite acid clearance. These
   responses were not dependent on proximal esophageal acid exposure. Also,
   SRaw continued to worsen during the recovery phase in the AR group,
   which may represent a delayed bronchoconstrictor effect. These data
   suggest thai microaspiration does not play significant role in
   esophageal acid-induced bronchoconstriction.}},

Abstract = {{Protein malnutrition early in life stunts subsequent physical growth in
   both humans and rats, but the mechanism(s) is un known. To test the
   hypothesis that temporary early life dietary protein restriction
   produces long-term alterations in the growth hormone (GH) neuroendocrine
   axis, we examined the effects of 3 wk of exposure to dietary protein
   restriction in male rats postweaning (3-6 wk of age) on spontaneous and
   GH-releasing factor (GRF)-stimulated GH secretion at 12 wk of age. In
   comparison to rats weaned onto a normal diet (23\% protein), rats weaned
   onto a low (4\%) protein diet failed to catch up growth transferred to
   the normal diet between 6 and 12 wk of age. Spontaneous 6-h GH secretory
   profiles of adult rats fed the low protein diet early in life showed a
   41\% reduction in mean GH peak amplitude and a significant suppression
   in overall mean 6-h plasma GH concentrations (37.5 +/- 4.5 versus 56.9
   +/- 5.9 mu g/L; p < 0.02). The magnitude of the GH response to 1 mu g of
   rat GRF(1-2 )NH2 i.v. challenge was augmented during the GH trough
   period in these rats (165.7 +/- 30.4 versus 43.9 +/- 17.6 mu g/L; P <
   0.01). Although basal plasma IGF-I levels and glucose tolerance of
   protein-deprived rats were normal at 12 wk of age, the insulin response
   to ip glucose was severely blunted {[}insulin integrated area under the
   curve: 303.0 +/- 32.7 versus 778.3 +/- 105.0 pmol/L/75 min; p < 0.01].
   These results demonstrate that temporary protein malnutrition early in
   life 1) blunts spontaneous pulsatile GH secretion, 2) augments GH
   responsiveness to GRF challenge, and 3) reduces the insulin secretory
   response to glucose in adulthood. Our findings suggest that dietary
   protein in early life is an important determinant for CNS control of GH
   secretion as well as for the development of pancreatic beta-cell
   sensitivity to glucose. Such alterations in the GH neuroendocrine axis,
   together with the subnormal insulin secretion, likely contribute to the
   lack of catch-up growth in this model.}},

   The paper inter-relates structural geology, geotechnical properties of

   and water supply. Conclusions suggest that the legendary Vale of Siddim
   was located to the northeast of the Lisan Peninsula at the southern
   extremity of the present-day North Basin of the Dead Sea. The
   destruction of the cities was the consequence of a seismic event leading
   to liquefaction of the alluvial plain constituting the Vale of Siddim.
   The event thus represents the first liquefaction event in recorded
   Judaeo-Christian history. The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were lost
   beneath the waters of the North Basin as a consequence.

Abstract = {{Male rats were given 2\% green tea as their drinking water for 2 wk
   before a single ip injection of the carcinogen 2-nitropropane (2NP) (100
   mg/kg body weight) and liver nuclear 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)
   levels and hepatotoxicity parameters were determined 6 or 15 hr
   thereafter. The increase of 8-OHdG adducts in liver nuclear DNA caused
   by 2NP was depressed 50\% at both time points with the green tea
   pretreatment. The time-dependent elevations of serum aminotransferases
   and lactate dehydrogenase values by 2NP were also effectively prevented.
   However, green tea had no obvious effects on the falls in serum lipid
   peroxide and triglyceride levels associated with carcinogen exposure.
   Increases of hepatic lipid peroxide levels with 2NP were depressed 100
   and 30\%, at 6 and 15hr, respectively, by green tea and the decrease in
   hepatic glycogen content at 6 hr was clearly alleviated.
   Histopathological examination revealed effective protection against
   induction of hepatic degenerative changes by 2NP at 15 hr. Drinking
   crude catechin extract solution with the same concentration of
   (-)epigallocatechin gallate as green tea provided protection at 6 hr,
   but with only half the effectiveness. These findings demonstrate that
   green tea can effectively block oxidative DNA damage to the liver as
   well as hepatotoxicity in rats treated with 2NP.}},

Abstract = {{The abrasive-waterjet (AWJ) machining process is a controlled erosive
   wear process where the abrasive cutting agents are focused in a narrow
   beam. The beam-material interaction process constitutes more than one
   mode, the most dominant of which are the cutting wear mode and the
   deformation wear mode. The cutting wear mode occurs at the top of the
   kerf due to shallow angles of impact and results in a steady-state
   interface. The material hardness (H) or Vicker's hardness number is the
   most relevant material property to this mode of interaction. The
   deformation wear mode occurs below the cutting wear mode due to large
   angles of impact and results in an unsteady penetration process. The
   modulus of elasticity (E) was found to correlate well with the
   deformation wear material removal. A prediction model was used to
   express the depth of cut (h) as a function of material properties:
   h = A/root H + B/E + C
   where A, B, and C are process constants.}},

   (3-{[}{[}{[}2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]carbamoyl]methyl]

   Cholecystokinin-octapeptide, dopamine, and alpha-calcitonin gene-related
   peptide, all suppressed gastric emptying in mice. Reversal of the
   depressed emptying occurred when DQ-2511 was administered by the oral or
   intraperitoneal route. When the action of eight proposed metabolites of
   DQ-2511 on the mouse cholecystokinin-octapeptide model was investigated,
   the main metabolite in plasma, MA-2, showed no effect, although two
   minor metabolites ameliorated or aggravated the delayed gastric
   emptying. This finding implies that DQ-2511, as the parent compound
   itself, exerts the ameliorative action. In dogs treated with cisplatin
   or copper sulfate, DQ-2511 had no antiemetic activity, as assessed by
   the number of vomiting episodes. The concern that the mechanism of
   action of DQ-2511 was blockade of receptors for
   cholecystokinin-octapeptide, dopamine, serotonin, cc-calcitonin
   gene-related peptide, nicotine or muscarine, was resolved by results of
   radioligand binding studies showing the absence of a DQ-2511 binding to
   any of these receptor types. Evidence is accumulating that the mechanism
   of the prokinetic action of DQ-2511 involves the intrinsic and extrinsic
   autonomic innervation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper has a 2-fold objective: (1) To introduce a measure that would
   be of general applicability in measuring diversity in different
   institutions. (2) To identify the determinants of diversity in
   child-care centers and, in particular, to examine whether the for-profit
   sector is less diverse than the not-for-profit sector in the child-care
   industry as the statistics suggest. Using our measure, we isolate
   factors that significantly influence diversity by using an economic
   model that makes diversity a decision variable of a firm. Two measures
   of diversity are suggested: absolute diversity and relative diversity
   (diversity relative to the surrounding community). To select a suitable
   index, the Herfindahl measure of concentration is considered relative to
   several suitable ecological indices measuring species diversity, and
   found to be virtually identical to such indices. Thus the H-index is
   used in both absolute and relative measures. Empirical estimation of
   both absolute and relative diversity equations use probability models
   and isolate factors that significantly influence both absolute diversity
   of child-care centers as well as their diversity relative to their
   respective counties. The data used is the recently released Profile of
   Child-Care Settings collected by the Mathematica Policy Research.}},

Abstract = {{To accurately localize a visual target in space despite eye
   movement-induced shifts of its retinal image, the brain must take into
   account both its retinal location and information about current eye
   position or at least the preceding eye displacement. We examined this
   ability with respect to saccadic eye movements by applying
   `'double-step'' stimuli, where the locations of two sequentially flashed
   target lights have to be fixated by two successive saccades performed
   after their disappearance. As the 2nd saccade will not start at the
   spatial location from which the 2nd target was seen, a dissonance arises
   between its retinal coordinates and the motor coordinates of the
   required 2nd saccade. Nevertheless, these saccades were performed quite
   accurately by 32 healthy human adults. To investigate the contribution
   of the cerebral cortex, we recorded horizontal double-step saccades in
   35 patients with focal unilateral hemispheric lesions. Whereas frontal
   lesions impaired temporal properties, posterior parietal lesions caused
   spatial dysmetria or failure of even ipsiversive 2nd saccades following
   contraversive 1st saccades. This reflects an inability to compensate for
   retino-spatial dissonance by using nonretinal information (corollary
   discharge) about eye displacement associated with a previous saccade
   into the contralesional hemifield. In conclusion, the parietal cortex is
   crucial for spatial constancy across saccades.}},

Abstract = {{At the Bufa del Diente contact-metamorphic aureole, brine infiltration
   through metachert layers embedded in limestones produced thick
   wollastonite rims, according to Cc+Qz=Wo+CO2. Fluid inclusions trapped
   in recrystallized quartz hosts include: (1) high salinity four phase
   inclusions {[}Th(V-L)=460-573 degrees C; Td(salts)=350-400 degrees C;
   (Na+K)(Cleq)=64-73 wt\%; X(CO2) less than or equal to 0.02]; (2) low
   density vapour-rich CO2-bearing inclusions {[}Th(L-V)approximate to
   500+/-100 degrees C; X(CO2)=0.22-0.44; X(NaCl) less than or equal to
   0.01], corresponding to densities of 0.27+/-0.05 gcm(-3). Petrographical
   observations, phase compositions and densities show that the two fluids
   were simultaneously trapped in the solvus of the H2O-CO2-salts system at
   500-600 degrees C and 700+/-200 bars. The low density fluid was
   generated during brine infiltration at the solvus via the wollastonite
   producing reaction. Identical fluid types were also trapped as inclusion
   populations in wollastonite hosts 3 cm adjacent to quartz crystals. At
   room temperature, both fluid types additionally contain one quartz and
   one calcite crystal, generated by the back-reaction Wo+CO2=Cc+Qz of the
   host with the CO2-proportion of the fluid during retrogression. All of
   the CO2 was removed from the fluid. On heating in the microstage, the
   reaction progress of the prograde reaction was estimated via volume loss
   of the calcites. In vapour-rich fluids, 50\% progress is reached at
   490-530 degrees C; 80\% at 520-560 degrees C and 100\% at 540-590
   degrees C, the latter representing the trapping temperatures of the
   original fluid at the two fluid solvus. The progress is volume
   controlled. With knowledge of compositions and densities from unmodified
   inclusions in quartz and using the equation of state of Duan et al.
   (1995) for H2O-CO2-NaCl, along with f(CO2)-values extracted from it, the
   reaction progress curve was recalculated in the P-T-X-space. The
   calculated progress curve passes through the two fluid solvus up to 380
   degrees C/210 bars, continues in the one fluid field and meets the
   solvus again at trapping conditions. The P-T slope is steep, most of the
   reaction occurs above 450 degrees C and there is high correspondence
   between calculated and measured reaction progress. We emphasize that
   with the exception of quartz, back-reactions between inclusion fluids
   and mineral hosts is a common process. For almost any prograde
   metamorphic mineral that was formed by a devolatilization reaction and
   that trapped the equilibrium fluid or any peak metamorphic fluid as an
   inclusion, a fluid-host back-reaction exists which must occur somewhere
   along the retrograde path. Such retrograde reactions may cause drastic
   changes in density and composition of the fluid. In most cases, however,
   evidence of the evolving mineral assemblages is not given for they might
   form submicroscopical layers at the inclusion walls.}},

Abstract = {{U-234/U-238 measurements on foraminifera could potentially provide an
   indicator of foraminifera diagenesis, a proxy for past seawater
   U-234/U-238 and, significantly, a direct dating tool for foraminifera.
   Such measurements are complicated, however, by the very low
   concentration of U in foraminifera and by the much higher U content of
   the Mn-rich diagenetic layer which forms on them within the sediment
   column. Here, we demonstrate that U-234/U-238 measurements can be made
   successfully on U samples of 1 ng or smaller (equivalent to <50 mg of
   foraminifera sample) and we report uranium isotope and concentration
   measurements on a variety of foraminifera samples. Core-top foraminifera
   subjected to reducing and oxidizing washes before analysis generally
   yielded U-234/U-238 within error of modern seawater. Two million
   year-old foraminifera could not be successfully cleaned of their Mn-rich
   coating, however, and yielded U concentrations and U-234/U-238 ratios
   significantly higher than the equivalent core-top samples. A suite of
   downcore foraminifera ranging in age from 6-162 ka yielded roughly
   constant U concentrations, and Mn/Ca ratios of <60 mu mol/mol,
   suggesting that they had been effectively cleaned of U hosted in the
   Mn-coating but, nevertheless, had U-234/U-238 which increased with age
   of sample, rather than decreasing as would be expected if they had
   behaved as closed systems. The high U-234/U-238 Seen in old foraminifera
   appears to reflect both addition of U from and exchange of U with,
   sediment porewaters with high U-234/U-238. This result effectively
   prevents the use of foraminifera as a tracer of past seawater U
   concentration and isotopic composition, and removes the possibility of
   using U-series dating on foraminifera. The behaviour of U differs from
   that of other trace elements, notably Cd, which appear to be robust to
   diagenesis in foraminifera, implying that U is not incorporated directly
   into the calcite structure and instead resides interstitially, or in
   organic material within the calcite shell. The susceptibility to
   diagenesis seen for U may prove typical for other trace elements which
   are not incorporated directly within the calcite structure in
   foraminifera.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the causes,
   symptoms and optimal management of massive delayed haemorrhage after
   pancreatic and biliary surgery. In a series of 686 patients who
   underwent major pancreatic and biliary surgery between 1983 and 1993,
   those with massive haemorrhage (necessitating more than 6 units packed
   cells within 24 h) more than 24 h after the initial surgery were
   selected. Two groups were formed, according to the aetiology of
   bleeding: bleeding caused by erosion of a major artery or that from the
   (gastro)intestinal suture line. The groups were compared with respect to
   bleeding parameters, symptoms, diagnostic and interventional procedures,
   and mortality. Massive postoperative haemorrhage occurred in 22 patients
   (3.2 per cent): 12 (1.7 per cent) with arterial bleeding and ten (1.5
   per cent) with suture-line bleeding were identified. Patients with
   arterial bleeding had a longer interval between initial surgery and
   haemorrhage (P = 0.02), more frequent septic complications (P = 0.03)
   and had a higher mortality rate than those with suture-line bleeding (50
   versus 0 per cent respectively, P = 0.02). If minimally invasive
   diagnostic and therapeutic techniques are not successful, early
   aggressive surgical intervention is mandatory, including thorough
   exploration of the area of the resection, ligated artery stumps and
   inspection of anastomoses by enterotomy.}},

   areas in Bjoerk-Shiley (p = 0.68) and St. Jude prostheses (p = 0.86).
   Differences between continuity and geometric areas were greater in St.
   Jude than in Bjoerk-Shiley valves (0.87 +/- 0.45 cm(2) vs. 0.06 +/- 0.47
   cm(2), p < 0.0001). Exclusion of patients with atrial fibrillation, with
   a postoperative interval of less than 1 year or valve sizes of 19 and 21
   mm did not change the results: Thus, underestimation of geometric areas
   is present in the St. Jude bileaflet aortic valves, while geometric and
   continuity areas are not significantly different in Bjoerk-Shiley

Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is a recent discipline that should be conducted
   scientifically and rigorously to move from a trial-and-error process to
   a predictive science to increase its success and the self-sustainability
   of restored ecosystems. The recent research developments in ecosystem
   dynamics allow scientists to provide a strong theoretical base for
   restoration ecology. Most large rivers have been degraded and managed by
   various agencies, but riverine wetlands are now recognized as providing
   numerous valuable functions. Numerous opportunities are available to
   ecologically restore wetlands disappearing through terrestrialization.
   After a brief description and discussion of several restoration projects
   carried out in riverine wetlands, we propose precise recommendations for
   future restoration projects, which should include the following
   essential steps: (1) increase restoration legitimacy with a team of
   interdisciplinary scientists working on the project-it can thus be
   conducted on a strong theoretical base derived from recent ecological
   concepts; (2) define precise and correct restoration mission, goals, and
   objectives, and appropriate performance indicators of restoration
   success or failure, and (3) monitor ecosystem changes both before and
   after the restoration, and compare these changes with changes observed
   in reference ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{In agreement with previous Work,(1,2) a thin, low temperature GaN buffer
   layer, that is used to initiate OMVPE growth of GaN growth on sapphire,
   is shown to play a critical role in determining the surface morphology
   of the main GaN epilayer. X-ray analysis shows that the mosaicity of the
   main GaN epilayer continues to improve even after several mu m of
   epitaxy. This continuing improvement in crystal perfection correlates
   with an improvement in Hall mobility for thicker samples. So far, we
   have obtained a maximum mobility of 600 cm(2)/V-s in a 6 mu m GaN
   epilayer. Atomic farce microscopy (AFM) analysis of the buffer layer and
   x-ray analysis of the main epilayer lead us to conclude that the both of
   these effects reflect the degree of coherence in the main GaN epitaxial
   layer. These results are consistent with the growth model presented by
   Hiramatsu et al., however, our AFM data indicates that for GaN buffer
   layers partial coherence can be achieved during the low temperature
   growth stage.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined whether ischemia-reperfusion injury to skeletal

   (PEP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The rectus femoris muscle of 54
   rabbits was rendered ischemic for 3.5 hr. Eighteen rabbits received no
   further treatment. Thirty-six were infused intra-arterially at the end
   of ischemia, 18 with vehicle alone, and 18 with a mixture of PEP (80 mu
   mol/kg) and ATP (2.6 mu mol/kg). Six rabbits from each group were
   explored after 24 hr reperfusion and the muscles assessed for viability
   (by nitro blue tetrazolium). ATP (by luciferin-luciferase
   chemiluminescence), malonyldialdehyde (MDA) (thiobarbituric acid
   method), and water content. The remaining muscles in each group were
   examined histologically after either 1 hr or 4 days of reperfusion. At
   24 hr the viability of the PEP/ATP infused muscles (78.9 +/- 15.4
   percent) was significantly greater than that of untreated (41.4 +/- 27.3
   percent) or vehicle-infused groups (34.0 +/- 32.7 percent). ATP stores
   were significantly higher and MDA (indicative of free radical activity)
   and water content significantly lower in the PEP/ATP treated group. At
   24 hr and 4 days, muscles infused with PEP/ATP showed less necrosis and
   fewer infiltrating neutrophils than the untreated groups. Studies with
   isolated rabbit neutrophils showed that ATP alone significantly
   inhibited superoxide anion production by stimulated neutrophils.
   However, when combined with PEP at concentrations similar to those
   achieved in vivo, ATP did not significantly affect superoxide
   production. The findings indicate that post-ischemic infusion of PEP/ATP
   significantly reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury in rabbit skeletal
   muscle. The protective effect of PEP/ATP is more likely to be due to
   supplementation of intracellular ATP stores than to the inhibition of
   superoxide production by infiltrating neutrophils.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine whether comodulation masking
   release (CMR) and across-channel masking (ACM) are by-products of a
   similar across-channel mechanism. This was addressed by examining how
   the two are affected by stimulus manipulations expected to influence
   their magnitude. Subjects were required to detect a 1000-Hz signal in
   the presence of a masker that consisted of a 1000-Hz (on-frequency)
   component alone or that component and up to six flanking components
   (500, 600, 700, 1300, 1400, and 1500 Hz). The on-frequency and flanking
   components typically were sinusoidally amplitude modulated at 10 Hz,
   although not necessarily in phase with one another. In experiment 1, the
   amount of CMR and ACM was highly influenced by whether the signal
   consisted of one or three 50-ms tone bursts; in fact, ACM was only
   observed when the signal was a train of three 50-ms tone bursts. In
   experiments 2 and 3, CMR tended to increase as the modulation depth or
   the number of flanking components increased, whereas ACM was relatively
   unaffected by these manipulations. In addition, ACM was observed under
   dichotic situations, whereas CMR was not. Taken together, the results
   suggest that ACM and CMR may be mediated by different mechanisms. (C)

Abstract = {{The pathogenicity of a Finnish Yersinia ruckeri isolate to 1-year-old
   brown trout was tested using both immersion and injection mode of
   infection. The occurrence of bacteria and antibody production were
   monitored for up to 25 days. No disease signs or mortality due to Y.
   ruckeri occurred in the immersion experiment where the fish were further
   stressed with Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, but Y. ruckeri was isolated
   from certain organs in half of the fish. The intestine, kidney and
   spleen were the most favoured sites of infection, only one fish having
   bacteria in the liver. The injection of brown trout caused 100\% Y.
   ruckeri infection and some mortality was recorded during the first week
   post infection. All dead fish exhibited signs of bacterial infection but
   none had inflammation around the mouth. Antibodies against Y. ruckeri
   were produced in both the groups subjected to immersion and that
   subjected to injection but the production was higher in the injected
   fish. These results confirm earlier findings that the Finnish Y. ruckeri
   is less pathogenic than, for example, Y. ruckeri in USA, and indicate
   that more experimental studies are needed to examine the significance of
   geographical variation of Y. ruckeri strains in terms of their
   pathogenicity.}},

   AFTER 2 HOURS OF COLD ISCHEMIA}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1187-1192}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background. Despite hypothermia and cardioplegia, myocardial ischemia
   followed by reperfusion results in both ventricular and endothelial
   dysfunction. The endothelial dysfunction is characterized by a reduced
   response to acetylcholine, which implies a reduced ability of the
   endothelium to release nitric oxide after hypothermic ischemia and
   reperfusion. We have previously demonstrated that infusion of the nitric
   oxide precursor L-arginine only during reperfusion after hypothermic
   ischemia significantly improves the recovery of ventricular function and
   results in an increased vasodilator response to the infusion of
   acetylcholine. In contrast, other investigators have found that nitric
   oxide has deleterious effects during postischemic reperfusion.
   Methods. In the current experiments we have further examined the role of
   endothelial production of nitric oxide by adding 10 mmol/L L-arginine to
   cardioplegia in isolated, blood-perfused neonatal lamb hearts having 2
   hours of cold cardioplegic ischemia. In another group 10 mmol/L
   D-arginine, an inactive enantiomer of L-arginine, was added to the
   cardioplegia. Controls received only cardioplegia (dextrose-potassium).
   Results. At 30 minutes of reperfusion, the L-arginine group showed a
   significantly improved recovery in left ventricular systolic function
   (maximum developed pressure, developed pressure at a constant balloon
   volume {[}V10] resulting in an end-diastolic pressure of 10 mm Hg before
   ischemia, positive maximum dP/dt, and dP/dt at V10), diastolic function
   (negative maximum dP/dt and end-diastolic pressure at V10), coronary
   blood now, endothelial function (assessed by the coronary vascular
   resistance response to acetylcholine), and myocardial oxygen consumption
   compared with the control group (p < 0.05). There were no significant
   differences in the recovery of any variables between the D-arginine and
   control groups.
   Conclusions. These results suggest that provision of more substrate for
   the endothelial production of nitric oxide during ischemia has an
   important salutary effect on the recovery of postischemic myocardial and
   endothelial function and provide further evidence for an important role
   for the endothelial production of nitric oxide in the response to
   hypothermic ischemia and reperfusion in the neonatal lamb heart.}},

   Patients underwent follow-up for possible recurrence, which then was

   received, and Dukes stage. Disease-free probability was determined using
   Kaplan-Meier actuarial curves for various subgroups of the study

Abstract = {{We used microelectrodes to monitor the recovery (i.e., decrease) of
   intracellular pH (pH(i)) after using internal dialysis to load squid
   giant axons with alkali to pH(i) values of 7.7, 8.0, or 8.3. The
   dialysis fluid (DF) contained 400 mM K+ but was free of Na+ and Cl- The
   artificial seawater (ASMT) lacked Na+, K+, and Cl-, thereby eliminating
   effects of known acid-base transporters on pH(i). Under these
   conditions, halting dialysis unmasked a slow pH(i) decrease caused at
   least in part by acid-base transport we refer to as `'base efflux.''
   Replacing K+ in the DF with either NMDG(+) or TEA(+) significantly
   reduced base efflux and made membrane voltage (V-m) more positive. Base
   efflux in K+-dialyzed axons was stimulated by decreasing the pH of the
   ASW (pH(o)) from 8 to 7, implicating transport of acid or base. Although
   postdialysis acidifications also occurred in axons in which we replaced
   the K+ in the DF with Li+, Na+, Rb+, or Cs+, only with Rb+ was base
   efflux stimulated by low pH(o). Thus, the base effluxes supported by K+
   and Rb+ appear to be unrelated mechanistically to those observed with
   Lit, Na+, or Cs+. The combination of 437 mM K+ and 12 mM HCO3- in the
   ASW, which eliminates the gradient favoring a hypothetical K+/HCO3-
   efflux, blocked pH(i) recovery in K+-dialyzed axons. However, the pHi
   recovery was not blocked by the combination of 37 mM Na+, veratridine,
   and CO2/HCO3- in the ASMT, a treatment that inverts electrochemical
   gradients for H+ and HCO3- and would favor passive H+ and HCO3- fluxes
   that would have alkalinized the axon. Similarly, the recovery was not
   blocked by K+ alone or HCO3- alone in the ASW nor was it inhibited by
   the K-W pump blocker Sch28080 nor by the Na-H exchange inhibitors
   amiloride and hexamethyleneamiloride. Our data suggest that a major
   component of base efflux in alkali-loaded axons cannot be explained by
   metabolism, a H+ or HCO3- conductance, or by a K-H exchanger. However,
   this component could be mediated by a novel K/HCO3- cotransporter.}},

Abstract = {{I investigated competition for light between canopy plants and juvenile

   California's northern Coast Ranges. Canopy effects on understory light
   supply were separated among the overlying adult valley oak, the adult's
   woody understory, and neighboring trees and shrubs through a series of
   light sampling surveys and measurements of the number, size, and spatial
   distribution of neighboring plants. Light supply in the understory was
   primarily influenced by neighboring plants, with no detectable effect of
   the overlying adult valley oak. Light supply in the understory averaged
   25\% full sun due to a high frequency of canopy gaps and a typically
   open understory. Seedling response to understory light supply was
   investigated in an experimental sunfleck gradient (10\%, 19\%, and 100\%
   full sun). Between 10\% and 100\% full sun, seedling growth increased by
   90\% and the shoot:root ratio changed from 1.561 to 0.607. Shade
   seedlings were also taller and produced fewer, larger, and thinner
   leaves than seedlings grown in full sun. A field survey of the spatial
   distribution and crown morphology of saplings and young adults found 1)
   the distance between young valley oaks and neighboring overstory trees
   to increase with neighbor size, and 2) crowns of the young oaks to be
   skewed away from neighbors. Although shading by the canopy was only
   moderate, canopy effects on understory light supply may restrict
   juvenile recruitment of valley oak in this woodland.}},

Abstract = {{Two biotrophic parasites of the wild crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)
   Heynh. are being used to explore the molecular basis and evolution of
   genotype-specific recognition and host defense, Genes for recognition of
   Peronospora parasitica (downy mildew) are numerous in A. thaliana and
   located on four of the five chromosomes as described previously. Genes
   for recognition of the closely related parasite Albugo candida (white
   blister) are described here, In contrast to the former parasite, less
   than 15\% of the host accessions tested were capable of recognizing
   either of two isolates of A. candida. The geographic regions represented
   by these accessions included countries in eastern and western Europe,
   Asia, North America and Africa. Extensive collections from England and
   Germany were required to identify examples of incompatible interactions,
   Phenotypic variation among incompatible interactions included reduced
   blister formation or complete lack of asexual reproduction by the
   parasite, Variation in the extent of the host response was also
   observed, Three host genes for recognition of A. candida (RAC), each
   associated with different interaction phenotypes, were identified
   through inheritance studies with three accessions, One of these genes at
   locus RAC1 appeared to be completely dominant, whereas the other two
   genes were only partially dominant or recessive under certain
   conditions, possibly including the effect of genetic background, One of
   the latter two genes defined a second locus RAC2, RAC1 was mapped to the
   top arm of chromosome 1 in the 1 cM interval between RFLP markers M254
   and M253.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - To determine the possibility of an ethnic influence on the
   development of macrosomia (birth weight >90th percentile for gestational
   age) in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We prospectively followed all
   African-American and Latino women enrolled in the Temple
   diabetes-in-pregnancy program. GDM was diagnosed in 103 African-American
   and 36 Latino women during the study period (1991-1994) according to the
   criteria of Carpenter and Coustan. All women were treated according to
   our previously published protocols. Data were collected on gestational
   weight gain, previous history of macrosomia, body mass index (BMI), and
   level of maternal glycemic control.
   RESULTS - Insulin therapy was required in 53 women(37.5\%) to maintain
   fasting blood glucose levels at <95 mg/dl and 2-h postprandial levels at
   <120 mg/dl. Macrosomia developed in 50\% of the neonates of Latino women
   versus 19\% of neonates of African-American women (relative risk 2.68;
   95\% confidence interval 1.57-4.59). Potential confounding factors were
   not significantly different between the Latino and African-American
   women: mean blood glucose 96.6 +/- 15.7 vs. 96.5 +/- 22.4 mg/dl; BMI
   29.0 +/- 5.5 vs. 31.5 +/- 8.2 kg/m(2) pregnancy weight gain 29.2 +/-
   12.7 vs. 30.9 +/- 20.5 lb; and parity 1.8 +/- 1.5 vs. 1.6 +/- 1.4,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS - We have demonstrated that Latino women with GDM are at
   higher risk for having macrosomic infants in comparison with
   African-American women. This ethnic variation in fetal growth may be due
   to varying influences of in utero growth promoters among these
   populations as well as underlying genetic factors.}},

Abstract = {{Thrombomodulin (TM) is composed of five domains. We investigated the
   roles of the sixth epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like structure (E6) in
   the second domain (D2) and of an O-glycosylation site rich domain (D3)
   in the function of TM in more detail using deletion analysis. Two
   soluble mutants of TM, TMD123 and TMD12, and three deletion mutants
   lacking respectively 6, 16, and 38 C-terminal residues of the E6
   portion, TMD12 Delta 6, TMD12 Delta 16, and TMD12 Delta 38, were
   expressed in COS cells and purified. The results of protein C-activating
   cofactor assay showed that TMD12 Delta e, TMD12 Delta 18, and TMD12
   Delta 38, which lack the C-terminal region, had remarkably weak cofactor
   activities in comparison with TMD123 (9.1, 1.4, and 1.1\% of TMD123
   activity, respectively). Similar findings were obtained for
   anticoagulant activity. These findings indicate that the last loop
   structure in E6 is required for full activity of recombinant human TM.
   We also determined in vivo stabilities of TMD12, TMD123, and TMD12 Delta
   6 in a pharmacokinetic study in rats. TMD12 and TMD12 Delta 6, which
   lack the D3 domain, exhibited increased clearance (about twice that of
   D123). This finding suggested that the D3 domain of TM plays an
   important role in stabilizing TM in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the mean square radius of the deuteron in the

   concerning the constituent nucleons. We argue the possibilities to
   explain the discrepancy in the mean square radius of the deuteron
   between experiment and non-relativistic nuclear potential models. It is
   found that the relativistic corrections cannot account for the
   discrepancy, since the relevant relativistic corrections cancel each
   other. For the relativistic corrections to the non-relativistic theory,
   it is necessary to have at least a consistent treatment of both the
   equation and the electromagnetic current of the deuteron as a bound
   system. Furthermore, we estimate the contributions of the off-shell
   effects for the photon-nucleon interaction vertex. These off-shell
   effects may be candidates to explain the discrepancy.}},

Abstract = {{Cytoplasmic incompatibility is caused in various insects by
   intracellular infection with rickettsia-like microorganisms of the genus
   Wolbachia. In Japan Laodelphax striatellus shows unidirectional
   cytoplasmic incompatibility between northeastern and southwestern
   populations. In this study, nine natural populations of L. striatellus
   collected from central Japan, including the geographic boundary between
   the two cytotype populations, were analysed for Wolbachia infection by
   PCR using primers specific to Wolbachia 16S rDNA. The geographic pattern
   of the infection rates of the southwestern (high) and the northeastern
   (low or zero) populations broadly resembled that of a previous study of
   incompatibility. In populations which originated from the boundary
   regions between the southwestern and northeastern populations, the
   infected and uninfected cytotypes coexisted, It is suggested that in
   some populations of L. striatellus, which formerly had been uninfected
   with Wolbachia, the infection property has changed to the infected.
   Based on our results, we conclude that the distribution of
   Wolbachia-infected L. striatellus populations have spread northeasterly

Abstract = {{Shock tube experiments have been undertaken in which a shock wave
   accelerates normally to an interface separating two gases of different
   densities leading to the formation of a three-dimensional mixing zone
   between the two gases. Assuming the mixing zone to be homogeneous and
   weakly dependent on the wall effects, an integrated monodirectional
   absorption technique had been previously carried out and average
   temperature and density evolutions were determined within it. But the
   mixing zone is really deformed by the wall effects and in consequence it
   is not homogeneous. Thus, to improve the diagnostic technique, the
   experimental setup has been modified so that the mixing zone is divided
   into nine identical homogeneous imaginary regions. Temperature and
   species concentration are determined through each region of the mixing
   zone by a multidirectional laser absorption technique in order to have
   some new information on the influence of the wall effects on the
   Richtmyer-Meshkov instability study in square-cross-section shock tubes.
   Furthermore, a better accuracy in the measurements of the mixing zone
   thickness is obtained from a discussion of the concentration profiles.
   The consequence is that previous results achieved with integrated
   techniques such as global Schlieren, shadograph, or monodirectional
   absorption methods seem to be strongly overestimated.}},

   amplitude dwarf novae. Limited ground-based optical photometry was also
   obtained contemporaneously. This is the first such ultraviolet
   spectroscopy of these systems, and we compare our results with other
   well-studied dwarf novae of similar orbital periods. We find that the
   slope of the ultraviolet spectra are similar to that for typical dwarf
   novae during normal outburst but are slightly bluer than other
   short-period systems at superoutburst. Complex line profiles exist and
   show large wind velocities which exceed the white dwarf escape velocity
   and are at or above the largest velocities seen in normal dwarf novae.
   We also present an observational summary of the outburst lightcurves of
   SW UMa and how these may be related to other large outburst dwarf novae.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. The effects of gender, pregnancy and anesthesia on the
   pharmacokinetics of zidovudine (AZT) were studied in rats.
   Methods. Unanesthetized male (MR), female (FR) and pregnant (day 20, PR)
   rats received 50 mg/kg AZT via a jugular vein cannula. Female (FRA),
   pregnant (day 20, PRA) and pregnant (day 20, PRR) rats maintained under
   ketamine: acepromazine:xylazine anesthesia also received 50 mg/kg AZT.
   Two fetuses were removed at each sampling time from the PRR group.
   Plasma samples were collected and analyzed by RIA.
   Results. With the exception of a lower non-renal clearance in female
   rats, there were no gender differences in the disposition of AZT. No
   significant differences were noted in total clearance, non-renal
   clearance or volume of distribution between pregnant and female rats,
   however, significant differences in renal clearance values were evident.
   Anesthesia resulted in decreased total, renal and non-renal clearances
   in female and pregnant rats. The removal of fetuses during the
   experiments did not alter the total clearance of AZT in pregnant rats,
   however, renal clearance and volume of distribution were decreased by
   cesarian section.
   Conclusions. The rat appears to be a suitable laboratory animal model
   for investigating AZT disposition during pregnancy. However, results of
   pharmacokinetic studies when animals are maintained under anesthesia
   with ketamine:acepromazine:xylazine must be interpreted with caution.}},

Abstract = {{The defect engineering in metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy In(x)G(1-x)As
   and InP controlled oxygen doping using diethyl aluminum ethoxide (DEALO)
   was developed in this study. DEALO doping has led to the incorporation
   of Al and O, and the compensation of shallow Si donors in InxGa1-xAs:Si
   with 0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.25. With the same
   DEALO mole fraction during growth, the incorporation of Al and O was
   found to be independent of x, but the compensation of Si donors
   decreases with increasing In content. Deep level transient spectroscopy
   analysis on a series of InxGa1-xAs:Si:O samples with 0 less than or
   equal to x less than or equal to 0.18 revealed that oxygen incorporation
   led to a set of deep levels, similar to those found in DEALO doped GaAs.
   As the In composition was increased, one or more of these deep levels
   became resonant with the conduction band and led to a high electron
   concentration in oxygen doped In0.53Ga0.47As. Low temperature
   photoluminescence emission measurements at 12K on the same set of
   samples revealed the quenching of the near-band edge peak, and the
   appearance of new oxygen-induced emission features. DEALO doping in InP
   has also led to the incorporation of Al and O, and the compensation of
   Si donors due to oxygen-induced multiple deep levels.}},

   materials (NaZn13 structure type). At larger values of x the ternary
   alloy formed in a bct structure (Ce2Ni17Si9 structure type). Replacement
   of Co by Si in PrCo13 results in a drop in T-C from 1318 K (for LaCo13)
   to similar to 900 K for fcc Pr(Co,Si)(13) alloy and to similar to 20 K

   predict ab initio its rough 3D topology. The main tools used were Hidden
   Markov models (HMM) for fold recognition, a beta-strand pair potential
   to predict beta-sheet topology, and the PHD server for secondary

Abstract = {{A least squares optimization strategy is first reviewed and applied to
   the task of fitting a given collection of symmetric proximity values
   defined between the objects from one set by a collection of
   reconstructed proximity values, satisfying a fixed set of constraints,
   generated from some specified graph-theoretic structure, such as an
   ultrametric or an additive tree, selected for representing the objects.
   Our method uses iterative projection on to closed convex sets defined by
   the collection of given constraints characterizing the structural
   representation specified, and in contrast to least squares optimization
   methods that impose such constraints through the use of penalty
   functions, avoids the use of the latter, as well as the implementation
   of any gradient-based optimization technique. Secondly, just as various
   penalty-function/gradient-based optimization techniques have been turned
   into heuristic search strategies for such particular structures of
   interest as ultrametrics or additive trees, the use of iterative
   projection is suggested as a general heuristic search strategy for
   locating the best structural representations to impose in the first
   place, where the collection of constraints used may vary over the course
   of the optimization process. Our evaluation of the expected results uses
   several data sets previously analysed in the literature. Finally,
   several other applications of iterative projection as a heuristic
   optimization technique are discussed, including the consideration of
   data beyond that of a single symmetric proximity matrix (for example,
   extensions to two-mode proximity matrices, i.e. between two distinct
   object sets, and to three-way proximity matrices either symmetric or
   not), and to representations based on sums of matrices where each is
   constrained separately to conform to some desired representational
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{The X chromosome pair was identified in diakinesis/metaphase I stage
   mouse oocytes using a repeat sequence DNA probe and fluorescence in situ
   hybridisation. Chiasma positions along the X bivalent were mea sured in
   57 oocytes from 4 females. Overall, our observations showed that while
   there were no obvious `'hotspots'' for chiasma formation along the X
   chromosome, there was a tendency to favour the distal end. Minimum
   inter-chiasma distances were substantial indicating the occurrence of
   strong genetic interference. Estimates of both genetic distances and
   recombination fractions for any interval along the chromosome can be
   calculated from the chiasma data. The average chiasma frequency for the
   X bivalent was 1.37 giving an estimated total genetic map length of 68.5
   cM. In general, the pattern of chiasma distribution along the X
   chromosome resembled that anticipated from recombination distances in
   published consensus linkage maps. There were, however, some intriguing
   differences between the two approaches. The reason for these
   discrepancies are unknown but may be related to lack of precision in
   cytogenetic mapping of loci, inter-strain and/or interspecies
   differences in the genetic controls over the distribution of crossover
   events. One advantage of the chiasma analysis approach is its
   suitability for investigating these problems.}},

Abstract = {{Presented in this paper is a fuzzy logic approach to improve performance
   of a magnetic bearing control system. Classical, linear design
   techniques are most often used to control the natural instability of
   these bearings, but magnetic nonlinearities limit control effectiveness
   and the region of stable performance. Therefore, the idea here is to
   adjust the linear controller signal in such a way that nonlinear effects
   are better compensated. The relationships of attractive force to the
   electromagnet currents and air gap are described and compensated using
   fuzzy principles, rather than a precise model-based control approach.
   Computer simulations are used to confirm that a fuzzy description of
   nonlinear compensation does indeed improve system performance, without
   requiring an exact model of the bearing nonlinearities.}},

Abstract = {{The CAMCOG, which forms part of the CAMDEX interview (Roth et al., 1986,
   1988), is a brief neuropsychological battery designed to assess the
   range of cognitive functions required for a diagnosis of dementia, and
   to detect mild degrees of cognitive impairment. It was administered to a
   population sample of 418 elderly people (aged 77 and above) in their
   place of residence. The data show that in contrast to the Mini-Mental
   State Examination, total CAMCOG scores are well distributed and there is
   no ceiling effect.
   Examination of the association between CAMCOG scores and
   socio-demographic variables (age, sex, education and social class) shows
   that each exerts a significant, and independent, effect upon
   performance.
   CAMCOG also includes a number of subscales which assess individual areas
   of cognitive function. Of the eight major subscales (orientation,
   language, memory, attention, praxis, calculation, abstract thinking,
   perception), age was significantly related to all but attention; sex
   with attention, praxis, calculation and perception; education with
   language and abstract thinking; and social class with language and
   perception. In all these analyses, the results were adjusted for the
   effects of the other socio-demographic variables using analysis of
   variance. However, education and social class are highly correlated
   variables and when the association with education is examined without
   adjusting for social class, attention and praxis are also found to be
   significantly related to education. Caution must therefore be taken when
   using the CAMCOG (or any other cognitive test) as a screening test for
   dementia, using a single, predetermined cutpoint.
   In general, the combination of brevity and breadth of the CAMCOG, along
   with its distributional properties, makes it an attractive
   neuropsychological test for use in the community or the clinic.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a benchmark job-lot manufacturing system a simulation study was
   carried out to compare the performance of just-in-time (JIT) shop
   control system Kanban with conventional job-shop control procedures. The
   shop control policies were tested under a good manufacturing environment
   and the effects of job mix and load capacity bottlenecks on various shop
   control policies were tested. From the simulation results, it is
   inferred that there are shop control procedures that perform better than
   the Kanban in a job shop. It has been observed that even with adequate
   capacity, bottleneck areas surface due to fluctuations in the shop load.
   Kanban is not appropriate in such a situation because capacity
   bottlenecks can significantly reduce the effectiveness of a pull system.
   The disparateness in the processing requirements for jobs can seriously
   undermine the performance of the shop. This is the type of shop
   environment where the shop control procedures will be most effective.
   Although Kanban came out best when the load capacity bottlenecks and the
   disparateness of the jab mix were removed, the selected shop control
   variable combinations closely approximated the Kanban result. Although
   many features of JIT can be implemented in any system, companies trying
   to adopt JIT should remember that Kanban requires a rigid system
   intolerant of any deviation.}},

   maximum at 682 nm (PChl 682/672) appeared. The long-wavelength PChl form
   could be photoconverted into a stable Chl form: PChl 682/672 --> Chl
   715/696. This photoreaction is observed both at room temperature and at
   -40 degrees C. The proximity of the absorption maxima of Chl 715/696 to
   the absorption spectra of the primary donor and primary acceptor of
   photosystem I and of the fluorescence band of Chl 715/696 to the
   fluorescence spectrum of Chl of the core antenna of PSI suggest that Chl
   715/696 is the Chl of the PSI core. This is consistent with the
   literature indicating the appearance of PSI activity within a few
   seconds of illumination of the studied cells.}},

Abstract = {{Background Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to modulate cardiac
   function. We investigated the effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on NO
   synthase activity in cardiac myocytes.
   Methods and Results Using the Griess reagent,we measured the production
   of nitrite, a stable metabolite of NO, by cultured neonatal rat cardiac
   myocytes. The expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA was
   assayed by Northern blotting. Incubation of cardiac myocytes for 24
   hours with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) caused a significant increase
   in NO production. Ang II significantly augmented NO synthesis in IL-1
   beta-stimulated but not in unstimulated cells in a dose-dependent
   manner. The angiotensin type I receptor antagonist CV 11974 inhibited
   the effect of Ang II dose-dependently. Simultaneous incubation of Ang II
   with N-G-monomethyl-L-arginine or actinomycin D also completely
   inhibited the effect of Ang II. The Ang II-induced NO production by IL-1
   beta-stimulated cells was accompanied by increased iNOS mRNA
   accumulation. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also augmented NO
   syn thesis in IL-1 beta-stimulated but not in unstimulated cells in a
   dose-dependent manner. The protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C
   dose-dependently blocked the effect of Ang II. After protein kinase C
   activity was functionally depleted by treatment of cells with PMA for 24
   hours, Ang II did not augment IL-1 beta-induced NO production.
   Conclusions These results indicate that Ang II upregulates IL-1 beta
   induced iNOS expression in cardiac myocytes, which is mediated at least
   partially via activation of protein kinase C.}},

Abstract = {{A new adaptation technique has been developed for two- and

   Roe's approximate Riemann solver. The grid is unstructured, and its
   motion and evolution obey the physical and geometrical conservation
   laws. The error is evaluated by a reconstructed,higher order solution,
   which is used to derive a forcing term to drive the motion of the grid
   nodes. This is formulated so as to uniformly distribute the error, while
   keeping the same grid connectivity. The development is made for two- and
   three-dimensional grids, although results are presented only for

Abstract = {{On western Kongsoya, Svalbard, three coarsening-upwards sequences of
   marine to littoral sediments, separated by tills, are recognised in
   sections at ca 50-92 m above present sea level. These sequences show
   major glaciations in the northern Barents Sea, resulting ih substantial
   glacioisostatic downpressing of Kongstoya. Till fabrics indicate ice
   movements controlled by the local topography, while glaciotectonic
   deformations suggest that ice moved from an ice divide northeast of
   Kongsoya, independent of the local topography. The stratigraphical
   evidences show two pre-Holocene ice-free periods, when the climate was
   similar to or slightly warmer than at present. The age of these periods
   is not clear. It is suggested that the elder ice free interval is older
   than isotope stage 5e. The younger ice free interval could be of Eemian
   or Early Weichselian age. The uppermost succession of
   sublittoral-littoral sediments is of early Holocene age. It relates to
   the high (greater than or equal to 100 m) postglacial marine limit,
   dated to approximately 10,000 sp.}},

Abstract = {{One of the `'interesting'' objects identified by Weinberger during an
   eyeball search of sky survey plates for planetary nebulae is a
   previously unrecognized distant Galactic halo globular cluster. Deep B,
   R, and I CCD frames of the object to R = 23 reveal it to be a cluster of
   stars some 2' in core size, with a well-defined main sequence with a
   turnoff at R = 22 and a sparsely populated subgiant branch leading to a
   stubby red horizontal branch at R = 18.7. With a reddening-corrected
   distance modulus of 18.0, corresponding to a distance of 40 kpc, the
   Pyxis globular cluster is the latest addition to an exclusive club of
   distant Galactic satellites. Pyxis is similar in morphological
   appearance to other outer halo globular clusters and lies tantalizingly
   close to the plane of the Magellanic Clouds orbit (Jones and coworkers),
   suggesting it might be a detached cluster of this system.}},

Abstract = {{A computational model is developed that allows one to estimate in a real
   3-D geometry the electrodynamic characteristics of complicated waveguide
   antennas ('grills') generating plasma waves in the lower hybrid
   frequency band. The antenna coupling efficiency and the shape of the
   wavenumber spectrum are found as a solution of a self-consistent problem
   taking into account a complete set of waveguide eigenmodes and finite
   waveguide dimensions in both directions and an arbitrary orientation to
   the plasma magnetic field. Electric and magnetic fields inside the
   waveguides are equated to the outside fields represented as a Fourier
   sum over wavenumbers N-3, N-z in the plane parallel to the plasma
   surface. The fields at the plasma edge are determined by the 2 x 2
   plasma surface impedance matrix found as a numerical solution of the
   wave equation in the cold plasma approximation using the finite element
   (Galerkin) method. The solution is found on a 1-D mesh, i = 1, 2,..., N,
   in the form E(x(i), N-y, N-z) exp{[}i(N(y)y + N(z)z - omega t)] so that
   the fourth order differential equation with appropriate boundary
   conditions is reduced to a set of 4N+2 algebraic equations. The
   developed model is applied to modelling a quite new antenna design for
   generating the fast H waves, which can be used for plasma heating and
   current drive in tokamaks of ITER scale. The antenna parameters are
   optimized to obtain the best coupling efficiency. The structure of waves
   excited in the plasma at various angles between the antenna and the
   plasma magnetic field is considered. The nature of the waves with N-z <
   1 excited by the grill is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHAP) particles synthesized by a wet method
   have been modified by treating them with water-acetone solutions of
   ethyl phosphates (EP). The modified CaHAP particles were characterized
   by various means, XRD patterns of the modified CaHAP particles showed a
   strong peak at d=1.40 nm in addition to the peaks characteristic of
   CaHAP. With increasing EP concentration the XRD peaks of CaHAP were
   weakened while the new strong peak grew rapidly. The original particles
   were modified by EP, with no formation of new particles. These results
   indicate that treatment with EP induces the formation of a layered
   structure in the surface layer of the particles. The H2O and C2H5 groups
   present in the modified particles were removed by heating above 350
   degrees C in air, which resulted in the immediate disappearance of the
   XRD peaks due to the layered structure, so that only the CaHAP peaks
   were observed. Outgassing of the modified materials above 300 degrees C
   gave mesoporous CaHAP particles.}},

Abstract = {{The technique of using the `escape function' for global optimization in
   lens design is described. This includes how to identify two solutions as
   independent; the threshold value for this criterion can be chosen to
   determine how to explore local solutions-rough or fine. Choice of
   appropriate values for two parameters in the escape function is most
   important, since this will affect the efficiency of the automatic global
   optimization process. There are two problems, i.e. giving default values
   at the beginning of the design, and determining a default rule to change
   them when the escape is unsuccessful. The latter was solved by assuming
   a `saddle path' as the best route to escape. An exact solution for the
   former was not found, but a hint for finding a second best solution is
   shown based on the statistical study of local minima.}},

   carbonyl group and carboxyl group which are adsorbed chemical
   components. The other impurities were observed on the surface in both
   cases; however, the number and level of impurities on the surface after
   FZM were much larger than those on the surface before FZM; these adhered
   to the surface during sample preparation for XPS measurement. It is
   concluded that sample preparation introduces contamination which affects
   the detection limit of chemical analytical instruments. Sn was only
   observed on the top surface after FZM. It was segregated Sn which was
   contained in chromium as a starting material. It must be eliminated
   before starting. From XPS depth profiling results, it was concluded that

Abstract = {{To resolve the propagation characteristics of low-frequency (LF) radio
   waves in the low latitude magnetosphere, the navigation radio signal
   (transmitting frequency of 85.725 kHz, 1.2 kW CW) from Biei Decca
   station in Hokkaido (geographical latitude: 43.60 degrees N,
   geographical longitude: 142.45 degrees E, magnetic latitude: 37.20
   degrees N) was observed at Birdsville, Australia (geographical latitude:
   25.83 degrees S, geographical longitude: 139.33 degrees E, magnetic
   longitude: 37.08 degrees S), which is the magnetic conjugate point. From
   the analysis of the intensity, Doppler spectrum and polarization of the
   magnetospheric propagation wave, the following characteristics were
   obtained. (1) The magnetospheric wave, which is below the detectable
   level during daytime, appeared around sunset and disappeared immediately
   after sunrise. (2) at sunset, the width of the Doppler spectrum
   spreading is rather narrow and the polarization is a right-handed
   elliptical one. This suggests a propagation in a few ducts. (3) During
   the night, the width of the Doppler spectrum spreading is rather wide
   and the polarization is a right-handed elliptical one close to linear.
   The intensity is higher when the sustaining duration of the
   magnetospheric propagation wave is longer. This suggests a propagation

   intermedius strains. Streptococcus anginosus was recovered more often
   from the genital and urinary tracts and S constellatus was recovered
   from the thorax. Streptococcus intermedius was mostly found in the head

Abstract = {{Norwood's operation provides satisfactory palliation for neonates with
   hypoplastic left heart syndrome, The dominant physiologic features of
   hypoplastic left heart syndrome, ductal dependency of the systemic
   circulation and parallel pulmonary and systemic circulations, are shared
   by a multitude of other less common congenital heart malformations.
   Theoretically, these should be equally amenable to palliation by
   Norwood's operation, Between January 1990 and June 1994, 60 neonates
   with malformations other than hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent
   initial surgical palliation by Norwood's procedure. Diagnoses included
   single left ventricle with levo-transposition of the great arteries
   (12); critical aortic stenosis (8); complex double-outlet right
   ventricle (8); interrupted aortic arch with ventricular septal defect
   and subaortic stenosis (7); ventricular septal defect, subaortic
   stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta (7); aortic atresia with large
   ventricular septal defect (6); tricuspid atresia with transposition of
   the great arteries (6); heterotaxy syndrome with subaortic obstruction
   (3); and other (3), There were 10 hospital deaths and 50 survivors (83\%
   survival), After the introduction of inspired carbon dioxide therapy
   into the postoperative management protocol (1991), 42 of 47 patients
   survived (89\% survival), Mortality was independent of diagnosis and
   essentially the same as that for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. With
   minor technical modifications, Norwood's operation provides satisfactory
   initial palliation for a wide variety of malformations characterized by
   ductal dependency of the systemic circulation in anticipation of either
   a Fontan procedure or a biventricular repair.}},

Abstract = {{Female mice of the BALB/c and CF1 strains were mated and irradiated with
   various doses of X-rays 7 h after presumed fertilization. 18 days later,
   females were killed and their uteri examined for prenatal mortality at
   the different stages of development. Living fetuses were weighed and
   examined for the presence of external malformations. A number of them
   were also examined for skeletal anomalies. Radiation induced mainly a
   dose-dependent increase of the preimplantation loss in the BALB/c strain
   and of the early postimplantation loss in the CF1 strain. Embryos of the
   BALB/c strain were refractory to the induction of teratogenic effects
   after such preimplantation irradiation. In CF1 mice, the frequency of
   malformed fetuses increased regularly after irradiation, the difference
   with controls being significant for the doses of 10, 50 and 100 cGy.
   Dwarfism occurrence also appeared to be increased by irradiation in this
   strain, although the importance of this effect varied depending on the
   criterion chosen for the assessment of dwarfs. With the definition
   proposed in the present paper, the increase in the frequency of dwarfs
   paralleled that of malformed fetuses, being significant after doses of
   50 and 100 cGy. Irradiation did not increase the frequency of skeletal
   anomalies. A careful examination of the various data obtained to date
   led us to conclude that radiation may possibly be teratogenic in several
   mouse strains, when administered as early as during the one-cell stage
   and, to a lesser extent, during the following preimplantation stages.
   However, early prenatal mortality will remain by far the greatest risk
   associated with an exposure to radiation during this period. Moreover,
   the relativity of the risk of abnormality due to such irradiation should
   be considered in the context of the high prevalence of developmental
   defects spontaneously occurring during human pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{A virulent strain of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, subgroup
   Pontiac, was grown in continuous culture at a constant growth rate under
   iron-replete and iron-limited conditions. Iron limitation was achieved
   by the removal of ferrous sulfate and hemin from the chemically defined
   medium. Residual contaminating iron, 0.45 mu M, was sufficient to
   support iron-limited growth. Typical iron-replete cultures metabolized
   3.3 mu M iron. Serine provided the principal source of carbon and energy
   for both cultures, although iron-replete cultures also depleted a number
   of other amino acids. There was a 40\% decrease in culture biomass under
   iron restricted conditions. iron limitation did not significantly affect
   carbohydrate metabolism, with the molar growth yield for carbon
   (Y-carbon) comparable for both cultures, However, under iron-limited
   conditions a sixfold increase in Y-iron correlated with a significant
   decrease in the iron content of the biomass, as the culture utilized the
   available iron more efficiently. Highly pleomorphic iron-replete
   cultures became uniform cultures of short fine rods when adapted to
   iron-deficient conditions. In addition to the morphological and
   physiological changes, iron limitation had a critical effect on culture
   virulence. The virulence of this strain was significantly (P < 0.05)
   reduced when the culture was subjected to iron-limited conditions. This
   phenomenon was reversible, with a significant increase in culture
   virulence upon reversion to iron-replete conditions. When compared in an
   in vitro macrophage assay, the number of culturable avirulent
   iron-limited cells located intracellularly after infection was
   significantly lower than for the virulent replete and control cultures.
   These results further support the role of environmental parameters in
   regulating the virulence of L. pneumophila.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafine titanium dioxide powder was synthesized by the gas-phase
   oxidation of titanium tetrachloride in a multistage aerosol reactor. The
   reactor consisted of three zones: an evaporation zone for TiCl4, a
   preheating zone for oxygen and vaporized titanium tetrachloride, and a
   reaction zone. Preheating temperature of reactants, partial pressure of
   reactants, and temperature in the reaction zone were chosen as
   experimental variables for the control of particle size and
   distribution. Ultrafine TiO2 powders ranging from 30 to 70 nm in average
   particle sizes were produced. The preheating temperature of reactants
   was found to be an effective factor for particle size and distribution
   of ultrafine powders. As the preheating temperature was increased,
   average particle size became smaller and size distribution more uniform.
   Larger particles having narrow size distributions were produced with an
   increase in TiCl4 mole fraction under the control of preheating
   temperature. However, variation of O-2 mole fraction did not show much
   difference on the average particle size. As the temperature in the
   reaction zone was increased, average particle size became smaller. With
   the decrease in the residence time of reactants in the reaction zone
   smaller particles were obtained.}},

   design safety of the limit states. The reinforcing steel bars are
   uniformly distributed throughout the beam section. Three different
   ductility definitions (strain, curvature, and displacement) were derived
   and presented, This paper also formulated a structural reliability
   analysis method to establish limitations on the quantity of steel in
   masonry beams. Equations were derived for the expected capacity at yield
   and ultimate limit states. An important part of this paper was to
   quantify the uncertainty in the design capacity of concrete masonry
   beams of different limit stares resulting from the variation of design
   variables, A Monte Carlo analysis was performed to incorporate the
   uncertainties in material properties, structural engineering equations,
   and construction quality control.}},

Abstract = {{The species composition of sand flies and the seasonality of Phlebotomus
   papatasi Scopoli were studied in the southern Jordan Valley from May to
   November 1992 using CDC light traps. Eleven species of sand flies were
   recorded, including P. kazeruni Theodor \& Mesghali and P. tobbi Adler
   \& Theodor, which are new records for the study area, and Sergentomyia
   squamipleuris Newstead, which is reported for the first time from
   Jordan. P. papatasi was the most abundant Phlebotomus species collected
   from domestic habitats as well as Psammomys obesus Crestzchmar burrows,
   comprising 89.4 and 99.5\% of the total Phlebotomus catches,
   respectively. The catch of P. papatasi in CDC light traps was compared
   among domestic habitats, P. obesus burrows in an agriculturally modified
   semiarid rural habitat, and P. obesus burrows in a natural semiarid
   rural habitat. Peak P. papatesi abundance occurred in September and
   October and then declined sharply by late November. The abundance and
   temporal association of P. papatasi activity with the prevalence of
   cutaneous leishmaniasis in the study area pointed to the significance of
   this sand fly in the transmission of the parasite.}},

   simple freeze-thaw procedure, The assay routinely detected 1 to 10
   oocysts in purified oocyst preparations, as shown by direct microscopic
   counts and by an immunofluorescence assay, The sensitivity of the PCR
   assay in some seeded environmental water samples was up to 1,000-fold

   or magnetic-antibody capture. Sensitivity was also improved 10- to
   1,000-fold by probing of the PCR product on dot blots with an
   oligonucleotide probe detected by chemiluminescence, Confirmation of the
   presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples from the outbreak

   M LiClO4/HClO4, with rate constants reported at 25 degrees C. All these
   reactions are first order in {[}Cr2+] and independent of {[}H+]. The
   iodine atom abstraction from ethyliodoacetate by chromium(II) gives rate
   = k{[}Cr2+] {[}EIA], k=0.41+/-0.02 M(-1) s(-1), Delta H{*}=20.4+/-5 kJ
   mol(-1), Delta S{*} = -184+/-14J mol(-1) K-1. The reaction of
   (NH3)(5)CoO2CCH2I2+ is complicated because of competing iodine atom
   abstraction atom abstraction and cobalt(III) reduction and the reaction
   is biphasic. The overall rate for the first stage gives k(1app) =
   0.23+/-0.02 M(-1) s(-1), Delta H{*} = 22.0+/-7.2 kJ mol(-1), Delta S{*}
   = -183+/-20.6 J mol(-1) K-1. The individual contributions have been
   separated by a study of the rate of cobalt(II) production. The first
   stage yields (NH3)(5)CoO2CCH2-Cr(OH2)(5)(4+) (B-1) (k=0.07 M(-1) s(-1))
   and (H2O)(5)CrO2CCH2I2+ (A(1)) (k=0.13 M(-1) s(-1)). For the second

   mol(-1), Delta S{*} = -204+/-13.4 cal mol(-1) K-1 and this stage
   involves halogen abstraction from A(1) (k=0.045 M(-1) s(-1)) and
   cobalt(III) reduction of B-1 (k similar to 0.012 M(-1) s(-1)). The
   aquation of (H2O)(5)CrI2+ catalysed by Cr(II) has been observed as a
   second stage in the reaction of EIA, and an independent study gives the
   following kinetic results: rate=k{[}Cr2+]{[}(H2O)(5)CrI2+]/{[}H+],
   k=0.020+/-0.002 s(-1), Delta H{*} = 69.9+/-3.0 kJ mol(-1), Delta S{*} =

Abstract = {{An architectural analysis of the root system of young oil-palm (Elaeis
   guineensis Jacq.) seedlings was made. In this analysis, root branching
   was modelled by a Markov chain (discrete-time, discrete-state space
   stochastic process). This study has been realized on radicles of young
   oil-palm seedlings which were considered as main axes which branch. We
   defined an elementary length unit as the smallest length between two
   successive lateral roots. The model was based on the analysis of a
   sequence of events, each event being indexed by the rank of the
   elementary length unit on the main axis. An event was defined as the
   state of the length unit, chosen between unbranched state and three
   branched-state categories. The branching process of the oil-palm radicle
   was modelled by a four-state first-order Markov chain. Consequently, the

Abstract = {{Molybdenum trioxide with an orthorhombic symmetry is one of the most
   interesting layered intercalation materials because of its use in solid
   state batteries and display systems. In the present investigation, thin
   films of MoO3 were prepared by flash-evaporation technique on silica
   glass and silicon substrates maintained at different temperatures, T-s,
   in the range of 30-300 degrees C. The films were systematically
   characterized by studying their structural, optical and electrical
   properties. X-ray diffraction and SEM analysis showed that films have an
   orthorhombic layered structure. The Raman scattering and infrared
   absorption were studied to establish the T-s dependence of the film
   properties. The energy gap of MoO3 films is located between 2.8 and 3.2
   eV depending on the substrate and annealing temperature. AC and DC
   conductivities were measured as a function of T-s. The effect of
   annealing treatment was also investigated.}},

Title = {{A SIMPLE PROCEDURE FOR ESTIMATING PRECONSOLIDATION PRESSURE FROM SOIL
   COMPRESSION CURVES}},
Journal = {{SOIL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Classical graphics and regression procedures have been used to estimate
   preconsolidation pressure (sigma(p)) from soil compression curves, but
   none of these procedures is easy to use and they often involve
   subjective judgement. This paper presents a simple procedure for
   estimating sigma(p) from uniaxial compression tests for either saturated
   or unsaturated soil conditions. We evaluated five methods for estimating
   sigma(p) from standard soil compression curves for an applied stress
   sequence of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600 kPa. Four methods
   estimated sigma(p) as the intersection of two lines: (a) the regression
   line obtained for the first two, three, four or five points of the
   applied stress sequence in the secondary compression portion of the
   compression curve and (b) the extension of the virgin compression line
   determined from the points associated with applied stress of 800 and
   1600 kPa. Method 5 consisted of the Schmertmann method. The sigma(p)
   determined for each method was compared to sigma(p) estimated using the
   graphical procedure of Casagrande for 288 soil compression curves from
   three soils in Michigan and from values reported in the literature.
   Methods 1 and 5 fit our data best at low sigma(p) (high soil water
   content) while methods 2 and 3 fit the data better at high sigma(p) (low
   soil water content). Based on a low RMSE (18), a high R(2) (0.92), and
   closeness of fit to the 1:1 line, a combination of methods 1 and 3 was
   selected as the best estimation procedure. For data from the literature,
   methods 1 and 2 provided the best estimate based on lowest RMSE of 5 to
   9, R(2) of 0.98 to 0.99, and the closest fit to the 1:1 line. The
   combined methods were not tested for published data since matric
   potentials for measured values were unknown. The final procedure,
   combined methods 1 and 3, was programmed into a computer spreadsheet
   provided in an Appendix. This procedure provides a fast and reliable
   estimation of sigma(p) for saturated and unsaturated soil conditions and
   eliminates subjective judgment associated with classical graphical
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The Space Station Alpha is the most significant international space
   project of this century and the largest international technology
   development project ever undertaken. The space robot manipulators will
   be a substantial part of the space station and will perform tasks such
   as assembly as well as maintenance of the station. Therefore the robot
   manipulators need a very sophisticated real-time control capability for
   gross and fine motions (i.e. compliant motions) during various
   operations. Moreover, the proposed dual-arm robot system servicing the
   Space Station requires automated motion coordination, synchronization of
   the arms, and controlled mechanical interaction with fixed and moving
   objects involved in various tasks.
   This paper presents a comprehensive solution to the problem of robust
   execution of fine motions within the context of a Supervised Autonomous
   System and develops an adaptive control technique which provides on-line
   autonomous trajectory correction and compliant motion in an unstructured
   environment for space operations. The Adaptive Control Techniques have
   recently emerged as promising alternatives to the conventional methods
   of control, to generate contact motion. In Adaptive Hybrid
   Force/Position Control, the desired motion is split into two parts where
   the force is controlled in the constrained direction in an adaptive
   manner while the position control takes place in the free space. The
   environment parameters are identified on-line to increase the dynamic
   performance of the force control scheme.
   The simulation results are presented and the comparisons with the
   existing techniques are made. The comparison of the simulation results
   of this research with those from a non-adaptive hybrid scheme showed
   that the instability problems which occur as a result of contact due to
   a stiff environment can be eliminated with this adaptive scheme.
   Similarly, the sluggish performance can be improved by this adaptive
   scheme for the case of a contact motion with a compliant surface.
   Several experiments using the Harmony (real-time, multi-tasking,
   multi-processing) operating system developed by the National Research
   Council, a PUMA 560 robot and the Instrumented Remote Centre Compliance
   (IRCC) sensor have been performed and the experimental results are
   recorded.(1,2)}},

Abstract = {{Free-product recovery system designs for light hydrocarbon recovery were
   investigated to evaluate the effects of multiple-stage pumping, delayed
   startup, and uncertainty of key residual oil saturation input data using
   a vertically integrated three-phase flow model, ARMOS. The results
   obtained from a single well recovery system subjected to a given well
   location and uniform soil properties suggested that multiple-stage water
   pumping can enhance the recovery and provide optimal design conditions
   if cost and recovery oil volume are the targets. However, if containment
   of the spill area with simultaneous recovery is the target, then
   single-stage pumping still provides the optimal design. Delayed startup
   of the operation from the initial site characterization can cause
   substantial plume movement during the lag period making predictions made
   with zero time lag invalid. Allowance should be made in the design to
   account for this time delay. Uncertainty of maximum residual oil
   saturations in both saturated and unsaturated zones may cause
   considerable differences in predicted results. Careful attention should
   be paid to obtaining these data for accurate remediation design.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive oxygen species, especially iron-catalyzed hydroxyl radicals (.
   OH), are implicated in the pathogenesis of asbestos-induced pulmonary
   toxicity. We previously demonstrated that phytic acid, an iron chelator,
   reduces amosite asbestos-induced . OH generation, DNA strand break
   formation, and injury to cultured pulmonary epithelial cells (268
   {[}1995, Am. J. Physiol. (Lung Cell. Mel. Physiol.) 12: L471-480]). To
   determine whether phytic acid diminishes pulmonary inflammation and
   fibrosis in rats after a single intratracheal (it) instillation of
   amosite asbestos, Sprague-Dawley rats were given either saline (1 mi),
   amosite asbestos (5 mg; 1 mi saline), or amosite treated with phytic
   acid (500 mu M) for 24 hr and then instilled. At various times after
   asbestos exposure, the rats were euthanized and the lungs were lavaged
   and examined histologically. A fibrosis score was determined from
   trichrome-stained specimens. As compared to controls, asbestos elicited
   a significant pulmonary inflammatory response, as evidenced by an
   increase (similar to 2-fold) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell counts
   at 1 wk and the percentage of BAL neutrophils (PMNs) and giant cells at
   2 wk (0.1 vs 6.5\% and 1.3 vs 6.1\%, respectively; p < 0.05). Asbestos
   significantly increased the fibrosis score at 2 wk (0 + 0 vs 5 rf: 1;p <
   0.05). The inflammatory and fibrotic changes were, as expected, observed
   in the respiratory bronchioles and terminal alveolar duct bifurcations.
   The increased percentage of BAL PMNs and giant cells persisted at 4 wk,
   as did the fibrotic changes. Compared to asbestos alone, phytic
   acid-treated asbestos elicited significantly less BAL PMNs (6.5 vs
   1.0\%; p < 0.05) and giant cells (6.1 vs 0.2\%; p < 0.05) and caused
   significantly less fibrosis (5 vs 0.8; p < 0.05) 2 wk after exposure. We
   conclude that asbestos causes pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in
   rats after it instillation and that phytic acid reduces these effects.
   These data support the role of iron-catalyzed free radicals in causing
   pulmonary toxicity from asbestos in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the performance of the three excimer laser delivery
   systems in correcting myopia.
   Methods: The first generation excimer laser systems produced by Summit,
   VISX and LEI were examined. The first 40 consecutive eyes with six-month
   refractive results were selected from the LEI centre. Forty consecutive
   eyes, matched for age and attempted corrections, were then selected from
   each of the Summit and VISX centres. The postoperative visual results
   were examined retrospectively and compared among the three groups.
   Results: At six-month follow-up, the mean and standard deviation of the
   spherical equivalent retraction were +0.27 (SD, 0.65) dioptre in the
   Summit group, -0.33 (SD, 0.83) dioptre in the VISX group and -0.62 (SD,
   0.89) dioptre in the LEI group (P = 0.0001, ANOVA). Thirty-five eyes
   (88\%) in the Summit group, 33 eyes (83\%) in the VISX group and 28 eyes
   (70\%) in the LEI group achieved corrections within 1 dioptre of
   intended corrections (P = 0.131, chi(2) test). Four eyes (10\%) in the
   Summit group, two eyes (5\%) in the VISX group and one eye (3\%) in the
   LEI group were overcorrected by more than 1 dioptre at six-month
   follow-up. Unaided visual acuity (Snellen equivalent) was 6/12 or better
   in 37 eyes (93\%) in the Summit group, 34 eyes (85\%) in the VISX group
   and 34 eyes (87\%) in the LEI group (data missing in one eye). Loss of
   one or more lines of best corrected visual acuity (Snellen equivalent)
   was found in 6 of 39 eyes (15\%) in the Summit group, 10 of 40 eyes
   (25\%) in the VISX group and 4 of 36 eyes (11\%) in the LEI group (P =
   0.258, chi(2) test). Regression between one and six month follow-up
   differed significantly (P = 0.001, ANOVA) among the groups, with the
   mean of -1.25 (SD, 0.94) dioptres in the Summit group, -0.59 (SD, 1.01)
   dioptre in the VISX group and -0.40 (SD, 0.99) dioptre in the LEI group.
   Conclusions: Statistically comparable results were found in the three
   groups in terms of refraction and visual acuity six months after myopic
   photorefractive keratectomy. No statistical differences were found
   between the groups in terms of significant overcorrection or loss of
   best corrected acuity. The group treated using the Summit system
   demonstrated significantly greater regression than the other groups,
   necessitating larger initial hyperopic shifts.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated mutations of the epithelial (E)-cadherin gene and loss
   of heterozygosity (LOH) at flanking loci using three microsatellite
   markers on the long arm of chromosome 16 in 25 ductal carcinomas of the
   breast. Expression of E-cadherin was also investigated
   immunohistochemically. No mutations were detected in exons 6 through 9
   of the E-cadherin gene. LOH was observed more frequently (42\%) at
   D16S402 (16q-ter) than at D16S421 (16q22.3-q23.1) (17\%), which is
   located near the E-cadherin gene. Expression of E-cadherin was observed
   at the cell borders in 92\% (11/12) of the tumors examined. The absence
   of mutations in the E-cadherin gene and its conserved expression suggest
   that inactivation of E-cadherin does not contribute significantly to the
   invasion or metastatic potential of ductal carcinomas of the breast.
   Furthermore, the high frequency of LOH at 16q-ter suggests the existence
   of another tumor suppressor gene which may play a crucial role in the

Abstract = {{During a period of volatile oil prices and of refining margins that were

   ballpark figure for what the refinery would be worth to a potential

   differ substantially from those of the current owner. An initial attempt
   at conventional economic analysis proved inadequate because of the large
   uncertainties involved. A quick, straightforward analysis using
   probability trees and simple approximations from decision analysis
   identified a reasonable range of values for the refinery, thereby
   providing significant insights to management. This approach has
   potential for a variety of facilities-evaluation problems and for other
   engineering economic-evaluation problems involving substantial

   Blowing ratios up to 0.51\% of the freestream mass how were tested using

   Measurements included wall heat flux and static pressure, as well as
   exit pitot pressure profiles. Shadowgraph photography was: used for flow

   for the highest blowing ratio. On the other hand, large increases in the

Abstract = {{This paper employs multiattribute value assessment and risk analysis to
   evaluate the benefits of four alternatives to improve electrical system
   reliability in British Columbia. A multiattribute value model is
   constructed as a cost-equivalent function, based on value judgments
   provided by a group of senior system planners and two senior vice
   presidents from BC Hydro. Using data drawn from the utility's service
   records and probabilities elicited from the utility's technical
   specialists, a risk analysis is developed to estimate the magnitude and
   duration of outages associated with the various alternatives. The value
   model and probabilities are combined to estimate the expected equivalent
   costs of outages over time, for the four alternatives. The influence of
   this analysis on BC Hydro's transmission system planning is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Information technology (IT) projects can fail for a variety of reasons
   and in some cases can result in considerable financial losses for the
   organizations that undertake them, One pattern of failure that has been
   observed but seldom studied is the runaway project that seems to take on
   a life of its own, Prior research has shown that such projects can
   exhibit characteristics of the phenomenon known as escalating commitment
   to a failing course of action, One explanation of escalation is the
   so-called sunk cost effect which posits that decision-makers are unduly
   influenced by resources that have already been spent and are therefore
   more likely to continue pursuing a previously chosen course of action, A
   competing explanation, labeled the completion effect, holds that
   decision makers escalate their commitment as they draw closer to
   finishing the project.
   In order to understand more about the relative effects of sunk cost and
   project completion information, a role-playing experiment was conducted
   in which business students mere asked to decide whether or not to
   continue funding an IT project given uncertainty regarding the prospects
   for success, Three variables were manipulated in the experiment: the
   level of sunk cost, degree of project completion, and the presence or
   absence of an alternative course of action, Results showed that
   subjects' willingness to continue a project increased with the level of
   sunk cost and the degree of project completion, but that subjects were
   more apt to justify their continuation on the basis of sunk cost. As
   theory would predict, the presence of an alternative course of action
   had a moderating effect on the escalation that was observed.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a Canadian study have shown that a set of 12 (I)ADL items
   did not meet the criteria of Guttman's scalogram program, questioning
   the assumption of hierarchical ordering. In this article, the
   hierarchical structure of (I)ADL items from the Canadian elderly sample
   is retested with another scalogram program, and both the epidemiological
   research and clinical applications of hierarchical scales are discussed.
   For retesting the hierarchical structure, Mokken's Stochastic Scale
   Program was used. When item distributions were not too skewed, the
   existence of one general dimension with two (correlated) subdimensions
   were clearly found. The analyses for scalability showed that, except in
   the case of extremely skewed item distributions, the data set met the
   criteria of Mokken's Stochastic Scale Program, indicating a hierarchical
   structure of the items. The scalability of a set of items is affected by
   the sample studied, the choice of response options for each item, the
   selection and number of items in the scale, and the type of scaling
   procedure. The practical assumptions of hierarchy should be restricted
   to program planning and epidemiological research purposes only. For
   clinical assessment, a finer grading is desirable and all questions on
   an ADL/IADL inventory should be asked for each individual.}},

   temperatures of 1350-1460 degrees C at distances up to 900 km from the

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms of CBF increase
   as induced by hypercapnia. It was achieved in anesthetized rats by
   determining total cerebral blood volume (TCBV), parenchymal blood (CBV),
   plasma (CPV), erythrocyte (CEV) volumes and cerebral hematocrit (CHct)
   as well as CBF at about 40, 60, and 80 mm Hg P(a)co(2). TCBV was
   measured by a noninvasive blood dilution method using
   {[}Tc-99m]pertechnetate. CBV, CPV, and CEV were measured on isolated
   brain by I-125-serum albumin and Cr-51-erythrocytes. CBF was measured by
   both {[}I-131/C-14]iodoantipyrine and Co-57-microsphere extractions. The
   extraparenchymal blood volume (ECBV) was evaluated by subtracting CBV
   from TCBV. Under normocapnia, ECBV was 2.8 times larger than CBV. Under
   moderate hypercapnia, ECBV increased by 44\%, CBV was not modified, and
   CBF increased by 52\%. These results demonstrate that the main site of
   vasodilation is located in the extraparenchymal vasculature, which thus
   acts as a vascular reserve. By contrast, under severe hypercapnia, ECBV
   remained unchanged, whereas CBV then increased by 17\%; CBF
   simultaneously showed an additional augmentation of either 52 or 309\%
   when diffusible tracer or microspheres were used. This important
   increase in CBF cannot be explained either by capillary recruitment of
   closed capillaries or by active diameter lengthening of already open
   capillaries. The concomitant and great increase in capillary blood
   velocity was also shown to reduce cerebral flow efficiency, a situation
   consistent with a `'luxury perfusion.''}},

   behavior of stored corn and wheat. These predictions indicate that
   cooling of grain to 0 degrees C during the fall season can keep grain
   moistures under stable conditions for the entire year. It also shows
   that moisture migration occurs in all sizes of bins and it starts

   injected before, but not after, the intoxicated practice under ethanol.
   The effect of D-cycloserine on tolerance when this agonist was
   administered in divided doses before and after test was similar to that
   obtained when D-cycloserine was injected before test. Higher doses of
   D-cycloserine did not produce a further enhancement of rapid tolerance.
   Moreover, when the dose of ethanol on day 1 was large enough to induce
   rapid tolerance per se, D-cycloserine did not further enhance the
   tolerance. The enhancement of tolerance by D-cycloserine was antagonized
   by previous administration of ketamine. The enhancement of ethanol
   tolerance by D-cycloserine and the antagonism of this effect by ketamine
   cannot be attributed to changes in pharmacokinetics of ethanol. Taken
   together, these results confirm the participation of the NMDA receptor
   system in the development of tolerance to ethanol, and reinforce earlier
   findings about the involvement of learning in tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{The urban warming effect is interesting in its own right and is
   important for understanding global warming. The aim of this study is to
   determine how the urban warming effect changes with cloud conditions and
   with wind speed. Studies of the urban warming effect have mostly
   concentrated on the urban-rural difference in daily maximum or minimum
   temperatures. The problem was approached using a new technique. Instead
   of comparing a city, represented by a first-order weather station, with
   the surrounding rural area, represented by data collected by cooperative
   observers; pairs of cities, each with a first-order weather station,
   were studied. One city was large. The other city was small enough to
   have a minimal warming effect and was close enough to the larger city to
   approximately represent the rural area. In this way, hourly
   temperatures, cloud cover, and wind data could be studied rather than
   only the differences between the daily maxima or minima. Results show
   that wind disrupts the normal nocturnal cooling pattern in which the
   smaller city, with lower thermal inertia, cools more quickly than the
   larger city. Clouds also disrupt this pattern, at least to the extent
   that one must be careful about extrapolating either magnitudes or
   patterns of urban-rural temperature difference observed by satellites
   under clear sky conditions to partly cloudy or cloudy conditions.}},

   the Seebeck coefficients (all directions) increases as the oxygen (hole)
   doping levels increase in these overdoped materials. In samples with
   high transition temperatures, a crossover from negative to positive
   appears similar to 15 K above the superconducting transition

Abstract = {{U ntil now, fluorescence characteristics of hydrocarbon fluid inclusions
   have been limited in measurement by the requirement to use bandpass
   filters, dichroic mirrors and neutral density beamsplitters/quartz
   wedges in the optical light path. Measurements have generally been
   restricted to monitoring emission spectra from ca. 400 nm and above
   because the microscope arrangements have used fluorescence `'cubes''
   optimized for specific excitation wavelengths such as the emission lines
   in the mercury spectrum. This has meant that only those lines can be
   used to excite an inclusion and recording of excitation spectra is not
   possible. Well established luminescence techniques of
   excitation-emission and synchronous excitation-emission spectroscopy
   have been expanded into the micro-scale domain by the use of a
   commercially available luminescence spectrometer adapted to a microscope
   via UV-transparent Suprasil(R) fiber optic cables. These techniques were
   developed to pursue non-destructive fingerprinting of individual
   hydrocarbon fluid inclusions by use of the quantitative parameters of
   optimum excitation wavelength and Stokes' shift. The technique of
   fluorescence excitation and emission micro-spectrometry (FLEEMS) has
   been tested on different hydrocarbon fluid inclusion samples from
   reservoir rocks of the Norwegian continental shelf and from a Norwegian
   on-shore hydrocarbon bearing diabase dyke. This new technology readily
   allows unique luminescence information to be extracted for
   discrimination of hydrocarbon fluid inclusions with visually identical
   fluorescence color and emission behavior in the visible region.
   Spectroscopic information in the range of 240-800 MI is accessible with
   a wavelength accuracy better than 0.25 nm and reproducibility better
   than 0.05 nm for both excitation and emission. Signal/noise ratios are
   higher than previously available for microscopic applications. This
   technology can readily be adapted to most brands of microscopes in a
   modular way without any irreversible microscope customization. (C) 1996

Abstract = {{FLP site-specific recombinase was expressed in stably transformed
   tobacco and Arabidopsis. FLP-expressing tobacco lines were crossed with
   other transformed tobacco lines that contained a stably integrated FLP
   recognition target construct(s). The target construct consisted of two
   directly-oriented FLP recognition targets (FRTs), flanking a hygromycin
   resistance cassette located between a GUS coding region and an upstream
   35S CaMV promoter. Excision of the hygromycin resistance cassette by
   FLP-mediated recombination between FRTs brings the GUS coding region
   under the transcriptional control of the CaMV 35S promoter. In the
   absence of FLP-mediated recombination, the GUS gene is transcriptionally
   silent. GUS activity was observed in the progeny of all crosses made
   between FLP recombinase-expressing and target-containing tobacco lines,
   but not in the selfs of parents. The predicted recombination product
   remaining after excision was confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis. In
   Arabidopsis, inducible expression of FLP recombinase was achieved from
   the soybean Gmhsp 17.6L heat-shock promoter. Heat-shock induction of FLP
   expression in plants containing the target construct led to activation
   of constitutive GUS expression in a subset of cells, whose progeny,
   therefore, were GUS-positive. A variety of clonal sectors were produced
   in plants derived from seed that was heat-shocked during germination.
   The ability to control the timing of GUS activation was demonstrated by
   heat-shock of unopened flower heads which produced large sectors. It was
   concluded that heat-shock-induced expression of FLP recombinase provides
   a readily controllable method for generating marked clonal sectors in
   Arabidopsis, the size and distribution of which reflects the timing of
   applied heat-shock.}},

   experimentally. Results of these studies indicate that stiffness data
   for joints 1, 2 and 3 are similar between PUMA 560 manipulators.
   Nonlinear relationships between end effector load, end effector
   displacement and joint configuration are explained. Because mass and
   inertia data has already been determined, complete dynamic models of the
   PUMA 560 manipulator which include joint compliance data, are now
   possible. Using linearized equilibrium equations, static, compliant,
   configuration dependent joint deflections are determined and compared

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional superconducting arrays with combined direct and
   alternating applied currents are studied both analytically and
   numerically. In particular, we investigate in detail current-voltage
   characteristics of a square array with 1/2 flux quantum per plaquette
   and triangular arrays with 1/2 and 1/4 flux quantum per plaquette. At
   zero temperature reduced equations of motion are obtained through the
   use of the translational symmetry present in the systems. The reduced
   equations lead to a series of subharmonic steps in addition to the
   standard integer and fractional giant Shapiro steps, producing devil's
   staircase structure, This devil's staircase structure reflects the
   existence of dynamically generated states in addition to the states
   originating from degenerate ground states in equilibrium. Widths of the
   subharmonic steps as functions of the amplitudes of alternating currents
   display Bessel-function-type behavior. We also present results of
   extensive numerical simulations, which indeed reveal the subharmonic
   steps together with their stability against small thermal fluctuations.
   Implications for topological invariance are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate reaching towards a visual target is initially disturbed when
   the visual field is displaced by prisms, but recovers with successive
   trials. To determine how the improvement depends on the visual error
   signals associated with the motor output, the time course of prism
   adaptation was studied with delayed visual information on the error.
   Subjects were trained to reach rapidly at a target on a tangent screen.
   Vision was always blocked during the movement, and allowed again only
   after the index finger touched the screen. One experiment consisted of
   three sets of 30 trials. In the first set, the subject wore no prisms
   and vision was allowed without delay, In the second, the visual field
   was displaced by prisms, and vision was available only after a delay
   period of 0-10,000 msec while the subjects maintained their final
   pointing position. Initially, the subject misreached the target by about
   the amount of visual displacement (60 mm), Errors decreased with trials
   by an amount proportional to the error in the preceding trial. The rate
   of decrease of error was generally largest when the delay was 0 msec,
   became significantly smaller when the delay was 50 msec, and showed only
   gradual change with longer delays. In the third set, the subject wore no
   prisms and vision was allowed without delay, Initial misreaching in the
   direction opposite to the visual displacement, reflecting the amount of
   adaptation in the second set, was generally largest with no delay
   (median of 46 mm) and significantly smaller with 50 msec and longer
   delays (17-33 mm). These results indicate that the rate and amount of
   prism adaptation depends critically on the availability of visual
   information within 50 msec of the completion of the movement.}},

   the ratios of alpha-Toc stereoisomers in lymph of the all-rac-alpha-Toc
   group were the same as the administered alpha-Toc stereoisomers, and
   2R-isomers occupied approximately 50\% of absorbed alpha-Toc. The uptake
   of alpha-Toc stereoisomers also was measured using Caco-2 cells cultured
   on filter membranes. The concentration of RRR-alpha-Toc in Caco-2 cells

Abstract = {{There is increasing epidemiologic interest in the role drinking water
   disinfection byproducts (DBPs) may play in adverse reproductive outcomes
   such as inability to conceive, spontaneous abortion, and low birth
   weight, Although dozens of DBPs already have been identified, only a few
   studies have attempted to determine whether DBPs alter male reproductive
   parameters such as testicular and epididymal histology, testicular and
   epididymal sperm numbers, and epididymal sperm morphology and motility
   in laboratory animals, In these studies, alterations in epididymal sperm
   motility seemed to be predictive of more generalized toxicity of the
   male reproductive system, Because there is a need to prioritize DBPs for
   thorough reproductive and developmental toxicity testing, preliminary
   screening for the potential of DBPs to alter reproductive function seems
   warranted, Here, we elected to examine only cauda epididymal sperm
   motion parameters and testicular and epididymal histopathology, The
   effects of exposure to two commonly occurring DBPs, bromodichloromethane
   (BDCM) and chloral hydrate (CH), via drinking water were evaluated in
   F344 rats at an interim (52 week) necropsy during cancer bioassay
   studies, Exposure to 22 and 39 mg/kg BDCM and 55 and 188 mg/kg CH did
   not produce any systemic toxicity, Histopathologic evaluation revealed
   no gross lesions in the reproductive organs, and no tumors were detected
   in any tissues, In contrast, exposure to 39 mg/kg BDCM significantly
   decreased the mean straight-line, average path, and curvilinear
   velocities of sperm recovered from the cauda epididymidis. This BDCM
   exposure shifted the average path velocity distribution to a lower modal
   velocity range, Exposure to 188 mg/kg CH significantly decreased both
   the percentage of motile and progressively motile sperm, This CH
   exposure shifted the straight-line velocity distribution to a lower
   modal velocity range, These are the first reproductive toxicity data
   from exposure to BDCM and CH, The observed effects on sperm motion
   occurred in the absence of carcinogenesis, Because the effects of BDCM
   on sperm motility occurred at a lower exposure than that of other DBPs
   that compromise sperm motility, a thorough reproductive evaluation now
   is underway.}},

Abstract = {{D-Amino acid oxidase (DAO), which catalyzes oxidative deamination of
   D-amino acids, is known to be highly expressed in the kidney. This study
   was designed to examine the localization of DAO mRNA in the mouse kidney
   using in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISH). For comparison, ISH
   for mRNA of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which is also highly
   expressed in the mouse kidney, was simultaneously performed. Adult, male
   mice which received 1 mg of testosterone propionate or vehicle
   injection, were sacrificed 14 h after injection and their kidneys were
   removed and processed for ISH. Hybridization signals for both mRNAs were
   exclusively located over the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule in
   the vehicle-treated animals. Signals for the DAO mRNA were observed at
   nearly the same hybridization intensity throughout the proximal tubule,
   whereas hybridization signals for the ODC mRNA were observed exclusively
   in the pars convoluta. Following testosterone treatment, ODC mRNA in the
   pars convoluta was expressed with a stronger intensity than that in the
   vehicle-injected animals. ODC mRNA was also expressed in the pars recta
   with a weaker intensity than in the pars convoluta. On the other hand,
   DAO mRNA expression was little affected by testosterone treatment. These
   results indicate that, although both genes are possibly expressed in the
   same cells, the expression of these genes is regulated by different
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Perfusion cultures of human bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC)
   provide a unique in vitro model of hematopoiesis, supporting growth of
   both accessory and hematopoietic elements. In this study, bioreactors
   were used to analyze the consumption and production of growth factors
   (GFs) in relation to each other and to the cells produced. The
   exogenously added GFs interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage
   colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), and
   erythropoietin (Epo) each exhibited different, but reproducible,
   consumption kinetics. Epo and IL-3 were consumed slowly for the first
   5-7 days, and then the consumption rate of both increased. Epo
   consumption reached a plateau by day 10, whereas IL-3 consumption
   continued to increase. Consumption of SCF was similar to that of Epo,
   but began 2-3 days earlier. GM-CSF was consumed throughout the culture
   period in an accelerating manner. Consumption of SCF and Epo were
   related, because omission of Epo from the growth medium reduced SCF
   consumption by 53\% and omission of SCF reduced Epo consumption by 82\%.
   A reproducible relationship between cumulative GF consumption and total
   cell production was observed. Epo was most potent, with 5900 molecules
   consumed per cell produced, whereas 69,400 molecules of SCF were
   consumed per cell generated. More specifically, Epo consumption was
   correlated (r = 0.92 and 0.96) with the number of glycophorin A-positive
   (glyA(+)) cells produced, and the rate of Epo consumption varied with
   the progression of cells through the erythroid lineage. Consequently,
   measurement of GF consumption rates may be useful for quantifying the
   types of cells present in a culture. Endogenous GF production was also
   examined. G-CSF and MIP-1 alpha were present at high levels during the
   first 4 days but then declined rapidly. LIF first appeared in the second
   week and steadily increased thereafter. Omission of SCF from the medium
   allowed the detection of endogenous SCF production, and the kinetics was
   similar to that of LIF. IL-6 production was biphasic, with a peak and
   decline in week 1 and an increase during week 2. TGF-P was below the
   level of detection in these cultures. The results sug gest that
   perfusion supports accessory and hematopoietic elements which interact
   and therefore represent a partially functional tissue ex vivo. This
   system provides a useful model for studying relationships within GF
   networks and for elucidating the conditions that result in primitive
   cell expansion ex vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Background Excellent results regarding mortality are well recognized in
   the long-term period after intracardiac repair of tetralogy of Fallot.
   However, it is still unclear how postoperative sequelae affect cardiac
   performance during exercise.
   Methods and Results Twenty-nine patients with tetralogy of Fallot were
   studied 16+/-2 years after intracardiac repair by use of radionuclide
   first-pass ventriculography with an ultra-high-sensitive gamma camera at
   rest and at peak exercise on a semi-upright bicycle ergometer. The
   results were compared with those from 10 age- and sex-matched control
   subjects. Left and right ventricular ejection fraction and absolute
   ventricular volume were measured at rest and peak exercise. Regional
   right ventricular wall motion and diastolic function of the left
   ventricle were also assessed. Cardiac output of tetralogy was normally
   preserved both at rest and during exercise. Nevertheless, the
   incremental response of left ventricular ejection fraction during
   exercise was depressed in the patients. Left ventricular ejection
   fraction during exercise was inversely correlated with the right
   ventricular end-diastolic volume and the severity of pulmonary
   regurgitation. Regional wall motion at the right ventricular outflow
   tract was not decreased in the patients. Left ventricular diastolic
   function was not impaired in the patients compared with control
   subjects.
   Conclusions Latent left ventricular dysfunction during exercise is
   related to an enlarged right ventricle due to pulmonary regurgitation
   after intracardiac repair of tetralogy. Careful follow-up is required in
   patients having significant pulmonary regurgitation.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the natural history of brain cavernous malformations, the
   authors entered patients referred to their center into a prospective
   registry between 1987 and 1993. All patients underwent magnetic
   resonance imaging, which showed the typical appearance of this lesion,
   and conservative management was recommended in all. Patients or their
   referring physicians were contacted for follow-up data. The purpose of
   the study was to define the rate of symptomatic hemorrhage and to
   determine the outcome in those patients who had suffered seizures.
   Follow-up data were available for 122 patients with a mean age at entry
   of 37 years (range 4-82 years). The malformation was located in the
   brainstem in 43 cases (35\%), the basal ganglia/thalamus in 20 (17\%),
   and a hemispheric area in 59 (48\%). Fifty percent of patients had never
   had a symptomatic hemorrhage, 41\% had one bleed, 7\% had two, and 2\%
   had three. Seizures were reported in 23\% of patients and headaches in
   15\%. Lesions were solitary in 80\% of patients and multiple in 20\%.
   The retrospective annual hemorrhage rate (61 bleeds/4550.6 patient-years
   of life) was 1.3\%.
   The mean prospective follow-up period was 34 months. There were nine
   bleeds during this time, six with new neurological deficits. in patients
   without a prior bleed, the prospective annual rate of hemorrhage was
   0.6\%. In contrast, patients with prior hemorrhage had an annual bleed
   rate of 4.5\% (p = 0.028). Patient sex (p = 0.97) or the presence of
   seizures (p = 0.11), headaches (p = 0.06), or solitary versus multiple
   lesions (p = 0.15) were not significant predictors of later hemorrhage.
   There was no difference in the rate of bleeds between brain locations.
   Four patients with seizures became seizure free and four patients
   without seizures later developed seizures; only one patient developed
   intractable seizures. Fourteen patients (11\%) underwent surgery (two
   after hemorrhage, five with seizures, and seven with progressive
   deficits), and five had radiosurgery. No patient died in the follow-up
   period. This study indicates that conservative versus operative
   management strategies may need to be redefined, especially in patients
   who present with hemorrhage and who appear to have a significantly
   increased risk of subsequent rehemorrhage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new analytical method for estimating compaction
   quality, based on the entropy, Maximization of the entropy of the
   signature results in an increase of compaction quality. The paper
   studies the influence of the architecture of a compactor on the entropy
   growth, This approach is suitable for nonlinear compactors, widely known
   linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) and the counting compactors, as
   well, Useful theorems to determine entropy growth during the test have
   been given and proven, Furthermore, the class of nonlinear compactors
   based on shift registers named cyclic feedback shift registers (CFSRs),
   which guarantee the maximal entropy growth and the aliasing probability
   of 2(-n), is found, It is shown that they are considerably better than
   the simplest linear compactor (feedback shift register) and in many
   cases are quite as good as linear compactors (LFSRs) having primitive
   polynomials, On the opposite side, compactors based on counters are far
   worse than CFSRs. The family of CFSRs is much greater than the already
   explored family of LFSRs and some CFSRs require less overhead.}},

Abstract = {{We performed a prospective study to evaluate the imaging potential of
   thallium-201 as compared with other imaging modalities in
   differentiating residual/recurrent tumors from post-therapy changes in
   patients with musculoskeletal sarcomas. Tl-201 scans, magnetic resonance
   imaging (17), X-ray computed tomography (6) or contrast angiography (6)
   studies in 29 patients previously treated for musculoskeletal sarcomas
   were correlated with either histopathologic findings (26 patients) or
   2-year clinical follow-up (three patients). All imaging studies were
   acquired within 2 weeks. Ratios of Tl-201 tumor uptake to the
   contralateral (28 patients) or adjacent region of interest were
   calculated. When qualitative interpretation was in doubt, only those
   cases with a ratio of 1.5 or more were considered suggestive of re
   current or residual viable tumor tissue. Residual or recurrent tumor
   tissue was verified in 21 patients by biopsy, All had true-positive
   Tl-201 scans while the other imaging modalities were true-positive in 20
   and equivocal in one. In eight patients, there was no evidence of viable
   tumor tissue as proven by biopsy in five and long-term clinical
   follow-up in three. Tl-201 scan was false-positive (ratio 1.5) in one
   patient and true-negative in seven while the other imaging modalities
   had four false-positives. The average Tl-201 ratios were 3.8+/-1.1 in
   the true-positive cases and 1.3+/-0.3 in the true-negative cases, The
   percentage sensitivities, specificities, and accuracy for Tl-201 were
   100\%, 87.5\%, and 96.5\% versus 95\%, 50\%, and 82.7\% respectively for
   other imaging modalities, These results indicate that Tl-201
   scintigraphy is more accurate than other imaging modalities in
   differentiating residual/recurrent musculoskeletal sarcomas from
   post-therapy changes.}},

   the activity in the serum of patients with various cancers. Evidence is
   presented that this protein forms a complex with serum ribonucleases
   which results in the inactivation of enzymes and protection of RNA from
   acid precipitation. The serum protective activity against acid
   precipitation of poly (U) was measured in 37 patients with
   gastrointestinal cancer and 79 with gynecological cancer, along with 15
   male subjects with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal system,
   15 with uterine leiomyoma, 19 healthy men and 30 healthy women from the
   hospital personnel. The mean values found in patients with various
   tumors were about three times higher than those found in healthy
   individuals, while no significant overlapping of values was observed
   between cancer patients and controls. On the other hand, the activity
   was not increased in patients with nonmalignant diseases of

   odours from females of T. urticae were studied in the laboratory using a

   response to odours from infested plants or leaves than to the uninfested
   ones. This preference was maintained even after the colonies of the
   spider mite were removed from the surface of the infested leaves and the
   leaves were rinsed with water. However, A. andersoni females did not
   show a preference for possible odours released by adult females of T.
   urticae or pin-pricked uninfested leaves. These results suggest that the

Abstract = {{Radial increment along the stems and the root systems of 20 balsam fir
   (Abies balsamea Mill.) was analysed as an indicator of resource
   allocation after a spruce budworm outbreak. The trees were located in a
   natural forest, 130 km north of Lake Saint Jean (Quebec) in the boreal
   forest zone. The dynamics of the forest were determined by fire and
   insect outbreaks. The 20 analysed firs showed clear signs of the last
   two spruce budworm outbreaks. Tree-ring width was reduced one year
   earlier in the crown region than at the stem base, and was more variable
   in the root system. Many tree-rings were missing at the stem base
   section and especially in the root system (2099 missing rings). Recovery
   started with a time delay of one year from the upper part of the crown
   and continued downwards in the stem. The roots and the crown recovered
   within a longer period.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of age-related changes based on the thiobarbituric acid (TEA)
   test appear to be inconsistent and contradictory. In our work, real
   basal (hypothetical, corrected to the zero concentration of atmospheric
   oxygen), basal (atmospheric oxygen-stimulated) and stimulated
   (L-glutamic and hydrochloric acids) levels of TBA-reactive products
   (TBARP) were estimated in the brain (hippocampus-HPC, cortex-COR,
   cerebellum-CRB) from young (3 months) and old (28 months) male and
   female Wistar rats. The values of basal levels of TBARP were different
   in young (HPC > COR > CRB) as well as in old animals (COR > CRB > HPC).
   Thus, the process of aging caused a significant decrease in the HPC (to
   72\%) and no change in the COR and CRB, Levels stimulated by L-glutamic
   acid were significantly decreased (COR,CRB) and unchanged (HPC) in old
   compared to young animals. The real basal levels estimated by regression
   analysis seem to be higher in the brain tissue damaged by aging. We
   discuss the usefulness of the TEA test applied to aged tissue, the
   effect of acidosis, the effectivity of L-glutamic acid to generate free
   radicals and the differences between individual brain areas.}},

Abstract = {{The retention behavior of octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, and its
   glycosylated derivatives containing different numbers of glucose units
   has been studied by reversed phase HPLC. A retention model was developed
   by correlating the logarithm of the retention factor with the
   hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of the analyte. Linear functions could be
   derived for all the separation systems investigated. The slopes of the
   straight lines were a measure of the selectivity of the chromatographic
   system and enabled calculation of increments for the saccharide groups
   in different eluent systems. The highest increment was found using
   trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as ion pairing agent. The model was extended
   to substitution of the same peptide with hydrophobic groups such as
   acetyl and alkyl. Straight lines were again obtained.
   The influence of the different eluent systems upon peak shape and
   retention is also discussed. Owing to the strong peak tailing a dual
   retention mechanism consisting of hydrophobic and silanophilic
   interactions was assumed. It was shown that addition of quaternary
   ammonium compounds to mask the surface silanols of the stationary phase
   reduced both the peak tailing and the retention of the peptides.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the mechanism of androgen-induced thymolysis, the effects

   of estradiol and dexamethasone (DEX) in intact, castrated, and

   the most potent, followed by nortestosterone and T, an order similar to
   their anabolic potency on muscle. As the thymolytic effects of T and
   MENT were not altered by the concomitant administration of an aromatase
   inhibitor or a 5-reductase inhibitor, it was concluded that the effects
   of androgens were not mediated by their conversion to estrogens or 5
   alpha-reduced metabolites. involvement of glucocorticoid receptors in
   androgen action was excluded because mifepristone (an
   antiglucocorticoid) blocked DEX-induced, but not T-or MENT-induced,
   thymus regression. Flutamide, an antiandrogen, significantly blocked the
   thymolytic effect of T and MENT, providing further support for this
   conclusion. This suggested that the thymolytic action of androgens is an
   intrinsic property mediated via androgen receptors (AR). The occurrence
   of AR in the thymus was demonstrated by binding assays and the presence
   of AR messenger RNA (mRNA) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
   reaction. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
   for AR mRNA in the thymus showed 6-fold more AR mRNA in the thymic
   epithelial cells than in the thymocytes. However, epithelial cells
   represent only a small fraction of the thymus. Hence, it is hypothesized
   that the androgens produce their thymolytic effects by stimulating the
   secretion of a factor(s) by the thymic epithelial cells that, in turn,
   causes regression of the thymus.}},

   transforming hybrid suitable for MMIC applications and a new method of

   feasible. Starting from a given number of sections, type of response,
   and impedance transformation ratio and for a specified midband coupling,
   power division ratio, isolation or directivity ripple bandwidth, the set
   of constants needed for the evaluation of the reflection coefficient
   response is first calculated. The latter is used to define a driving
   point impedance of the circuit, synthesize it and obtain the branch line
   immittances with the use of the concept of double length unit elements

Abstract = {{Cyclohexane carboxylate supported relatively rapid growth (doubling
   times 7-8 h) of Rhodopseudomonas palustris under oxic or photosynthetic
   conditions, but did not serve as a substrate for either of the known
   aromatic CoA ligases. A CoA ligase that thioesterifies cyclohexane
   carboxylate was partially purified and did not cross react
   immunologically with the two CoA ligases purified previously from this
   bacterium. Crude extracts of R. palustris cells grown with a range of
   aromatic or alicyclic acids contained a dehydrogenase that reacted with
   cyclohexane carboxyl-CoA or cyclohex-1-ene carboxyl-CoA, using
   2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol or ferricenium ion as electron carrier.
   This activity was not detected in extracts of adipate-, glutamate-, or
   succinate-grown cells. No oxidation or reduction of nonesterified
   cyclohexane carboxylate or cyclohexene carbocylate was detected in
   extracts of cells grown with aromatic or aliphatic substrates, neither
   aerobically nor anaerobically. A constitutively expressed thioesterase
   that hydrolyzed cyclohexane carboxyl-CoA and also some alicyclic and
   aliphatic CoA derivatives was purified and characterized. The enzyme had
   little or no activity on benzoyl-CoA or 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA. The
   presence of a thioesterase that effectively hydrolyzes cyclohexane
   carboxyl-CoA suggests that transient production of cyclohexane
   carboxylate is a physiological response to temporary excess of reductant
   during metabolism of aromatic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{To demonstrate whether L-carnitine treatment could further improve the
   anemia in dialyzed patients under recombinant human erythropoietin
   (r-HuEPO) therapy, leading to a reduction in r-HuEPO requirements,
   L-carnitine (1 g intravenously after every dialysis session) was
   administered for 6 months to a group of 13 patients; the results were
   compared with data from a placebo control group (N = 11), Globular
   osmotic fragility and endogenous EPO secretion were also evaluated.
   L-Carnitine treatment promoted a 38.1\% reduction in r-HuEPO
   requirements in the active group (102.2 +/- 52.6 U/kg/wk v 63.3 +/- 37.8
   U/kg/wk; P < 0.02), with globular osmotic fragility and endogenous EPO
   levels remaining unchanged and thus not accounting for carnitine effect
   on anemia, In the active group, seven patients decreased r-HuEPO needs
   (responders), while six did not (nonresponders), Compared with
   nonresponders, responders showed higher mean values at time 0 for
   r-HuEPO requirements and endogenous plasma EPO levels, although not
   statistically significant, It is concluded that L-carnitine deficiency
   might promote EPO resistance in dialyzed patients, which is corrected by
   L-carnitine supplementation, ultimately reducing r-HuEPO requirements.

Abstract = {{The distances over which magnetohydrodynamic waves will propagate in a
   non-ideal, magnetic, compressible medium, representing the solar corona
   structured by the presence of loops of denser material, are considered.
   The waves are damped by ion viscosity and electron heat conduction in a
   radiating, optically thin atmosphere. Waves which lose their energy of
   propagation in distances of less than our criterion value of 4 x 10(9)
   cm are regarded as candidates for contributing towards coronal heating.
   Alfvenic-type waves only dissipate in this way in weak (less than or
   similar to 15 G) magnetic fields and when they have periods of a few
   seconds (2-10 s). Acoustic-type waves can also be dissipated and we give
   typical values of magnetic field strength, density and temperature for
   which the dissipation could occur. Dissipating acoustic-type waves have
   periods that range from tens to hundreds of seconds (15-225 s).
   Calculations show that reliable measurements of velocity amplitudes will
   be invaluable in deciding whether these dissipating waves can contribute
   to heating the corona. We suggest that the waves that survive
   dissipation may account for some of the observed coronal oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{Previous measurements of mammalian photoreceptor spectral sensitivity
   have been analysed, with particular attention to the long-wavelength
   region. The measurements selected for study come from rod and cone
   systems, and from human, monkey, bovine and squirrel sources, For the
   spectra from photoreceptor electrophysiology and from psychophysical
   sensitivity, the frequency scaling applied by Mansfield (1985, The
   visual system, pp, 89-106, New York: Alan Liss) provides a common shape
   over a range of at least 7 log(10) units of sensitivity, from low
   frequencies (long wavelengths) to frequencies beyond the peak. The same
   curve is applicable to the absorbance spectrum of bovine rhodopsin,
   although the absorbance can only be measured down to about 2 log(10)
   units below the peak, At the longest wavelengths the results exhibit a
   common limiting slope of 70 log(e) units (or 30.4 log(10) units) per
   unit of normalized frequency, A simple equation is presented as a
   generic description for the alpha-band of mammalian photoreceptor
   spectral sensitivity curves, and it seem likely that the equation may be
   equally applicable to retinal(1)-based pigments in other species,
   Despite the lack of a theoretical basis, the equation has the correct
   asymptotic behaviour at long wavelengths, and it provides an accurate
   description of the peak, It also accounts accurately for the
   experimentally observed `'yellowing'' of long-wavelength lights that
   occurs beyond 700 nm.}},

Abstract = {{We analyse the formation of HeI lines in late-type dwarfs by statistical
   equilibrium (or NLTE radiative transfer) computations. Atmospheric
   models for a dK (epsilon Eri) and a dMe (V 1005 Ori = G1 182) stars are
   considered. The validity of the weakly non-uniform approximation for dMe
   stars established in Lanzafame (1994a) for the lower transition region
   of dMe stars implies that streaming particles have virtually no role in
   the formation of the lines. Comparison with observations of the HeI(10
   830 Angstrom) and HeI(5 876 Angstrom) lines in the dMe star, V 1005 Ori,
   indicate that it is possible to reproduce the observed helium lines with
   a simple model compatible with other observational constraints.
   Over-ionisation by coronal EUV radiation is found to play a minor role

Abstract = {{Influenza C/Ann Arbor/1/50-pi (C/ AA-pi) virus causes persistent
   infections in MDCK and Wi38 cells, but sets limited, wild-type like

   dependent on the host environment, we determined the nucleotide sequence
   of the C/AA-pi analogous gene to the basic polymerase 2 (PB2) of
   influenza A virus, which is known to be a determinant for the host
   range. C/AA-pi and the parental wild-type virus (C/AA-wt) have 16
   nucleotides in common that are different to a previously published PB2
   sequence (C/JJ/50). These variations, which are probably due to
   divergent passage histories, are scattered along the sequence and are
   partially found in another published isolate (C/Berlin/1/85). One single
   mutation, however, is unique to the persistent variant. Nucleotide 28
   mutated from T to C which leads to a change of amino acid 3 from Leu to
   Phe, This substitution is stably associated with the persistent
   phenotype throughout multiple passages in different cell lines and eggs
   and cannot be found in any other influenza C viruses.}},

   depletion technique was used to identify the muscle fibers in a motor
   unit (motor unit fibers). The motor unit fibers were subsequently
   characterized according to immunocytochemical, enzyme-histochemical and
   morphometrical properties, and the spatial arrangement was determined
   with the aid of a computer-assisted model. An age-related motor unit
   transformation was observed in both fast- and slow-twitch rat skeletal
   muscles as was a rearrangement of motor unit fibers. The spatial
   redistribution of motor unit fibers, higher innervation ratios, and
   larger motor unit territories in old age indicate an age-related
   denervation-reinnervation process due to loss of alpha-motoneurones.}},

Abstract = {{Theory: Organizational learning is conceived apart from `'inertia'' by
   drawing from the literature on organizations and cognitive psychology.
   Hypotheses: Organizational learning is predicted to be cumulative and
   specific (limited in space and time) rather than noncumulative or
   general (applied to diverse subjects and new tasks). It is also expected
   to reflect important subject and learner characteristics that are
   expressed in two competing models: the first assumes that subject
   difficulty impedes learning and the second assumes that apparent
   inhibitors actually facilitate learning.
   Methods: Correlations are examined among successive estimates of foreign
   military spending, for the same countries and years, published by the
   United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). Learning
   scores, for different nations, are regressed on potential learning
   inhibitors and facilitators that are linked to the two models.
   Results: Learning in ACDA is most convincingly shown to be specific
   (though cumulative and noncumulative). Learning appears to occur with
   moderate challenges and to be determined primarily by learner
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In space-filling 2D cellular structures with trivalent vertices and in
   which each cell is constrained to share at most one side with any cell
   and no side with itself, the maximum fraction of three-sided cells is
   produced by a decoration of vertices of any initial structure by
   three-sided cells. Fractal cellular structures are obtained if the
   latter decoration process is iterated indefinitely. Other methods of
   constructions of fractal structures are also described. The probability
   distribution P(n) of the number n of cell sides and some two-cell
   topological properties of a 2D fractal cellular structure constructed
   from the triangular Sierpinski gasket are investigated. On the whole,
   the repartition of cells in 2D structures with n greater than or equal
   to 3 and P(3) not equal 0 evolve regularly when topological disorder,
   conveniently measured by the variance mu(2) of P(n), increases. The
   strong correlations which exist among cells, in particular in natural
   structures (mu(2) less than or similar to 5), decrease progressively
   when mu(2) increases, a cell repartition close to a random one being
   reached for mu(2) similar to 12. We argue that the structures finally
   evolve to fractal structures (for which mu(2) is infinite) but we have
   not characterized the latter transition.}},

   satellite DNA. A 1.2 kb EcoRI fragment was subcloned from the CX16-2D12
   cosmid and was named 2D12/E2. DNA sequencing revealed that this 1,205 bp
   fragment consisted of approximately five tandemly repeated DNA monomers
   of 220 bp. DNA sequence homology between the monomers of 2D 12/E2 ranged
   from 72.8\% to 78.6\%. Interestingly, DNA sequence analysis of the
   2D12/E2 clone displayed a change in monomer unit orientation between
   nucleotide positions 585-586 from a `'tail-to-head'' arrangement to a
   `'head-to-tail'' configuration. This may reflect the existence of at
   least one inversion within this repetitive DNA array in the centromeric
   region of the human X chromosome. The DNA consensus sequence derived
   from a compilation of these 220 bp monomers had approximately 62\% DNA
   sequence similarity to the previously determined gamma 8 satellite DNA
   consensus sequence. Comparison of the 2D12/E2 and gamma 8 consensus
   sequences revealed a 20 bp DNA sequence that was well conserved in both
   DNA consensus sequences. Slot-blot analysis revealed that this
   repetitive DNA sequence comprises approximately 0.015\% of the human
   genome, similar to that found with gamma 8 satellite DNA. These
   observations suggest that this satellite DNA clone is derived from a
   subfamily of gamma satellite DNA and is thus designated gamma X
   satellite DNA, When genomic DNA from six unrelated males and two
   unrelated females was cut with SstI or HpaI and separated by
   pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, no restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms were observed for either gamma X (2D12/E2) or gamma 8
   (50E4) probes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization localized the 2D12/E2
   clone to the lateral sides of the primary constriction specifically on
   the human X chromosome.}},

Abstract = {{A 55-year-old man, with a history of nephrectomy for renal cell
   carcinoma, was evaluated using radionuclide angiocardiography to exclude
   cardiac shunts as the cause of vascular bruits heard at auscultation. A
   pulmonary time-activity curve derived from the right lung showed a
   pattern typical of a large left-to-right shunt, whereas that from the
   left lung was normal. Increased systemic arterial flow to the lateral
   right chest was noted in early dynamic images. Subsequent studies
   revealed that this flow and the abnormal time-activity curve of the
   right lung were due to systemic arterial supply to metastatic pleural
   cancer, originating from the kidney. the authors conclude that special
   caution should be undertaken in the interpretation of the radionuclide
   angiocardiography for determining left-to-right cardiac shunts,
   especially in those showing a asymmetric pulmonary time-activity curve.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive production of collagen type I is a major contributor to
   hepatic fibrosis, Activated (myofibroblastic), but not quiescent,
   hepatic stellate cells (lipocytes) have a high level of collagen type I
   and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. Therefore, stellate cell
   activation is a critical step in hepatic fibrosis, Here we show that
   quiescent stellate cells were activated by the generation of free
   radicals with ascorbate/FeSO4 and by malondialdehyde, a product of lipid
   peroxidation, In addition, stellate cell activation by collagen type I
   matrix and TGF alpha was blocked by antioxidants, such as
   d-alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene. Moreover, oxidative
   stress, TGF alpha and collagen type I markedly stimulated stellate cell
   entry into S-phase, NFkB activity and c-myb expression, which were
   prevented by antioxidants. c-myb antisense oligonucleotide blocked the
   activation and proliferation of stellate cells induced by TGF alpha.
   Nuclear extracts from activated, but not from quiescent, stellate cells
   formed a complex with the critical promoter E box of the alpha-smooth
   muscle actin gene, which was disrupted by c-myb and NFkB65 antibodies,
   and competed by c-myb and NFkB cognate DNA. c-Myb expression was also
   stimulated in activated stellate cells in carbon tetrachloride-induced
   hepatic injury and fibrogenesis. This study indicates that oxidative
   stress plays an essential role, through the induction of c-myb and NFkB,
   on stellate cell activation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the nonradial oscillations of neutron stars with the
   superfluid core. We consider a most simplified case for the
   oscillations, ignoring the rotation and electromagnetic fields of the
   neutron stars. The core is assumed to be filled with free neutrons,
   protons, and electrons. All of the neutrons and protons are assumed to
   be in superfluid states and the normal components of the neutron and
   proton fluids are ignored since the transition temperatures are much
   higher than the interior temperature of neutron stars. We employ
   Newtonian hydrodynamic and hydrostatic equations to obtain wave
   solutions and equilibrium models for the neutron stars. The neutron star
   model is divided into the superfluid core and the normal fluid envelope.
   Different wave equations are integrated in the core and in the envelope,
   and a complete solution of the oscillation is obtained by applying jump
   conditions at the boundary between the core and envelope of the star. We
   find a class of modes associated with the superfluid core. We also find
   another class of modes which correspond to the f and p modes of a normal
   fluid star. This class of modes are not sensitive to superfluidity of
   the fluids in the core. The modes associated with the superfluid core
   are found among the f and p modes. Assuming composition gradient of the
   matter in local p equilibrium, we calculate low frequency g modes
   propagating in the interior of the neutron star. We find that
   superfluidity in the core inhibits the propagation of the g modes even
   if there exists the composition gradient.}},

Abstract = {{In density-functional theory (DFT), Perdew, Parr, Levy, and Balduz
   {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 1691 (1982)] have shown that for all the
   electronic systems, the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital
   (HOMO) is equal to the negative of the ionization potential. This
   equality is not recovered within the different approximations of the
   exchange-correlation functional proposed in the literature. The main
   reason is that the exchange correlation potentials of various
   functionals used in DFT calculations decay rapidly to zero whereas they
   should exhibit a Coulombic asymptotic -1/r behavior. In this work we
   propose a gradient-corrected (GC) exchange potential with a correct
   asymptotic -1/r form for large values of r. The energy of the HOMO
   calculated with this potential is improved compared to the local-density
   approximation (LDA) and to the GC functionals widely used in the DFT.
   Our HOMO eigenvalues are compared to the optimized-potential-model
   eigenvalues which are the exact values for the exchange-only potential.
   Using the fact that the LDA satisfies the virial theorem, the exchange
   energy corresponding to this GC exchange potential can be calculated
   under a simple assumption.}},

   as determined by assay-ing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels
   for protein phosphatase activity, The first 25 amino acids of the
   protein's sequence were identified, as well as an internal sequence
   spanning some 20 amino acids. Using this information, we cloned the gene
   for PP1-arch via the application of PCR and conventional cloning
   techniques. The gene for PP1-arch predicted a protein of 293 amino acids
   that bore striking resemblance to the members of the major family of
   protein-serine/threonine phosphatases from members of the domain
   Eucarya, the PP1/2A/2B superfamily, The core of the protein, spanning
   residues 4 to 275, possessed 29 to 31\% identity with these eucaryal
   protein phosphatases, Of the 42 residues found to be absolutely
   conserved among the known eucaryal members of the PP1/2A/2B superfamily,
   33 were present in PP1-arch. If highly conservative substitutions are
   included, this total reached 37, The great degree of sequence
   conservation between molecules from two distinct phylogenetic domains

Abstract = {{In a study to investigate early interactions of Entamoeba histolytica
   with epithelial cell monolayers, we found that a monoclonal antibody
   (MAB), CD6, against an ameba surface antigen recognized the lateral
   surface of epithelial cells after coculture with trophozoites. Display
   of the CD6 antigen on the epithelial cells necessitated contact with
   active trophozoites. It was found neither at 4 degrees C, nor with
   prefixed trophozoites, nor with trophozoite-conditioned media, nor when
   a filter prevented direct contact, Monolayers exposed to amebic
   sonicates or detergent lysates showed random immunostaining, Access to
   the antigenic site was Limited, as immunostaining occurred predominantly
   with subconfluent monolayers, CD6 epithelial cell binding was first
   observed after 5 min of coculture; trophozoite-mediated target cell
   lysis was not detected until 15 min following coculture, Epithelial cell
   immunostaining occurred with some other ameba-specific antibodies but
   not with MAbs raised against the 170-kDa subunit of the
   galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNAc)-specific lectin, The CD6
   MAb as well as some other ameba-specific antibodies immunoprecipitated
   from trophozoite lysates the same bands as the MAbs against the
   cysteine-rich domain of the 170-kDa subunit of the Gal/GalNAc-specific
   lectin, Why the latter MAbs failed to stain epithelial cells in the
   vicinity of attached trophozoites is presently unknown. We concluded

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic burden of obesity in France.
   DESIGN: A prevalence-based approach identifying the costs incurred
   during a given year (1992) by obese subjects,
   MEASUREMENTS: Direct costs (personal health care, hospital care,
   physician services, drugs) and indirect costs (lost output as a result
   of cessation or reduction of productivity caused by morbidity and
   mortality); economic benefits due to the reduced incidence of hip
   fractures.
   RESULTS: The direct costs of obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 27)
   were 11.89 billion French Francs (FF), which corresponded to about 2\%
   of the expenses of the French care system, Hypertension represented 33\%
   of the total amount and cancer 2.5\% of the direct cost of obesity,
   Indirect costs represented FF 0.6 billion, These are conservative
   estimates as far as all obesity-related diseases and all health care and
   indirect costs were not included due to missing information,
   CONCLUSION: These results were remarkably similar to previous reports on
   the economic costs of obesity in other western countries (USA, Sweden,
   Netherlands, Australia) which concluded that the cost of obesity
   amounted to around 2\% to 5\% of the total cost of health care in
   industrialized societies.}},

Abstract = {{To identify risk factors for incident Lyme disease in California during

   activities of 101 cases of physician-diagnosed erythema migrans
   ascertained via both active and passive surveillance with those of 107
   controls matched on sex, age, and neighborhood. Questions asked by
   telephone pertained to location of home, presence of wildlife around the
   house, hours of outdoor work and outdoor leisure activities, pet
   ownership, precautionary measures to avoid tick bites, tick removal
   methods, and knowledge about Lyme disease. For cases, activities
   pertained to the month prior to the onset of erythema migrans; controls
   were interviewed about the same activities during the same one-month
   period. The observation of deer and lizards around the home and a
   history of exposure to ticks were associated with Lyme disease (deer,
   odds ration (OR) = 2.53, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-5.15;
   lizards, OR = 2.14, 95\% CI 1.14-4.04). However, the only activity
   associated with Lyme disease was the use for more than 5 hours per week
   of wide maintained trails (OR = 11.33, 95\% CI 1.33-123.5); this
   association occurred only in persons with other outdoor leisure
   activities. No other behaviors or activities were identified as risk
   factors for acquisition of Lyme disease in California.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to explore whether neuronal injury
   incurred as a result of brief periods of ischemia is aggravated by
   preischemic hyperglycemia. Anesthetized rats were subjected to 2.5 min
   of ischemia, and allowed 7 days of recirculation for histopathological
   evaluation of CA1 hippocampus damage. Normo- and hyperglycemic animals
   had plasma glucose concentrations of 5 - 7 and, 18 - 20 mM,
   respectively. DC potentials shifts and extracellular calcium
   concentration (Ca-e(2+)) were measured with microelectrodes. Both normo-
   and hyperglycemic animals had an average of 100 - 150 necrotic CA1
   neurons (about 10 - 15 \% of control), with no difference between the
   groups. However, whereas cells in normoglycemic animals showed a DC
   potential shift of about 3 min duration, with uptake of virtually all
   extracellular calcium, cells in hyperglycemic ones did not depolarise,
   nor was there a decrease in Ca-e(2+). It is concluded that neither
   membrane depolarisation nor cellular uptake of calcium is required to
   trigger ischemic cell death.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm is developed for identifying bus clusters called control
   areas that have strong local controllability and observability property
   for measurements and controls at the buses or on generators within the
   control area. Two types of control areas are identified; one that is
   based on weak boundaries of the reactive power voltage jacobian and is
   called voltage control area; the other is based on the jacobian of both
   real and reactive power balance equations with respect to voltage and
   angle at network buses. The two control areas are identical under light
   load conditions, but are different as the system approaches voltage
   collapse or poorly damped low frequency oscillations. The understanding
   of strong controllability and observability in terms of real power angle
   dynamics and reactive power voltage dynamics (voltage control areas) and
   the strong controllability and observability of voltage and angle
   dynamics (control areas) helps understanding of voltage instability and
   inter-area oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{It has long been recognized that Ni-Ti shape memory alloys (SMAs) behave
   pseudoelastically above the austenite finish temperature (A(f)) with a
   nearly perfectly plastic character during the initial cycles of
   transformation. Under conditions of cyclic loading with a maximum strain
   epsilon(max), the critical stress to initiate stress-induced martensitic
   (SIM) transformation decreases, the strain-hardening rate increases,
   residual strain accumulates and the hysteresis energy progressively
   decreases over many cycles of loading. Hence the hysteresis energy
   available for dissipation gradually decreases during cycling. Recent
   work (Miyazaki et al., 1981, 1986; Contardo and Guenin, 1990; Filip and
   Mazanec, 1994) has shown that dislocations are generated in the alloy
   during the phase transformation to accommodate formation of SIM, giving
   rise to the change of hysteresis behavior of the SMA. Upon loading the
   SMA to a strain level higher than epsilon(max), the alloy behaves almost
   identical to the `'virgin material''. Likewise, it has been shown (Huo
   and Muller 1993) that the stress at which either the forward or reverse
   transformation occurs, even in the absence of significant matrix
   dislocation effects, depends upon the strain level (transformation
   level) prior to the last unloading event. This behavior is attributed to
   the distribution and configuration of austenite-martensite interfaces
   which evolve during the transformation and requires additional internal
   state variable(s) beyond the mass fraction of martensite for
   description. These path dependent mechanisms are expected to invalidate
   current internal state variable models which assume that the free energy
   depends only on strain, temperature and martensite mass fraction. In
   this paper, some modelling features are discussed to address the effects
   of dislocation arrays generated in the parent phase as well as the
   distribution of transformation product/interfaces. Several uniaxial
   experiments are reported on Ni-Ti to highlight the path dependence of
   the cyclic deformation behavior and progressive decrease of dissipated
   energy. Implications for multiaxial loading behavior are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose Hemodilution lowers the total circulatory red
   cell mass and blood viscosity and thereby may alter the time of passage
   of red cells and plasma through cerebral microvessels. This study was
   designed to clarify this question
   Methods Adult Wistar-Kyoto rats, aged approximately 32 weeks, were
   divided into hemodilution and control groups. Local cerebral blood flow
   and microvascular red cell and plasma volumes in 14 brain structures
   were measured with the use of {[}C-14]iodoantipyrine, Fe-55-labeled red
   cells, and {[}C-14]inulin, respectively.
   Results In the control group, the hematocrit in cerebral microvessels
   ranged from 0.29 to 0.45 with a mean of 0.36, which was 71\% of the
   systemic hematocrit (0.51). The mean transit times of blood, red cells,
   and plasma through microvessels were 0.62 to 1.77 seconds (mean, 0.92
   second), 0.44 to 1.15 seconds (mean, 0.65 second), and 0.78 to 2.5
   seconds (mean, 1.25 seconds), respectively. In the hemodilution group,
   the mean hematocrit in microvessels was 0.28, which was 89\% of the
   systemic hematocrit (0.32). Local cerebral blood flow was approximately
   59\% higher (P < .01) than that of the control animals. The rate of
   oxygen delivered to the brain was slightly increased (9\%) after
   hemodilution. Blood volume in cerebral microvessels was similar to that
   of the control group. Mean transit time of blood was 0.62 second (68\%
   of the control), transit time of red cells was 0.53 second (85\% of the
   control), and transit time of plasma was 0.67 second (54\% of the
   control).
   Conclusions These findings indicate that isovolemic hemodilution
   accelerates the plasma (not red cell) flow velocity in cerebral
   microvessels.}},

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that breast surgery may induce prolactin (PRL)
   increase. Because of the potential stimulatory role of PRL on breast
   cancer cells, its postoperative increase may influence the prognosis of
   breast cancer patients. This study was performed to evaluate the
   influence of surgery-induced hyperprolactinemia on recurrence rate in
   operable breast cancer. The study included 250 consecutive breast cancer
   patients, clinical stage T1-3 N0-2M0, who were observed for a median
   follow-up of 72 months. Surgery-induced hyperprolactinemia occurred in
   108/250 patients (43 \%). Irrespectively of node involvement, hormonal
   receptor, type of surgery and adjuvant therapies, the relapse rate was
   significantly higher in patients who had no surgery-induced
   hyperprolactinemia than in those with postoperative PRL increase (64/142
   vs. 23/108; p < 0.001). This difference was also significant in relation
   to node status (N0: 22/63 vs. 5/56, p < 0.001; N+: 42/79 vs. 18/52, p <
   0.05). The present study shows that a surgery-induced rise of PRL,
   despite its potential stimulation of cancer cell growth, is
   paradoxically associated with a longer disease-free survival in operable
   breast carcinoma in both patients with or without axillary node
   involvement. Moreover, this study suggests that the prognosis of
   node-negative patients who did not show postoperative hyperprolactinemia
   tends to be similar to that of patients with node involvement and
   surgery-induced PRL enhancement. Therefore, the lack of surgery-induced
   hyperprolactinemia would have to be grouped together with the
   unfavorable prognostic factors of breast cancer.}},

   to match hydro-sodium removal with interdialytic load and to verify the

   Module (BM - COT Hospal) allows the automatic determination of plasma
   water conductivity and effective ionic dialysance with no need for blood

   modelling'' (CKM) and the possibility that this may substitute `'sodium
   kinetic modelling'': Moreover, we evaluated the `'in vivo'' relationship
   between ionic dialysance and effective urea clearance. Our results
   demonstrate that: 1) CKM makes it possible to obtain programmed
   end-dialysis plasma wafer conductivity with an error of less than +/-
   0.14 mS/cm, roughly equivalent to a sodium concentration of +/- 1.4
   mEq/L.2). lonic dialysance and effective urea clearance are not
   equivalent but, as the interrelationship between these is known, the BM

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of a cusp ion step, observed by the Defense
   Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F10 spacecraft, between two
   poleward moving events of enhanced ionospheric electron temperature,
   observed by the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar. From the
   ions detected by the satellite, the variation of the reconnection rate
   is computed for assumed distances along the open-closed field line
   separatrix from the satellite to the X line, d(0). Comparison with the
   onset times of the associated ionospheric events allows this distance to
   be estimated, but with an uncertainty due to the determination of the
   low-energy cutoff of the ion velocity distribution function, f(nu).
   Nevertheless, the reconnection site is shown to be on the dayside
   magnetopause, consistent with the reconnection model of the cusp during
   southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Analysis of the time
   series of distribution function at constant energies, f(t(s)), shows
   that the best estimate of the distance d(0) is 14.5 +/- 2 R(E). This is
   consistent with various magnetopause observations of the signatures of
   reconnection for southward IMF. The ion precipitation is used to
   reconstruct the field-parallel part of the Cowley D ion distribution
   function injected into the open low-latitude boundary layer in the
   vicinity of the X line. From this reconstruction, the field-aligned
   component of the magnetosheath flow is found to be only -55 +/- 65 km
   s(-1) near the X line, which means either that the reconnection X line
   is near the stagnation region at the nose of the magnetosphere, or that
   it is closely aligned with the magnetosheath flow streamline which is
   orthogonal to the magnetosheath field, or both. In addition, the sheath
   Alfven speed at the X line is found to be 220 +/- 45 km s(-1), and the

Abstract = {{We have previously described a monoclonal antibody, MAb DC3:H10, which
   recognized an epitope preferentially expressed on the surface of Candida
   albicans germ tubes. In the present study we examined the MAb-reactive
   material further. Immunoblot analysis of the material purified partially
   by Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography reacted with
   antibodies to the C. albicans C3d receptor (CR2). In an ELISA, MAb
   DC3:H10 captured antigen that was recognized by both anti-CR2 and
   anti-mp58 fibrinogen binding mannoprotein polyclonal antibodies. The MAb
   DC3:H10 failed to compete with either of these antisera in an ELISA.
   Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) analysis showed differences in surface
   distribution for the MAb DC3:H10, the CR2, and the mp 58 epitopes. Dual
   labeling IIF experiments showed MAb DC3:H10 binding to be unaffected by
   binding of fibrinogen or anti-mp58 antibody. However, the binding
   patterns of MAb DC3:H10 were modified in the presence of anti-CR2
   antibody, suggesting a complex interaction between these cell wall

Abstract = {{Thirteen adult female rabbits underwent unilateral osteotomy of the

   created; in four animals, osteotomy without angulation was performed.
   After a 12-week survival period, the knee joints were processed for
   histology by staining with hematoxylin and eosin and safranin O.
   Additionally, the chondroitin sulphate epitopes 3-B-3(-) and 7-D-4 were
   evaluated immunohistochemically as markers of osteoarthritis. Changes of
   the articular surface of the tibis were visualized by scanning electron
   microscopy. Light microscopic evaluation by the Mankin et al. scoring
   system revealed mild or moderate damage of the cartilage in the lateral
   compartment of angulated extremities when compared with the control
   side. Immunohistology with the monoclonal 3-B-3 and 7-D-4 antibodies
   showed no increased expression of these epitopes in the lateral
   compartments of the knee. Scanning electron microscopic evaluation of
   the tibial surfaces revealed slight surface damage localized to the
   central, weight-bearing portion of the lateral tibial plateau of
   angulated extremities. Angulation of 30 degrees led to only mild
   degenerative changes of the cartilage. These results indicate that, in
   the short term, cartilage has considerable capacity to withstand the
   effects caused by severe angulation of the limb.}},

   grown by low pressure metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) is
   reported for quaternary (Q) alloys having bandgap wavelengths of
   lambda(g) = 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5 mu m. Films with these different
   Q-compositions were deposited lattice matched to InP at a growth
   temperature of 675 degrees C. Subsequent growth experiments were then
   performed for each Q-composition in which the input gas flow rates were
   kept the same and only the temperature changed in 25 degrees C
   decrements down to 600 degrees C. Photoluminescence (PL) and lattice
   mismatch (LMM) measurements of the resulting films were used to
   determine the effect of growth temperature on film composition. The PL
   data indicate a temperature shift in the PL wavelength of -1.8
   nm/degrees C for the 1.5Q composition, -2.9 nm/degrees C for 1.3Q, and
   -4.3 nm/degrees C for 1.1Q. Negative shifts were also observed in LMM of

   ppm/degrees C for 1.1Q. The Ga/In and P/As ratios of the Q-films were
   measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy and correlated with
   full-wafer maps of the PL wavelength and lattice mismatch to gain
   insight into the processes responsible for wafer nonuniformity in MOVPE.}},

Abstract = {{A 33-week-gestation infant with a massive sacrococcygeal teratoma
   weighed 4,000 g, but the actual weight of the infant was approximately
   1,500 g. With the potential for massive blood loss and impaired lung
   compliance during resection, some type of cardiopulmonary support was
   necessary. Resection was undertaken with the assistance of veno-arterial
   extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and hypothermic:
   hypoperfusion. Immediately after removal of the tumor, which weighed
   2,420 g, the infant was decannulated from ECMO, and the carotid artery
   was primarily reconstructed end-to-end. The amount of intraoperative
   blood loss was 550 mL. There was no noticeable coagulopathy.
   Postoperatively, the child weighed 1,580 g. Follow-up head ultrasound
   results were normal, and the patient has done well. This is the first
   reported case in which ECMO with hypothermic hypoperfusion was used for
   resection of a massive tumor. This experience shows that ECMO is both

Abstract = {{Water rationing is a common, but little studied, technique for managing
   urban water supplies during drought. This paper reviews a wide range of
   approaches for implementing water rationing for urban drought
   management. These rationing approaches are assessed in terms of
   practical and theoretical performance. The paper then examines the
   potential benefits of allowing drought water rations to be transferable
   or marketable. Transferable rights have become a common suggestion for
   allocating scarce resources for a wide range of water-quantity and
   water-quality problems. Although attractive in terms of economic
   theories of resource allocation, transferable drought water rations
   often will be uneconomical for small transactions, due to likely high
   costs of completing transactions. However, transferable drought water
   rations might be useful for allocating scarce water among large
   industrial, commercial, and institutional users and among residential
   users with very different water demands. The equity effects of
   transferable drought rations would vary with the initial allocation of
   water rations. Legal aspects of how transferable rations might be
   implemented for public water-supply systems remain to be explored.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studies of adult antisocial behavior or criminality usually
   find genetic factors to be more important than the family environment,
   whereas studies of delinquency find the family environment to be more
   important. We compared DSM-III-R antisocial personality disorder
   symptoms before vs after the age of 15 years within a sample of twins,
   rather than comparing across studies.
   Methods: We administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version
   III-revised by telephone to 3226 pairs of male twins from the Vietnam
   Era Twin Registry. Biometrical modeling was applied to each symptom of
   antisocial personality disorder and summary measures of juvenile and
   adult symptoms.
   Results: Five juvenile symptoms were significantly heritable, and five
   were significantly influenced by the shared environment. Eight adult
   symptoms were significantly heritable, and one was significantly
   influenced by the shared environment. The shared environment explained
   about six times more variance in juvenile antisocial traits than in
   adult traits. Shared environmental influences on adult antisocial traits
   overlapped entirely with those on juvenile traits. Additive genetic
   factors explained about six times more variance in adult vs juvenile
   traits. The juvenile genetic determinants overlapped completely with
   genetic influences on adult traits. The unique environment (plus
   measurement error) explained the largest proportion of variance in both
   juvenile and adult antisocial traits.
   Conclusions: Characteristics of the shared or family environment that
   promote antisocial behavior during childhood and early adolescence also
   promote later antisocial behavior, but to a much lesser extent. Genetic
   causal factors are much more prominent for adult than for juvenile
   antisocial traits.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of tamoxifen on the growth and
   differentiation of normal human cervical cells and compare those effects
   with those of a synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES). In
   addition, the effects of these compounds on immortalized cervical cells
   and cervical tumor cells were ascertained.
   METHODS: Growth curves were used to determine the effects on cell
   proliferation. The expression of several proteins was used to determine
   the effects on cell differentiation. Binding assays and Western analysis
   were used to determine estrogen receptor levels.
   RESULTS: Both tamoxifen and DES inhibited the proliferation of normal
   cervical cells. This growth inhibition war coincident with an increase
   in cell differentiation as determined by cornified envelope formation.
   The increase in envelope number was not accompanied by an increase in
   involucrin or cornifin, two protein precursors of the envelope. The
   activity of transglutaminase, which enzymatically incorporates precursor
   proteins into the envelope, war not stimulated following treatment.
   Diethylstilbestrol did not alter the growth or differentiation of the
   human papillomavirus 16-immortalized cell line ECE16-1 or any of the
   cervical tumor cell lines. Of all the immortalized or cancer cell lines,
   only Caski cells were growth inhibited by tamoxifen. Normal ectocervical
   epithelial cells and Caski cells expressed the high-affinity 56-kDa
   estrogen receptor, but H-3-estradiol binding was not detected in cell
   extracts from either ME180 or ECE16-1 cells. Nevertheless, extracts from
   ME180 cells contained an immunoreactive band at the appropriate
   molecular weight for the estrogen receptor.
   CONCLUSIONS: There results suggest that tamoxifen and DES act similarly
   in normal cervical cells to promote cervical cell differentiation.
   However, because Caski cell growth was inhibited by tamoxifen and not
   DES, the effects of tamoxifen in there cells may be mediated by
   non-estrogen receptor mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Sinus tachycardia has been reported after radiofrequency catheter
   ablation of supraventricular tachycardia. Frequently, these patients
   require beta-blocking agents for symptomatic control.
   The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the incidence of
   inappropriate sinus tachycardia and heart rate variability after
   ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and accessory
   pathways. Patients undergoing ablation had 24-h ambulatory monitoring
   ECG (Holter) performed before the procedure, on the clay of the
   ablation, and 3 months afterwards. There were 170 patients, mean age 48
   +/- 23 years, 93 were female. A complete study of the 24-h Holter with
   analysis of heart rate variability: SD, rMSSD, pNN50, high and low
   frequency was obtained.
   There was a low prevalence of inappropriate sinus tachycardia after the
   ablation procedure (10 of 170 patients: five with four atrioventricular
   nodal reentry, with posteroseptal accessory pathways and one of the
   latter following ablation of the left accessory pathway). There was no
   modification of time and frequency domain parameters of heart rate
   variability in the remaining patients who underwent radiofrequency
   ablation. Holter monitoring 3 months after ablation showed that
   parameters of heart rate and heart rate variability had normalized in
   patients who had developed inappropriate sinus tachycardia.
   Inappropriate sinus tachycardia may be initiated by both radiofrequency,
   ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and
   radiofrequency ablation of posteroseptal accessory pathways. Specific
   damage to the posteroseptal region is responsible for these changes,
   which usually recover spontaneously after 3 months.}},

Abstract = {{The unique capability of orthogonal wavelets, which have attractive
   time-frequency localization properties as exemplified by the Meyer
   wavelet, is demonstrated in a diagnosis of the interannual variability
   using a 44-year dataset of the sea surface temperature (SST). This
   wavelet analysis is performed in conjunction with an empirical
   orthogonal function analysis and a Fourier analysis to illustrate their
   complementary capability. The focus of this article is on the equatorial
   Pacific SST, which is known to have far-reaching impacts on short-term
   climate variability. The Meyer spectrum brings to light intriguing
   episodic characteristics of three separate sequences of El Nino
   (abnormally warm) and La Nina (abnormally cold) events during the past
   42 years. It quantifies the relative contributions to the variability
   associated with different frequency ranges at different times. Through a
   wavelet cross-spectral analysis with the SST at an equatorial location
   and at a midlatitude location in the Pacific Ocean, the planetary
   character of the SST field associated with such events is also
   illustrated.}},

   features of 12 patients with histologically confirmed disease were
   analysed. Patients were mostly young males with median age of 24.6
   years. Two thirds belonged to poor socioeconomic class. Main presenting
   features were chronic diarrhoea and weight loss. Eleven patients had
   radiologic evidence of malabsorption syndrome. Endoscopic findings of
   mucosal thickening, edema, and flattened villi were present in the
   majority. Patients had both secretory and non-secretory types of
   disease. Six patients presented with stage A disease. Four responded to
   antibiotics or steroids, although mucosal abnormalities persisted in
   three. Two stage A patients evolved into stage C disease, one was lost
   to follow-up, the other is alive with disease. Three patients presented
   with stage B disease. Two responded completely to chemotherapy, the
   third refused treatment and expired after 16 months. Three patients had
   stage C disease at diagnosis. They received aggressive combination
   chemotherapy and remain in complete remission with a median follow-up of
   2.2 years. This is the first series of patients with IPSID reported from
   Pakistan. Clinicopathological features and therapeutic results are
   consistent with the experience elsewhere. Increased awareness may result
   in early diagnosis and better management. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Cationic polymerization of various monomers in the presence of onium
   salts were induced by h nu, EB and gamma irradiation. The mechanism for
   the initiation process involves the photoreduction of onium salts by a
   direct photolysis or by an indirect redox reaction from organic free
   radicals or solvated electrons depending on the reduction potentials of
   the onium salts. For EB and gamma irradiation only solvated electrons
   were capable of reducing the onium salts with reduction potentials lower
   than approximately -100 kJ/mol. An enhanced production of protons and/or
   carbenium ions takes place if the reduction potentials of the onium
   salts are higher than -60 kJ/mol. This paper will give some indications
   of useful onium structures that fulfill the needs in EB and gamma
   induced cationic polymerization. Typical examples are fragmenting type
   of dialkylphenacyl and cyclic ringopening phenacylic sulfonium salts.
   The influence of typical `'polymer or monomer backbone'' structural
   groups, such as esters and ethers on the proton formation under high
   energy irradiation, was studied by UV spectroscopy at 540 nm. The
   formation of acid was monitored in the presence of various onium salts,
   and alpha-naphtylred was used as an indicator. By comparing aromatic
   versus aliphatic structural group influences on the generation of
   protons and carbenium ions a good correlation was found between
   experimental data and theoretical calculations on nucleophilicity,
   electron charge density distributions and electron scavenging effects by
   the use of simplified Huckel calculations (SHMO).}},

Abstract = {{We present a detailed analysis of the magnetic topology of AR 6233 on
   two consecutive days (August 28 and 29, 1990) and compare the location
   of the magnetic separatrices and separators with off-band H alpha
   observations and other flare manifestations, such as intense nonthermal
   electron precipitation and high coronal pressure sites, for two flares
   that occured on these days. Since for one of the days of our analysis we
   have two magnetograms covering fields of view with different scale
   lengths, we analyzed the dependence of the topology of the region of
   interest on the presence of external magnetic field concentrations. We
   have found that considering these concentrations does not modify the
   location of separatrices in the region. Because transverse magnetograms
   indicate that strong magnetic shear is present along the longitudinal
   inversion line where flare brightenings are located, the observed
   photospheric magnetic field is modeled in an approach in which a
   combination of sources with current-free and non current-free magnetic
   field is used. This model allows us to obtain a better fit between the
   observed and modeled transverse held, then we find a closer relationship
   between separatrices and hare features. The results of a current-free
   and of a linear force-free approach are also shown for comparison.
   As in other flaring regions studied previously, chromospheric flare
   brightenings are found on separatrices. The topological structure
   obtained for these flares is rather complex. We find that the
   connectivity of field lines may change drastically from one edge of a
   ribbon to the other. Electron precipitation and high coronal pressure
   sites, and some photospheric intense currents are also found in the
   immediate vicinity of separatrices. The early kernels of August 28 hare
   are found closer to the separatrices of the nonpotential field, while
   the later are closer to those of the potential field. All these results
   agree with the hypothesis that magnetic energy is stored in
   field-aligned currents and released due to magnetic field reconnection,
   with a noticeable relaxation of the field, either at the separator
   region or on separatrices.}},

Abstract = {{Nondestructive rests are becoming popular in rapidly evaluating the
   properties of construction materials. In this study, the applicability
   of the impact resonance method and the ultrasonic pulse velocity method
   to polyester. polymer (compressive strength of 110 MPa) and polymer
   concrete (compressive strength of 58 MPa) was investigated. The effect
   of specimen shape and size on the dynamic moduli, damping ratio, and
   pulse velocity were studied. The response of cylinders
   (length-to-diameter ratio 2 and 3) and prisms (length-to-width ratio 2.5
   and 4.5) in the three fundamental modes of vibration, namely,
   longitudinal, transverse, and torsional, were investigated. From the
   longitudinal and transverse resonant frequencies, the dynamic Young's
   modulus of elasticity (E(d)) and damping ratio (D) were determined.
   Using the torsional, resonant frequency, the dynamic modulus of rigidity
   (G(d)) and dynamic Poisson's ratio (v(d)) were determined. Using the
   ultrasonic method, the pulse velocity in polymer (P) and polymer
   concrete (PC) was measured at frequencies of 50 and 150 kHz. The dynamic
   modulus of elasticity (E(p)) was also determined from the pulse velocity
   and compared to tile static modulus (E(s)).
   The dynamic modulus of elasticity for PC (E(d)(PC)) agreed well with the
   static modulus (E(s)(PC)) for all the shapes and sizes investigated. The
   average dynamic Poisson's ratio (v(d)(PC)) was 0.22, as compared to the
   static value (v(s)(PC)) of 0.20. The dynamic modulus of rigidity
   (G(d)(PC)) was independent of specimen shape. For polymer, the pulse
   velocity (V-p(P)) was independent of specimen size and testing
   frequency. The average pulse velocities of polymer and PC were 2450 and
   3425 m/s, respectively. The modulus of elasticity (E(p)(PC)) was 10
   percent higher than the static modulus (E(s)(PC)) for PC cylinders. The
   dynamic modulus (E(p)(PC))PC from pulse velocity measurements was as
   sensitive as the static modulus to changes in density and specimen size.
   The average during ratios of polymer and PC were 1.1 and 0.6 percent,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Treatments with psoralens and long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation
   (UVA, 320-400 nm; PUVA) have shown efficacy for virus sterilization of
   platelet concentrates (PC). Our laboratory has employed the psoralen
   derivative 4'-aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (AMT), and we have
   found that platelet integrity is best preserved when rutin, a flavonoid
   that quenches multiple reactive oxygen species, is present during
   AMT/UVA treatment of PC.
   In this report, we examine the effects of different UVA spectra under
   our standard PC treatment conditions (i.e. 50 mu g/mL AMT, 0.35 mM rutin
   and 38 J/cm(2) UVA). Added vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV;greater than
   or equal to 5.5 log(10)) was completely inactivated with the
   simultaneous maintenance of the platelet aggregation response (>90\% of
   control) when a WA Light source with transmission mainly between 360 and
   370 nm (narrow UVA1) was used. In contrast, with a broad-band WA
   (320-400 nm; broad UVA) light source, the aggregation response was
   greatly compromised (<50\% of control) with only a minor increase in the
   rate of VSV kill. With this lamp, platelet function could be improved to
   about 75\% of the control by adding a long-pass filter, which reduced
   the transmission of shorter (less than or equal to 345 nm) WA
   wavelengths (340-400 nm; UVA1). At equivalent levels of virus kill,
   aggregation function was always best preserved when narrow UVA1 was used
   for PUVA treatment. Even in the absence of AMT, and with or without
   rutin present, narrow UVA1 irradiation was better tolerated by platelets
   than was broad WA.
   Our results suggest that for PUVA treatment of PC, the UVA dose range in
   which complete virus kill is obtained with the simultaneous maintenance
   of in vitro platelet function is smallest with broad WA irradiation and
   largest with narrow UVA1. Thus, the virus specificity of PC treatment
   with AMT, WA and quenchers can be further enhanced by the exclusion of
   the shorter UVA wavelength range.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier works on discharges sustained by electromagnetic surface waves
   in absence of a magnetic field have revealed the central role played by
   the power balance per electron. This balance relation stated that,
   provided energy transport is negligible, the power theta(L) lost by the
   electron an the average in collisions with heavy particles is exactly
   compensated under steady-state conditions by the power theta(A) taken by
   the electron on the average from the high frequency (hf) field, their
   common value being the parameter theta. Then, because theta(L) is to a
   first approximation the same in all hf discharges under given discharge
   conditions and power density, a simple discharge model valid for all hf
   plasmas was used. The present article is an extension of this approach
   to hf magnetized plasmas, using surface-wave plasma columns placed in an
   axially directed static magnetic field as a means of investigation. We
   observe that theta decreases monotonously when increasing the magnetic
   field intensity B-o, showing no extremum at or close to the electron
   cyclotron resonance frequency match over the gas pressure range (5-100
   mTorr) investigated. We show that theta is controlled either by
   classical ambipolar diffusion or anomalous diffusion, the actual
   diffusion regime depending on whether the novel parameter B(o)p (p is
   gas pressure) is small or large. Our measured theta values are further
   used to estimate the average electron density in helicon sources given
   the power density, showing fair agreement with the reported values. (C)

   trans-complementation was achieved between the cso determinant with the
   aforementioned deletion mutation and the CfaB gene encoding the
   structural subunit protein (CfaB) of CFA/I fimbriae, resulting in the
   expression of CFA/I fimbriae. The observation that heterologous assembly
   was possible between these two fimbrial systems, together with the
   knowledge that the adhesin of CFA/I fimbriae is the structural subunit,
   was exploited to investigate whether CsoA had adhering properties. A
   deletion mutation in cfaB was created in the CFA/I fimbrial determinant.
   Complementation of this mutation with csoA in trans resulted in
   expression of the CsoA antigen on the bacterial cell surface and
   restoration of bacterial adherence. As no minor subunits act as the
   adhesin in CFA/I fimbriae, adhesion was mediated by CsoA. Nucleotide
   sequencing of the DNA region downstream from csoA confirmed the absence
   of genes encoding minor subunits which might act as the adhesin. Two
   open reading frames were revealed which encoded proteins sharing
   considerable homology with proteins encoded by corresponding ORFs in the
   CFA/I fimbrial operon. These proteins underlie the functional
   similarities between the CS1 and CFA/I fimbrial systems, allowing
   heterologous expression of their respective subunits.}},

Abstract = {{Full-length, truncated, and mature forms of the CryIA(b) insecticidal
   crystal protein gene of Bacillus thuringiensis were engineered into the
   p10 locus of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV).
   A signal sequence of Heliothis virescens juvenile hormone esterase was
   introduced at the N-terminus of these constructs to induce secretion.
   All recombinants, except those containing the mature toxin, produced
   high levels of CryIA(b) ICPs in insect cells. Thirty percent of the
   intracellular protoxin was N-glycosylated, suggesting that the protoxin
   was translocated across the ER membrane. Secretion into the medium,
   however, was limited. The production of the mature toxin was poor as a
   result of its cytotoxicity to insect cells. In a bioassay against second
   instar Spodoptera exigua larvae, using a recombinant expressing the
   Androctonus australis scorpion toxin gene in the same p10 locus as a
   positive control, the median survival time of AcNPV recombinants
   expressing the various B. thuringiensis CryIA(b) ICP constructs was not
   significant different from that of wildtype AcNPV. This suggests that
   production and/or secretion of B. thuringiensis (pro)toxins by AcNPV p10
   recombinant viruses does not increase insecticidal activity since (i)
   the protoxins produced are inactive and not likely to be activated in
   vivo; (ii) secretion of the B. thuringiensis protoxins is poor; and
   (iii) production of the mature toxins results in cytotoxicity. (C) 1995

   cutting tools with different side cutting edge angles. The occurrence of
   regenerative chatter vibration of the cutting tool is influenced by two
   factors, which are closely related to the vibratory energy supply or

   flank and the workpiece. Of course, this factor exists in the primary
   chatter, too. The other is the regenerative effect. The influence of
   both factors on the regenerative chatter vibration of cutting tools with
   different side cutting edge angles is examined experimentally. The
   vibratory energy supply is simulated considering the dynamic cutting
   process. As a result, the property of the regenerative chatter vibration
   and the influence of the side cutting edge angle on the regenerative
   chatter vibration are clarified.}},

Abstract = {{Patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) have been
   identified as potential risk factors for stroke, but information about
   the risk of recurrent cerebral ischemia is scarce. The aim of this
   retrospective study was to assess the absolute risk of recurrent
   cerebrovascular events in 132 patients under 60 years of age with patent
   foramen ovale, atrial septal aneurysm (diagnosed by transesophageal
   echocardiography with a contrast study), or both and an otherwise
   unexplained stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). During a mean
   follow-up of 22.6 +/- 16 months, six patients had a recurrent stroke (n
   = 2) or a TIA (n = 4). No systemic embolism was observed. The actuarial
   risk of having a recurrent stroke was 2.3\% (95\% confidence interval,
   0.6\% to 8.2\%) at 2 years, whereas the risk of having a stroke or a TIA
   was 6.7\% (95\% confidence interval, 3.1\% to 14.2\%) at 2 years. The
   average annual rates of recurrence were 1.2\% and 3.4\%, respectively.
   In patients with both PFO and ASA, the actuarial risk of a first
   recurrent stroke was 9.0\% (95\% confidence interval, 2.4\% to 28.5\%)
   at 2 years, with an average annual rate of recurrence of 4.4\%. As a
   group, patients with patent foramen ovale, atrial septal aneurysm, or
   both and an otherwise unexplained stroke or TIA appear to have a low
   risk of recurrent stroke whatever the prophylactic antithrombotic
   therapy used. The association of ASA and PFO may be an indicator of a
   higher risk of recurrent stroke.}},

   encoding growth factors of the FGF, TGF, and PDGF families. Homeobox
   (Hox) genes are a family of developmental control genes activated early
   in embryogenesis that encode positional information along the
   anterior-posterior body axis and specify distinct spatial domains within
   developing limbs. Growth factor genes can regulate the proliferation and
   differentiation of various embryonic structures including limb buds and
   have been shown to influence Hox gene expression. Candidate genes HOXD,

   minimum transmitted power to the maximum transmitted power, kappa. New
   analytical expressions for tau and kappa are given in simple form as a
   function of the position of the incident beam wave (with respect to the
   slit) and the spot size. Also, an interesting diffraction property of E
   and tau given by E = tau/lambda is presented, where lambda is the
   wavelength of the incident beam wave. We have found that the diffraction
   patterns at minimum transmitted power have an unusual shape: at vertical

Abstract = {{The concept of a solar power station (SPS) was proposed 25 years ago.
   During the intervening years, long-distance, high-power transmission
   microwave technology has advanced. Realization of wireless power
   transmission in space is now no longer a dream. It has been predicted
   from three-way coupling that a static plasma wave is excited when an
   intense microwave passes through space plasma. The microwave power
   transmission rocket experiment in an ionosphere carried out by the
   authors (MINIX, Microwave Ionosphere Nonlinear Interaction eXperiment)
   has confirmed this fact. In this experiment, a phenomenon that cannot be
   explained by the three wave resonance theory has been discovered. In
   this paper, a computer experiment using plasma has been carried our with
   an electromagnetic particle code. Static plasma wave excitation and the
   saturation phenomenon are explained in which not only the simple
   three-wave coupling but also the wave-particle interaction are included.}},

Abstract = {{Involvement of cyanide (CN)-resistant respiration in cell-type
   proportioning was analyzed using the developmental system of
   Dictyostelium discoideum. When migrating slugs were vitally stained with
   rhodamine 123, which is known to stain actively respirating mitochondria
   coupled with an elevated electronic potential of the inner membrane, the
   posterior prespore region was stained more strongly than the anterior
   prestalk region. Application of benzohydroxamic acid (BHAM) and propyl
   gallate, specific inhibitors of CN-resistant respiration, to starved
   Dictyostelium cells induced formation of unique cell masses, in which
   almost all of the cells differentiated into stalk-like cells with a
   large vacuole and thick cell wall. BHAM was also found to enhance the
   expressions of prestalk-specific genes such as ecmA and ecmB in the
   unique cell mass in a position-dependent manner. In contrast, the
   expression of a prespore-specific gene, Dp87, was almost completely
   inhibited by BHAM. Taken together these results strongly suggest the
   involvement of CN-resistant respiration in the proportion regulation of
   cell types differentiating during the Dictyostelium development. (C)

Abstract = {{Background The effect of volatile anesthetics on cerebral blood how
   depends on the balance between the agent's direct vasodilatory action
   and the indirect vasoconstrictive action mediated by flow-metabolism
   coupling. To compare the intrinsic action of volatile anesthetics, the
   effect of halothane, isoflurane, and desflurane on how velocity in the
   middle cerebral artery during propofol-induced isoelectricity of the
   electroencephalogram was examined,
   Methods: In 21 ASA physical status 1-2 patients, anesthesia was induced
   with 2.5 mg/kg propofol, 3 mu g/kg fentanyl, and 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium
   and maintained with a propofol infusion to preserve an isoelectric
   electroencephalogram. End-tidal carbon dioxide and blood pressure were
   maintained constant throughout the study period. A transcranial Doppler
   was used to measure blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery,
   and a catheter was inserted in a retrograde direction into the jugular
   bulb for oxygen saturation measurements. After 15 min of isoelectric
   electroencephalogram, arterial and jugular venous blood samples were
   drawn, and how velocity in the middle cerebral artery was recorded.
   Patients were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 MAC halothane,
   isoflurane, or desflurane, and after 15 min of equilibration, all
   variables were measured again. The concentration of the volatile agent
   was increased to 1.5 MAC, and after 15 min of equilibration, the
   measurements were repeated.
   Results: Halothane, isoflurane, and desflurane significantly increased
   now velocity in the middle cerebral artery (baseline 28 +/- 4, 30 +/- 4,
   and 29 +/- 3 cm/s, respectively) at 0.5 MAC (19 +/- 1.5\%, 21 +/- 2\%,
   and 23 +/- 3\%, respectively; P < 0.05) and at 1.5 MAC (48 +/- 3\%, 75
   +/- 7\%, and 74 +/- 4\%, respectively; P < 0.05). Changes in the
   cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference are consistent with
   these findings.
   Conclusions Halothane, isoflurane, and desflurane have intrinsic,
   dose-related cerebral vasodilatory effects. Whereas all three agents are
   similar at 0.5 MAC, isoflurane and desflurane have greater vasodilatory
   effects than halothane at 1.5 MAC.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Tardive dyskinesia (TD) may be mediated through free radical
   damage to neurons. Plasma lipid peroxide levels are a measure of radical
   damage to fats. Vitamin E is a free radical scavenger.
   Method. One hundred and twenty-eight schizophrenic patients were
   examined for TD using the Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale. Blood
   samples were taken to measure plasma lipid peroxide, serum vitamin E and
   cholesterol, and vitamin E:cholesterol ratios. Twenty-four patients were
   also examined in October 1993, January 1994, and April 1994. Biochemical
   results were compared in 81 patients and 79 normal subjects.
   Results. Patients with and without TD did not differ in median plasma
   lipid peroxide and serum vitamin E levels, or vitamin E:cholesterol
   ratios. Correlations between seasonal change scores in TD and
   biochemical measurements were low. Lipid peroxide levels were higher and
   vitamin E:cholesterol ratios lower in patients than in normal subjects.
   Vitamin E levels were lowest in in-patients and in those living in
   supported accommodation.
   Conclusions. The results do not support the hypothesis that TD is
   mediated through free radical damage to neurons, but suggest increased
   free radical activity in schizophrenia.}},

   the often unchallenged `level playing field' of exam room must be
   replaced by new means of establishing fairness, reliability and
   validity. Innovative assessment is limited in its developments within
   the HE context; eg the weightings given to the process and products of
   learning can be of issue. It is also difficult to accomodate individual

Abstract = {{A 5 year study was undertaken in Kielder Forest to examine changes in
   pellet group counts, direct observations, body weight and potential
   fertility in a population of roe deer Capreolus capreolus subjected to
   heavy hunting pressure.
   Over the study period, the mean number of pellet groups per plot and
   mean number of deer observed per hour declined consistently while the
   mean number of hours hunting effort required to remove one deer
   increased. Measuring the rate of accumulation of pellet groups in
   permanent sample plots over 6 month periods appeared to provide a
   reliable method of monitoring changes in population density, as did
   systematic collection of observational data.
   Based on estimates derived from the pellet group counts, the deer
   population was reduced from a density of 12.0 to 3.0 deer km(-1) over
   the study period. In the latter stages, the number of deer removed from
   the population was equal to or greater than the estimated population
   size, suggesting that immigration from the surrounding forest area was a
   major factor affecting population density.
   Despite the significant reduction in population density, the average
   body weight and number of corpora lutea present in female deer was
   apparently unaffected, suggesting that habitat quality (rather than
   population density), was the main determinant of fertility.}},

Abstract = {{When completed, Belfast Waterfront Hall will comprise a prestigious
   civic building with a 2250 seat capacity main auditorium and a separate
   500 seat minor hall. Commissioned by Belfast City Council on a prime
   site on the banks of the River Lagan, it will be the `jewel in the
   crown' of the overall development strategy of the Laganside Corporation,
   the body responsible for improving the city centre riverside
   environment. The Hall will cater for a wide usage spectrum from full
   orchestral to theatrical performances and even to pop concerts, boxing
   matches, exhibitions and major conferences-making it, perhaps, the most
   versatile of its kind in Europe. In engineering terms, the project is
   extremely complex, with extensive basement areas and a unique steel
   domed roof structure to the main auditorium. Reinforced and precast
   concrete form the main elements of the construction which is supported
   on piled foundations. The controversial, pound 29 million project
   commenced on site in May 1993 and will take three years to complete. The
   paper highlights the interaction involved to achieve the requirements of
   the Client and the various Design Team members. It outlines the civil
   and structural engineering design from concept through to the detailed
   stage and describes the main aspects of construction.}},

Abstract = {{In patients with myocardial infarction, thrombolytic therapy induces a
   paradoxical activation of the hemostatic mechanism, In patients with
   unstable angina, the effect of thrombolysis on the coagulation cascade
   is unknown. We prospectively measured the plasma concentrations of
   prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and fibrinopeptide A in consecutive patients
   with unstable angina randomized to receive placebo alone (n = 23),
   streptokinase 1,500,000 IU over 1 hour followed by a 48-hour placebo
   infusion (n = 21), or streptokinase 250,000 over 1 hour followed by a
   continuous infusion of 100,000 IU per hour over 48 hours (n = 20). All
   the patients received intravenous heparin for 72 hours. The plasma
   levels of the different markers were measured at baseline, 90 minutes,
   24 hours, and 48 hours after the start of therapy. The median baseline
   plasma concentrations of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and fibrinopeptide A
   were similar in the three treatment groups. In comparison with placebo,
   an increase in plasma prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and fibrinopeptide A,
   was observed after 90 minutes in the two groups receiving thrombolysis.
   After 24 and 48 hours, the prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 levels remained
   significantly higher only in the patients receiving the 48-hour
   streptokinase infusion. In patients with unstable angina, thrombolytic
   therapy induces an activation of the hemostatic mechanism, despite
   concomitant heparin administration; in those receiving a prolonged
   streptokinase infusion, the activation of coagulation persists for as
   long as the drug is administered. (C) 1995 by The American Society of

Abstract = {{In intact tissue, {[}D-Ala(2),MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)] enkephalin (10(-5) M;

   inhibited L-valine absorption and L-valine-dependent variations of
   short-circuit current (Delta I-sc,I-val). Naloxone (10(-6) M)
   antagonized these effects. In the absence of the muscularis and
   myenteric plexus this enkephalin or morphine (mu-ligand) reduced I-sc
   and Delta I-sc,I-val. These enkephalin effects occurred at different
   times. Different concentrations of enkephalin were tested for their
   effects on Delta I-sc,I-val. {[}D-Ala(2),D-Leu(5)] enkephalin (mainly a

   reduction of L-valine absorption does not depend on the effects on basal
   ion transport. Interaction of opioids with mu-receptors located in the

   reduction. This enkephalin effect seems to be at least partially under

Abstract = {{A theoretical investigation of the indirect effect of radiation on the
   DNA macromolecule in dilute aqueous solution has been performed. A
   combination of the Monte Carlo method and the model of Smoluchowski
   together with the knowledge of rate constants for . OH radical reaction
   with DNA constituents and the detailed model of the DNA atomic structure
   allows us to calculate patterns of . OH radical attack on DNA. These
   patterns depend on DNA strandedness (single or double), base sequence
   and DNA conformation (A-, B-, Z-DNA). The comparison of the calculated
   patterns with the experimental data on strand breakage induced by
   gamma-radiolysis enables us to discuss the results obtained in term of
   molecular mechanisms of radiation induced damage. We can conclude: a)
   for B-DNA the variation in initial damage is mainly determined by the
   rate constant of the chemical reaction of . OH radical with different
   DNA components together with their specific position in the structure
   (sequence), and b) base radicals contribute only slightly to the
   formation of frank strand breaks, but significantly to the formation of
   alkali revealed breaks in B-DNA in dilute aqueous solution. For A-DNA
   only small differences in its radiolysis, as compared to the B-DNA, are
   predicted. On the contrary, calculations predict substantial differences
   in the indirect effect of radiation on the Z-form of DNA.}},

Abstract = {{Pupillometry is a simple non-invasive technique which allows early
   detection of an altered functioning of both branches of the Autonomic
   Nervous System (ANS). In the present study, the pupillometric findings
   (dark and light diameters and light reflex) obtained in 14 Multiple
   System Atrophy (MSA) patients (5 with the striatonigral degeneration
   (SND) type and 9 with the olivopontocerebellar (OPCA) type were compared
   with those of a sex- and age-matched control group and with a group
   patients suffering from idiopathic parkinsonism who had never undergone
   treatment previously.
   MSA patients showed larger pupils after dark and light adaptation, high
   degrees of anisocoria after light adaptation and a complex impairment of
   pupil response to light (mainly occurring in the OPCA-type of MSA)
   represented by an increase in latency, contraction time and a reduction
   in contraction amplitude. These data point to the existence in MSA
   (particularly of OPCA-type) of a pupillary imbalance, mainly involving
   the parasympathetic branch of the ANS, which is likely to be due to an
   impairment of the central pathways subserving pupil response to light
   and is probably detectable in the early stages of the disease by means
   of dynamic pupillometric evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{If the prevalence of sick building syndrome (SBS) is estimated before
   intervention begins, then a reduction in the estimate may later be used
   to measure success of the intervention, and in particular, those efforts
   toward improving air quality. However, the measure of success will be
   distorted if factors other than air quality affect the SBS prevalence
   estimate. in this study the background prevalence of SBS was estimated
   and study factors identified that alone affected the estimate. Two
   symptom questionnaires were randomly administered to workers from 39
   offices before routine physical examinations; one questionnaire
   described the SBS study, the other did not. SBS was defined as a symptom
   in the prior 24-hour or 7-day recall period that was more severe at work
   and not related to suspected confounders-allergy, cold, flu. Prevalence
   and prevalence ratios were estimated along with 95\% confidence
   intervals (CI). Symptoms were reported by 45\% of 1088 workers surveyed,
   but most reported them as more severe outside work or related them to
   confounders. SBS prevalence was 5\%. it was 3.2 times higher (95\% CI:
   1.8, 5.7) among workers cognizant of the study relative to those
   blinded, 2.2 limes higher (95\% CI: 1.2, 4.1) for the 7-day relative to
   the 24-hour recall period, and 2.5 times higher (95\% CI: 1.4, 5.0) for
   females. SBS prevalence did not differ by workday or age. Since study
   factors alone affected prevalence estimates, a standardized assessment
   method seems necessary for SBS.}},

   before tracheal extubation. Diclofenac suppository was prescribed to
   prevent postoperative pain. No opioids or postoperative antiemetics were
   administered All children remained in hospital for two days
   postoperatively. The incidence and frequency of vomiting were compared
   in the groups with Kruskall-Wallis Rank test. Clonidine 4 mu g . kg(-1)
   caused a lower incidence and frequency of vomiting than did placebo and
   diazepam (incidence and frequency: 11\% and 1,37\% and 3, and 34\% and 2
   in clonidine 4 mu g . kg(-1), placebo, and diazepam, respectively; P <
   0.05 for clonidine 4 mu g . kg(-1) vs placebo and diazepam). However,
   low-dose clonidine was ineffective. These data suggest that
   preanaesthetic medication with clonidine 4 mu g . kg(-1) may be useful
   for preventing emesis following strabismus surgery. This property of
   clonidine indicates that it may be superior to other sedative
   premedicants such as diazepam and midazolam.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an approach that provides Internet-based support
   far a genome center to map human chromosome 12, as a collaboration
   between laboratories at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in
   Bronx, New York, and the Yale University School of Medicine in New
   Haven, Connecticut. Informatics is well established as an important
   enabling technology within the genome mapping community. The goal of
   this paper is to use the chromosome 12 project as a case study to
   introduce a medical informatics audience to certain issues involved in
   genome informatics and in the Internet-based support of collaborative
   bioscience research, Central to the approach described is a shared
   database (DB/12) with Macintosh clients in the participating
   laboratories running the 4th Dimension database program as a
   user-friendly front end, and a Sun SPARCstation-2 server running Sybase.
   The central component of the database stores information about yeast
   artificial chromosomes (YACs), each containing a segment of human DNA
   from chromosome 12 to which genome markers have been mapped, such that
   an overlapping set of YACs (called a `'contig'') can be identified,
   along with an ordering of the markers. The approach also includes 1) a
   map assembly tool developed to help biologists interpret their data,
   proposing a ranked set of candidate maps, 2) the integration of DB/12
   with external databases and tools, and 3) the dissemination of the
   results. This paper discusses several of the lessons learned that apply
   to many other areas of bioscience, and the potential role for the field
   of medical informatics in helping to provide such support.}},

Title = {{UNILATERAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION OF THE PHRENIC-NERVE}},
Journal = {{THORAX}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Background - Electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve is a useful
   non-volitional method of assessing diaphragm contractility. During the
   assessment of hemidiaphragm contractility with electrical stimulation,
   low twitch transdiaphragmatic pressures may result Et om difficulty in
   locating and stimulating the phrenic nerve. Cervical magnetic
   stimulation overcomes some of these problems, but this technique may not
   be absolutely specific and does not allow the contractility of one
   hemidiaphragm to be assessed. This study assesses both the best means of
   producing supramaximal unilateral magnetic phrenic stimulation and its
   reproducibility. This technique is then applied to patients.
   Methods - The ability of four different coils to produce unilateral
   stimulation in five normal subjects was assessed from twitch
   transdiaphragmatic pressure (TwPDI) measurements and diaphragmatic
   electromyogram (EMG) recordings. The results from magnetic stimulation
   were compared with those from electrical stimulation. whether the
   magnetic the contralateral phrenic nerve as well as the intended phrenic
   nerve, EMG recordings from each hemidiaphragm were compared during
   stimulation on the same side and the opposite side relative to the
   recording electrodes. The EMG recordings were made from skin surface
   electrodes in five normal subjects and from needle electrodes placed in
   the diaphragm during cardiac surgery in six patients. Similarly, the
   direction of hemidiaphragm movement was evaluated by ultrasonography. To
   determine the usefulness of the technique in patients the 43 mm mean
   diameter double coil was used in 54 patients referred for assessment of
   possible respiratory muscle weakness. These results were compared with
   unilateral electrical phrenic stimulation, maximum sniff PDI, and TwPDI
   during cervical magnetic stimulation.
   Results - In the five normal subjects supramaximal stimulation was
   established for eight out of 10 phrenic nerves with the 43 mm double
   coil. Supramaximal unilateral magnetic stimulation produced a higher
   TwPDI than electrical stimulation (mean (SD) 13.4 (2.5) cm H2O with 35
   mm coil; 14.1 (3.8) cm H2O with 43 mm coil; 10.0 (1.7) cm H2O with
   electrical stimulation). Spread of the magnetic field to the opposite
   phrenic nerve produced a small amplitude contralateral diaphragm EMG
   measured from skin surface electrodes which reached a mean of 15\% of
   the maximum EMG amplitude produced by ipsilateral stimulation.
   Similarly, in six patients with EMG activity recorded directly from
   needle electrodes, the contralateral spread of the magnetic field
   produced EMG activity up to a mean of 3\% and a maximum of 6\% of that
   seen with ipsilateral stimulation. Unilateral magnetic stimulation of
   the phrenic nerve was rapidly achieved and well tolerated. In the 54
   patients unilateral magnetic TwPDI was more closely related than
   unilateral electrical TwPDI to transdiaphragmatic pressure produced
   during maximum sniffs and cervical magnetic stimulation. Unilateral
   magnetic stimulation eliminated the problem of producing a falsely low
   TwPDI because of technical difficulties in locating and adequately
   stimulating the nerve. Eight patients with unilateral phrenic nerve
   paresis, as indicated by a unilaterally elevated hemidiaphragm on a
   chest radiograph and maximum sniff PDI consistent with hemidiaphragm
   weakness, were all accurately identified by unilateral magnetic
   stimulation.
   Conclusions - Unilateral magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation is easy to
   apply and is a reproducible technique in the assessment of hemidiaphragm
   contractility. It is well tolerated and allows hemidiaphragm
   contractility to be rapidly and reliably assessed because precise
   positioning of the coils is not necessary. This may be particularly
   useful in patients. In addition, the anterolateral positioning of the
   coil allows the use of the magnet in the supine patient such as in the
   operating theatre or intensive care unit.}},

   exchange when the alpha(2) beta(2) enzyme complex is or is not saturated
   with glycine have been determined at pH 7.0 and 7.8. At pH 7.8 the
   effects of binding the allosteric effector, DL-alpha-glycerol
   3-phosphate, and of removing the alpha-subunits have been examined. The
   beta-subunits preferentially catalyse the exchange of the pro-2R proton
   of glycine, but adding alpha-subunits decreases the stereospecificity of
   the exchange reactions. Likewise, binding of DL-alpha-glycerol
   3-phosphate to the alpha(2) beta(2) enzyme complex causes a further
   decrease in the stereospecificity of this reaction. The
   stereospecificity of the second-order exchange reaction catalysed by the
   beta-subunits is 136-fold larger than that of the alpha(2) beta(2)
   enzyme complex in the presence of DL-a-glycerol 3-phosphate, while there
   is only a 5-fold decrease in the stereospecificity of the first-order
   exchange reaction under the same conditions. We discuss how these
   results relate to current theories which attempt to explain how the

   factors mainly of the prothrombin complex (factors II, VII and/or X)
   taken from eight dogs at different times of vitamin K-1 therapy after
   coumarin intoxication. This was demonstrable by use of three different
   Ca-thromboplastins. With the standard test only plasmas with an
   excessive decrease of coagulation factor activity (sum of activity
   decrease of the single factors in relation to the respective reference
   range {[}SAD] >100\%) were detectable with sufficient reliability. In
   contrast, by using a method optimized for dogs (1:20 sample predilution,
   fibrinogen substitution) and respecting the species specific features of
   coagulation physiology, pathological PT-values were measured in up to
   70\% of the samples (dependent on the Ca-thromboplastin) with slight
   reductions of single factor activity (SAD: 11-25\%). Significant
   differences concerning the sensitivity were seen additionally between
   the different Ca-thromboplastins. Human placenta thromboplastin in
   particular, but also rabbit brain thromboplastin, were more sensitive
   than a preparation of recombinant human tissue factor. The correlation
   between the PT and the SAD was closer when using the optimized method (r
   = 0.919-0.954) compared to the standard test (r = 0.771-0.862). In
   contrast to the standard test, the PT optimized for dogs is, therefore,
   a reliable screening test to recognize a slight reduction in prothrombin
   complex. It is especially suitable for monitoring of vitamin K, therapy
   after coumarin intoxication.}},

Abstract = {{Research in obesity has generally not demonstrated an association with
   increased rates of psychopathology compared to normal-weight comparison
   groups. However, studies of obese obese individuals from clinical
   samples with recurrent binge eating or binge eating disorder (BED) have
   generally revealed increased rates of psychiatric comorbidity compared
   to nonbinge eating obese individuals. Also, several studies have
   reported finding an association between BED and elevated rates of
   psychological distress, social problems, and impaired self-esteem. This
   report provides an overview of research findings regarding psychiatric
   comorbidity among individuals with BED, and it presents suggestion for
   future research.}},

   \{{[}{[}1-{[}(2-methylsulphonyl)amino]ethyl]-4-piperidin-yl]methyl

   pK(i) values reported in 5-HT3-receptor binding of {[}H-3]GR65630 to rat
   cortical membranes, the affinity of YM060, YM114, ondansetron and
   granisetron for 5-HT4 receptors was approximately 5, 5, 3.5 and 3.5 log
   units lower than that for 5-HT3 receptors, respectively. In the guinea
   pig longitudinal muscle with myenteric plexus and rat esophageal tunica
   muscularis mucosae, YM060 and YM114 showed neither 5-HT4-agonistic nor
   antagonistic properties. Although ondansetron produced
   concentration-dependent increases in the magnitude of the twitch
   response in longitudinal muscle, it did not possess 5-HT3- and
   5-HT4-agonistic activity. Granisetron antagonized 5-HT-induced
   relaxation of the rat esophagus with an apparent pA(2) value of 5.39.
   Intravenous YM060, YM114, ondansetron and granisetron significantly
   enhanced gastric emptying of glass beads and improved cisplatin-induced
   slowing of gastric emptying in rats. These results indicate that the
   selectivity of YM060 and YM114 for 5-HT3 receptors is higher than that
   of ondansetron and granisetron and that these 5-HT3 antagonists have
   gastroprokinetic activity in normal and cisplatin-treated rats without
   affecting 5-HT4 receptors.}},

Abstract = {{Time-resolved photovoltage measurements were performed with the
   acid-blue (bR(605)(A)) and acid-purple (bR(565)(A)) forms of
   bacteriorhodopsin (bR) in the time range from 25 ns to 100 s. The
   bR(605)(A) and bR(565)(A) pigments were formed by titration with H2SO4
   in the absence and presence of 150 mM KCl, respectively. Qualitatively
   the kinetics of the charge displacement in these two states are similar
   and consist of two fast phases in one direction (100 ns bandwidth
   limited and similar to 1 mu s) followed by a decay in the opposite
   direction via one component for bR(605)(A) (4.4 +/- 0.6 ms) or two
   components for bR(565)(A) (33 +/- 8 mu s and 3.6 +/- 0.5 ms). The
   transient photovoltage signal returns exactly to the initial value after
   several milliseconds, well before the passive discharge of the
   electrical measuring system at 2 s. We conclude that no net charge
   transfer occurs in either bR(605)(A) or bR(565)(A). The direction of the
   fast components is opposite that of net proton translocation in bR at pH
   7. So, if the charge that moves back and forth is due to a proton, it
   moves first in the direction of the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (<1
   mu s) and returns to its initial position via the 4.4 ms (bR(605)(A)) or
   the 33 mu s and 3.6 ms (bR(565)(A)) decay components. The amplitude of
   the charge motion in both low pH forms is too large to be due to
   isomerization alone and is comparable to one of the major components in
   bR at pH 7. From the pH dependence of the photovoltage amplitudes
   apparent pK(a)s of 1.6 +/- 0.2 and 2.0 +/- 0.2 were determined for the
   transitions from bR(568) to bR(605)(A) and to bR(565)(A), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe the physical map and transcriptional
   organisation of a 100-kb region with the BRCA1 locus at 17q12-21. Using
   the cDNA of the EDH17B2 gene as a probe, we screened a human genomic
   cosmid library. Positive cosmid clones were aligned and a contig around
   the EDH17B2 gene was established, expanding the previously reported map.
   In order to identify genes located in this region, we used the cosmid
   inserts to select cDNAs from a human ovarian cDNA library. Among the
   clones identified, cDNA OV-1 corresponds to a human homologue of a rat
   PRL-1 tyrosine phosphatase gene that shows enhanced expression during
   hepatic regeneration and in some tumour cell lines. Neither the OV-1 nor
   the PRL-1 protein shares strong homology with any previously
   characterised phosphotyrosine phosphatase, suggesting that they probably
   belong to a new phosphatase family. In an attempt to characterise the
   OV-1 gene, we found that the genomic sequence present on chromosome 17
   probably corresponds to a nonfunctional copy of the gene, as it contains
   several sequence changes that disrupt the potential coding information
   of the gene. Three other cDNAs, corresponding to unrelated genes, were
   also identified and characterised. They did not reveal striking
   homologies in database sequence comparison and therefore represent new
   genes localised on chromosome 17q, in a region that frequently shows
   loss of heterozigosity in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of selenium (Se) in bovine liver requires a sensitive
   method due to the low content of this element in such tissue. The
   hydride generation-atomic absorption technique responds to this
   requirement, and is also recognized for its simplicity and accuracy. The
   sample dissolution is required. The organic matrix must be completely
   destroyed, but without analyte losses. In this work, a simple procedure
   for the Se determination in bovine liver is presented: a 10:1
   nitric-percloric (mixture) is added to 10 mg of the powdered and dried
   sample, in quartz open tubes. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight
   and then heated, stepwise, to 140 degrees C (60') and 210 degrees C.
   Selenium was determined in the resulting solution by
   hydride-generation-AAS. The detection limit of the who le analytical
   procedure was 0,5 ng (n=10, k=3). A very good concordance between found
   and certified values was observed in the analysis of a standard
   reference material - NIST 1577a, bovine liver. The procedure permitted
   the determination of Se concentration above 0,1 mu g/g in the dried
   material.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondrial DNA haplotype diversity and frequency distribution were
   examined within and among four narrowly endemic species and one
   cosmopolitan species of the rock-dwelling cichlid fish species flock
   (mbuna) of Lake Malawi in East Africa. The endemics, restricted to very
   small islands, appear to have originated less than 20,000 yr ago.
   Relative and absolute levels of genetic diversity were used to examine
   the possibility that these endemics arose through founder events, as has
   been suggested for the Hawaiian drosophiloids, to which the East African
   cichlids have been compared. Three principal results emerged from this
   study. First, the undescribed species Pseudotropheus zebra `black
   dorsal' was found to be depauperate of mtDNA haplotype diversity
   relative to sister taxa, suggesting a severe population bottleneck
   during, or subsequent to, its recent origin. Second, significant
   differences in haplotype frequency existed among all five closely
   related species examined here. Geologic evidence and distributional
   limits indicate that this divergence in haplotype frequency occurred
   rapidly, consistent with population bottlenecks. Paradoxically, in three
   of four species examined there was no apparent reduction in genetic
   diversity, and two had haplotype diversity values that were high
   relative to other freshwater fishes. Third, it was found that replicate
   collections of single species at different sites within the same general
   locations, without obvious barriers to gene flow, also exhibited
   significant differences in haplotype frequency. Such apparent fine-scale
   genetic structuring, whether spatial or temporal, has substantial
   implications for estimates of effective population size and modeling of
   speciation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic second harmonic generation in solids is difficult to measure

   heterodyne interferometer modified to measure acoustic fundamental and
   second harmonics is presented. It requires relatively little sample
   preparation and it provides noncontact, wideband, absolute, and
   pointlike measurements. It is shown that the output of an ideal
   heterodyne interferometer does not contain any even harmonics of a
   single-frequency acoustic signal. Odd harmonics, however, are produced
   in calculable amounts. A detailed model of the interferometer is
   introduced to account for various sources of spurious second harmonics
   and the model is experimentally verified. Three methods of calibration
   for the absolute measurement of surface displacement are presented.
   Measurements of the nonlinearity parameter, beta, of a fused quartz

   with low Rb concentration undergo the same sequence of low-temperature
   phase transitions as the pure compound LiKSO4. The mixed crystals' Raman
   spectra are very similar to those of the pure compound, showing that the
   presence of the Rb ions introduces a local distortion without destroying
   the long-range order of the crystalline arrangement. In the mixed
   crystals, the hexagonal-trigonal phase transition is shifted to higher
   values of temperature and the ferroelastic transition to lower values,
   with increasing Rb concentration. A qualitative model, whose basic
   assumption is the local trigonal distortion introduced by the Rb ions,

Abstract = {{The winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Rawhide is heterogenous
   for the 1BL/1RS translocation. The 1BL/1RS translocation has been proven
   to increase grain yield and decrease end-use quality in bread wheat. The
   objective of this research was to investigate if the excellent yield
   performance of Raw hide was due to higher yielding 1BL/1RS Lines
   compensating for lower yielding in lines and if the acceptable quality
   of Rawhide was produced by higher end-use quality in lines compensating
   for lower end-use quality 1BL/1RS lines. To do so, 19 homogeneous in
   genotypes and 18 homogeneous 1BL/1RS genotypes were selected from
   Rawhide. These genotypes, three composites (Composite In, Composite
   1BL/1RS, and Composite Total), Rawhide, and three check cultivars, were
   evaluated in four Nebraska environments for grain yield, yield
   components, and end-use quality traits. No significant differences were
   found between chromosome classes for grain yield. The 1BL/1RS genotypes
   had a higher kernel weight (4\%) than 1B genotypes; however, the in
   genotypes had a greater number of spikes per square meter (5\%).
   Composites were no different from Rawhide and from each other for grain
   yield and yield components. For end-use quality traits, the 1BL/1RS
   genotypes had a higher protein content (137 mg g(-1)), similar mixing
   time (4.8 min), and lower mixing tolerance (3.5) than in genotypes (132
   mg g(-1), 5.0 min, and 4.9, respectively). However, a mixing tolerance
   value of 3.5 is acceptable. In general, no differences were found among
   the composites and between the composites and Rawhide for quality
   traits. Hence, the 1BL/1RS translocation was not beneficial for yield
   nor was it detrimental for end-use quality in this genetic background.}},

   the magnitude of corneal astigmatism. It consists of a rack of
   elliptical keratoscopic lenses corresponding to increasing magnitudes of
   astigmatism and is made from inexpensive autoclavable injection-molded
   plastic. The ruler's keratoscopic lenses refract light, creating a real

Abstract = {{A new method is proposed for the calculation of kinetic coefficients
   from Fokker-Planck (FP) equations. Starting from the time scale
   separation between the kinetic modes of the FP operator and the other
   faster eigenmodes associated to the local equilibration of the
   coordinates, a set of site-localizing functions is introduced for the
   ensemble of stable states of the system by means of linear combinations
   of the kinetic eigenfunctions. They allow the mapping of a
   nonequilibrium distribution onto a set of site populations which obey to
   rate equations of kinetic type. Such a procedure is easily implemented
   by using numerical eigenfunctions of the time evolution operator, so
   providing a set of transition rates which leads to the same decay rates
   of the FP kinetic modes. Several examples are considered in order to
   illustrate the typical results of the method. Particularly interesting
   is a two-dimensional model for the chain of two bistable oscillators
   bound to a wall. A new kind of kinetic processes is recovered, besides
   ordinary transitions associated to saddle point crossings. They
   represent displacements localized within the chain without saddle point
   crossing, with analogy to crank-shaft transitions of polymers. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{The free radical theory of aging postulates that free radicals are the
   underlying cause of aging, One of the well-established age-associated
   disorders is the decrease in the insulin-stimulated glucose transport
   through the cell membrane which was reported to be a major mechanism
   underlying insulin resistance in old rats, The present study
   investigates the protective capacity of two known antioxidants, vitamin
   C and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), against age-associated free
   radical damage, which could be the reason behind the decreased
   insulin-stimulated glucose transport in old animals, Maximum
   insulin-stimulated glucose transport has been estimated in dipocytes
   isolated from adult 6-month-old Fischer rats and from senile
   24-month-old control rats as well as from 24-month-old rats that were
   fed either vitamin C or BHT for 18 months, A significant increase in
   maximum insulin-stimulated glucose transport was observed in the BHT (p
   = 0.015) and the vitamin C groups (p = 0.039) compared with the control
   group of the same age, Significant stimulations with insulin over basal
   activities were also observed in the BHT group (p = 0.0001) as well as
   the vitamin C group (p = 0.009), while a nonsignificant stimulation (p =
   0.097) was observed in the old control group, This study suggests a
   protective role that BHT (fat soluble) may have on the lipid moiety of
   the cell membrane and vitamin C (water soluble) on one or more of the
   intracellular cytoplasmic constituents concerned with glucose transport.}},

   role behaviors were largely unrelated to task role adoption but were
   inversely associated with maintenance role behaviors. Perceptions of
   group cohesiveness were positively linked with both task and maintenance
   role activity but were lowest among individual role players. Task roles

   both maintenance and individual roles were viewed neutrally in this

Abstract = {{Objective: Endoscopic images of the colonic mucosal venous structure in
   eight cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices and in eight
   noncirrhotic subjects were analyzed to qualitatively determine whether
   or not the vasculature be altered by persisting portal hypertension.
   Methods: On the endoscopic images, a venous network consisting of
   confluent venous branches draining into one penetrating vein was as a
   whole defined as one `'venous unit.'' For each venous unit, the area of
   vein bed was calculated by means of an image processor. Each venous
   network was idealized to be a graphic representation consisting of lines
   (venous routes) and dots (origins, terminations, branching or
   anastomosing), on which two topological variables, the total number of
   zero-dimensional cells (ail) and the Betti number of dimension-1
   (beta(1){[}K]), signifying the complexity and the number of venous
   anastomoses, respectively, were determined. Results: The area of vein
   bed (mean +/- SD) was significantly greater (p < 0.01) for the cirrhotic
   patients (41 +/- 37 mm(2)) than for the noncirrhotic subjects (24 +/- 12
   mm(2)). The all was also greater (p < 0.01) for the patients (68 +/- 29)
   than for the noncirrhotic subjects (42 +/- 17). The beta(1){[}K] for the
   patients was significantly greater Cp < 0.01) for the cirrhotic subjects
   (7.1 +/- 4.4) than for the noncirrhotic subjects (2.6 +/- 2.9).
   Conclusion: The image processing and topological analysis of the colonic
   mucosal veins demonstrated that persistent portal hypertension alters
   the colonic mucosal venous structure by increasing the caliber of the
   veins and the number of merges (branching or anastomosing) between them.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to measure the quality of falling snow particles as a
   help in analyzing radio attenuation during snowfalls. Since the quality
   of snow particles depends almost entirely on their density (the amount
   of water they contain), the snow particle density reflects their
   quality. To permit automatic measurement of the average densities of
   falling snow particles over long periods of time, the diameters and fall
   velocities of snow particles are measured by means of image processing.
   Simultaneously, the weight of all snow particles that have fallen to the
   ground was measured directly by means of an electronic balance. The
   density of the falling snow particles is calculated by dividing into
   this total weight the total volume of snow particles that passed through
   a unit volume (obtained from the diameter and velocity of snow
   particles). The diameters, velocities, and number of snow particles are
   determined by image processing. Snowfall rates calculated from the image
   processing data are compared with those measured directly and are found
   to agree.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the effects of culturing neonatal rat-brain astrocytes
   in medium containing delipidated serum, with or without added linoleic
   acid (LA, 18:2 omega 6), on membrane fatty-acid composition and
   functions. After 18-21 days in culture, polyunsaturated fatty acids
   (PUFA) constituted approximate to 24 mol\% of the total fatty acids in
   the astrocytes grown in delipidated media ('controls'); these
   proportions were increased by 35-40\% to approximate to 33 mol\% when
   the cells were supplemented with 35 mu M LA. Notable differences in the
   PUFA profiles of the cells cultured with or without added LA included:
   (a) higher proportions of omega 6 PUFA in the LA-supplemented astrocytes
   (approximate to 25\%, relative to approximate to 10\% in controls) that
   were accompanied by an increase in the ratio of omega 6/omega 3 PUFA
   (from <2 in controls to approximate to 5), and (b) higher proportions of
   20:3 omega 9 and 22:3 omega 9 in the control astrocytes (>5\%) relative
   to the LA-supplemented cells (approximate to 1\%). The major metabolites
   in the omega 6 PUFA-enriched cells were arachidonic (20:4 omega 6),
   adrenic (22:4 omega 6) and docosapentaenoic (22:5 omega 6) acids (15, 5
   \& 3 mol\%, respectively). Enrichment of the astrocytes in omega 6 PUFA
   did not alter basal levels of cAMP, nor did it affect the amounts of
   cAMP formed in response to forskolin, isoproterenol, adenosine or
   histamine. However, dopamine-dependent increases in cAMP formation in
   the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, Ro 20-1724, were
   reduced by approximate to 25\% relative to those in controls. LA
   supplementation modified uptake of {[}H-3]adenosine into the astrocytes;
   values for K-t for a high affinity transport were increased relative to
   controls, and maximum capacity of a lower affinity process was reduced.
   Uptake of {[}H-3]glutamate was not altered in the omega 6 PUFA-enriched
   astrocytes. This study demonstrated that cultured astrocytes take up
   exogenous linoleic acid and incorporate its metabolites into
   phospholipid, and that the resulting changes in membrane PUFA
   composition modify only specific cell functional properties.}},

Abstract = {{The light distribution during photodynamic therapy of the bronchial tree
   has been estimated by measuring the fluence rate in ex vivo experiments
   on dissected pig bronchi. The trachea was illuminated (630 nm) with a
   cylindrical diffuser and the fluence rate was measured with a fibre
   optic isotropic probe. The experiment with the diffuser on the central
   axis was also simulated with Monte Carlo techniques using the optical
   properties that were determined with a double-integrating-sphere set-up.
   The results from ex vivo experiments and the Monte Carlo simulations
   were found to agree within the error of measurement (15\%), indicating
   that the Monte Carlo technique can be used to estimate the light
   distribution for varying geometries and optical properties. The results
   showed that the light fluence rate in the mucosa of the tracheal tract
   may increase by a factor of six compared to the fluence rate in air (in
   the absence of tissue). This is due to the scattering properties of the
   tissue and the multiple reflections within the cavity. Further ex vivo
   experiments showed that the positioning of the diffuser is critical for
   the fluence rate in the lesion to be treated. When the position of the
   diffuser was changed from the central axis to near the lesion, the
   fluence rate in the mucosa increased significantly by several orders of
   magnitude as compared to the initial (central) illumination. The inter-
   and intraspecimen variations in this increase were large (+/-35\%)
   because of variations in optical and geometrical properties and light
   source positioning, respectively. These variations might cause under- or
   overdosage resulting in either insufficient tumour necrosis or excessive
   normal tissue damage.}},

Abstract = {{Previous investigators measuring the pH of lysosomes have used distized
   video microscopy (DVM) in freshly isolated or cultured cells. Although
   useful, this technique is time consuming, requires the use of an image
   analysis system, and is limited by the fact that measurements can be
   made in only a relatively small number of cells. The aim of this study
   was to develop and initially apply a technique using now cytometry to
   make dynamic measurements of lysosomal pH in a large number of living
   hepatocytes. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with fluorescein
   isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-Dex), a pH-sensitive fluorescent probe that
   is sequestered into lysosomes. Hepatocytes were isolated 16 hours after
   injection by collagenase perfusion. Lysosomal pH was measured in 20,000
   hepatocytes per animal using now cytometry with excitation at 488 nm and
   emission at 530 nm (pH sensitive) and 585 nm (pH insensitive). A
   standard curve of pH versus the 530/585 nm ratio was generated with
   FITC-Dex-loaded hepatocytes by equilibrating intralysosomal pH with
   extracellular pH using ionophores and metabolic inhibitors. The acute
   effects of chloroquine and methylamine were determined by exposing
   isolated hepatocytes to these lysosomotropic agents. The effect of
   chronic administration of chloroquine and Triton WR-1339 (Rutger
   Chemical, Inc., Irvington, NJ) on lysosomal pH was also measured.
   Intralysosomal pH was 4.67 + 0.02, nearly identical to the value 4.70 +
   0.05 previously measured by us using DVM. Both chloroquine and
   methylamine caused both rapid (<1 minute), major (0.5 to 2.0 pH units),
   and dose-dependent increases in lysosomal pH as well as changes in
   lysosome morphology, In contrast, although chronic chloroquine and
   Triton WR-1339 administration caused dramatic ultrastructural changes in
   lysosomal morphology, lysosomal pH was not increased by either of these
   agents suggesting that their pharmacological mechanisms are not mediated
   by their effects on lysosomal pH, These results show the utility and
   validity of using now cytometry in living cells to quantify dynamic
   changes in the pH of lysosomes and show a dissociation of morphological
   and pH responses of hepatocyte lysosomes to chronic treatment with
   lysosomotropic agents.}},

Abstract = {{We studied open-lung biopsies from 17 patients with pulmonary
   lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) using paraffin-section immunostains
   and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) RNA in situ hybridization to assess the
   phenotype of these unique tumors and to clarify the role of EBV
   infection. Histologically, all cases demonstrated the characteristic
   mixed mononuclear cell infiltrate of lymphomatoid granulomatosis with
   variable numbers of cytologically atypical large lymphoid cells in a
   background of small lymphocytes. Paraffin-section immunostains in all
   cases showed a predominance of T lymphocytes. A minor population of
   CD20-positive large B lymphocytes was identified in 11 cases;
   immunoglobulin light-chain restriction was demonstrated in four of these
   and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in another case. Nuclear
   labelling for EBV RNA was detected in 10 of these 11 cases and was
   confined to the population of large B lymphocytes. Staining for CD20 was
   absent in the remaining six cases, as was nuclear labeling for EBV RNA.
   However, the large atypical lymphoid cells stained for
   T-cell-lineage-specific antibodies in three of these cases, We conclude
   that some cases of lymphomatoid granulomatosis are B-cell lymphoma
   associated with EBV infection, whereas others are of T-cell origin and
   are probably unrelated to EBV infection.}},

   analysis showed that C. perfringens scRNA could compensate for
   vegetative growth and allow the formation of heat-resistant spores in an
   scRNA-depleted a. subtilis strain, whereas Escherichia coli 4.5S RNA
   could not maintain sporulation. Since both E. coli 4.5S RNA and C.

Abstract = {{Polycrystalline aluminium nitride (AIN) thin films were synthesized by
   evaporation of aluminium and simultaneous irradiation with nitrogen
   ions, ion-beam assisted deposition, and the effect of the ion beam
   energy on the film microstructure was studied. The substrate was
   single-crystal Si(100), and the substrate temperature was varied from
   room temperature to 573 K. The kinetic energy of the nitrogen ion beam
   was varied from 0.05 keV to 0.5 keV. The structure of the AIN thin films
   was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). From the XRD patterns, it is
   found that (1) the (00 . 2) plane of hexagonal A1N grows preferentially
   with an ion beam energy of 0.05 keV (the c-axis oriented structure)
   independently of the substrate temperature, (2) the intensity of the
   lines (10 . 0) and (10 . 1) becomes stronger with increasing ion beam
   energy, and (3) the full width at half maximum of the (00 . 2)
   diffraction line tends to narrow with decreasing ion beam energy and
   increasing substrate temperature. The present results show that the ion
   beam energy plays an important role in the degree of preferred
   orientation of AIN films and c-axis oriented films can be synthesized at

Abstract = {{To describe quantitatively the peritoneal transport of drugs, the
   kinetic model, which involves changes in the volume and osmolality of
   the dialysate as well as the diffusion and convection of drugs across
   the peritoneum, was applied. The apparent peritoneal permeability (P-d)
   of unbound drugs in rats and the partition coefficient (P-app) in an
   octanol:water system at pH 7.4 were estimated among acidic drugs, Using
   the values of unbound fraction (f(s)), the P-d values of the drugs were
   estimated from concentration-time profiles in serum and the peritoneal
   dialysate after intraperitoneal administration of drugs, The intrinsic
   membrane permeability (P-dm) was calculated based on a physiological
   pharmacokinetic model. The f(s) . P-dm values of thiopental and
   thiamylal (6.5 and 5.4 ml/min) were 2-3 times greater than the effective
   peritoneal blood flow, indicating that the peritoneal transport of the
   barbiturates with high lipophilicity was dominantly blood flow-limited.
   Evidence shows a high degree of correlation between log P-dm and log
   P-app. By considering the relationships, we estimated the P-dm of
   quinolonecarboxilic acids, The f(s) . P-dm values of quinolonecarboxilic
   acids were <10\% of the peritoneal effective blood flow rate, indicating
   that the peritoneal transport of quinolonecarboxilic acids was
   dominantly diffusion-limited because of low lipophilicity. In
   conclusion, there was a good correlation between log P-dm and log P-app.
   The prediction of P-dm can be useful to describe the peritoneal
   pharmacokinetics.}},

Abstract = {{A key component of an implant that can be triggered by external morphine
   to release naltrexone is an inactivated enzyme that can be activated by
   morphine and which can then rapidly remove a protective coating
   surrounding a bioerodible polymer containing dispersed naltrexone. In
   this article we describe a lipase that has been conjugated with
   O-3-carboxymethylmorphine, morphine-beta-3-glucuronide and
   O-3-carboxypropylmorphine. The enzyme conjugate was then inactivated by
   complexation with affinity-purified goat polyclonal antimorphine
   antibodies. Antibody lipase interactions were measured by pH Stat and
   ELISA techniques. Affinity constants of the antibodies determined by
   radioimmunoassay using tritium-labeled morphine were 4.10 x 10(6), 3.18
   x 10(6) and 3.38 x 10(7), respectively. While a concentration of 10(-5)
   M morphine was required to restore lipase activity, it is likely that a
   combination of correct morphine tether and correct affinity-purified
   antibody can increase sensitivity to the desired 10(-8)-10(-9) M
   morphine level. Thus, a functioning device can almost certainly be
   constructed. However, it is unlikely that reactivation times of 1-2 h
   necessary for clinical usefulness in treatment of narcotic addiction can
   be achieved. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Reconstitution experiments with purified components reproduce the basic
   characteristics of receptor/G protein coupling, i.e., GTP-sensitive high
   affinity agonist binding and receptor-promoted GTP binding. However, the
   interaction of agonists with the A, adenosine receptor in rat and bovine
   but not human brain membranes deviates from the ternary complex model
   since the agonist/receptor/G protein complex cannot be dissociated by
   high concentrations (greater than or equal to 100 mu M) of the
   hydrolysis-resistant analogue GTP gamma S. The reason for this
   phenomenon referred to as a `'tight coupling mode'' has remained
   enigmatic. We show that it is attributable to a distinct membrane
   protein, which we labeled the coupling cofactor. Extraction of the
   protein from rat brain membranes with the detergent
   3{[}3-(cholamidopropyl)diamethylammonio]-1-propanamium increased the
   potency of GTP gamma S by 1000-fold. After extraction, the potency was
   comparable to that in human brain membrane. Detergent extracts from rat
   brain membranes were used to resolve the component from solubilized
   receptors and G protein alpha and beta gamma subunits by sequential
   DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and Superose gel filtration (molecular
   weight of similar to 150 kDa in
   3{[}3-(cholamidopropyl)diamethylammonio]-1-propanamium). Coupling
   cofactor restored guanine nucleotide refractoriness in a
   concentration-dependent manner to both detergent-extracted rat brain
   membranes and, albeit with lower affinity, human brain membranes.
   However, in human brain extracts, cofactor activity was detectable on
   reconstitution with rat acceptor membranes, indicating an intrinsic
   difference between rat and human receptors in their ability to interact
   with the cofactor. With high amounts of coupling cofactor present, GTP
   gamma S no longer decreased but rather increased agonist affinity.
   Readdition of partially purified coupling cofactor to acceptor membranes
   reduced the rate of A(1) adenosine receptor-mediated G protein turnover.
   These observations show that the component identified traps the ternary
   agonist/receptor/G protein complex in a stable conformation, impedes
   signaling of the A(1) adenosine receptor, and thereby regulates the
   level of signal amplification.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a neural-network-based approach for the problem of
   sensor failure detection, identification, and accommodation for a flight
   control system without physical: redundancy in the sensors. The approach
   is based on the introduction of on-line learning neural network
   estimators. For a system with n sensors, a combination of a main neural
   network and a set of n decentralized neural networks achieves the design
   goal. The main neural network and the ith decentralized neural network
   detect and identify a failure of the ith sensor, whereas the output of
   the ith decentralized neural network accommodates for the failure by
   replacing the signal from the failed ith sensor with its estimate. The
   on-line learning for these neural network architectures is performed
   using the extended back-propagation algorithm. The document describes
   successful simulations of the sensor failure detection, identification,
   and accommodation process following both soft and hard sensor failures.
   The simulations have shown remarkable capabilities for this neural

Abstract = {{The aim was to establish whether interesterification of oils, an
   alternative to the use of trans fatty acids in margarine manufacture,
   adversely affects plasma lipids. Twenty-seven hypercholesterolemic men
   participated in a double-blind, crossover trial of three margarines: 1)
   high-linoleic acid, moderate trans fatty acids; 2) high-palm oil blend
   (predominantly lauric, myristic, palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids);
   and 3) an interesterified form of the high-palm oil margarine. Both
   high-palm oil margarines led to similar low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)
   cholesterol concentrations (4.43 +/- 0.94 and 4.54 +/- 0.88 mmol/L,
   respectively), which were significantly higher than the LDL
   concentrations after the high-linoleic acid margarine (4.02 +/- 0.85
   mmol/L, P < 0.001). Interesterification transferred substantial
   proportions of palmitic acid into the sn-2 position of glycerides and
   unsaturated fatty acids into the sn-1,3 positions, and this was
   reflected in plasma chylomicrons. This study shows that
   interesterification of oils used to harden margarines does not raise
   plasma cholesterol more than does the margarine's constituent fatty
   acids.}},

   sensitivity and susceptibility to killing by topo II poison. The
   relative sensitivities of these cell lines to camptothecin (also 8 h, 37
   degrees C exposure) also agree generally with their relative X-radiation
   sensitivities although the correlation is not as good as for etoposide.
   In addition, exponential phase (i.e, actively proliferating) cultures of
   the radiosensitive HT-144 cells are more susceptible to killing by both
   etoposide and camptothecin than the radioresistant Mel-3, confirming
   previously reported cross-sensitivities between X-radiation and topo
   poisons in actively proliferating cultures of other types of cell lines.
   Hence our results suggest that the previously reported cross-sensitivity
   between topo II poisons and X-radiation in actively proliferating rodent
   cell lines is also observed in `non-proliferating' rodent and human cell
   lines. Additionally, there is cross-sensitivity between topo I poisons
   and X-radiation in both rodent and human cell lines as well.}},

   MICROALBUMINURIC NIDDM PATIENTS - A LONGITUDINAL STUDY}},
Journal = {{DIABETES CARE}},
Year = {{1995}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - To assess the long-term relationships between 24-h
   ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP), urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate,
   and metabolic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)
   patients with normo- and microalbuminuria.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We conducted a prospective study of 23
   NIDDM patients (11 with normoalbuminuria and 12 with microalbuminuria)
   receiving standard clinical care, including antihypertensive treatment,
   attending the outpatient clinic and 8 healthy control subjects.
   Twenty-lour-hour AMBP and UAE were measured synchronously in addition to
   fasting plasma glucose, HbA(1c), and serum creatinine at baseline and
   after 4.6 (4.2-5.1) years {[}mean (range)].
   RESULTS - Baseline systolic, but not diastolic. 24-h AMBP was
   significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with control subjects
   (146/80 {[}16/11] vs. 133/78 {[}9/9] mmHg, P < 0.05), but was similar in
   normoalburninuric (143/81 {[}11/11] mmHg) and microalbuminuric (148/80
   {[}20/10] mmHg) patients during strict blood pressure control, The
   annual increase in 24-h AMBP was equivalent in diabetic patients
   (0.6/-0.2 {[}2.6/1.5] mmHg/year) and control subjects (0.7/0.2
   {[}1.2/1.4] mmHg/year, NS) and not significantly different from zero.
   Overall UAE did not change in control subjects (5.6 {[}1.6] vs. 4.4
   {[}1.9]) (geometric mean \textbackslash{}antilog SD\textbackslash{}) or
   in the normoalbuminuric (8.7 {[}1.7] vs. 11.3 {[}3.0] mu g/min) and
   microalbuminuric (35.7 {[}2.1] vs. 34.5 {[}3.2] mu g/min) patients, In
   diabetic patients, the annual change in UAE correlated significantly
   with the annual change in the systolic (r = 0.61, P < 0.002) and
   diastolic (r = 0.54, P < 0.008) 24-h AMBP. In microalbuminuric patients,
   only the annual increase in systolic 24-h AMBP correlated significantly
   with the annual change in UAE (r = 0.71, P = 0.010), whereas in the
   normoalbuminuric patients, only the annual increase in diastolic 24-h
   AMBP and the annual change in UAE were significantly correlated (r =
   0.66, P = 0.026). in a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, the
   annual progression in albuminuria in NIDDM patients was significantly
   determined by increases in systolic (parameter estimate 0.018, SE 0.006,
   P < 0.008) as well as in diastolic 24-h AMBP (parameter estimate 0.026,
   SE 0.011, P < 0.033).
   CONCLUSIONS - In an outpatient clinical setting, 24-h AMBP is similar in
   NIDDM patients with normo- and microalbuminuria. Alterations in both
   24-h AMBP and UAE are on average moderate and equivalent compared with
   those in healthy control subjects, Although the average change in
   albuminuria is small. a progression in albuminuria relates to increments
   in both systolic and diastolic 24-h AMBP.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for motion-compensated temporal prediction of image
   sequences is proposed. Motion vector fields in natural scenes should
   possess two basic properties. First, the field should be smoothly
   varying within moving objects to compensate for nonrigid or rotational
   motion, and scaling of objects. Second, the field should be
   discontinuous along the boundaries of the objects. In the proposed
   method the motion vector field is modelled using finite element methods
   and interpolated using adaptive interpolators to satisfy the
   above-stated requirements. This is particularly important when only very
   sparse estimates of motion vector fields are available in the decoder
   due to bit-rate constraints limiting the amount of overhead information
   that can be transmitted. The proposed prediction method can be applied
   for low-bitrate video coding in conventional codecs based on
   motion-compensated prediction and transform coding, as well as in
   model-based codecs. The performance of the proposed method is compared
   with standard motion-compensated prediction based on block matching. It
   is shown that for simple video telephony scenes a reduction of more than
   30\% in the energy of the prediction error can be achieved with an
   unchanged number of transmitted motion vectors and with only a modest
   increase in computational complexity. When implemented in an H.261 codec
   the new prediction method can improve the peak SNR 1-2 dB producing a
   significant visual improvement.}},

Abstract = {{The responses of gas exchange and ventilatory variables exhibit obvious
   asymmetry between the incremental and decremental phases of trapezoidal
   ramp exercise (29). Computer simulation was performed to explore the
   possible mechanisms producing this asymmetry of pulmonary O-2 uptake
   (VO2) dynamics. The model consisted of three compartments (the lungs,
   the exercising muscles, and the other organs and tissues), which were
   perfused by respective regional circulations. Exercise was simulated by
   increasing the pulmonary blood flow (Q) and the muscle VO2 in proportion
   to work rate. The dynamic responses of Q and the muscle VO2 were assumed
   to obey first-order linear kinetics. The ratio of blood flow in the
   muscle compartment to total cardiac output was assumed to increase
   linearly with work rate. Our simulation demonstrated that the muscle
   blood flow and mixed venous O-2 content exhibited significant asymmetry
   between the incremental and decremental phases of exercise. The model
   suggested that the asymmetry of VO2 between incremental and decremental
   ramp exercise was dependent on the redistribution ratio of blood flow to
   the working muscles. The validity of the model was then evaluated by
   comparing the simulated results with experimental data obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The POU-domain transcription factor Oct-2 is expressed in both B
   lymphocytes and sensory neurones, where its expression is regulated by
   nerve growth factor (NGF), In order to define a possible role for Oct-2
   in neurotrophin signalling, we examined the expression of an
   NGF-regulated channel (capsaicin-evoked ion fluxes), neuropeptides
   (substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide), structural proteins
   (neurofilaments and peripherin) and receptors (trks) in dorsal root
   ganglion neurones derived from perinatal transgenic mice containing a
   defective Oct-2 structural gene. Northern blots show that central
   nervous tissue contains a larger than normal(> 10 kb) mRNA transcript
   corresponding in size to an Oct-2 transcript encoding a defective
   protein. PCR analysis shows the absence of normal Oct-2 transcripts in
   dorsal root ganglia. In null mutants, capsaicin sensitivity, and
   neuropeptide and cytoskeletal protein expression were unaffected by the
   loss of Oct-2 expression. The number of sensory neurones and the gross
   morphology of CNS tissues that normally express high levels of Oct-2
   were also examined and found to be normal in the null mutant.
   Heterozygous animals show normal thresholds of sensitivity to noxious
   heat and normal inflammatory responses. Oct-2 does not therefore play an
   essential role in the NGF responsiveness of sensory neurones in these
   animals.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of a minimal operation for Crohn's disease, particularly of
   the small intestine, is based on the rationale that it is impossible to
   cure Crohn's disease by excision, since it is a panintestinal disease
   that can eventually occur in any part of the remaining intestine. The
   surgeon is required to treat only the complications and to conserve as
   much intestine as possible. In the case of stricture, excision is not
   necessary if the narrowing can be corrected. Strictureplasty is ideal
   for short strictures of the small intestine in quiescent disease. The
   morbidity and mortality of strictureplasties are low. In spite of
   leaving the `'burnout'' disease behind, the recurrent stricture after
   strictureplasties is comparable to the recurrence after bowel
   resections. The purpose of strictureplasty is to correct the small bowel
   obstruction and to preserve the length of the small intestine. It is,
   however, not intended to replace a small bowel resection.}},

   is breached, hyperplasia and hypertrophy occur and a premature gall is
   formed. Ultrastructural observations confirmed that loosening of the
   middle lamella occurs during progress through the cortex. Differences in
   the patterns of labelling of healthy and infected roots were revealed
   when the antipolygalacturonic acid antibody, JIM5, was applied; epitopes
   recognized by this antibody are mainly located on the triple junctions
   between cells. Some of the antibodies used proved very useful in
   illustrating the intercellular migration of JJ2 in the vascular
   cylinder, where they move in the vicinity of the protoxylem and future
   metaxylem cells. An envelope surrounding the nematodes, but located
   specifically on plant cell walls, was observed when infected root
   sections were probed with PC245. This material at this interface appears
   to be of nematode origin. Characterization of the molecules involved is
   currently under investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The amino group of doxorubicin (DXR) was found to be bound to the
   carboxyl group of carboxymethylpullulan (CMPul) either directly or
   through tetrapeptide spacers, including Gly-Gly-Phe-Gly, Gly-Phe-Gly-GIS
   and Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly. These conjugates had DXR contents of 6.1-7.1\%,
   with the degree of substitution of carboxymethyl groups being 0.6 per
   sugar moiety. These conjugates associate in phosphate-buffered saline
   (PBS) (pH 7.4), forming micelles with hydrophobic DXR inside and
   hydrophilic CMPul on the outside. The amounts of DXR released from the
   conjugates in the presence of rat liver lysosomal enzymes were
   determined by HPLC. The rate of the drug release differed among the
   conjugates tested. CMPul-DXR conjugate bound through Gly-Gly-Phe-Gly
   released 35\% of its DXR over 24 h. On the other hand, CMPul-DXR
   conjugate without spacer released no free DXR. The antitumor effect of
   each conjugate in rats bearing Walker 256 was studied by monitoring the
   tumor weights after a single intravenous injection. Compared with DXR,
   CMPul-DXR conjugates bound through Gly-Gly-Phe-Gly and Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly
   spacers significantly suppressed the tumor growth, while CMPul-DXR
   conjugate bound through Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly showed less antitumor effect
   than DXR. CMPul-DXR conjugate without spacer showed no in vivo antitumor
   effect even at a dose equivalent to as much as 20 mg/kg of DXR.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood were examined
   to assess the toxic effects of diborane (B2H6, CAS: 19287-45-7) on the
   lung. Male Wistar rats were exposed to diborane at 20 ppm (intended
   concentration) for 4 h (phase I study) to evaluate timecourse changes up
   to 14 days, and at 10 or 1 ppm (intended concentrations) to assess the
   dose-effect relationship after {[}leukocyte counts, alpha(1)-antitrypsin
   (alpha(1)-AT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total protein, phospholipids
   etc.] were examined and biochemical and histopathological studies were
   also carried out. In the phase I study, neutrophils (\%) in BALF
   increased on the day of exposure and then decreased gradually for 3
   days. Rapid and marked increases in alpha(1)-AT and SOD activity in BALF
   were detected on the day of exposure, and phospholipids had sharply
   increased on day 3. After 14 days, these parameters in the exposed rats
   had returned to their background level and alpha(1)-AT decreased
   significantly. In the phase II study, total protein, alpha(1)-AT
   activity and phospholipids in BALF showed dose-dependent increases, and
   serum alpha(1)-AT activity increased significantly. Alveolar capillary
   and alveolar cell damage were confirmed in rats exposed to 20 ppm, 10
   ppm or 1 ppm diborane for 4 h by evaluating the parameters examined. The
   protection system appeared to start operating immediately after
   exposure, and the recovery mechanism seemed to start operating 1 day
   after exposure and cease by day 14. The no-observed-effect level could
   not be observed.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical analyses of organochlorine compounds in effluents, sediment,

   adsorbable organic halogens (AOX), 4.7 kg/ton of air dried pulp (ADP),
   and polychlorinated phenolic compounds (31 g/ton ADP) in the effluent.
   The extractable organochlorine content in the accumulated fiber sludge
   of the sedimentation tank (70-100 mu g/g) was more than 100 times higher
   than the sediment from the receiving river. Chlorinated compounds
   including dioxins were detected at low levels in sediment and rice,
   crab, mollusc and fish samples. Significant amounts of the chlorinated
   persistent compounds are probably transported by the Red River to the
   river mouth and coastal area. Heavy metal content was high in sediment
   and mollusc samples from the receiving rice field and fish pond. There
   may be a possible risk for human intoxication of the metals through the
   aquatic food chain via the mollusc but not via the rice.}},

Abstract = {{The indole alkaloid, raumacline, is biosynthesized from ajmaline, when
   the latter was fed to cell suspensions of Rauwolfia serpentina.
   Formation in catalysed by two enzymes, a cell wall-bound peroxidase
   following by a NADPH(2)-dependent reductase. The first enzyme cleaves
   ajmaline oxidatively leading to a C-21 epimeric mixture of
   21-hydroxyraumacline, a novel alkaloid, which, in turn, is reduced under
   formation of raumacline. The peroxidase reaction is not specific for
   Rauwolfia cells whereas the reductase is present exclusively in
   Rauwolfia cell suspensions. The reductase has been purified to
   homogeneity. The enzyme is highly substrate specific, only accepting
   21-hydroxyraumacline and perakine, the latter leading to raucaffrinoline
   by reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Injuries are a major cause of mortality, morbidity and disability. They
   have been recognized worldwide as a serious public health problem. The
   epidemiology of injuries in Kenya is however poorly documented and
   specific programmes for their surveillance and prevention have not been
   established. This study aimed at examining the incidence and causes of
   trauma, their relationships with demographic characteristics as well as
   hospital utilization. If was sa prospective hospital based survey over a
   three month period in which trauma victims presenting to hospitals
   located within Eldoret town were enrolled, A total of 1304 casualties
   were registered of whom 71\% were males and 29\% females. The most
   vulnerable groups were males and young adults aged between 20 and 30
   years. Exposure during night-time and weekends in addition to alcohol
   intoxication all had a significant influence on the incidence. Assaults
   were the leading cause of injuries being responsible for 40\%. Road
   traffic accidents (RTAs) accounted for 18\%, falls 17\%, burns 3\% and
   dog bites 3\%. 16.5\% of the victims aged above 15 years, who were
   examined within 12 hours of injury had taken alcohol, 25\% of the
   assault victims were alcohol related while this was 10\% amongst road
   traffic casualties. Passengers in public transport vehicles were most
   involved in RTAs. They comprised 56\% whereas bicyclists, pedestrians
   and drivers accounted for 15\%,14\%,8\% respectively. 80\% of the
   casualties were treated as outpatients while 20\% were admitted. The
   mean length of stay was seven days, Twelve patients died. The use of
   operating theatres was required in only eleven cases, while X-rays were
   indicated in nearly one third of the victims. The implications of these
   findings, with regard to the formulation of injury prevention strategies
   are discussed.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Previous sediment studies in the surf zone typically have computed
   suspended sediment flux profiles by pairing a single current meter
   measurement at an elevation of 20 cm or more with measurements of
   suspended sediment concentration from sensor arrays located at 4-50 cm
   elevation. This note reports the results of a field experiment in which
   small impeller current meters were paired with OBS sensors at common
   elevations of 4, 9 and 19 cm from the bed and across the inner surf zone
   to obtain concurrent velocity and concentration profiles. The objectives
   of this experiment were to measure suspended sediment flux profiles
   within 20 cm of the seabed to determine the magnitude of flux very close
   to the seabed in comparison to measurements at higher elevation; and to
   evaluate the errors associated with estimating sediment flux using
   current meter measurements at only one elevation compared to flux
   estimates based on velocity profile measurements. Results show that the
   total sediment flux at z = 4 cm was greater than the flux higher in the
   water column (z = 9 and 19 cm) by a factor of at least 2. The flux
   profiles computed using a single impeller current meter at z = 19 cm and
   OBS sensors at z = 4, 9 and 19 cm typically were between 0.5 and 2.0
   times the flux profiles computed using paired instruments. In one case
   the estimate of flux direction from the single current meter data
   predicted transport in the wrong cross-shore direction. These results
   highlight the importance of nearbed measurements of concentration and
   velocity in estimating sediment transport in the surf zone.}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent PTH increases trabecular bone mass in vive by stimulating
   osteoblast differentiation to increase bone formation, The molecular
   events that mediate the anabolic effect of PTH on osteoblasts have not
   been characterized. We investigated if PTH regulated mRNA expression of
   protooncogenes, c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, early response genes that have
   been shown to be involved in the regulation of both cell proliferation
   and differentiation, As PTH also regulates the early expression of the
   cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in bone cells in vitro, we also
   investigated if this occurred in vive, in concert with the other early
   response genes, Northern blot hybridization was used to analyze mRNA
   expression in the metaphysis of the distal femur of young rats, To
   determine the proliferative state in these femurs, mRNA expression of
   the cell proliferation marker histone, H4, was assessed, subcutaneous
   administration of a single injection of human PTH (1-34) at 8 mu g/100g,
   a dose known to increase bone forming surfaces, induced rapid and
   transient expression of c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and IL-6 mRNA. A second
   novel transcript for IL-6 was detected, but its significance remains
   unknown, Induction of all these messages was evident by 1 h; the levels
   of mRNA returned to baseline after 3-6 h, Concurrently, PTH had a small
   inhibitory effect on the expression of histone H4 mRNA, We conclude

Abstract = {{The diurnal courses of CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance in
   spring were determined in trees of Prosopis chilensis growing in
   Quebrada San Carlos, Vicuna, 4th Region, Chile. These two parameters
   along with proline content, and the expression of free and conjugated
   ubiquitin and the heat shock protein (HSP) M(r) 70 K were determined at
   the same time intervals in the leaves of six-month-old plants acclimated
   in a growth chamber with similar conditions to those of Quebrada San
   Carlos. The expression of the HSPs was studied by Western and immune dot
   blot analyses using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies generated
   against these types of proteins. The CO2 assimilation of
   northwest-facing trees and plants under simulated conditions showed a
   bimodal response with maxima at 12.00 and 18.00 hr, when the temperature
   was 25 degrees and the relative humidities were 35 and 33\%,
   respectively; the minimum was around 15.00 hr with a temperature of 35
   degrees and a relative humidity of 32\%. The low CO2 assimilation at 35
   degrees was not correlated with stomatal closure, but rather with a
   nyctinastic movement of leaf and foliole petioles, which greatly
   decreased the foliar area. After 18.00 hr, CO2 assimilation declined to
   become zero or negative at 21.00 hr. Proline, the expression of M(r) 70
   K and conjugated ubiquitin also reached a maximum at 35 degrees. The
   expression of free ubiquitin showed the reverse pattern being high at
   night, early in the morning and late in the evening. The physiological
   implications of these responses to temperature stress are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: An in vivo tumor model for the study of human urothelial
   carcinoma is desirable. Orthotopic xenografts are useful in order to
   better approximate human tumor cell behavior in situ. A prior model has
   been described in the nude mouse. However, its small bladder size limits
   both histologic characterization and the application of intravesical
   therapeutics. In the absence of preirradiation, orthotopic xenografts of
   human transitional cell carcinoma in the nude rat has not been
   previously reported.
   Materials and Methods: Nude rats 2 to 4 weeks of age were inoculated
   with 1-5 x 10(6) cells of RT4 (well differentiated papillary human
   bladder tumor cell line). Inoculation was performed via open cystotomy.
   Techniques of mucosal injury including acid treatment and cautery were
   explored in an effort to optimize tumor implantation and growth. Animals
   were sacrificed at varying intervals and histologic assessment was
   performed.
   Results: The overall rate of tumor implantation and growth was 93.4\%
   (57 of 61). Tumors reliably grew within the muscularis and mucosal
   growth was seen as well. Intramuscular tumor growth was less
   differentiated and had a higher fraction of mitotic cells than mucosal
   tumor. Tumor growth was consistently seen as early as 2 weeks after
   inoculation which facilitates experimental trials. Distant metastasis
   was not observed. Mucosal injury did not increase the rate of tumor
   implantation.
   Conclusion: This model is highly reproducible and will prove useful in
   the further study of bladder cancer progression as well as in the
   development of therapeutic modalities for both superficial and muscle
   invasive bladder carcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial resistance is more widespread than can be accounted for as
   being a consequence of the selection pressure caused by the use of
   antibiotics alone. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a high
   mercury content in feces might select for mercury-resistant bacteria and
   thus for antimicrobial resistance linked to mercury resistance, Three
   subject groups with different exposures to dental amalgam fillings were
   compared. None of the subjects had taken antimicrobial agents during the
   three preceding months or longer. The group exposed to dental amalgam (n
   = 99) had 13 times more mercury in feces than the group that had never
   been exposed to amalgam (n = 43) and the group whose amalgam fillings
   had been removed (n = 56). No significant differences in either mercury
   resistance or antibiotic resistance in the fecal aerobic gramnegative
   flora of these subject groups were seen. The following antimicrobial
   resistance frequencies were detected with a replica plating method:
   greater than or equal to 1\% resistance was seen in 40\% of the subjects
   for ampicillin, 14\% of the subjects for cefuroxime, 6\% of the subjects
   for nalidixic acid, 14\% of the subjects for trimethoprim, 19\% of the
   subjects for sulfamethoxazole, and 25\% of the subjects for
   tetracycline. The amount of mercury in feces derived from amalgam was
   not selective for any resistance factors in aerobic gram-negative
   bacteria, but antimicrobial resistance was widespread even among healthy
   subjects with no recent exposure to antibiotics.}},

Abstract = {{Human neutrophils, plated on fibronectin-coated polystyrene wells, were
   found to exhibit a prolonged production of superoxide anion (O-2(-)) in
   response to tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). The TNF-triggered O-2(-)
   production was significantly reduced by 10 mu M prostaglandin E(2)
   (PGE(2)), which was ineffective at lower doses. Moreover, the O-2(-)
   production was slightly reduced by the phosphodiesterase type TV (PDE
   TV) inhibitor RO 20-1724, When PGE(2) and RO 20-1724 were added together
   to TNF-triggered neutrophils they caused a marked synergistic inhibition
   of O-2(-) production. The action of PGE(2) could be mimicked by
   forskolin (FK), a well-known direct activator of adenylate cyclase.
   These results suggest that cyclic AMP (cAMP)-elevating agents (PGE(2),
   PK, RO 20-1724) down-regulate the capacity of adherent neutrophils to
   mount the respiratory burst in response to TNF. Consistent with this
   interpretation, PGE(2) and RO 20-1724 increased the intracellular levels
   of cAMP displaying synergistic activity. Moreover, the
   membrane-permeable analogue of cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP, was found to
   inhibit the TNP-induced O-2(-) production in a dose-dependent manner. As
   all the aforementioned cAMP-elevating agents did not affect the O-2(-)
   production in response to phorbol myristate acetate, they appear to act
   by interfering with the assembly of the O-2(-)-generating NADPH oxidase
   complex rather than by directly inhibiting the activity of already
   working oxidase complex, In conclusion, taking into account the TNF
   capacity to promote PGE(2) formation at sites;If inflammation, our
   observations suggest the existence of a negative PGE(2)-dependent
   feed-back, potentially capable of controlling the neutrophil response to
   TNF and susceptible to amplification by PDE IV-inhibiting compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The thyroglossal duct cysts originate from thyroglossal duct involution
   default. The case record of 17 patients admitted for that disease in the
   ORL department of the national hospital of Ouagadougou during those past
   7 years, is reviewed. They represent 1,5 \% of patients operated in this
   department during the same period, all diseases concerned. In the
   present report, the thyroglossal duct cysts are essentially observed in
   children under 10 years old (13/17 patients). In most of the cases
   (12/17), our patients have needed medical advice for an anterior
   cervical tumefaction 7 years after the first symptoms.
   Between clinical and paraclinical findings we give preference to the
   first ones that can avoid, in most of-the cases, a lot of complementary
   tests which are of limited interest and too expensive in our countries.
   In the therapeutic field, the Sistrunk technic has been recognized since
   1920 as the best method. Our patients who have been operated according
   to that technic have no tendency to relapse.}},

Abstract = {{My central argument in this article is that the pueblo de indios of
   18th-century central Mexican highlands should be seen as the
   continuation of pre-Hispanic indigenous landed estates. The pueblos were
   highly stratified entities and were ruled by a small elite of families,
   usually referred to as caciques. The local level elite either traced
   descent from the pre-Hispanic nobility or had taken the place of that
   nobility by acquiring parts of early post-conquest grants in which
   pre-Hispanic demesnes were recognized. Consequently, Spanish
   institutions might have changed the from but not the basic substance oi
   indigenous forms of lordship.}},

Abstract = {{Administration of glucocorticoids decreases the release of
   corticotropin-releasing hormone and in vitro turnover of norepinephrine
   (NE) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and
   immobilization (IMMO) markedly increases NE release and stimulates
   corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the PVN. This study assessed
   whether hypercortisolemia affects in vivo indexes of catecholaminergic
   activation in the PVN. Microdialysis was used to simultaneously measure
   PVN microdialysate concentrations of NE, the neuronal NE metabolite
   dihydroxyphenylglycol, the extraneuronal NE metabolite
   methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol, and the dopamine metabolite
   dihydroxyphenylacetic acid before, during, and after 2 h of IMMO.
   Catecholamine synthesis was examined based on elevations of
   3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine levels after local perfusion with NSD-1015,
   an inhibitor of L-aromatic acid decarboxylase. Cortisol (CORT; 25 mg/kg
   . day) or vehicle (VEH; saline) was infused sc for 7 days via an osmotic
   minipump. CORT-treated rats had lower basal NE, dihydroxyphenylglycol,
   methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels and
   significantly smaller levels of all these compounds during IMMO than
   VEH-treated rats. CORT-treated rats also had less NSD-1015-induced
   accumulation of microdialysate 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine at baseline
   and during IMMO than VEH-treated rats. Basal and IMMO-induced plasma
   ACTH and corticosterone responses were reduced in CORT-treated rats.
   The results indicate that chronic hypercortisolemia decreases basal
   levels and stress-induced increments in indexes of release, metabolism,
   turnover, and synthesis of catecholamines in the PVN and suggest
   that-glucocorticoids restrain the limit of
   hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activation during stress by
   attenuating catecholamine synthesis and release in the PVN.}},
