Abstract = {{Aging dynamics have been investigated in glassy states of poly(methyl
   methacrylate) using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy and temperature
   modulated differential scanning calorimetry. Both the dielectric
   constant and the heat capacity were found to decrease with increasing
   aging time during an isothermal aging process at a given temperature
   below the glass transition temperature. The aging at a temperature for a
   few hours after an intermittent stop of the cooling process is memorized
   as a downward shift of the dielectric constant and the heat capacity.
   The memory of the thermal history is recalled as a minimum in the
   dielectric constant and the heat capacity during the subsequent heating
   process. A temperature cycling measurement on the dielectric constant
   clearly shows that there are rejuvenation and memory effects in the
   aging dynamics. The observed results are discussed on the basis of a
   hierarchical model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We recently demonstrated that standard fixed-time lattice random-walk
   models cannot be modified to represent properly the biased diffusion
   processes in more than two dimensions. The origin of this fundamental
   limitation appears to be the fact that traditional Monte Carlo moves do
   not allow for simultaneous jumps along each spatial direction. We thus
   propose a new algorithm to transform biased diffusion problems into
   lattice random walks such that we recover the proper dynamics for any
   number of spatial dimensions and for arbitrary values of the external
   field. Using a hypercubic lattice, we redefine the basic Monte Carlo
   moves, including the transition probabilities and the corresponding time
   durations, in order to allow simultaneous jumps along all Cartesian
   axes. We show that our new algorithm can be used both with computer
   simulations and with exact numerical methods to obtain the mean velocity
   and the diffusion coefficient of point-like particles in my dimension
   and in the presence of obstacles. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   dewetting films: (i) mass exchange leading to collapse of individual

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests an important role for corticotropin-releasing
   hormone (CRH) and CRH receptors in cocaine reinforcement. CRH receptor
   antagonists reduce cocaine self-administration and attenuate the
   reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior, but little is
   known about the mechanisms involved. One possible mechanism for these
   effects may involve the cocaine-induced activation of CRH located in
   brain regions outside of the hypothalamus. CRH has been shown to
   increase dopaminergic transmission in regions relevant for cocaine
   reinforcement, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus
   accumbens. Here, we report that CP-154,526, a CRH1-receptor antagonist,
   actually enhances cocaine-induced increases in dopamine overflow in the
   medial prefrontal cortex, measured using in vivo microdialysis. In
   contrast, the receptor antagonist did not alter cocaine-induced
   increases in dopamine in most of the nucleus accumbens, except for the
   most rostral part. These data suggest a surprising role for prefrontal
   cortex dopamine in the ability of CRH-receptor antagonists to attenuate
   cocaine seeking in rats.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersion polymerization has been successfully applied to synthesize

   distinctive emission spectra with peaks at 580 and 650 nm for SiOEP and
   PtOEP, respectively. While the emission of SiOEP exhibited no response
   to oxygen, the luminescence intensity of PtOEP was monotonically
   dependent on the concentration of oxygen. From the Stern-Volmer plot, we
   observed a linear correlation between the intensity ratio of SiOEP at
   580 nm to PtOEP at 650 nm and the concentration of oxygen, which could
   be used to reliably monitor the partial pressure of oxygen in a system.

Abstract = {{The conformation of the six-membered ring of pyranosyl sugars has
   pronounced effects on the physical and chemical properties of
   carbohydrates. We present a method to determine key features of the
   potential energy surfaces, such as transition states associated with the
   inversion pathways of the model compounds cyclohexane, tetrahydropyran,
   p-dioxane, m-dioxane, s-trioxane, and 2-oxanol. Finally, we make the
   first determination of the pathways for inversion of
   penta-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranose and
   penta-O-methyl-beta-D-glucopyranose. For both anomers, a transition
   state with five coplanar atoms with appreciable E-O character was found.
   The method is based on constrained Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular
   dynamics, as implemented in the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method.
   The constraints are derived from the normal modes of six-membered rings
   and are described in terms of the canonical conformations (1)C4 chair,
   B-1,B-4 boat, and S-O(2) skew-boat. The PAW derived trajectories are in
   agreement with previous suggestions in the literature that
   pseudorotation is an important feature of such conformational
   interconversions. The dynamic nature as well as the internal
   coordinate-based constraints provide a method which can reliably
   accommodate pseudorotation. To determine semi quantitative energies, we
   recalculate key conformations using standard quantum mechanical
   calculations while keeping the ring dihedral angles frozen at their
   values found in the dynamics. In all cases where experimental barriers
   are known, our results are in excellent agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Surveillance for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in the
   United States has become a focus of public health attention due to
   concerns about disease acquired through exposure to transmissible
   spongiform encephalopathy in other species. A definitive diagnosis
   requires neuropathologic examination, yet concerns about the
   invasiveness of procedures and infection control may be barriers to
   brain biopsy or autopsy in patients with suspected CJD.
   Methods. We reviewed medical records of 50 of the 97 patients identified
   through the Massachusetts Department of Public Health CJD surveillance
   system for 1991 - 2001 and of an additional 21 patients in whom CJD was
   suspected but later ruled out.
   Results. Of the 50 patients, brain biopsy was performed on 14 (28\%),
   brain biopsy or autopsy was performed on 27 (54\%), and brain biopsy and
   autopsy were performed on 4 (8\%). Brain biopsy or autopsy was declined
   for an additional 7 patients (14\%) by family or health care proxy. The
   proportion of patients on whom brain biopsy was performed was inversely
   correlated with age, with only 9 (21\%) of the 43 patients 160 years old
   having brain tissue diagnosis. Brain biopsy was performed on patients in
   whom CJD was suspected but ruled out somewhat less often than it was for
   patients with confirmed CJD (4 {[}19\%] of 21 patients vs. 7 {[}23\%] of
   30 patients, respectively; P = .71).
   Conclusion. The majority of patients with CJD-related death whose
   medical records were available had a brain biopsy or autopsy performed
   or requested (34 {[}68\%] of 50 patients).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLIMATE}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{3777-3795}},

Abstract = {{The characteristic features of the boreal summer intraseasonal
   oscillation (BSISO) during its reinitiation period are studied using
   NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. Based on these observations and with the aid of an
   anomalous atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM), a possible
   mechanism responsible for the BSISO reinitiation is elucidated. The
   western equatorial Indian Ocean along the eastern African coast tends to
   be a key region for the phase transition of the BSISO from an enhanced
   to suppressed convective phase, or vise versa. The major precursory
   feature associated with reinitiation of suppressed convection is found
   in the divergence and reduced specific humidity in the boundary layer.
   Numerical experiments indicate that the low-level divergence is caused
   by the cold horizontal temperature advection and associated adiabatic
   warming (descending motion) in situ. The summer mean state is found to
   be important for the cold horizontal temperature advection through the
   modulation of a Gill-type response to an intraseasonal oscillation (ISO)
   heating in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. The results in this
   study suggest a self-sustained paradigm in the Indian Ocean for the
   BSISO; that is, the BSISO could be a basinwide phenomenon instead of a
   global circumstance system as hypothesized for the boreal winter ISO
   (i.e., the Madden-Julian oscillation).}},

Abstract = {{Protein kinase B (PKB alpha/Akt1) a PI3K-dependent serine-threonine
   kinase, promotes T cell viability in response to many stimuli and
   regulates homeostasis and autoimmune disease in vivo. To dissect the
   mechanisms by which PKB inhibits apoptosis, we have examined the
   pathways downstream of PKB that promote survival after cytokine
   withdrawal vs Fas-mediated death. Our studies show that PKB-mediated
   survival after cytokine withdrawal is independent of protein synthesis
   and the induction of NF-kappa B. In contrast, PKB requires de novo gene
   transcription by NF-kappa B to block apoptosis triggered by the Fas
   death receptor. Using gene-deficient and transgenic mouse models, we
   establish that NF-kappa B1, and not c-Rel, is the critical signaling
   molecule downstream of the PI3K-PTEN-PKB signaling axis that regulates
   lymphocyte homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal phase separation of aqueous triethylamine (TEA) solutions (TEA
   wt \% = 6.5-6.7 in 1120) was induced by irradiating a focused 1064-nm
   laser beam (spot size similar to 1 mu m) under an optical microscope,
   and this produced a single micrometer-sized TFA droplet as demonstrated
   by in situ Raman microspectroscopy. Since H2O absorbs 1064-nm light,
   heat is generated at the focal spot of the incident laser beam, giving
   rise to photothermal phase separation of the aqueous TEA solution. The
   TEA droplet produced by phase separation was trapped simultaneously by
   the incident laser beam. In the presence of p-chlorophenol (CP) in an
   aqueous TFA solution, laser induced photothermal phase separation and
   simultaneous TEA droplet formation brought about
   extraction/concentration of CP from the surrounding solution phase to
   the TEA droplet (similar to 15-mu m diameter and 1.7-pL volume). Raman
   microspectroscopy demonstrated that the distribution coefficient of CP
   (K-D) between the solution phase and the single TFA droplet was
   K-D(drop) = similar to 21, while that in a bulk TEA/H2O system was
   K-D(bulk) = 4.7. The larger K-D(drop) value as compared to K-D(bulk) was
   discussed in terms of radiation pressure exerted on CP in the TEA
   droplet.}},

Title = {{Carriage of CARD15 variants and smoking as risk factors for resective

Abstract = {{Background: It is controversial whether CARD15 variants are truly
   associated with a more severe form of Crohn's disease. The relative role
   of CARD15 genotype and smoking in Crohn's disease progression is also
   debated.
   Aim: To investigate the association between CARD15 variants and history
   of resective surgery in patients with Crohn's ileal disease, taking into
   account smoking as a possible confounding factor.
   Methods: We originally assessed CARD15 genotype in 239 north Italian
   Crohn's disease patients ( mean follow-up: 10.1 +/- 8.1 years). We then
   focused on 193 patients with proven ileal involvement, 70 of whom
   (36.3\%) carried CARD15-mutated alleles (G908R, R702W, L1007fs).
   Results: Carriage of CARD15 variants was positively associated with
   family history and ileal-only disease and negatively associated with
   uncomplicated behaviour at maximal follow-up (P < 0.05). Ileal resection
   was the only variable independently associated with CARD15 variants at
   multivariate analysis (OR 3.8; 95\% CI 1.6-9.2; P=0.003). Kaplan-Meier
   analysis showed that ileal resection was favoured both by CARD15
   variant-carriage (P=0.01) and by smoking (P=0.05), but smoking did not
   affect progression to surgery in variant carriers (P=0.31). Thirteen of
   14 (93\%) patients being resection-free at 15-year follow-up, had CARD15
   wild-type genotype (P=0.01), whereas only seven (50\%) had never smoked
   (P=1.0).
   Conclusions: In summary, CARD15 variant-associated Crohn's ileitis is
   virtually committed to stricturing and/ or penetrating disease and,
   eventually, to resective surgery. Smoking accelerates progression to
   surgery in patients with wild-type CARD15 genotype, but it seems to
   exert no additional effect in CARD15-variant carriers.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at characterizing the interactions between a complex
   peptide mixture and the G-10 membrane (Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN) as
   influenced by pH. It was previously shown that the composition of the
   peptide layer interacting with the G-10 membrane and causing fouling was
   pH-dependent. An adsorption-desorption procedure was used to evaluate
   the effect of pH (5 and 9) and added CaCl2 (0.01 M) on the profile of
   peptides adsorbed onto the G-10 membrane. Modifications of the surface
   properties of the G-10 membrane upon adsorption of tryptic beta-LG
   peptides were also estimated using contact angle measurements. These
   methods demonstrated that the nature of the tryptic peptides contained
   in a beta-LG hydrolysate adsorbing onto the G-10 membrane was influenced
   by the pH and the presence of Ca2+ ions. The selective influence of the
   pH was attributed to changes in the ionization state of the membrane. At
   pH 9, mostly basic (positive) peptides were able to interact with the
   membrane while at pH 5 no direct correlation with the pI of the peptides
   was obtained. Hydrophobic interactions were shown to be involved in the
   adsorption as evidenced with sequence beta-LG 15-20. This peptide is
   thought to play a key role in the build-up of the fouling layer,
   determining the resulting sieving properties of the G-10 membrane during

Abstract = {{Proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are
   critical positive regulators of neuronal differentiation in a variety of
   species and are required for proper differentiation of various subtypes
   of neurons. Although bHLH factors demonstrate some unique functions
   during neural development, they share the ability to regulate neuronal
   differentiation, potentially by targeting overlapping sets of genes. To
   assess this, we performed a screen in ectoderm animal cap tissue to
   identify direct transcriptional targets shared by two Xenopus
   ato-related bHLH factors, Xath5 and X-NeuroD. Candidate target genes
   identified in this screen include several transcriptional regulators
   (Xebf2, Xebf3, XETOR and NKL), an RNA binding protein (e1rC), a cell
   cycle component (Xgadd45 gamma) and several novel genes. Overexpression
   of either Xath5 or XNeuroD induced ectopic in vivo expression of these
   candidate target genes. Conversely, blocking ato-related bHLH activity
   prevented endogenous nervous system expression of these genes.
   Therefore, we have identified a set of genes that can be regulated by
   multiple ato-related bHLH factors and may function as critical effectors
   of proneural bHLH-mediated differentiation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Thin NiAl bicrystals 5 mm in diameter and 150-350 mu m thick were tested
   under laser-induced shock compression to evaluate the material behavior
   and the effect of localized strain at the grain boundary on the failure
   of these specimens. Circular NiAl bicrystal samples with random
   misorientation were grown using a modified Czochralski technique and
   samples were prepared for shock compression at moderate pressures (< 10
   GPa). The observed crack patterns on the drive surface as well as the
   free surface were examined using optical microscopy. Transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) of the drive surface as well as in the bulk of
   one grain was performed on recovered specimens following shock
   compression. This revealed that a nanocrystalline region with a grain
   size of 15-20 nm formed on a thin layer at the drive surface following
   the plasma expansion phase of the laser-induced shock. TEM in the bulk
   of one grain showed that plastic deformation occurred in a periodic
   fashion through propagation of dislocation clusters. Cracking on the
   free surface of the samples revealed a clear grain boundary affected
   zone (GBAZ) due to scattering of the shock wave and variations in wave
   speed across the inclined boundary. Damage tended to accumulate in the
   grain into which the elastic wave refracted. This damage accumulation
   corresponds well to the regions in which the transmitted waves impinged
   on the free surface as predicted by elastic scattering models. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{By means of double immunohistofluorescence techniques, we have
   investigated the colocalization of nitric oxide synthase and tyrosine
   hydroxylase (TH) or serotonin (5-HT) in the central nervous system of
   the anurans Rana perezi and Xenopus laevis and the urodele Pleurodeles
   waltl. A wide codistribution of neuronal populations, expressing these
   markers, was found throughout the brain and spinal cord. In contrast,
   colocalization of these markers was rather restricted. Only in the
   caudal portion of the brainstem raphe column in anurans, approximately
   80\% of the 5-HT-positive cells were also NOS-immunoreactive, whereas in
   the urodele brain, about 40\% of the serotonergic cells at the level of
   the glossopharyngeal motor nucleus were simultaneously NOS-positive. In
   various brain regions, a wide codistribution of NOS- and TH-containing
   neurons was observed, but real colocalization of nitreigic and
   catecholaminergic cells was only found in a small neuron population in
   the posterior tubercle of anuran amphibians. Therefore, in amphibians,
   only a distinct and small cell population within the serotonergic raphe
   column (anurans and urodele) and in the catecholaminergic posterior
   tubercle (anurans) seem to produce simultaneously nitric oxide. (c) 2005

Title = {{Immune sensitization of equine bronchus: glutathione, IL-1 beta
   expression and tissue responsiveness}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Increasing clinical epidemiological and experimental
   evidence indicates that excess of production of reactive oxygen free
   radicals (ROS) induced by an oxidative stress is involved in the
   pathogenesis of a number of human airway disorders, as well as equine
   recurrent airway obstruction. Free-radicals modulate the activation of
   transcription factors, such as nuclear factor( NF)-kappa B and activator
   protein (AP)-1, in several different cells. This activation leads to
   expression of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin
   (IL)-1 beta. We have hypothesized that equine airway sensitization might
   induce an oxidative stress and increase the ROS production, which in
   turn might enhance a production of IL-1 beta and airway
   hyperresponsiveness.
   Methods: We have examined the effect of passive sensitization on IL-1
   beta mRNA expression and electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced
   contraction in equine isolated bronchi, and the potential interference
   of reduced-glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant, with these responses.
   Bronchi passively sensitized with serum from animals suffering from
   heaves and having high total level of IgE, and control tissues, either
   pretreated or not with GSH ( 100 mu M), were used to quantify IL-1 beta
   mRNA. Other tissues were used to study the effect of EFS ( 3 - 10 - 25
   Hz).
   Results: Mean IL-1 beta mRNA expression was higher in passively
   sensitized than in control rings. GSH significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced
   the IL-1 beta mRNA expression only in passively sensitized bronchi. ELF
   induced a frequency-dependent contraction in both non-sensitized and
   passively sensitized tissues, with a significantly greater response
   always observed in sensitized tissues. GSH did not modify the
   EFS-induced contraction in non-sensitized bronchi, but significantly ( p
   < 0.05) decreased it in passively sensitized tissues.
   Conclusion: Our data indicate that the passive sensitization of equine
   bronchi induces inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. These effects
   might be due to an oxidative stress because a pretreatment with GSH
   decreased the increased IL-1 beta mRNA expression and responsiveness to
   EFS of passively sensitized bronchi.}},

   metronidazole benzoate (MB), diloxanide furoate (DF), methyl paraben
   (MPn) and propyl paraben (PPn) in suspension. The cis/trans
   isomerization phenomenon for DF has also been presented. The method uses
   as stationary phase a Supelco LC-18 DB (15 cm x 4.6 mm) 5 mu m column
   and as a mobile phase a buffer-acetonitrile mixture (70:30, v/v)
   adjusted to pH of 2.5 at a flow rate of 2.0 mL min(-1). The buffer is a
   0.005 M KH2PO4 solution. The four analytes were well resolved from the
   degraded solutions peaks. The excepients present in the formulation do
   not interfere with the assay procedure. The linearity range (n = 3) is
   (0.20130-1.20779 mg mL(-1)) for MB with R of 0.99985; (0. 15790-0.94740
   mg mL(-1)) for DF with R of 0.99987; (0.01131-0.06788 mg mL(-1)) for MPn
   with R of 0.99987 and (0.00 126-0.00756 mg mL(-1)) for PPn with R of
   0.99991. Precision (n = 6) was 0.87\% for MB; 1.15\% for DF; 1.32\% for
   MPn and 1.27\% for PPn. The percentage recoveries (n = 3) were 99.1\%
   for MB; 99.6\% for DF; 99.1 \% for MPn and 98.7\% for PPn. The proposed
   method can be utilized for the routine analysis of the four analytes in

Abstract = {{High silica mordenite samples (Si/Al molar ratios 38 and 60) were
   synthesized hydrothermally at 433 K with the template route method using
   o-phenylenediamine and characterized with several techniques including
   XRD, FT-IR, TG/DTA, pyridine-FTIR and N-2 adsorption. The effects of
   Na2O/SiO2 ratio, Si/Al ratio, temperature, crystallization time and
   various templates on mordenite crystallization as well as crystallite
   size that was smaller than 50 nm, irrespective of varying the parameters
   were thoroughly investigated. The effect of alkali cations such as Na+
   and K+ on mordenite crystallization and on thermal stability of the
   produced mordenite was also investigated. Pyridine adsorption suggests
   an increase in Lewis acid sites particularly following hydrothermal
   treatment at 120 degrees C where at 160 degrees C both Lewis and
   Bronsted acid sites in addition to oxidation products, which are
   indicative of the existence of dual acid-base sites, were exposed.
   Surface texturing of the produced samples were correlated with their

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2005}},

Pages = {{3713-3725}},

Abstract = {{The high topography of Greenland results in a number of orographically
   induced high wind speed flows along its coast that are of interest from
   both a severe weather and climate perspective. Here the surface wind
   field dataset from the NASA-JPL SeaWinds scatterometer on board the
   Quick Scatterometer (Quik-SCAT) satellite is used to develop a
   wintertime climatology of these flows. The high spatial resolution and
   the twice-daily sampling of the SeaWinds instrument allows for a much
   more detailed view of the surface winds around Greenland than has been
   previously possible. Three phenomena stand out as the most distinctive
   features of the surface wind field during the winter months: the
   previously identified tip jets and reverse tip jets, as well as the
   hitherto unrecognized barrier flows along its southeast coast in the
   vicinity of the Denmark Strait. Peak surface wind speeds associated with
   these phenomena can be as large as 50 m s(-1) with winds over 25 m s(-1)
   occurring approximately 10\%-15\% of the time at each location.
   A compositing technique is used to show that each type of flow is the
   result of an interaction between a synoptic-scale parent cyclone and the
   high topography of Greenland. In keeping with previous work, it is
   argued that tip jets are caused by a combination of conservation of the
   Bernoulli function during orographic descent and acceleration due to
   flow splitting as stable air passes around Cape Farewell, while barrier
   winds are a geostrophic response to stable air being forced against high
   topography. It is proposed that reverse tip jets occur when barrier
   winds reach the end of the topographic barrier and move from a
   geostrophic to a gradient wind balance, becoming supergeostrophic as a
   result of their anticyclonic curvature.}},

Abstract = {{Bronchial dehiscence after lung transplantation is difficult to treat
   and associated with high mortality. We describe our experience using
   self-expanding metallic stents to treat post-lung transplant bronchial
   dehiscence. From January 1995 to June 2004, 189 single and 118 double
   lung transplants were performed in our institution, totaling 425 at-risk
   bronchial anastomoses. Seven (1.6\%) incidents of life-threatening
   bronchial dehiscence were treated with self-expanding metallic stents.
   The interval between transplant and diagnosis of dehiscence was 29.1 +/-
   18.5 days. All patients presented with respiratory distress, and three
   required mechanical ventilation. Self-expanding metallic stent placement
   resulted in complete bronchial healing. All three patients with
   respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation were successfully
   weaned after stent placement. In two later cases, the stents were
   electively removed after adequate healing of the dehiscence.
   Complications included stent migration (one patient) and in-stent
   stenosis (three patients). Two of these patients required repeat stent
   insertion after removal, due to bronchomalacia. In patients with
   life-threatening bronchial dehiscence, self-expanding metallic stents
   offer prospects for a successful outcome. Self-expanding metallic stents
   are known to be associated with significant granulation tissue
   formation, and this property provides a platform for healing of
   dehiscence and, in time, peribronchial soft tissue grows in to cover the
   defect, allowing stent removal.}},

Abstract = {{Adapt78 (DSCR1/calcipressin/MCM) is a potent natural inhibitor of
   calcineurin, an important intracellular phosphatase that mediates many
   cellular responses to calcium. We previously reported two major
   cytosolic isoforms (I and 4) of Adapt78, and that isoform 4 is an
   oxidative and calcium stress-response protein. Using a higher cell
   culture density and new antibody, we again observed that both major
   isoforms localized to the cytosol, but a significant level of isoform 4
   (but not isoform 1) was also detected in the nucleus where it was
   present in the nonsoluble region and not associated with RNA. Exposure
   of cells to hydrogen peroxide led to the significant loss of isoform 4
   from the nucleus with a moderate increase in cytosolic localization. The
   change in isoform 4 phosphorylation state in response to oxidative
   stress, characterized by a loss of the lesser (hypo) phosphorylated
   Adapt78, was not due to accelerated degradation, although general
   Adapt78 degradation was proteosome mediated. Finally, stimulation of
   Jurkat and primary T-lymphocyte signaling led to isoform 4 induction.
   This induction was BAPTA, diphenylene iodonium, and N-acetylcysteine
   inhibitable, and accompanied by induction of the classic immune response
   mediator and calcineurin-pathway-stimulated interleukin-2. These studies
   reveal new redox-related activities for Adapt78 isoform 4, which may
   contribute to its known calcineurin-regulating and cytoprotective
   activities, and further suggest that Adapt78 plays a role in basic
   T-cell response, (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented for the preparation of silica-based alkylsilane
   stationary phases using octanol as a displaceable surface template to
   control the rate of alkylsilane condensation with the silica surface,
   and thereby, the resulting alkylsilane surface coverage. This method
   improves upon conventional preparation schemes by allowing alkylsilane
   stationary phases of systematically varying surface coverage to be
   prepared from a single reaction mixture and a single precursor molecule
   without rigorous control of water content of the solution or of the
   silica. Octadecylsilane stationary phases ranging in surface coverage
   from similar to 3.5 to 6.0 mu mol/m(2) were synthesized using one set of
   experimental conditions with variation of only the
   octadecylsilane/octanol ratio. The conformational order of the
   octadecylsilane alkyl chains was assessed using Raman spectroscopy and
   was found to increase with increasing surface coverage in a manner
   similar to stationary phases prepared by conventional routes. As
   chromatographic stationary phases in microbore columns for the
   reversed-phase separation of monosubstituted aromatic compounds, the
   performance of these materials is comparable to or better than that of
   commercially available octadecylsilane stationary phases under identical
   chromatographic conditions. Furthermore, the high-density stationary
   phases (> 3.5 mu mol/m(2)) prepared by this route exhibit geometric
   shape selectivity comparable to or better than that reported earlier for
   high density octadecylsilane stationary phases prepared using
   conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{In mucopolysacchariclosis-1 (MPS-1), alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency
   leads to progressive heparan sulfate (HS) and dermatan sulfate (DS)
   glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation. The functional consequences of
   these accumulated molecules are unknown. HS critically influences tissue
   morphogenesis by binding to and modulating the activity, of several
   cytokines (eg, fibroblast. growth factors {[}FGFs]) involved in
   developmental patterning. We recently isolated a multipotent progenitor
   cell from postnatal human bone marrow, which differentiates into cells
   of all 3 embryonic lineages. The availability; of multipotent progenitor
   cells from healthy volunteers and patients with MPS-I (Hurler syndrome)
   provides a unique opportunity to directly examine the functional effects
   of abnormal HS on cytokine-mediated stem-cell Proliferation and
   survival. We demonstrate here that abnormally I sulfated HS in Hurler
   multipotent progenitor cells perturb critical FGF-2-FGFR1-HS
   interactions, resulting in defective FGF-2-induced proliferation and
   survival of Hurler multipotent progenitor cells. Both the mitogenic and
   survival-promoting activities of FGF-2 were restored by substitution of
   Hurler HS by normal HS. This perturbation of critical HS-cytokine
   receptor interactions may represent a mechanism. by which accumulated HS
   contributes to the developmental pathophysiology of Hurler syndrome.
   Similar mechanisms may operate in the pathogenesis of other diseases
   where structurally, abnormal GAGs accumulate.}},

Abstract = {{By using the single molecule detection (SMD) technique based on laser
   scanning fluorescence microscopy, we have developed a method to count
   the number of labeled fluorophores in a single biomolecule. The number
   of labeled fluorophores in an individual molecule was measured by
   counting the number of discrete level jumps in the
   fluorescence-intensity transients, or Gaussian fitting of the
   fluorescence-intensity histogram. The instabilities of intensity
   transients due to humid environments of biomolecules were minimized by
   optimizing the matrix materials and sample-preparation condition and
   adding a strong triplet quencher, AET (2-aminoethanethiol). After
   validating the counting method and estimating the counting uncertainties
   through observations of a well-defined number of fluorophores, the
   distribution of the number of incorporated fluorophores in a DNA strand
   was observed. The advantages in biological analysis by using a
   single-molecule fluorescence technique have been considered.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the existence of focusing solution to a class of
   porous medium equations taking the form u(t) = Delta u(m) + F(x, u, del

   distribution is in the exterior of a finite domain. That is, there is a
   hole in the support of initial value, and in finite time T the hole
   disappears. We show there exists a focusing solution for a number of
   important models in physics and biology. Such solution is an example of
   a self-similar solution of the second kind. That is, the similarity
   variables cannot be determined a priori from dimensional consideration.
   Furthermore, it serves the purpose of supplying concrete bounds for the
   optimal regularity of general solutions of the equation. The P-Laplacian
   counterpart of this equation is also studied. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Carboplatin is an anticancer drug for the treatment of cancers affecting
   various organs including ovary and testes. It essentially exerts its
   cytotoxicity against cancerous cells via covalent attachment of platinum
   atom to DNA, generating various platinum-DNA adducts. Platinum-DNA
   adducts inhibit biological processes essential for cellular viability.
   However, carboplatin interacts nonspecifically with DNA, resulting in
   damaging of normal cell DNA. Potential in vitro interaction of
   carboplatin with genes encoding tumor suppressor proteins such as human
   breast cancer suppressor gene 1(BRCA1) was herein investigated. The
   696-bp fragment of the 3 `-region of BRCA1 gene (nucleotide 4897-5592)
   was amplified by RT-PCR using mRNA templates isolated from human white
   blood cells. Retardation of the electrophoretic migration on agarose gel
   of drug-treated DNA, in the dose-response manner, was observed. Analysis
   by restriction digestion with PvuII and EcoO1091 suggested that the
   platination favorably occurred at the dGpG sequence of EcoO1091-cleaved
   site. The semi-quantitative PCR-based assay was used to determine the
   lesion frequencies produced by carboplatin in the 696-bp fragment of the
   3 `-region of BRCA1 gene and in the 3,426-bp fragment of the BRCA1 exon
   11 of human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. A significant decrease in
   DNA amplification was observed at 400 mu M of carboplatin with
   approximately 1-2 platinum atoms per BRCA1 fragment. Carboplatin caused
   slightly less damage at equimolar concentrations in cells than in
   cell-free! BRCA1 fragment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Epidermal growth factor receptor-1 (EGFR) and EGFR-2 (HER2) have become
   major targets for cancer treatment. Blocking antibodies and
   small-molecule inhibitors are being used to silence the activity of
   these receptors in different tumors with varying efficacy. Thus, a
   better knowledge on the signaling pathways activated by EGFR and HER2
   may help unravel novel therapeutic targets and molecular markers of
   response. Here, we show that treatment of breast cancer cell lines with
   blocking antibodies against EGFR (cetuximab) or HER2 (trastuzumab)
   promotes the specific induction of proapoptotic Bnip3L and
   chemosensitization. Moreover, we found that the Bnip3L gene is
   transcriptionally activated by FoxO3a. Trastuzumab-mediated induction of
   Bnip3L and nuclear translocation of FoxO3a was also shown in pleural
   effusion cells from a breast cancer patient. Transfection of breast
   cancer cells with constitutively active FoxO3a or with Bnip3L promotes
   sensitization to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. On the contrary,
   blockade of Bnip3L expression by a small interfering RNA strategy
   significantly diminished the chemosensitizing effect of cetuximab. We
   found also an inverse correlation between EGFR and Bnip3L expression in
   surgical specimens from patients with breast cancer. Therefore,
   blockading EGFR or HER2 specifically up-regulates Bnip3L, which is
   required for chemosensitization of breast cancer cells. This novel
   pathway provides also the rationale for therapeutic strategies aimed to
   induce the expression of Bnip3L.}},

Abstract = {{Although pharmacologic treatments are available for patients with
   schizophrenia, little is known about how prescription patterns of
   atypical antipsychotic agents are related to patient characteristics. In
   this study, we examined the association between patient characteristics
   and the likelihood of being initiated on olanzapine or risperidone, two
   of the most frequently prescribed atypical agents for schizophrenia. We
   selected patients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia or
   schizoaffective disorder based on >= 1 inpatient or >= 2 outpatient
   ICD-9-CM codes (>= 7 days apart) between 7/1/98 and 6/30/99 from the
   Veterans Health Administration (VA). We classified patients into one of
   three types of initiation: (a) not on olanzapine or risperidone, (b) not
   on any atypical agents, or (c) not on any antipsychotic agents for 6
   months, and then subsequently being prescribed the target drugs. Using
   logistic regression, we examined whether the odds ratio of being
   initiated on olanzapine versus risperidone are related to patient
   sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Compared to risperidone
   initiators, olanzapine initiators used more drugs for psychiatric
   conditions (including antiparkinsonian agents, typical antipsychotics,
   and mood stabilizers) than risperidone initiators. On the other hand,
   risperidone initiators had more medical comorbidities and more
   non-psychiatric hospitalizations. Olanzapine and risperidone appear to
   be prescribed to patients with different characteristics. Initiation of
   risperidone was more common among patients who presented with more
   medical comorbid conditions, whereas initiation of olanzapine was more
   common among patient who presented with more mental comorbid conditions.
   Future research needs to determine the reasons for those differences.

Abstract = {{In rat heart mitochondria, auranofin, arsenite, diamide, and BCNU
   increase H2O2 formation, further stimulated by antimycin. However, in
   submitochondrial particles, H2O2 formation and oxygen uptake are not
   affected, indicating that these substances do not alter respiration.
   Mitochondria are also able to rapidly metabolize added H2O2, in a
   process partially prevented by BCNU or auranofin. Calcium does not
   modify the production or H2O2 and the mitochondrial thioredoxin system
   is not affected by calcium ions. Auranofin, arsenite, and diamide
   determine a large mitochondrial permeability transition. while BCNU and
   acetoacetate are ineffective. Thiols and glutathione are modified only
   by BCNU and diamide. However, all the compounds tested cause the release
   of cytochrome c that occurs also in the absence of mitochondrial
   swelling. In conclusion, the compounds utilized share the common feature
   of shifting the mitoclondrial thiol-linked redox balance towards a more
   oxidized condition that is responsible of the observed effects. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Olfactory deficits, observed in schizophrenia, may be associated with a
   disruption of synaptic transmission in the olfactory system. Using
   immunohistochemistry and optical densitometry, we assessed the integrity
   of the synaptic connection between olfactory receptor neurons and
   olfactory bulb target neurons in schizophrenia by comparing the level of
   eight proteins, expressed in the olfactory bulb glomeruli, among
   schizophrenia and control subjects. In schizophrenia, no change was
   observed in the levels of OMP, GAP43 and NCAM, proteins expressed by
   olfactory receptor neurons, suggesting an intact innervation of the
   olfactory bulb by these neurons. This was supported by the absence of
   change in calbindin level, which has been shown to decrease after the
   destruction of the olfactory epithelium. The level of synaptophysin, a
   pre-synaptic protein, was also unchanged. These findings suggested that
   axons of olfactory receptor neurons establish synapses with their
   olfactory bulb targets in schizophrenia. The absence of change in the
   level of poorly phosphorylated neurofilament of moderate and high
   molecular weight (NFM/HP) suggested no lack of dendritic innervation
   despite a previously seen reduction of glomerular MAP2 level in
   schizophrenia subjects. This and above findings were consistent with the
   absence of change in the level of tubulin III, a protein expressed by
   neurons of both olfactory epithelium and bulb. Finally, we noted no
   significant decrease in trkB level, a neurotrophin receptor involved in
   the olfactory epithelium maintenance. This study showed no evidence of
   major structural alteration of the synapse between the olfactory
   epithelium and bulb in schizophrenia. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A newborn male was referred for genetic evaluation because of multiple
   congenital abnormalities. Physical findings included a round face,
   telecanthus, hypertelorism, a short upturned nose with anteverted nares,
   small ears, micrognathia, short toes, and congenital heart disease.
   Chromosome analysis detected a possible deletion of 9qter because of
   satellite material on 9qter. Delineation by FISH and microarray CGH
   studies showed 46,XY,der(9)t(9;22)(q34.3;p11.2). The mother and maternal
   grandfather had a balanced t(9;22) (q34.3;p11.2) rearrangement. Also,
   the maternal great-aunt of the propositus was found to have a
   duplication of 9q34.3 -> qter. FISH was required to delineate her
   karyotype, which was 46,XX.ish der(22)t(9;22)(q34.3;p11.2). This
   maternal great-aunt and one of her daughters (cytogenetics not done)
   have a relatively normal phenotype, only reporting mild learning

   group. The strong increase on hydrophobicity in the presence of the

Abstract = {{Densely grafting copolymers of ethyl cellulose with polystyrene and poly
   (methyl methacrylate) were synthesized through atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP). First, the residual hydroxyl groups on the ethyl
   cellulose reacted with 2-bromoisobutyrylbromide to yield
   2-bromoisobutyryloxy groups, known to be an efficient initiator for ATRR
   Subsequently, the functional ethyl cellulose was used as a
   macroinitiator in the ATRP of methyl methacrylate and styrene in toluene
   in conjunction with CuBr/N,N,N',N `',N `'-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine
   as a catalyst system. The molecular weight of the graft copolymers
   increased without any trace of the macroinitiator, and the
   polydispersity was narrow. The molecular weight of the side chains
   increased with the monomer conversion. A kinetic study indicated that
   the polymerization was first-order. The morphology of the densely
   grafted copolymer in solution was characterized through laser light
   scattering. The individual densely grafted copolymer molecules were
   observed through atomic force microscopy, which confirmed the synthesis

Abstract = {{As bacteria grow and proliferate, they release a variety of volatile
   compounds that can be profiled and used for speciation, providing an
   approach amenable to disease diagnosis through quick analysis of

   alternative to mass spectrometry detection and whole cell pyrolysis
   approaches, we have developed methodology that involves detection via a
   sensitive, micromachined differential mobility spectrometer (microDMx),
   for sampling head-space gases produced by bacteria growing in liquid
   culture. We have applied pattern discovery/recognition algorithms
   (ProteomeQuest) to analyze headspace gas spectra generated by microDMx
   to reliably discern multiple species of bacteria in vitro: Escherichia
   colt, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Mycobacterium
   smegmatis. The overall accuracy for identifying volatile profiles of a
   species within the 95\% confidence interval for the two highest accuracy
   models evolved was between 70.4 and 89.3\% based upon the coordinated
   expression of between 5 and 11 features. These encouraging in vitro
   results suggest that the microDMx technology, coupled with
   bioinformatics data analysis, has potential for diagnosis of bacterial

Abstract = {{This paper reports some significant characteristics of electromagnetic
   radiation (EMR) emitted from commercially pure aluminium strips under
   opening and shearing modes of fracture at elevated temperatures. It is
   observed that elevated temperatures affect only the kHz component
   frequency of EMR, the MHz component in opening mode remains
   uninfluenced. Shearing mode of fracture did not emit any MHz component
   frequency EMR signal. EMR characteristics have been observed to change
   remarkably when aluminium strip is heated to 150 degrees C and above,
   prior to the test, under both opening and shearing modes of fracture.
   Further, the EMR characteristics are in several ways entirely opposite
   in the opening and shearing modes of fracture. These results are
   expected to give an insight into the dislocation kinematics within the
   metallic materials at elevated temperatures. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   same way. but 22:5n-6 was a poor substrate. The products were identified
   by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The missense mutation 374A >
   T of CYP4F8 (Tyr(125)Phe in substrate recognition site-1 (SRS-1)) occurs
   in low frequency. This variant oxidized two PGH(2), analogs. U-51605 and
   U-44069, in analogy with CYP4F8, but 20:4n-6 and 22:5n-6 were not

   The mutant CYP4F8 Gly(328)Glu oxidized U-51605 and U-44069 as

   shifted from C-18 to C-19. Single amino acid Substitutions in SRS-1 and

   conclude that CYP4F8 and CYP4F12 catalyze epoxidation of 22:6n-3:6n-3

Abstract = {{The voltage induced assembly and photoreactivity of cadmium selenide
   (CdSe) nanoparticles protected by mercaptosuccinic acid are studied at
   the polarisable interface between water and 1,2-dichloroethane
   electrolyte solutions. Cyclic voltammograms and admittance measurements
   show an increase of the interface excess charge associated with the
   adsorption of CdSe nanoparticles as the Galvani potential difference is
   tuned to negative values with respect to the potential in the organic
   phase. Within the potential range where the nanoparticles are adsorbed,
   band-gap illumination leads to heterogeneous electron transfer from CdSe
   nanoparticles to electron acceptors located in the organic phase. The
   interfacial Galvani potential difference plays an important role in
   these phenomena, as it affects the interfacial density of the
   nanoparticles, as well as the driving force for the electron transfer.
   The photocurrent efficiency also strongly depends on the formal redox
   potential of the electron acceptor, indicating that the heterogeneous
   photoreaction is kinetically controlled. The interfacial electron
   transfer occurs via depopulation of the deep trap states in the band
   gap. Analysis of the photocurrent transient responses reveals that the
   magnitude of the instantaneous photocurrent upon illumination is
   determined by the kinetics of heterogeneous electron transfer, while
   photogenerated holes are swiftly captured by species present in the
   aqueous phase. The photocurrent decay upon constant illumination is
   associated with the diffusion of the acceptor to the interfacial region.
   From the phenomenological point of view, the photoelectrochemical
   behaviour of CdSe nanoparticles can be compared to a self-assembled
   ultrathin p-type semiconductor photoelectrode. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Purpose: Myeloid suppressor (Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+)) cells accumulate in the
   spleens of tumor-bearing mice where they contribute to immunosuppression
   by inhibiting the function of CD8(+) Tcells and by promoting tumor
   angiogenesis. Elimination of these myeloid suppressor cells may thus
   significantly improve antitumor responses and enhance effects of cancer
   immunotherapy, although to. date few practical options exist.
   Experimental Design: The effect of the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine on
   the number of (Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+)) cells in the spleens of animals bearing
   large tumors derived from five cancer lines grown in both C57BI/6 and
   BALB/c mice was analyzed, Suppressive activity of splenocytes from
   gemcitabine-treated and control animals was measured in natural killer
   (NK) cell lysis and Winn assays. The impact of myeloid suppressor cell
   activity was determined in an immunogene therapy model using an
   adenovirus expressing IFN-beta.
   Results:This study shows that the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine,
   given at a dose similar to the equivalent dose used in patients, was
   able to dramatically and specifically reduce the number of-myeloid
   suppressor cells found in the spleens of animals bearing large tumors
   with no significant reductions in CDC+ T cells, CD8(+) T cells, NK
   cells, macrophages, or B cells. The loss of myeloid suppressor cells was
   accompanied by an increase in the antitumor activity of CD8(+) Tcells
   and activated NK cells. Combining gemcitabine with cytokine immunogene
   therapy using IFN-beta markedly enhanced antitumor efficacy.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that gemcitabine may be a practical
   strategy for the reduction of myeloid suppressor cells and should be
   evaluated in conjunction with a variety of immunotherapy approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Vibrational frequencies for the 7-azaindole and 7-azaindole-water
   complex are calculated by the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF)
   and correlation-corrected VSCF (cc-VSCF) methods using second-order
   perturbation theory (MP2), with the 6-31G(d) basis set, and density
   functional theory with the B3LYP functional and the same basis set. The
   potential energies at quadrature points for VSCF calculations are
   estimated from the quartic force field (QFF) determined by the
   respective electronic structure methods. The comparison with
   experimental fundamentals for 7-azaindole indicates that MP2 gives
   better results for NH and CH stretching modes than B3LYP, while B3LYP
   gives better results for CC stretching and ring deforming modes. The
   vibrational modes for the 7-azaindole-water complex are discussed in
   terms of those of the isolated 7-azaindole and water. This VSCF/QFF

Abstract = {{A new method is proposed for the determination of the stationary
   one-component nucleation rate J with the help of data for the growth
   probability P-2 of a dimer which is the smallest cluster of the
   nucleating phase. The method is based on an exact formula relating J and
   P-2, and is readily applicable to computer simulations of nucleation.
   Using the method, the dependence of J on the supersaturation s is
   determined by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional (2D)
   nucleation of monolayers on the (100) face of Kossel crystal. The change
   of J over nearly 11 orders of magnitude is followed and it is found that
   the classical nucleation theory overestimates the simulation J values by
   an s-dependent factor. The 2D nucleus size evaluated via the nucleation
   theorem is described satisfactorily by the classical Gibbs-Thomson
   equation and its corrected version accounting for the spinodal limit of
   2D nucleation. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Retrospective analysis of patients treated with single and
   dual growing rods who had completed their course of treatment, had
   definitive fusion, and had a minimum of 2 years follow-up.
   Objectives. To determine which technique was the most effective in the
   management of severe spinal deformity in young children: control of the
   spinal deformity, spinal growth, and the incidence of complications.
   Summary of Background Data. Growing rod techniques provide proximal and
   distal segmental ``claw{''} foundations, but their overall results
   through definitive fusion have not been clearly determined.
   Methods. A total of 28 consecutive patients who had growing rod
   procedures followed through definitive spinal fusions were analyzed.
   There were three patient groups: Group 1 (N=5), single submuscular rod
   and short apical fusion; Group 2 (N=16), single growing rod alone; and
   Group 3 (N=7), dual growing rods.
   Results. The interval between initial rod insertion and definitive
   spinal fusion was similar in all three groups. The best overall results
   occurred in Group 3, whereas the patients in Group 1 had the worse
   results. Both Groups 2 and 3 provided good initial correction of the
   spinal deformity and allowed spinal growth. Group 2 had better frontal
   and sagittal plane balance and the lowest complication rate.
   Conclusion. The use of growing rods is effective in controlling severe
   spinal deformities and allowing spinal growth. Dual rods are stronger
   than single rods and, therefore, provide better initial correction and
   maintenance of correction. The use of an apical fusion does not appear
   to be effective over the course of treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Costly disposal of uranium (U) contaminated sediments is motivating
   research on in situ U(VI) reduction to insoluble U(IV) via directly or
   indirectly microbially mediated pathways. Delivery of organic carbon
   (OC) into sediments for stimulating U bioreduction is diffusion-limited
   in less permeable regions of the subsurface. To study OC-based U
   reduction in diffusion-limited regions, one slightly acidic and another
   calcareous sediment were treated with uranyl nitrate, packed into
   columns, then hydrostatically contacted with tryptic soy broth
   solutions. Redox potentials, U oxidation state, and microbial
   communities were well correlated. At average supply rates of 0.9 mu mol
   OC (g sediment)(-1) day(-1), the U reduction zone extended to only about
   35-45 mm into sediments. The underlying unreduced U(VI) zone persisted
   over 600 days because the supply of OC was diffusion-limited and
   metabolized within a short distance. These results also suggest that low
   U concentrations in groundwater samples from OC-treated sediments are
   not necessarily indicative of pervasive U reduction because interior and
   exterior regions of such sediment blocks can contain primarily U(VI) and
   U(IV) respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Hippocampal activity influences neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus;
   however, little is known about the involvement of the hippocampal
   circuitry in this process. In the subgranular zone of the adult dentate
   gyrus, neurogenesis involves a series of differentiation steps from
   radial glia-like stem/progenitor (type-1) cells, to transiently
   amplifying neuronal progenitor (type-2) cells, to postmitotic neurons.
   In this study, we conducted GFP-targeted recordings of progenitor cells
   in fresh hippocampal slices from nestin-GFP mice and found that neuronal
   progenitor (type-2) cells receive active direct neural inputs from the
   hippocampal circuitry. This input was GABAergic but not glutamatergic.
   The GABAergic inputs depolarized type-2 cells because of their elevated
   {[}Cl-](i). This excitation initiated an increase of {[}Ca2+](i) and the
   expression of NeuroD. A BrdU-pulse labeling study with GABA(A)-R
   agonists demonstrated the promotion of neuronal differentiation via this
   GABAergic excitation. Thus, it appears that GABAergic inputs to
   hippocampal progenitor cells promote activity-dependent neuronal
   differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure for the formation of intimate blends of three binary polymer
   systems polycarbonate (PC)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),
   PC/poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and PMMA/PVAc is described. PC/PMMA,
   PC/PVAc, and PMMA/PVAc pairs were included in gamma-cyclodextrin
   (gamma-CD) channels and were then simultaneously coalesced from their
   common gamma-CD inclusion compounds (ICs) to obtain intimately mixed
   blends. The formation of ICs between polymer pairs and gamma-CD were
   confirmed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC). It was observed {[}solution H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)]
   that the ratios of polymers in coalesced PC/ PMMA and PC/PVAc binary
   blends are significantly different than the starting ratios, and PC was
   found to be preferentially included in gamma-CD channels when compared
   with PMMA or PVAc. Physical mixtures of polymer pairs were also prepared
   by coprecipitation and solution casting methods for comparison. DSC,
   solid-state H-1 NMR, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and direct
   insertion probe pyrolysis mass spectrometry (DIP-MS) data indicated that
   the PC/PMMA, PC/PVAc, and PMMA/ PVAc binary polymer blends were
   homogeneously mixed when they were coalesced from their ICs. A single,
   common glass transition temperature (Tg) recorded by DSC heating scans
   strongly suggested the presence of a homogeneous amorphous phase in the
   coalesced binary polymer blends, which is retained after thermal cycling
   to 270 C. The physical mixture samples showed two distinct T-gS and H-1
   T-1 rho values for the polymer components, which indicated
   phase-separated blends with domain sizes above 5 run, while the
   coalesced blends exhibited uniform 1H spin-lattice relaxation values,
   indicating intimate blending in the coalesced samples. The TGA results
   of coalesced and physical binary blends of PC/PMMA and PC/PVAc reveal
   that in the presence of PC, the thermal stability of both PMMA and PVAc
   increases. Yet, the presence of PMMA and PVAc decreases the thermal
   stability of PC itself. DIP-MS observations suggested that the
   degradation mechanisms of the polymers changed in the coalesced blends,
   which was attributed to the presence of molecular interactions between
   the well-mixed polymer components in the coalesced samples. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The transcriptional properties of unliganded thyroid hormone receptors
   are thought to cause the misdevelopment during hypothyroidism of several
   functions essential for adult life. To specifically determine the role
   of unliganded thyroid hormone receptor alpha 1 (TR alpha 1) in neuronal
   tissues, we introduced a mutation into the mouse TR alpha 1 gene that
   lowers affinity to thyroid hormone (TH) 10-fold. The resulting
   heterozygous mice exhibit several distinct neurological abnormalities:
   extreme anxiety, reduced recognition memory, and locomotor dysfunction.
   The anxiety and memory deficiencies were relieved by treatment with high
   levels of TH in adulthood, an effect that correlated with a
   normalization of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampal
   CA1 region. In contrast, a post-natal TH treatment was necessary and
   sufficient for ameliorating the adult locomotor dysfunction. Here, the
   hormone treatment normalized the otherwise delayed cerebellar
   development. The data thus identify two novel and distinct functions of
   an unliganded TR alpha 1 during development and adulthood, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Previous studies have shown that patients with
   Bcr-Abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) either have primary
   disease that is refractory to imatinib mesylate or develop disease
   recurrence after an initial response.
   METHODS. The authors investigated the effects of a newly designed
   Bcr-Abl inhibitor, AMN107, by comparing its in vitro inhibitory potency
   on p190 Bcr-Abl ALL cell lines with that of imatinib.
   RESULTS. In two Philadelphia (Ph)-positive ALL cell lines, AMN107 was
   found to be 30-40 times more potent than imatinib in inhibiting cellular
   proliferation. AMN107 was also more effective than imatinib in
   inhibiting phosphorylation of p190 Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in cell lines
   and primary ALL cells. The inhibition of cellular proliferation was
   associated with the induction of apoptosis in only one of the cell
   lines. No activity was observed in cell lines lacking the BCR-ABL
   genotype.
   CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study suggest the superior
   potency of AMN 107 compared with imatinib in Ph-positive ALL and support
   clinical trials of AMN 107 in patients with Ph-positive ALL.}},

Abstract = {{The diencephalic/midbrain tegmental domain of the developing lamprey was
   characterized by the special features of the ventricular zone and
   distribution of some postmitotic neuronal populations, using
   proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and HNK-1 immunocytochemistry.
   In late prolarvae and early larvae, the tegmental ventricular zone
   differentiated a striking arrangement of thin longitudinal crests with
   strongly PCNA-immunoreactive cells protruding toward the ventricle and
   separated by shallow valleys whose cells were faintly or moderately
   PCNA-immunoreactive. The tegmental ventricular zone was composed of a
   large caudal region located ventral to the pretectum and the midbrain
   tectum, and of a smaller rostral wedge-shaped region that extended
   dorsally between the dorsal and the ventral thalamus, in the last one,
   ventricular crests coursing in the zona limitans intrathalamica. In
   other diencephalic and midbrain regions, the ventricular zone lacked
   this crest-like organization and exhibited different smooth-surfaced
   domains rather homogeneous in thickness and appearance. The distribution
   of HNK-1-immunoreactive cell populations in the tegmental domain appears
   to be closely related with the pattern of proliferation crests.
   Together, our results reveal a shared basic organization in the
   tegmental domains of the diencephalon and midbrain of developing
   lamprey, indicating early appearance of the domain in vertebrate
   phylogeny. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A major hurdle in designing successful epitope-based vaccines resides in
   the delivery, stability, and immunogenicity of the peptide immunogen.
   The short-lived nature of unmodified peptide-based vaccines in vivo
   limits their therapeutic application in the immunotherapy of cancers and
   chronic viral infections as well as their use in generating prophylactic
   immunity. The incorporation of beta-amino acids into peptides decreases
   proteolysis, yet its potential application in the rational design of T
   cell mimotopes is poorly understood. To address this, we have replaced
   each residue of the SIINFEKL epitope individually with the
   corresponding, beta-amino acid and examined the resultant efficacy of
   these mimotopes. Some analogs displayed similar MHC binding and superior
   protease stability compared with the native epitope. Importantly, these
   analogs were able to generate cross-reactive CTLs in vivo that were
   capable of lysing tumor cells that expressed the unmodified epitope as a
   surrogate tumor Ag. Structural analysis of peptides in which anchor
   residues were substituted with beta-amino acids revealed the basis for
   enhanced MHC binding and retention of immunogenicity observed for these
   analogs and paves the way for future vaccine design using beta-amino
   acids. We conclude that the rational incorporation of beta-amino acids
   into T cell determinants is a powerful alternative to the traditional
   homologous substitution of randomly chosen naturally occurring
   alpha-amino acids, and these mimotopes may prove particularly useful for
   inclusion in epitope-based vaccines.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the mechanisms of electron injection to TiO2 in retinoic acid
   (RA) and carotenoic acids (CAs), including RA5, CA6, CA7, CA8, CA9, and
   CA11 having the number of conjugated double bonds n = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and
   11, respectively, their subpicosecond time-resolved absorption spectra
   were recorded free in solution and bound to TiO2 nanoparticles in
   suspension. The time-resolved spectra were analyzed by singular-value
   decomposition (SVD.) followed by global fitting based on an energy
   diagram consisting of the 3A(g)(-), 1B(u)(-), 1B(u)(+), and 2A(g)(-)
   singlet excited states, whose energies had been determined as functions
   of 1/(2n + 1) by the use of carotenoids with n = 9-13. It was found that
   electron injection took place from both the 1B(u)(+) and 2A(g)(-) states
   in RA5, CA6, CA7, and CA8, whereas only from the 1B(u)(+) state in CA9
   and CA11. The electron-injection efficiencies were determined, by the
   use of the relevant time constants determined by the SVD and
   global-fitting analyses, to be in the following order: RA5 approximate
   to CA6 < CA7 > CA8 > CA9 > CA11. To determine the mechanism of charge
   recombination via the T-1 state, submicrosecond time-resolved absorption
   spectra of RA5, CA6, CA7, and CA8 bound to TiO2 nanoparticles in
   suspension were recorded. The SVD and global-fitting analyses lead us to
   a new scheme, which includes the formation of the D-0(.+) - T-1 complex
   followed by transformation to both the D-0(.+) and T, states. On the
   other hand, their one-electron oxidation potentials were determined, and
   their singlet and triplet levels were scaled to the conduction band edge
   (CBE) of TiO2. The T-1 level was lower than, but closest to, the CBE in
   RA5, and it became lower in the order RA5, CA6, CA7, and CA8. Consistent
   with the energy gap between the CBE and the T-1 levels, the generation
   of the T-1 state (or in other words, charge recombination) decreased in
   the order RA5 > CA6 > CA7 > CA8.}},

Abstract = {{Psoriasis is a frequent, inflammatory disease of skin and joints with
   considerable morbidity. Here we report that in psoriatic lesions,
   epidermal keratinocytes have decreased expression of JunB, a gene
   localized in the psoriasis susceptibility region PSORS6. Likewise,
   inducible epidermal deletion of JunB and its functional companion c-Jun
   in adult mice leads ( within two weeks) to a phenotype resembling the
   histological and molecular hallmarks of psoriasis, including arthritic
   lesions. In contrast to the skin phenotype, the development of arthritic
   lesions requires T and B cells and signalling through tumour necrosis
   factor receptor 1 ( TNFR1). Prior to the disease onset, two chemotactic
   proteins (S100A8 and S100A9) previously mapped to the psoriasis
   susceptibility region PSORS4, are strongly induced in mutant
   keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro. We propose that the abrogation of
   JunB/activator protein 1 (AP-1) in keratinocytes triggers
   chemokine/cytokine expression, which recruits neutrophils and
   macrophages to the epidermis thereby contributing to the phenotypic
   changes observed in psoriasis. Thus, these data support the hypothesis
   that epidermal alterations are sufficient to initiate both skin lesions
   and arthritis in psoriasis.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] A three-sided box, MedBox, comprising the Strait of Gibraltar, 24
   degrees - 41 degrees N east of 22 degrees W, was constructed using
   hydrographic and chemical data from three World Ocean Circulation
   Experiment cruises in 1997 - 1998. An extended optimum multiparameter
   (OMP) analysis resolves the water mass structure in the MedBox. The mass
   transport is estimated from data and models warranting mass conservation
   and no deep water formation within the region. Combining the mass
   transport, the OMP analysis, and the spatial distribution of
   anthropogenic carbon (C-ANT), some relevant questions about the
   Mediterranean Water ( MW) formation, transport, and role in the global
   CO2 cycle are resolved. MW is produced at a rate of 2.7 +/- 0.2 Sv in
   the eastern North Atlantic. It entrains 2.3 Sv of central waters during
   its formation, including also remnants of Antarctic Intermediate Water.
   The main advection route of MW is northward, close to the Iberian margin
   (2.2 Sv), while about 0.5 Sv are exported into the subtropical eastern
   North Atlantic. The eastern North Atlantic within the MedBox is a strong
   region of air-sea C-ANT uptake, 0.7 +/- 0.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1), where
   C-ANT is accumulated at a rate of 66 +/- 21 kmol s(-1) (0.025 GtC
   yr(-1)), 17\% are taken up through the air-sea interface, and the rest
   is advected into the area by the circulation. The entrainment of central
   waters to form MW drives a drawdown of 151 +/- 14 kmol s(-1) (0.06 GtC
   yr(-1)) from the surface to intermediate levels, and 88 +/- 8 kmol s(-1)
   (0.03 GtC yr(-1)) are exported with MW into the North Atlantic, mainly
   by the horizontal/ eddy circulation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Head lice are the most common parasitic infestation in the
   United States requiring topical treatment with pediculicides. Ovide(R),
   the 0.5\% malathion formulation used in treatment of head lice requires
   placement on dry hair for 8-12 h. Malathion, however, is effective at
   killing lice and nits in 10 min. Our concern of over exposing children
   to malathion has led us to examine whether significantly more malathion
   will penetrate transdermally when applied for the recommended 8 h than
   for a shorter but apparently equally effective period.
   Methods: In vitro absorption studies were performed across haired rat
   skin and human abdominal skin to determine whether reducing malathion
   application time decreased skin absorption.
   Results: A 0.5 h exposure caused 0.36 +/- 0.14\% of the donor malathion
   to penetrate through human skin after 24 hand 2.1 +/- 0.6\% remained in
   the skin after washing with shampoo. After 8 h of topical applications
   penetration was approximately three-fold greater (1.02 +/- 0.41) and 3.4
   +/- 10.5\% remained in the skin (p < 0.05 versus 0.5 h). The
   relationship between absorption and exposure time also occurred for
   haired rat skin (p < 0.05). This differential continued for 72 h even
   after removal of the source.
   Conclusions: Significantly less malathion penetrated from Ovide(R) after
   0.5 h versus the suggested 8 h application, without decreasing the
   product's efficacy. Further clinical studies in children are warranted
   to confirm the efficacy of this shortened application time. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{An electronic nose (e-nose), the Cyrano Sciences' Cyranose 320 (C-320),
   comprising an array of 32 polymer carbon black composite sensors has
   been used to identify two species of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria,
   namely methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and
   methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) responsible for ear nose and
   throat (ENT) infections when present in standard agar solution in the
   hospital environment. C-320 e-nose has also been used to identify
   coagulase-negative staphylococci (C-NS) in the hospital environment.
   Swab samples were collected from the infected areas of the ENT patients'
   ear, nose and throat regions. Gathered data were a very complex mixture
   of different chemical compounds. An innovative object-oriented data
   clustering approach was investigated for these groups of S. aureus data
   by combining the principal component analysis (PCA) based
   three-dimensional scatter plot, Fuzzy C Means (FCM) and self-organizing
   map (SOM) network. Using these three data clustering algorithms
   simultaneously better `classification' of three bacteria subclasses were
   represented. Then three supervised classifiers, namely multi-layer
   perceptron (MLP), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and radial basis
   function network (RBF), were used to classify the three classes. A
   comparative evaluation of the classifiers was conducted for this
   application. The best results suggest that we are able to identify three
   bacteria subclasses with up to 99.69\% accuracy with the application of
   the RBF network along with C-320. This type of bacteria data analysis
   and feature extraction is very difficult. But we can conclude that this
   preliminary study proves that e-nose based approach can provide very
   strong solution for identifying S. aureus infections in hospital
   environment and early detection. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to elucidate the physical properties Of
   L-arginine and various counterion combinations in frozen aqueous
   solutions and in freeze-dried solids. L-Arginine remains amorphous in
   the highly concentrated non-ice phase in frozen solutions with a T-g'
   (glass transition temperature of maximally freeze-concentrated solutes)
   of -41.4 degrees C. Some acids and salts (e.g., H3PO4, H2SO4, HNO3, and
   NaH2PO4) raised the T-g', whereas others (e.g., HCl, CH3COOH, HCOOH,
   Na2HPO4, and NaCl) had little effect or lowered the L-arginine T-g'.
   Co-lyophilization with phosphoric acid also raised the glass transition
   temperature (T-g) of amorphous freeze-dried L-arginine solids.
   Arginine-H3PO4 combinations exhibited properties that led to either the
   stabilization or destabilization of a model protein (lactate
   dehydrogenase: LDH) during freeze-drying, depending on their
   concentration ratios. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and diffusion
   reflectance near-infrared (NIR) spectra indicated the presence of
   interactions between the amino and/or guanidyl groups Of L-arginine and
   phosphate ions in the amorphous freeze-dried cakes. It was postulated
   that the interaction between L-arginine and the multivalent counterions,
   as well as an increase in hydrogen bonding network, reduced the mobility
   of molecules in the frozen solutions and freeze-dried solids. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Prions represent a unique class of infectious agents in which the normal
   cellular prion protein (PrPC) is converted to an abnormal isoform (
   PrPSc), which accumulates in the brain and constitutes the major, if not
   the only, component of the infectious particle. Factors that still
   remain to be identified may facilitate the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc.
   In the present study, we first demonstrated that a growth factor of the
   neurotrophin family, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
   stimulates the formation of PrPSc in a gonadotropin-releasing
   hormone-secreting neuronal cell line (GT1-1 cells) infected with the
   Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) strain of scrapie as determined by
   Western blot analysis. We then observed that the prion-infected cells
   can be cleared from PrPSc by treatment with three inhibitors of
   mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2)
   {[}1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(o-aminophenylmercapto)butadiene and
   2-(2-amino-3-methyoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, as well as
   alpha-{[}amino{[}(4-aminophenyl)thio]methylene]-2-(trifluoromethyl)
   benzeneacetonitrile, which passes the blood-brain barrier], a component
   of one of the intracellular signaling pathways activated by BDNF. The
   MEK1/2 inhibitors were also efficient in clearing PrPSc from
   prion-infected GT1-1 cells stimulated to accumulate high levels of PrPSc
   by enhanced serum concentrations in the medium or by the use of a
   serum-free neuron-specific neurobasal medium. PrPSc did not reappear in
   the cultures within 5 weeks after completion of treatment. We conclude
   that inhibitors of the MEK1/2 pathway can efficiently and probably
   irreversibly clear PrPSc from prion-infected cells. The MEK pathway may
   therefore be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention in prion
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a new vaginal
   delivery system for the local treatment of vaginitis. Liposomes
   containing two commonly applied drugs in the treatment of vaginal
   infections, namely clotrimazole and metronidazole, were prepared by the
   proliposome and the polyol dilution methods. Both types of liposomes
   were characterised and compared for particle size, polydispersity,
   entrapment efficiency, and tested for in vitro stability in media that
   mimic human vaginal conditions (buffer, pH 4.5, and vaginal fluid
   simulant). To achieve application viscosity and to further improve their
   stability, liposomes containing drugs were incorporated in a bioadhesive
   gel made of Carbopol(R) 974P NF resin. In vitro release studies have
   demonstrated that even after 24 h of incubation in vaginal fluid
   simulant (at 37 degrees C) more than 30\% of the originally entrapped
   clotrimazole (or 50\% of metronidazole) was still retained in the gel.
   Storage stability studies have proved the ability of Carbopol(R) 974P NF
   gel to preserve original size distributions of incorporated liposomes.
   All the performed experiments confirm the applicability of bioadhesive
   liposome gels as a novel delivery system for local therapy of vaginal
   infections. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lipid-based delivery systems are becoming increasingly popular as
   carriers of drugs due to their ability to overcome barriers to oral
   absorption. The purpose of this study was to prepare novel lipid-based
   formulations of a model drug, piroxicam (PXCM), a poorly water-soluble
   non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) using
   1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DMPQ phospholipid
   alone, and in combination with polyethylene glycol (PEG 4600).
   Lipid-based drug delivery systems were prepared using conventional
   methods of preparation and the following aspects were evaluated (1) in
   vitro dissolution behavior, (2) absorption via Caco-2 cell monolayers
   and (3) stability of formulations over a 12-month period. In addition,
   physical characterization studies using differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) were also performed. Formulations of PXCM were
   prepared using DMPC in the following combinations (A) 1: 1 and (B) 2:1
   and a mixture of DMPC and PEG 4600 (C) 2: 1: 1, respectively.
   Dissolution studies conducted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4,
   37 +/- 0.5 degrees C) using the USP type II (paddle) dissolution
   apparatus showed an increase in dissolution rate and extent of the PXCM
   from all solid dispersion formulations when compared to the control. As
   such, the rate of drug release was observed to be fastest with
   formulation (C) showing the greatest increase of over two-fold compared
   to the control. Release of PXCM from formulations (A) and (B) was
   intermediate with the latter showing superior dissolution behavior
   despite containing lower amounts of the carrier lipid than the former.
   This observation indicates a possible existence of threshold levels for
   phospholipids carriers beyond which dissolution could be adversely
   affected. DSC studies further confirmed the dissolution behavior of
   these formulations demonstrating different levels of amorphous to
   crystalline nature. Results of HPLC analysis from Caco-2 cell Culture
   studies showed increase in transport of PXCM from all formulations, with
   formulation (C) showing the maximum increase followed by formulations
   (B) and (A), when compared to control. The apparent permeability
   coefficients (P-app) were calculated to be 7.92 x 10(-6), 9.48 x 10(-6),
   9.2 x 10(-6) and 5.6 x 10(-6) cm/s for formulations (A)-(C) and control,
   respectively. Overall, permeation appeared to improve for all
   formulations over the control. Stability studies at various temperatures
   showed all formulations to have good stability for the first 6 months;
   then a decline in dissolution rates was observed, especially for
   PEG-based lipid carrier systems, attributed to the increase in
   crystalline content of the solid dispersions upon storage. (C) 2005

Title = {{Chronic daily intrathecal injections of a large volume of fluid increase

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Mast cells are found in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as in
   the periphery. In the brain of mice, they are localized primarily in the
   thalamus and meninges. Although their numbers increase in response to
   stress, the mediator of their recruitment is not known. During studies
   in which drugs were delivered intrathecally in a volume sufficiently
   large to distribute to the brain, we discovered that repeated daily
   injections of this large volume increased the number of mast cells in
   the thalamus. The increase was not due to changes in electrolyte
   composition of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as chronically administered
   artificial CSF produced similar effects. Repeated injections of even
   small volumes (2 mu l) increased mast cells in the medial intralaminar
   (Med), ventral posterior (VP) and posterior (Po) nuclei. Increasing the
   volume injected daily to 20 mu l increased mast cells in the lateral
   intralaminar (Lat), laterodorsal (LD), ventrolateral (VL) and lateral
   geniculate (LG) nuclei and further increased those in the lateral
   extension of the Po nucleus. Thus, small and large volumes augment
   distinct populations of mast cells. While stem cell factor (SCF) is
   abundant in the CNS and is chemotactic to mast cells in the periphery,
   thalamic mast cells in the rodent do not express c-kit, the SCF
   receptor, suggesting that this factor may not be responsible for the
   effect. Consistent with this, centrally injected SCF was incapable of
   increasing thalamic mast cell populations after either single or chronic
   (21 days) daily injections compared to the effect of saline alone.
   Although the mechanism is not known, repeated injections of a large
   volume of fluid dramatically increase mast cells in the CNS, a
   phenomenon that may be relevant to clinical conditions of increased CSF
   pressure or volume. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   branched alkanes (isopentane, 2-methylpentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, and
   2,3-dimethylbutane) were performed on H-mordenite and H-beta at 473 K,
   and sulfated zirconia at 273 K and 323 K. Pentane and 2-methylpentane
   were converted into the corresponding isomers on Bronsted acids of
   mordenite and beta-zeolite in the initial stage of the reaction. The
   major final product was isobutane, formed by bimolecular reaction in the
   later stage of the reaction. In contrast, pentane and 2-methylpentane
   were converted into their isomers by monomolecular reaction on sulfated
   zirconia with high selectivity. No reaction was observed in isopentane
   isomerization on sulfated zirconia because the product has the same
   structure. These highly selective isomerizations are considered to be
   catalyzed by Lewis acid sites on sulfated zirconia, because it has
   superacidic Lewis acid sites. Multi-branched alkanes showed higher
   reactivity than linear, mono-branched and cyclic alkanes. Isobutane
   formation as the main product and remarkable deactivation were found in
   the isomerization of 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethybutane on
   sulfated zirconia. The Bronsted acid sites on sulfated zirconia were not
   strong enough to promote the skeletal isomerizations of linear and
   mono-branched alkanes. However, these acid sites were active enough to
   form intermediates by bimolecular reaction of multi-branched alkanes,
   and were the source of catalyst poisoning species formed by
   dehydrogenation. Cyclohexane was converted into methylcyclopentane on
   both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites with high selectivity. (c) 2005

   the melting point of various formulations composed of poloxamer 124 (P

   pharmacokinetic study of diclofenac sodium delivered by the
   poloxamer-based suppository were performed. Furthermore, the
   identification test in the rectum and morphology test of rectal tissues
   were carried out after its rectal administration in rats. The poloxamer
   mixtures composed of P 124 and P 188 were homogeneous phases. Very small
   amounts of P 188 affected the melting point of poloxamer mixtures. In
   particular, the poloxamer mixture {[}P 124{[}P 188 (97/3\%)] with the
   melting point of about 32 degrees C was a solid form at room temperature
   and instantly melted at physiological temperature. Very small amounts of
   P 188 hardly affected the dissolution rates of diclofenac sodium from
   the suppository. Dissolution mechanism analysis showed the dissolution
   of diclofenac sodium was proportional to the time. The poloxamer-based
   suppository gave significantly higher initial plasma concentrations and
   faster T x of diclofenac sodium than did conventional PEG-based
   suppository, indicating that the drug from poloxamer-based suppository
   could be absorbed faster than that from PEG-based one in rats. It
   retained in the rectum for at least 4 h and could not irritate or damage
   the rectal tissues of rats. Thus, the poloxamer-based solid suppository

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new kind of conductive polymer composites was
   fabricated by in situ polymerization of styrene (PS) in the presence of
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and solution mixing of
   polystyrene with MWCNTs, respectively. The electrical percolation
   behaviors of the composites and their resistance responsivities against
   various organic vapors were investigated. The experimental results
   showed that the in situ polymerization method has more advantages to
   improve the dispersion of MWCNTs in PS matrix, and produces composites
   with high sensitivity and rate of response for the vapors of good
   solvents of PS at filler range from 5 to 15 wt.\%. A rise in testing
   temperature raised the rate of response but lowered the maximum
   responsivity of the composites. It can be concluded that the MWCNT/PS
   composites developed in the present work are promising candidates for
   gas sensors to detect, distinguish and quantity organic vapors. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Glutamate 151 (E151) has been shown to be catalytically essential for
   the aminopeptidase from Vibrio proteolyticus (AAP). E151 acts as the
   general acid/base during the catalytic mechanism of peptide hydrolysis.
   However, a glutamate residue is not the only residue capable of
   functioning as a general acid/base during catalysis for dinuclear
   metallohydrolases. Recent crystallographic characterization of the
   D-aminopeptidase from Bacillus subtilis (DppA) revealed a histidine
   residue that resides in an identical position to E151 in AAP. Because
   the active-site ligands for DppA and AAP are identical, AAP has been
   used as a model enzyme to understand the mechanistic role of H 115 in
   DppA. Substitution of E151 with histidine resulted in an active AAP
   enzyme exhibiting a k(cat) value of 2.0 min(-1), which is over 2000
   times slower than r AAP (4380 min(-1)). ITC experiments revealed that
   Zn-II binds 330 and 3 times more weakly to E151H-AAP compared to r-AAP.
   UV-vis and EPR spectra of Con-loaded E151H-AAP indicated that the first
   metal ion resides in a hexacoordinate/pentacoordinate equilibrium
   environment, whereas the second metal ion is six-coordinate. pH
   dependence of the kinetic parameters kcat and K-m for the hydrolysis of
   L-leucine p-nitroanilide (L-pNA) revealed a change in an ionization
   constant in the enzyme-substrate complex from 5.3 in r-AAP to 6.4 in
   E151H-AAP, consistent with E151 in AAP being the active-site general
   acid/base. Proton inventory studies at pH 8.50 indicate the transfer of
   one proton in the rate-limiting step of the reaction. Moreover, the
   X-ray crystal structure of {[}ZnZn(E151H-AAP)] has been solved to 1.9
   angstrom resolution, and alteration of E151 to histidine does not
   introduce any major conformational changes to the overall protein
   structure or the dinuclear Zn-II active site. Therefore, a histidine
   residue can function as the general acid/base in hydrolysis reactions of
   peptides and, through analogy of the role of E151 in AAP, H115 in DppA
   likely shuttles a proton to the leaving group of the substrate.}},

Abstract = {{A powerful tool for postgenomic analysis of mammalian gene function is
   gene targeting in mouse ES cells. We report that homologous
   recombination using a promoterless gene trap vector ({''}targeting
   trapping{''}) yields targeting frequencies averaging above 50\%, a
   significant increase compared with current approaches. These high
   frequencies appear to be due to the stringency of selection with
   promoterless constructs, because most random insertions are silent and
   eliminated by drug selection. The promoterless design requires that the
   targeted gene be expressed in ES cells at levels exceeding a certain
   threshold (which we estimate to be approximate to 1\% of the transferrin
   receptor gene expression level, for the secretory trap vector used
   here). Analysis of 127 genes that had been trapped by random
   (nontargeted) gene trapping with the same vector shows that virtually
   all are expressed in ES cells above this threshold, suggesting that
   targeted and random trapping share similar requirements for expression
   levels. In a random sampling of 130 genes encoding secretory proteins,
   about half were expressed above threshold, suggesting that about half of
   all secretory genes are accessible by either targeted or random gene
   trapping. The simplicity and high efficiency of the method facilitate
   systematic targeting of a large fraction of the genome by individual
   investigators and large-scale consortia alike.}},

Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Mountain building depends on the disequilibrium between boundary
   stresses, either at the base of the deforming lithosphere or its lateral
   boundaries, and buoyancy stresses arising form lateral density
   variations within the lithosphere itself. On the basis of the thin
   viscous sheet approximation, we propose a model which accounts for both
   crustal and lithospheric thickness variations. The deformation is
   controlled by the sum of the moments of density anomalies (i.e. density
   anomalies times depth) of compositional and thermal origins. The
   transport of the compositional moment is obtained from the continuity
   equation while the transport of the thermal moment is obtained from the
   heat equation. The resulting set of equations controls the coupled
   behavior of the crust and lithosphere. It shows that various type of
   solutions can exist: unstable, stable and propagating. When propagation
   occurs, the crustal and the lithospheric thickness variations are out of
   phase. The tectonic waves propagate with velocities around 5 mm yr(-1)
   that increase with the crustal thickness and decrease with the
   lithospheric viscosity. We discuss these solutions and argue that
   continents may in large part be in a domain of propagating tectonic
   waves.}},

Abstract = {{Ion channel peptides have been prepared by solid-phase peptide
   synthesis, labeled with N-15 at selected sites, and reconstituted into
   oriented lipid bilayers. The (Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ser-Leu)(3)-CONH2
   peptide has previously been shown to exhibit well-defined and discrete
   ionic conductances when investigated by single-channel measurements
   {[}Lear, J. D., et al. (1988) Science 240, 1177]. Proton-decoupled N-15
   solid-state NMR spectroscopy indicates that
   (Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ser-Leu)(3)-CONH2 preferentially aligns parallel to
   the membrane surface in excellent agreement with its amphipathic helical
   structure. However, by carefully choosing the conditions of the membrane
   environment, significant contributions that are indicative of
   transmembrane alignments become obvious in the N-15 chemical shift
   solid-state NMR spectra. The data thereby provide experimental evidence
   for an equilibrium between in-plane and transmembrane-oriented helix
   configurations where the transmembrane and surface-oriented peptide
   fractions are in slow exchange. Similar topological equilibria are
   observed when the N-terminus of the LS21 peptide is acetylated. These
   observations provide experimental support for previous models,
   suggesting that the channels observed in single-channel conductance
   measurements are indeed formed by hexameric transmembrane helical
   bundles. In contrast, the shorter peptide
   (Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ser-Leu)(2)-CONH2 is oriented parallel to the
   membrane surface under all conditions tested. This peptide exhibits

Abstract = {{The surface structures, photovoltages, and stability of n-Si(111)
   electrodes surface-modified with Pt nanodots and organic groups were
   studied in an I-/I-3(-) redox electrolyte, using alkyls of varied chain
   length and those having a double bond and ester at the terminal as the
   organic groups. The n-Si was first modified with the organic groups, and
   then Pt was electrodeposited on it. Linear sweep voltammetry revealed
   that, for the modification with alkyls, the overvoltage for the Pt
   deposition became significantly larger with increasing alkyl chain
   length, though this does not necessarily hold for the modification with
   alkyls having a double bond and ester. Scanning electron microscopic
   inspection showed that the Pt particle density decreased and the
   particle size increased, with increasing alkyl chain length. The
   photovoltaic characteristics and stability for the n-Si electrodes
   modified with the organic groups were much improved by the Pt nanodot
   coating, though they became somewhat inferior with increasing alkyl
   chain length. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that
   surface alkylation at high coverage together with coating with small Pt
   nanodots gives efficient and stable n-Si electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{The glass-transition temperature, T-g, ofisotactic PMMA thin films has

   between the film and the substrate. The use of such a spacer drastically
   improves the sensitivity of Raman scattering measurements. The
   improvement in the sensitivity allows us to study phenomena involving
   changes in molecular dynamics, such as the phase transition, and to
   probe the existence in very thin films of several thickness-dependent
   transition temperatures, T-g(h). This in turn is interpreted as the
   occurrence in the film of a layered structure. The influence of the
   polymer concentration on the conformation of the surface adsorbed
   polymer layer and therefore on T-g(h) is discussed.}},

   species, but the underlying signaling mechanism remains poorly
   understood. Here, we report on the function and mechanism of the
   Drosophila insulin-like system in the central regulation of different
   hunger-driven behaviors. We found that overexpression of Drosophila
   insulin-like peptides (DILPs) in the nervous system of fasted larvae
   suppressed the hunger-driven increase of ingestion rate and intake of
   nonpreferred foods (e.g., a less accessible solid food). Moreover,
   up-regulation of Drosophila p70/S6 kinase activity in DILP neurons led
   to attenuated hunger response by fasted larvae, whereas its
   down-regulation triggered fed larvae to display motivated foraging and
   feeding. Finally, we provide evidence that neural regulation of food
   preference but not ingestion rate may involve direct signaling by DILPs
   to neurons expressing neuropeptide F receptor 1, a receptor for
   neuropeptide Y-like neuropeptide F. Our study reveals a prominent role
   of neural Drosophila p70/S6 kinase in the modulation of hunger response

Abstract = {{The efficiency of mechanical effluent treatment depends on the ratio of
   particle bound waste load to total waste load and on the size
   distribution of the suspended solids. We tested an innovative approach
   to increase mechanical treatment efficiency by adding small amounts of
   indigestible binders to trout feed. The hypothesis was that the addition
   of binders would enhance faecal stability and improve shear resistance.
   This should slow the breakdown of faeces by water turbulences resulting
   in larger particles. These are easier to remove by filtration and should
   be more resistant to leaching than small particles, so more soluble
   waste remains particle-bound and removable.
   In two separate trials, portion size trout were fed diets containing
   indigestible binders, while control groups received the same basal diet
   without binder. The fish were reared in 500 L circular tanks. The effect
   of each binder on the stability (viscosity and elastic resistance) of
   dissected faeces was measured by a rheometer. Both stability parameters
   increased significantly by the addition of the binders. Addition of Guar
   gum increased the viscosity of the faeces best by 183\% and 140\% in
   Trial 1 and Trial 2 respectively, while Alginate increased elastic
   resistance best by 173\% and 125\%. The digestibility of the diets was
   not affected.
   The dissected faeces were exposed to controlled turbulence in the
   laboratory. The particle size distributions of the suspensions were
   measured using a laser-based technique applying the `time-of-transition'
   theory. The Guar gum and Alginate treatments led to significantly larger
   particles compared to the control. Based on these data the beneficial
   effect of the Guar gum binder on post-filtration suspended solid load
   (100 mu m gauze) was calculated to be 40.2\% and 18.2\% for Trials 1 and
   2 respectively.
   In a leaching experiment, faecal particles were suspended in distilled
   water and allowed to leach for 1 h. The solids were fractionated by
   sieving and their relative phosphorus and nitrogen content was
   determined. The relative phosphorus and nitrogen content of the
   particles increased significantly with increasing size class. In a
   second experiment, larger particles of the Guar gum treatment yielded
   significantly higher total amounts of phosphorus and more dry matter
   remained solid-bound compared to the control.
   The present study demonstrates promising potential for binders as tools
   in significantly reducing the effluent load of fish farms without
   affecting feed efficiency. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent history has demonstrated that classical swine fever (CSF)
   epidemics can incur high economic losses, especially for exporting
   countries that have densely populated pig areas and apply a strategy of
   non-vaccination, such as The Netherlands. Introduction of CSF virus
   (CSFV) remains a continuing threat to the pig production sector in The
   Netherlands. Reducing the annual probability of CSFV introduction
   (P-CSFV) by preventive measures is therefore of utmost importance. The
   choice of preventive measures depends not only on the achieved reduction
   of the annual P-CSFV, but also on the expenditures required for
   implementing these measures. The objective of this study was to explore
   the cost-effectiveness of tactical measures aimed at the prevention of
   CSFV introduction into The Netherlands. For this purpose for each
   measure (i) model calculations were performed with a scenario tree model
   for CSFV introduction and (ii) its annual cost was estimated. The
   cost-effectiveness was then determined as the reduction of the annual
   P-CSFV achieved by each preventive measure (Delta P) divided by the
   annual cost of implementing that measure (Delta C). The measures
   analysed reduce the PCSFV caused by import or export of pigs. Results
   showed that separation of national and international transport of pigs
   is the most cost-effective measure, especially when risk aversion is
   assumed. Although testing piglets and breeding pigs by a quick and
   reliable PCR also had a high cost-effectiveness ratio, this measure is
   not attractive due to the high cost per pig imported. Besides,
   implementing such a measure is not allowed under current EU law, as it
   is trade restrictive. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of NO on TiO2 and Au-TiO2 catalysts calcined at different
   temperatures has been studied using DRIFTS as a monitoring tool. It was
   found that NO adsorption on TiO2 is initially dominated by unidentate
   nitrite (1479, 1464 cm(-1) ), a small concentration of nitro species
   (1440, 1385, 1370 cm(-1)) which later were replaced by nitrate (1611,
   1589 and 1480 cm(-1)) and which dominated the spectra after extended
   exposure of TiO2 to NO. Decomposition. of NO3- into NO2- at elevated
   temperatures is observed and nitrite bound to the surface to form
   nitrite (1407 cm(-1)), which dominates the spectra after cooing the
   system to 298 K. Coordinated NO on different V, sites (1906 and 1447
   cm(-1)) detected in the early stages of NO adsorption and (1934 and 2005
   cm(-1)) were also found after extended exposure of TiO2 to NO. For
   Au-TiO2, early spectra were also dominated by unidentate nitrite (1476
   cm(-1)) for uncalcined Au-TiO2 (designated Dry-Au-T) and (1477 cm(-1))
   for Au-TiO2 calcined at 973 K (designated Au-T973). In addition,
   bridging nitrite (1540 cm(-1)) is one of the dominant species seen on
   Dry-Au-TiO2.
   The nitrate surface species, which dominate the spectra after extended
   exposure, are virtually the same and behave in the same way under in
   situ thermal desorption experiments. However, nitrate formation on
   Au-TiO2 is relatively fast compared with the situation found for TiO2,
   Mechanisms for the formation of these species are discussed and compared
   with previously reported data. For Au-TiO2, two characteristic bands at
   1685 and 1644 cm(-1) for Dry-Au-T and at 1682 and 1643 cm(-1) for
   Au-T973 were detected at room temperature and dominated the initial
   spectra. The sites containing these NO molecules were populated first.
   For Dry-Au-T, the higher wavenumber mode (1685 cm(-1)), assigned to
   bridging NO adsorbate, decreased in intensity during NO adsorption to
   produce a very weak feature and is assumed to contribute to the
   dissociation of NO on this catalyst. However, the lower wavenumber mode
   (1644 cm(-1)), assigned to NO adsorbed at the gold-oxide interface,
   shifts to lower wavenumber and acts as a precursor state for the
   activated NO states detected at 1750 and 1714 cm(-1) on raising the
   temperature to 473 K. In contrast, for Au-T973, the lower wavenumber
   mode (1643 cm(-1)) is associated with a unit which undergoes
   dissociation, while the high wavenumber mode (1682 cm(-1)) is assigned
   to a precursor state for the thermally activated NO states detected at
   1744 and 1714 cm(-1) at 473 K. This trend is explained in terms of the
   changes in the degree of interaction between gold and the underlying
   TiO2 support brought about upon calcination. The results are discussed
   and correlated with previous observations on gold catalysts in an
   attempt to assess the impact of these thermally activated NO states on
   the decomposition and selective catalytic reduction of NO over gold
   catalysts. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between
   herd-level factors and the isolation of Salmonella in calves from dairy
   farms in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York. Study farms were
   129 conventional and organic farms enrolled without regard to previous
   history of Salmonella infection. Herds were sampled at 2-month intervals
   over a 1-year period. Salmonella was isolated in fecal samples from 176
   (3.8\%) of 4673 preweaned calves with 40 (31.0\%) of 129 farms having at
   least one positive calf sample over the course of the study.
   Multivariable logistic regression using the generalized estimating
   equations approach was used to evaluate risk factors for Salmonella
   shedding after adjustment for effects of herd size, season, state of
   origin and the multiple sampling occasions per herd. Factors retained in
   the final model that were associated with an increased odds for
   Salmonella shedding were lack of routine feeding of milk replacer
   containing antimicrobials to preweaned calves (OR = 2.8, 95\% CI: 1.4,
   5.8), use of maternity housing as a hospital area for sick cows more
   than once a month (OR = 2.1, 95\% CI: 1.1, 4.0), and cow prevalence
   level by visit, categorized into the following four-levels: >= 20\% (OR=
   11.6, 95\% CI: 5.7, 23.7), 10-19.9\% (OR = 4.7, 95\% CI: 2.0, 11.5),
   0.1-9.9\% (OR = 3.6, 95\% CI: 1.5, 8.7) and 0\% (reference level). Herd
   size was not associated with Salmonella shedding in the final

Abstract = {{Wild-type p53 accumulates in the nucleus following stress. Current

   MDM2-dependent nuclear export of wild-type p53 and a mutant lacking
   N-terminal phosphorylation sites. Etoposide and ionizing radiation
   inhibited nuclear export of wild-type p53 and the phosphor-mutant to
   comparable extents, indicating nuclear export inhibition does not
   require N-terminal phosphorylation. Cytoplasmic p53 accumulated in the
   nucleus of transfected cells treated with the nuclear export-inhibitor
   leptomycin B (LMB). Interestingly, LMB caused less p53 nuclear
   accumulation than stress treatment, suggesting stress-induced nuclear
   accumulation of p53 does not result solely from inhibited nuclear

Abstract = {{The influence of dietary phytoestrogens provided by Western diets on
   mammographic density is not well established. Soy and soy products as
   source of isoflavones were found to be inversely associated with high
   mammographic density, a marker for breast cancer risk. Another class of
   phytoestrogens, the lignans, which are more frequent in Western diets,
   are rarely investigated. Within the European Prospective Investigation
   into Cancer and Nutrition cohort in Heidelberg (EPIC-Heidelberg) we
   explored the feasibility of mammogram collection and measurement of
   mammographic density in order to investigate the association between
   dietary, phytoestrogen intake and breast density patterns. Wolfe
   classification was used to summarize mammographic density Dietary habits
   were assessed by means of a validated food frequency questionnaire.
   Out of the 505 randomly selected women, 317 (63\%) returned the
   questionnaire and 310 (61.4\%) women provided informed consent to
   collect mammograms. Dietary intake of seven women with dense patterns
   (DY) was compared with 47 women without dense patterns. A high dietary
   intake of fibre (p-value = 0.008) and secoisolariciresinol (p-value =
   0.043) is inversely associated with non-dense breast patterns. This is
   also observed for a high dietary intake of soy-products (pvalue = 0.004)
   and, in tendency, genistein (p-value = 0.069). After adjustment for
   energy intake and age the groups of dense and non-dense mammographic
   patterns were different regarding the intake of carbohydrate (p =
   0.032), soy-products (p = 0.020), fibre (p 0.046), and
   secoisolariciresinol (p = 0.027).
   Our results suggest an inverse association between dietary lignan intake
   and breast density, similar to the findings for isoflavones. To our
   knowledge this is the first report on this association, but due to the
   risk of chance finding, this has to be confirmed in a study with
   sufficient statistical power.}},

   ex Miq., Hopea odorata Roxb., Neobalanocaqws heimii (King) P. Ashton,

   greater shoot growth when supplied with ammonium than with nitrate.
   Higher root rnass ratios were observed in all species with nitrate,
   which would be an adaptive response to limited nitrogen uptake. The five
   species, which preferred ammonium, showed a higher light-saturated
   photosynthetic rate with ammonium supply. The lower light-saturated
   photosynthetic rate with nitrate supply was a result of lower
   photosynthetic capacity, as indicated by a lower CO,saturated
   photosynthetic rate. The lower leaf nitrogen content in seedlings
   supplied with nitrate would be the cause of the lower photosynthetic
   performance. Nitrate reductase activity in leaf and root of D.
   obtusifolius, N. heimii, and S. roxburghii showed generally low
   inducibility with nitrate. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Epibacteria, i.e. bacteria attached to suspended particles, were studied
   in ponds, used for the cultivation of Northern White Shrimp (Penaeus
   vannamei L.), at Hai-yan Farm (Zhejiang Province, China). Four ponds
   with different surface area and age were used. The water temperature
   ranged from 24 to 32 degrees C on the sampling days. Salinity and pH
   values of all shrimp ponds ranged 10-20 parts per thousand and 7.8-8.4,
   respectively, during the experimental period, from 20 May to 20 August
   2004. In this study, the numbers of suspended particles (SP), particles
   with bacteria attached (BP), epibacteria, i.e. bacteria attached to
   suspended particles only (EB), and total plate count (TPC) were
   determined and the concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC)
   measured. In addition, the correlation between particles, epibacteria
   and POC was analyzed. Results showed that the average number of SP in
   four shrimp ponds was 5.41 x 10(4) ml(-1), with a BP of 3.00 x 10(4)
   ml(-1), while the percentage of particles with bacteria attached was
   55.41\% of the total number of suspended particles. The EB and TPC of
   the four ponds were 6.33 x 10(4) per ml and 3.59 x 10(6) per ml,
   respectively, while the percentage of EB to TPC was only 1.76\%. There
   were highly significantly lower counts (P < 0.01) of BP, EB and TPC for
   the first year culture ponds during all phases. However, there was no
   significant difference (P > 0.01) for POC between the four shrimp ponds.
   The number of particles to which one, two, three or four bacteria were
   attached was 46\%, 22\%, 14\% and 9\%, respectively, of the total number
   of particles with bacteria attached. However, the percentage of
   particles with more than four bacteria attach was only 9\%. There was a
   significant correlation between the number of epibacteria and particles
   with bacteria attached (r = 0.9920, n = 36; P < 0.01). The number of
   epibacteria was also correlated with the number of suspended particles
   (SP) (r = 0.9558, n = 36; P < 0.01) and the total number of bacteria
   (TPC) (r = 0.8657, n = 36; P < 0.01), but was not correlated with POC (r
   = 0.1340, n = 36; P > 0.05). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a wide-field camera survey of the stars in the
   Monoceros Ring, thought to be an additional structure in the Milky Way
   of unknown origin. Lying roughly in the plane of the Milky Way, this may
   represent a unique equatorial accretion event which is contributing to
   the thick disc of the Galaxy. Alternatively, the Monoceros Ring may be a
   natural part of the disc formation process. With 10 pointings in
   symmetric pairs above and below the plane of the Galaxy, this survey
   spans 90 degrees about the equator of the Milky Way. Signatures of the
   stream of stars were detected in three fields, (l, b) = (118 degrees,
   +16 degrees) and (150 degrees, +15 degrees) plus a more tentative
   detection at (150 degrees, -15 degrees). Galactocentric distance
   estimates to these structures gave similar to 17, similar to 17, and
   similar to 13 kpc, respectively. The Monoceros Ring seems to be present
   on both sides of the Galactic plane, in a form different from that of
   the Galactic warp, suggestive of a tidal origin with streams multiply
   wrapping the Galaxy. A new model of the stream has shown a strong
   coincidence with our results and has also provided the opportunity to
   make several more detections in fields in which the stream is less
   significant. The confirmed detection at (l, b) = (123 degrees, -19
   degrees) at similar to 14, kpc from the Galactic Centre allows a
   re-examination revealing a tentative new detection with a Galactocentric
   distance of similar to 21 kpc. These detections also lie very close to
   the newly discovered structure in Triangulum-Andromedae hinting at a
   link between the two. The remaining six fields are apparently
   non-detections although in light of these new models, closer inspection
   reveals tentative structure. With the overdensity of M giant stars in
   Canis Major being claimed both as a progenitor to the Monoceros Ring and
   alternatively a manifestation of the Milky Way warp, much is still
   unknown concerning this structure and its connection to the Monoceros
   Ring. Further constraints are needed for the numerical simulations to
   adequately resolve the increasingly complex view of this structure.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of molecular hydrogen (H-2) in the interstellar medium
   takes place on the surfaces of dust grains. Hydrogen molecules play a
   role in gas-phase reactions that produce other molecules, some of which
   serve as coolants during gravitational collapse and star formation.
   Thus, the evaluation of the production rate of hydrogen molecules and
   its dependence on the physical conditions in the cloud are of great
   importance. Interstellar dust grains exhibit a broad size distribution
   in which the small grains capture most of the surface area. Recent
   studies have shown that the production efficiency strongly depends on
   the grain composition and temperature as well as on its size. In this
   paper, we present a formula that provides the total production rate of
   H-2 per unit volume in the cloud, taking into account the grain
   composition and temperature as well as the grain size distribution. The
   formula agrees very well with the master equation results. It shows that
   for a physically relevant range of grain temperatures, the production
   rate of H-2 is significantly enhanced due to their broad size
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a non-destructive testing method with positron
   annihilation lifetimes for thick materials. The positron annihilation
   lifetime is sensitive to the defect density of atoms or dislocations. A
   positron from a radiation source is annihilated with an electron at the
   front surface of the materials under investigation. The application of
   the positron lifetime method is restricted to thin materials. A positive
   muon can readily penetrate thick materials and decay into a positron and
   two neutrinos. The positrons from the muon decays are annihilated with
   electrons in the materials. The positron annihilation method using muon
   decays can be applied to thick materials. We estimated the efficiencies
   and the statistical uncertainties of the lifetime measurements for this
   method using a GEANT simulation. Some technical issues pertaining to the
   estimation of the defect distribution with this method are discussed.

Abstract = {{New approaches to design static and dynamical reconfigurable control
   systems are proposed based on the eigenstructure assignment techniques.
   The methods can recover the nominal closed-loop performance after a
   fault occurrence in the system, in the state and output feedback
   designs. These methods are capable of dealing with order-reduction
   problems that may occur in an after-fault system. The problem of robust
   reconfigurable controller design, which makes the after-fault
   closed-loop system insensitive as much as possible, to the parameter
   uncertainties of the after-fault model is considered. Steady state
   response of the after-fault system under the unit step input is
   recovered by the means of a reconfigurable feed-forward compensator. The
   methods guarantee the stability of the reconfigured closed-loop system
   in the case of output feedback. For the faulty situations, in which the
   order of the pre-fault and after-fault closed-loop systems are the same,
   sufficient regional pole assignment conditions for the reconfigured
   system are derived. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed methods for two aircraft models.}},

   evaluated on erythrocytes. Cyclophosphamide at a single dose of 4 mg/L
   was used as a positive control, The results of this study showed that
   both effluents had genotoxic potential. On the other hand, the level of
   genetic damage induced by petroleum refinery effluent was considerably
   higher than that of chromium processing plant effluent. Our results
   further indicate that nuclear abnormalities other than micronuclei, such

Abstract = {{Variability of chlorophyll concentration in the Arabian Sea and Bay of
   Bengal has been studied using SeaWiFS eight-day average, 9 km processed
   data for the period 1997-2000. The interrelationship with sea surface
   temperature (SST) was studied with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
   derived, best SST product. The chlorophyll pattern shows in general high
   concentrations during February to March in the Arabian Sea and November
   to December in the Bay of Bengal. Year-to-year variations in temperature
   show an inverse relation with chlorophyll, at different locations, even
   on a monthly basis. However, the intraannual variability in chlorophyll
   at different locations shows differences in the relationship with SST.
   The Arabian Sea showed an inverse relationship at most of the locations,
   while a positive relationship was observed in the northwest region
   during October to December and an inverse relationship during January to
   April. The Bay of Bengal showed positive relationships at northeast
   locations, whereas no definite assessment could be made for other
   locations due to the narrow range of chlorophyll concentration. A longer
   time series (similar to 10 years) will be required to establish a more
   concrete relationship but definitely consistent patterns are emerging
   from this study. The results form an additional dimension to the
   criteria for partitioning the ocean, required for global productivity or
   biophysical coupled modelling.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the two isomers of benzil, cis-skewed(c(S)) and

   absorption and emission spectra are discussed at the level of
   TD-B3LYP/6-31 + G{*}. The polarizable continuum model is applied in the
   calculations in solution. The calculated results indicate that the
   cis-skewvd configuration is slightly favored when the polarity of the
   solvent increases. T-1 and S-1 states of the two isomers as well as S-2
   state of the cis-skewed configuration all arise from the local
   excitation of n ->pi{*} type localized on the bicarbonyl moiety, but
   other excited singlet states are dominated by the pi ->pi{*} transition
   from the benzene ring to the carbonyl group. The theoretical
   calculations predict slight red shifts of the absorption and emission
   spectra in solvents for the charge transfer states and blue shifts for
   the local excitation states.}},

Abstract = {{A model is presented of pulse evolution in broadband intra-cavity
   frequency-doubled lasers. The model utilizes normalized coupled rate
   equations for each mode, including terms that represent the loss due to
   nonlinear mixing between longitudinal modes. The pulse energy, shape,
   peak power and duration are calculated by numerical solution of these
   equations. The model shows that the pulse duration depends not only on
   the initial population inversion, photon lifetime and the effective
   nonlinear coupling coefficient, as is the case for narrowband lasers,
   but also on the fundamental bandwidth. A gain-switched Ti:sapphire
   laser, pumped by a Q-switched Nd-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser at
   532 nm, was frequency doubled using an intra-cavity beta-barium borate
   crystal. The bandwidth was reduced from about 25 nm to about 1.5 nm in
   two steps using a series of prisms, and the resulting changes in
   experimental pulse durations and energies agree well with the model.}},

Abstract = {{Holography has been of increasing interest in recent years, with
   developments in many areas such as data storage and metrology.
   Photopolymer materials provide potentially good materials for
   holographic recording, as they are inexpensive and self-processing. Many
   experiments have been reported in the literature that describe the
   diffraction efficiency and angular selectivity of such materials. The
   majority of these reports discuss the performance of the holographic
   optical element after the recording stage. It has been observed,
   however, that sometimes, during exposure, the transmitted recording beam
   intensities vary with time. A simple phenomenological model is proposed
   to explain the beam modulation, which incorporates the growth of the
   phase grating, time-varying absorption effects, the mechanical motion of
   the plate, the growth of a lossy absorption grating during the recording
   process, and the effects of nonideal beam ratios. (c) 2005 Optical

   to gain novel insight into the ankyrins-G of skeletal muscle. We find:
   (i) that Ank3 is composed of at least 53 exons, many of which are
   subject to tissue-specific splicing; (ii) five novel full-length cDNAs
   encoding two canonical (Ank(G197), Ank(G217)) and three small isoforms
   (Ank(G109), Ank(G128), Ank(G130)) bring to six the number of ankyrins-G
   expressed in skeletal muscle; (iii) a 76-residue insert in the
   C-terminal domain is a `signature' for muscle ankyrins; (iv) variably
   spliced sequences of 17/18 and 195 residues increase diversity in the
   C-terminal domains. Comparison of endogenous ankyrins-G with in vitro
   translated cDNAs revealed that small ankyrins account for the majority
   of the immunoreactivity for ankyrin-G in soleus muscle. The small
   ankyrins, when expressed in vivo in the rat muscle, are all targeted to
   sarcolemmal costameres. Our results demonstrate the tissue-dependent
   alternative splicing of Ank3 in skeletal muscle and point to novel
   functions of small ankyrins-G in organizing microdomains of the plasma
   membrane. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background No prospective trial-based data are available for incremental
   cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with bare-metal
   stents (BMS) in unselected patients, as treated in everyday practice.
   Methods The Basel stent cost-effectiveness trial (BASKET) included 826
   consecutive patients treated with angioplasty and stenting for 1281
   de-novo lesions, irrespective of indication for angioplasty. Patients
   were randomised to one of two DES (Cypher, n=264; Taxus, n=281) or to a
   cobalt-chromium-based BMS (Vision, n=281) and followed up for 6 months
   for occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and costs. Analysis was
   by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was cost-effectiveness after
   6 months, with effectiveness defined as reduction of major adverse
   cardiac events.
   Findings Cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel
   revascularisation occurred in 39 of 544 (7.2\%) patients with DES and 34
   of 280 (12.1\%) with BMS (odds ratio 0.56, 95\% Cl 0.35-0.91; p=0.02),
   without significant differences between the two DES. Total costs at 6
   months were higher with DES (mean E10544, SD 6849) than with BMS (E9639,
   9067; p<0.0001); higher stent costs of DES were not compensated for by
   lower follow-up costs. incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DES
   compared with BMS to avoid one major event was E18311, and costs per
   quality-adjusted life-year gained were more than E50000. Subgroup
   analyses showed that DES were more cost-effective for elderly patients
   in specific high-risk groups. Interpretation In a real-world setting,
   use of DES in all patients is less cost effective than in studies with
   selected patients. Use of these stents could be restricted to patients
   in high-risk groups.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider nearshore rotational currents directly forced
   by unsteady multidirectional wave breaking. Scaling relationships,
   simplified analytical solutions, and asymptotic limits are developed for
   the maximum forced cross-shore and longshore velocities. In all cases,
   forced longshore velocities are considerably larger than cross-shore
   velocities. On longshore-uniform beaches, strong fluctuating velocities
   are found for (i) large waves; (ii) strong directional spreading; and
   (iii) short peak wave periods. When topographic inhomogeneities control
   longshore scales of wave breaking, overall scaling changes and the
   largest fluctuating velocities are found for (a) large waves; (b) long
   wave periods; and (c) topographic features that vary quickly in the
   longshore direction. The ratio of fluctuating rotational velocities to
   mean longshore current does not depend on the wave height or period, but
   instead on the bottom friction, slope, deep water wave angle, and
   details of the wave spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the details of Titan's interaction with Saturn's
   magnetosphere, which includes formation and location of an ionopause,
   mass loading via ion pickup, and the effects of finite gyroradii. We
   present new interpretations of the Voyager 1 plasma instrument
   measurements not addressed by Hartle et al. (1982). Pickup ions H+ and
   H-2(+) dominate in the outermost region with respect to Titan's
   ``ionopause,{''} followed by CH4+ at intermediate distances and N-2(+)
   just outside the ``ionopause.{''} Mass loading and slowing down of the
   ambient plasma is observed to increase as the pickup ion mass increases
   with decreasing radial distance from Titan's ionosphere. H-2 and CH4 are
   molecules not originally included in the exosphere of Titan by Hartle
   and coworkers, and the pickup ions of H-2(+) and CH4+ are a new feature
   of our model calculations and should be present in Titan's exospheric
   region. Therefore Titan could be an important source of carbon to
   Saturn's magnetosphere. Finite gyroradius effects are identified in the
   plasma interaction with Titan's atmosphere, which results in an
   asymmetric removal of ambient plasma from Titan's exosphere region. The
   finite gyroradius effects also show that the observed hot keV ion
   component of the ambient plasma is a heavy ion such as N+/O+. A minimum
   ``ionopause{''} altitude of 4800 km is estimated by a new approach using
   mass loading.}},

Abstract = {{In injured tissues, the fibrin-fibronectin (FN) provisional matrix
   provides a framework for cell adhesion, migration, and repair. Effective
   repair and remodeling require a proper balance between extracellular
   matrix (ECM) deposition, contraction, and turnover. We utilized a
   three-dimensional (3D) fibrin-FN provisional matrix model to determine
   the contributions of the FN-binding integrin receptors alpha 5 beta 1
   and alpha 4 beta 1 to matrix contraction. CHO alpha 5 cells expressing
   alpha 4 beta 1, a receptor for FN's RGD cell-binding domain, were highly
   contractile, and cells were well spread on a 3D fibrin-FN matrix. In
   contrast, CHO alpha 4 cells expressing the alpha 4 beta 1 receptor for
   FN's alternatively spliced V region attached less efficiently to FN and
   were deficient in fibrin-FN matrix contraction. Surprisingly, cell
   adhesion and matrix contraction by CHO alpha 4 cells were dramatically
   enhanced, to levels equivalent to CHO alpha 5 cells, when proteolyzed FN
   was used in place of intact FN in the fibrin-FN matrix. Similar
   enhancement was observed when ligand binding by alpha 4 beta 1 integrins
   was activated by treatment with Mn++, but not by stimulation of actin
   organization with LPA. Therefore, alpha 4 beta 1-dependent cell
   responses to the provisional matrix are modulated by cleavage of matrix
   components. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The highly disturbed hot gas in elliptical galaxies, as revealed in many
   Chandra X-ray images, implies a source of energy in the galactic
   nucleus. In some elliptical galaxies, faint X-ray ``ghost{''} cavities
   appear without corresponding radio lobes. It has been suggested that
   ghost cavities are caused by short-lived activity with a timescale of
   similar to 10(3) - 10(4) yr, but this is difficult to understand within
   the popular paradigm of active galactic nuclei. We suggest an episode
   model for ghost cavities, invoking captures of red giant stars by the
   black hole located at the center of elliptical galaxies at a typical
   rate of 10(-5) yr(-1) per galaxy. The accretion of tidally disrupted red
   giant stars onto the black hole powers activity in a timescale of a few
   years. The total energy channeled into the jet/outflow during the
   cooling time of the hot gas is similar to 10(56) ergs, which is the
   typical work required to form the observed cavities. In this scenario,
   the faint cavities are produced by the feedback following accretion of
   the debris of the captured red giant stars onto the black holes. We
   apply the present model to several elliptical galaxies and find that it
   can explain the formation of the ghost cavities. This model can be
   tested in the future by comparisons between radio and X-ray
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Tobacco smoke inhibits monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity in vitro and
   in vivo, suggesting that MAO-B inhibition is a possible contributing
   factor to tobacco smoke addiction. Thus, MAO-B is a possible candidate
   gene for predisposition to smoking. The TaqIB polymorphism for the
   Dopamine D2 Receptor gene (DRD2) has been previously associated with
   smoking status, although with some contradictory results. We
   investigated whether genetic variants of MAO-B intron 13 and DRD2 TaqIB
   polymorphism could be associated with smoking status among control
   subjects. There was no association of the intron 13 polymorphism itself
   with smoking status in either men or women. Similarly, no association
   with smoking status was observed for the TaqIB polymorphism of DRD2
   itself. However, among men, there was an interaction between MAO-B
   intron 13 polymorphism and the DRD2 TaqIB polymorphisms, in which
   subjects carrying MAO-B allele A and genotype B12 of DRD2 were 2.50
   times (95\% CI= 1.05-5.95) more likely to be ever-smokers than the pool
   of men carrying all other genotype combinations. These results
   demonstrate that particular combinations of genotypes for MAO-B and DRD2
   genes are associated with significantly higher risk for smoking behavior
   in men, but not in women. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Cryptochrome 1 and 2 act as essential components of the central and
   peripheral circadian clocks for generation of circadian rhythms in
   mammals. Here we show that mouse cryptochrome 2 (mCRY2) is
   phosphorylated at Ser-557 in the liver, a well characterized peripheral
   clock tissue. The Ser-557- phosphorylated form accumulates in the liver
   during the night in parallel with mCRY2 protein, and the phosphorylated
   form reaches its maximal level at late night, preceding the peak-time of
   the protein abundance by similar to 4 h in both light-dark cycle and
   constant dark conditions. The Ser-557- phosphorylated form of mCRY2 is
   localized in the nucleus, whereas mCRY2 protein is located in both the
   cytoplasm and nucleus. Importantly, phosphorylation of mCRY2 at Ser-557
   allows subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-553 by glycogen synthase
   kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), resulting in efficient degradation of mCRY2
   by a proteasome pathway. As assessed by phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta at
   Ser-9, which negatively regulates the kinase activity, GSK-3 beta
   exhibits a circadian rhythm in its activity with a peak from late night
   to early morning when Ser-557 of mCRY2 is highly phosphorylated.
   Altogether, the present study demonstrates an important role of
   sequential phosphorylation at Ser-557/Ser-553 for destabilization of
   mCRY2 and illustrates a model that the circadian regulation of mCRY2
   phosphorylation contributes to rhythmic degradation of mCRY2 protein.}},

Abstract = {{In several pathological conditions, epithelial cells demonstrate a
   breakdown of barrier function and acquire an invasive phenotype.
   Endothelial cells in particular are maintained in a mesenchymal state
   during the cell invasion phase of angiogenesis. We show here that
   tyrosine phosphorylation of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin at
   two critical tyrosines, Tyr-658 and Tyr-731, via tyrosine kinase
   activation or phosphatase inactivation was sufficient to prevent the
   binding of p120- and beta-catenin, respectively, to the cytoplasmic tail
   of VE-cadherin. In fact, phosphorylation at either site led to the
   inhibition of cell barrier function. Cells expressing wild-type
   VE-cadherin showed decreased cell migration compared with cells lacking
   VE-cadherin, whereas expression of VE-cadherin with a simple
   phosphomimetic tyrosine-to-glutamic acid mutation of Y658E or Y731E was
   sufficient to restore the migratory response. These findings demonstrate
   that a single phosphorylation event within the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic
   tail is sufficient to maintain cells in a mesenchymal state.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms of endosome biogenesis and maintenance are largely
   unknown. The small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7 are key determinants of early
   and late endosomes, organizing effector proteins into specific membrane
   subdomains. Whether such Rab machineries ate indefinitely maintained on
   membranes or can disassemble in the course of cargo transport is an open
   question. Here, we combined novel image-analysis algorithms with fast
   live-cell imaging. We found that the level of Rab5 dynamically
   fluctuates on individual early endosomes, linked by fusion and fission
   events into a network in time. Within it, degradative cargo concentrates
   in progressively fewer and larger endosomes that migrate from the cell
   periphery to the center where Rab5 is rapidly replaced with Rab7. The
   class C VPS/HOPS complex, an established GEF for Rab7 interacts with
   Rab5 and is required for Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion. Our results reveal
   unexpected dynamics of Rab domains and suggest Rab conversion as the
   mechanism of cargo progression between early and late endosomes.}},

Abstract = {{In Anopheles dirus glutathione transferase D3-3, there are electrostatic
   interactions between the negatively charged glutamyl alpha-carboxylate
   group of glutathione, the positively charged Arg-66, and the negatively
   charged Asp-100. This ionic interaction is stabilized by a network of
   hydrogen bonds from Ser-65, Thr-158, Thr-162, and a conserved
   water-mediated contact. This alternating ionic bridge interaction
   between negatively and positively charged residues stabilized by a
   network of hydrogen bonding we have named an electron-sharing network.
   We show that the electron- sharing network assists the glutamyl
   alpha-carboxylate of glutathione to function as a catalytic base
   accepting the proton from the thiol group forming an anionic
   glutathione, which is a crucial step in the glutathione transferase (
   GST) catalysis. Kinetic studies demonstrate that the mutation of
   electron- sharing network residues results in a decreased ability to
   lower the pK(a) of the thiol group of glutathione. Although the residues
   that contribute to the electron- sharing network are not conserved in
   the primary sequence, structural characterizations indicate that the
   presence of the network can be mapped to the same region in all GST
   classes. A structural diversification but functional conservation
   suggests a significant role for the electron- sharing network in
   catalysis as the purpose was maintained during the divergent evolution
   of GSTs. This network appears to be a functionally conserved motif that
   contributes to the ``base-assisted deprotonation{''} model suggested to
   be essential for the glutathione ionization step of the catalytic
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{This Letter presents the fine structure of energy levels for the edge
   states of a Haldane chain. In order to investigate the edge states, we
   have performed high field and multifrequency electron spin resonance
   (ESR) measurements of finite length S = 1 antiferromagnetic chains in
   Y2BaNi0.96Mg0.04O5. Owing to the high spectral resolution by high fields
   and high frequencies, observed ESR signals can be separated into the
   contributions of the finite chains with various chain lengths. Our
   results clearly show that the edge spins actually interact with each
   other through the quantum spin chain and the interaction depends on the
   chain length N. This N dependence has been obtained experimentally for
   the first time, and shows that the correlation length xi in the real
   system is somewhat larger than that calculated by a simple Heisenberg
   model.}},

Abstract = {{The tropics have been suggested as the drivers of global ocean and
   atmosphere circulation and biogeochemical cycling during the extreme
   warmth of the Cretaceous period(1,2); but the links between orbital
   forcing, freshwater runoff and the biogeochemistry of continental
   margins in extreme greenhouse conditions are not fully understood. Here
   we present Cretaceous records of geochemical tracers for freshwater
   runoff obtained from a sediment core off the Ivory Coast that indicate
   that alternating periods of arid and humid African climate were driven
   by orbital precession. Our simulations of the precession-driven patterns
   of river discharge with a global climate model suggest that ocean anoxia
   and black shale sedimentation were directly caused by high river
   discharge, and occurred specifically when the northern equinox coincided
   with perihelion ( the minimum distance between the Sun and the Earth).
   We conclude that, in a warm climate, the oceans off tropical continental
   margins respond rapidly and sensitively to even modest changes in river
   discharge.}},

Volume = {{437}},

Pages = {{231-234}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopes and optical tweezers are widely used to probe
   the mechanical properties of individual molecules and molecular
   interactions, by exerting mechanical forces that induce transitions such
   as unfolding or dissociation. These transitions often occur under
   nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects -
   features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium
   information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems(1-5)
   allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to
   thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be
   applicable to single-molecule force measurements(6) and have already
   provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin(7,8).
   Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem(9) can be used to
   determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes
   occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby
   providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical
   tweezers(10) to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with
   the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin(11) and an RNA
   three-helix junction(12). The resultant work distributions are then
   analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the
   difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant
   differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing
   effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure.}},

Abstract = {{We look for the minimal particle content which is necessary to add to
   the standard model in order to have a complete unification of gauge
   couplings and gravity at the weakly coupled heterotic string scale.
   Using the current precision electroweak data, we find that the presence
   of a vector-like fermion at an intermediate scale and a non-standard
   hypercharge normalization are in general sufficient to achieve this goal
   at two-loop level. If one requires the extra matter scale to be below
   the TeV scale, then it is found that the addition of three vector-like
   fermion doublets with a mass around 700 GeV yields a perfect
   string-scale unification, provided that the affine levels are k(y) =
   13/3, k(2) = 1 and k(3) = 2, as in the SU(5) circle times SU(5)
   string-GUT. Furthermore, if supersymmetry is broken at the unification
   scale, the Higgs mass is predicted in the range 125-170 GeV, depending
   on the precise values of the top quark mass and tan beta parameter. (c)

Abstract = {{The polyoxometalate (POM) chemistry world has been experiencing an
   unparalleled development of rapid synthesis of new compounds and slow
   development of POM-based functional materials and devices. Meanwhile,
   researchers in the microcapsule world, encouraged by the introduction of
   the layer-by-layer method, are pursuing good components for constructing
   functional capsule devices. Here, in view of the versatile properties
   that POM-based microcapsules may possess, various types of
   POM-polyelectrolyte composite microcapsules were constructed using the
   layer-by-layer method. Microscopy reveals that polyoxometalates form
   nanoparticles on the shell in the presence of cationic polyelectrolytes.
   These nanoparticles connected with polyelectrolytes constitute the shell
   and support the microcapsule from collapse after drying, and this is an
   interesting characteristic different from those of common composite and
   polyelectrolyte capsules. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV-vis
   absorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to
   examine the properties of the POMs in the microcapsules. The obtained
   microcapsules exhibit higher thermal stability than polyelectrolyte
   microcapsules. Furthermore, the functions of POMs were maintained when
   they were assembled into microcapsules. It is proved that microcapsules
   bearing POMs with redox activity can provide a reduction environment,
   which can lead to the realization of in situ synthesis of materials, and
   that microcapsules with photoluminescent POMs as a component can also
   have a photoluminescent property, providing a way to develop functional
   capsule devices. This work may provide an opportunity to enrich both the
   polyoxometalate chemistry and the capsule field.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{A new four-dimensional intermolecular potential-energy surface for the
   H-2-CO complex is presented. The ab initio points have been computed on
   a five-dimensional grid including the dependence on the H-H separation
   (the C-O separation was fixed). The surface has then been obtained by
   averaging over the intramolecular vibration of H-2. The coupled-cluster
   supermolecular method with single, double, and noniterative triple
   excitations has been used to calculate the interaction energy. The
   correlation part of the interaction energy has been obtained from
   extrapolations based on calculations in a series of basis sets. An
   analytical fit of the ab initio potential-energy surface has the global
   minimum of -93.049 cm(-1) at the intermolecular separation of 7.92 bohr
   for the linear geometry with the C atom pointing toward the H-2
   molecule. For the other linear geometry, with the O atom pointing toward
   H-2, the local minimum of -72.741 cm(-1) has been found for the
   intermolecular separation of 7.17 bohr. The potential has been used to
   calculate the rovibrational energy levels of the para-H-2-CO complex.
   The results agree very well with those observed by McKellar {[}A. R. W.
   McKellar J. Chem. Phys. 108, 1811 (1998)]: the discrepancies are smaller
   than 0.1 cm(-1). The calculated dissociation energy is equal to 19.527
   cm(-1) and significantly smaller than the value of 22 cm(-1) estimated
   from the experiment. Predictions of rovibrational energy levels for
   ortho-H-2-CO have also been done and can serve as a guidance to assign
   recorded experimental spectra. The interaction second virial coefficient
   has been calculated and compared with the experimental data. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Changes in the surface chain structure and the critical surface tension
   of poly (trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) film under uniaxial drawing
   were examined by polarized attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR)
   spectroscopy and contact angle measurement. It was observed from the
   stress-draw ratio curve and density measurement that the strain-induced
   crystallization occurs at the draw ratio of 2.5. From the ATR-IR
   spectra, it was also realized that the surface chain structure changes
   with the draw ratio, showing a remarkable increase in the surface
   crystallinity at the draw ratio between two and three. The critical
   surface tension of uniaxially drawn films increases with the draw ratio
   due to an increase in the surface crystallinity developed by the
   strain-induced crystallization. It is concluded that the surface
   properties of PTT film such as the chain structure at the surface and
   the critical surface tension are very closely related to the condition
   of uniaxial drawing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Computer simulation investigation of the water-benzene interface in a

   conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B}},

Volume = {{109}},

Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{The dependence of the properties of the water-benzene system on the
   thermodynamic conditions in a broad range of temperatures and pressures
   has been investigated by computer simulation methods. For this purpose,
   Monte Carlo simulations have been performed at 23 different
   thermodynamic states, ranging from ambient to supercritical conditions.
   The density profiles of the water and benzene molecules have been
   determined at each of the thermodynamic states investigated. Information
   on the dependence of the mutual solubility of the two components in each
   other as well as of the width of the interface on the temperature and
   pressure has been extracted from these profiles. The width of the
   interface has been found to increase with increasing temperature up to a
   certain point, where it diverges. The temperature of this divergence
   corresponds to the mixing of the two phases. The determination of the
   critical mixing temperature at various pressures allowed us to estimate
   the upper critical curve, separating the two-phase and one-phase liquid
   systems, of the phase diagram of the simulated water-benzene system. In
   analyzing the preferential orientation of the interfacial molecules
   relative to the interface, it has been found that the main orientational
   preference of the benzene molecules is to lie parallel with the plane of
   the interface, and the water molecules penetrated deepest into the
   benzene phase prefer to stay perpendicular to the interface, pointing by
   one of their O-H bonds almost straight toward the benzene phase, whereas
   the waters located at the aqueous side of the interface are
   preferentially aligned parallel with the interfacial plane. Although the
   strength of the observed orientational preferences decreases rapidly
   with increasing temperature, the preferred orientations themselves are
   found to be independent of the thermodynamic conditions. Remains of the
   orientational preferences of the molecules are found to be present up to
   temperatures as high as 650 K. The analysis of the relative orientation
   of the neighboring water-benzene pairs has revealed that the radius of
   the first hydration shell of the benzene molecules is independent of the
   thermodynamic conditions, even if the system consists of one single
   phase. It has been found that the nearest water neighbors of the benzene
   molecules are preferentially located above and below the benzene ring,
   whereas more distant water neighbors, belonging still to the first
   hydration shell, prefer to stay within the plane of the benzene
   molecule. In the two-phase systems the dipole vector of the nearest
   waters has been found to be preferentially perpendicular to the vector
   pointing from the center of the benzene molecule to the water 0 atom.}},

Journal = {{RADIO SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] Several chains of receivers, measuring total electron content
   (TEC) during passes of satellites in the U. S. Navy Ionospheric
   Measuring System (NIMS), are operated at northern high latitudes by
   members of the International Ionospheric Tomography Community (IITC).
   Results are presented here of nearly simultaneous latitude-altitude
   images of the ionosphere over Scandinavia, Greenland, and Alaska,
   generated from IITC data obtained on 20 September 2001 and interpreted
   in the context of an IMF-dependent convection model. The images are
   compared with output from a coupled thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere
   model and also with maps of high-latitude TEC generated from GPS
   measurements. With B-z and B-y both weakly negative, the images and map
   reveal plasma features of a two-cell convection pattern rotated slightly
   to earlier local magnetic times. The tomographic images provide details
   of map features such as a tongue of ionization created by solar EUV
   radiation on the dayside and entrained by convection into the polar cap
   from the western Russian sector. Combining latitude versus altitude
   tomographic images generated in different longitudinal sectors from
   polar-orbiting beacon satellites such as those of NIMS with TEC maps
   from GPS offers an emerging opportunity for polar aeronomic studies,
   especially if further related to synoptic convection measurements. The
   results also demonstrate the potential role of wide-scale radio
   tomography in the verification of ionospheric models.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated acid-catalyzed polycondensation of alkoxysilane
   monomers in liquid crystalline phases of nonionic CnEm surfactants. The
   liquid crystalline phase is retained when the monomers polymerize. The
   high molecular weight molecules formed phase separate from the mesophase
   and are subsequently organized by it to form micron-sized particles. A
   variety of particle morphologies are formed by organization of the
   polymer particles in the mesophase. For condensation of
   dimethyldimethoxysilane (DMS, with trimethoxysilane, TMS as crosslinker)
   in hexagonal and lamellar phases, specific reaction conditions, viz.
   slow condensation kinetics and low crosslink density, give rod-like
   particles in hexagonal phases and sheet-like structures in lamellar
   phases. However, when higher acid concentrations are used, the reaction
   kinetics accelerates and irregular particles form. Irregular particles
   also form when the fraction of trifunctional crosslinker is increased,
   and finally complex flower-like structures form for condensation of
   trimethoxysilane in the hexagonal phase. The particle morphology formed
   is crucially dependent on the details of the polycondensation rate,
   crosslinker density and surfactant-monomer/oligomer interactions. (c)

Abstract = {{We investigated the influence of induced fit of the androgen receptor
   binding pocket on free energies of ligand binding. On the basis of a
   novel alignment procedure using flexible docking, molecular dynamics
   simulations, and linear-interaction energy analysis, we simulated the
   binding of 119 molecules representing six compound classes. The
   superposition of the ligand molecules emerging from the combined
   protocol served as input for Raptor, a receptor-modeling tool based on
   multidimensional QSAR allowing for ligand-dependent induced fit.
   Throughout our study, protein flexibility was explicitly accounted for.
   The model converged at a crossvalidated r(2) = 0.858 (88 training
   compounds) and yielded a predictive r(2) = 0.792 (26 test compounds),
   thereby predicting the binding affinity of all compounds close to their
   experimental value. We then challenged the model by testing five
   molecules not belonging to compound classes used to train the model: the
   IC50 values were predicted within a factor of 4.5 compared to the
   experimental data. The demonstrated predictivity of the model suggests
   that our approach may well be beneficial for both drug discovery and the
   screening of environmental chemicals for endocrine-disrupting effects, a
   problem that has recently become a cause for concern among scientists,
   environmental advocates, and politicians alike.}},

Abstract = {{The crystallization rates of poly(3-alkyl thiophene) (P3AT) cocrystals
   having different alkyl chain length (e.g. hexyl and octyl) of the
   components are measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   technique. Two pairs of cocrystals with varying compositions of the
   components viz. poly(3-octyl thiophene) (P3OT(R), regioregularity 89
   mol\%) and poly(3-hexyl thiophene) {[}P3HT(R), regioregularity 92 mol\%
   and P3HT-2 regioregularity 82 mol\%] are used. In both the systems the
   isothermal temperature range (TR) in the same time scale of
   crystallization is found to decrease with increasing alkyl chain length
   in the blends. The crystallization rate at the same T-c decreases with
   increasing alkyl chain length P3AT concentration and the Avrami exponent
   values of cocrystals are same with those of the component values. The
   low Avrami exponent values (0.23-1.16) in all the samples suggest the
   presence of rigid amorphous portion which can not diffuse out quickly
   from the crystal growth front (soft impingement). Analysis of
   crystallization rate using Laurintzen-Hoffman (L-H) growth rate theory
   indicates that there is regime-I to regime-II transition in all the
   samples. The product of lateral (sigma) and end surface energy
   (sigma(e)) values are found to decrease with increasing the
   concentration of longer alkyl chain P3AT in the blend. Analysis of a
   values according to a theory of Hoffman et al. {[}Hoffman JD, Miller RL,
   Marand H, Rotiman DR. Macromolecules 1992;25:2221. {[}14]] indicates
   that there is chain extension of the components in the melt of the
   blends, however, the entropy of cocrystallization has different sign to
   the two systems. Cocrystallization in P3HT(R)/P3OT(R) system is an
   entropy driven process but that in P3HT(2)/P3OT(R) system is entropy
   forbidden process. A possible explanation of cocrystallization in the
   later system has been attributed from small interaction between the
   components. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{16730-16735}},

Abstract = {{Octupolar molecules are generally believed to be of potential use in
   developing nonlinear optical materials owing to the fact that they do
   not easily form molecular aggregates. This is often put against the
   conjectured drawback that electric fields have no poling, or ordering,
   effect for this class of molecules because of the lack of a permanent
   ground state dipole moment. In this paper, we analyze this notion in
   some detail and present results from molecular dynamics computer
   simulations of an ensemble of a prototypical octupolar molecule, the
   1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB) molecule, dissolved in
   chloroform. It is found that TATB molecules indeed show rather
   significant dipole moments in solutions because of the dual action of
   the thermal motions of the atoms and the strong intermolecular
   interactions. Applied electric fields accordingly show significant
   effects on the orientations of the molecular dipole moments. We also
   find that TATB molecules can aggregate because of the strong
   hydrogen-bonding interactions between the molecules, though they lack a
   static permanent dipole moment. Thus, the simulation results for TATB
   molecules in solution present us with a totally different notion about
   the collective properties of octupolar molecules. Taking account of
   quantum chemistry results, we found that the collective molecular
   nonlinear optical (NLO) properties are enhanced after the onset of the
   electric field, showing significant anisotropic characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical analysis of a remarkable phenomenon evinced by
   a periodic structurally chiral material-for example, a chiral sculptured
   thin film (STF) or a chiral liquid crystal-with a central 90
   degrees-twist defect illuminated with normally incident, circularly
   polarized light. Based on the coupled-wave theory (CWT), an approximate
   but closed-form solution of the relevant boundary-value problem is
   obtained in terms of a 4 X 4 CWT transmission matrix. The CWT
   transmission matrix is decomposed into two terms. The first term favours
   total transmission in the central part of the Bragg regime of the
   axially excited, structurally chiral material, while the second term
   favours total reflection in the whole Bragg regime. When the thickness
   of the structurally chiral material is relatively small, the second term
   is dominated by the first, which gives rise to a co-handed transmittance
   peak in the centre of the Bragg regime. As the thickness increases, the
   second term becomes significant and interferes with the first term such
   that the transmission matrix is isomorphic to that of a defect-free
   structurally chiral material-except in a tiny wavelength-regime wherein
   the L-infinity-norms of the two terms become identical to engender the
   total-reflection feature. Hence, the co-handed transmittance peak
   diminishes (and eventually vanishes) as the thickness increases and is
   replaced by a cross-handed reflectance peak. The bandwidths of the two
   peaks depend, in different ways, on the local birefringence of the
   structurally chiral material.}},

Abstract = {{Using the acoustic startle reflex, prepulse inhibition (PPI) is
   typically demonstrated by the interaction between two auditory stimuli
   presented in close temporal proximity. When a startle-eliciting pulse
   stimulus is shortly preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus, the reaction
   to the former is attenuated in comparison to when the pulse stimulus is
   presented alone. The present experiment evaluated the influence of
   different prepulse and pulse intensities upon the expression of PPI by
   additionally taking into account individual differences in startle
   reactivity. To this end, we subdivided a cohort of 102 mice into three
   subsets of equal size differing in startle responsiveness, and evaluated
   PPI using three levels of prepulse stimulus in combination with three
   intensities of pulse stimulus. Our results revealed additive as well as
   complex interactive effects amongst individual's reactivity, pulse
   intensity and prepulse intensity. At the same time, additional issues
   concerning the quantification of PPI are highlighted, especially when
   startle reactivity differs considerably between comparison groups. We
   concluded that the variation in pulse intensity represents a valuable
   addition to PPI assessment in general, and especially in genetically
   modified mice. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility and limits in performing tomographic bioluminescence
   imaging with a combined optical-PET (OPET) system were explored by
   simulating its image formation process. A micro-MRI based virtual mouse
   phantom was assigned appropriate tissue optical properties to each of
   its segmented internal organs at wavelengths spanning the emission
   spectrum of the firefly luciferase at 37 degrees C. The TOAST
   finite-element code was employed to simulate the diffuse transport of
   photons emitted from bioluminescence sources in the mouse. OPET
   measurements were simulated for single-point, two-point and distributed
   bioluminescence sources located in different organs such as the liver,
   the kidneys and the gut. An expectation maximization code was employed
   to recover the intensity and location of these simulated sources. It was
   found that spectrally resolved measurements were necessary in order to
   perform tomographic bioluminescence imaging. The true location of
   emission sources could be recovered if the mouse background optical
   properties were known a priori. The assumption of a homogeneous optical
   property background proved inadequate for describing photon transport in
   optically heterogeneous tissues and led to inaccurate source
   localization in the reconstructed images. The simulation results pointed

   cancer: Association with growth factor receptor expression and tamoxifen

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical data indicate that estrogen
   receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-negative (ER+/PR-) breast
   cancers are less sensitive to tamoxifen than are ER+/PR+ tumors. It has
   also been reported that tamoxifen may be less effective in tumors that
   overexpress either HER-2 or HER-1 (epidermal growth factor receptor) and
   that signaling through these receptors reduces PR expression in
   experimental models. We hypothesized that ER+/PR- breast tumors are more
   likely than ER+/PR+ breast tumors to have an aggressive phenotype, to
   express HER-1 and overexpress HER-2, and are less likely to benefit from
   tamoxifen adjuvant therapy. Methods: Clinical and biological features of
   31415 patients with ER+/PR+ tumors were compared with those of 13404
   patients with ER+/PR- tumors. Association between disease-free survival
   (DFS) and HER-1 and HER-2 status was analyzed in a subset of 11399
   patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Hazard ratios (HRs) and
   95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox regression or
   Kaplan-Meier analyses, and all statistical tests were two-sided.
   Results: ER+/PR- tumors were more frequent in older patients, were
   larger in size, had a higher S-phase fraction, and were more likely to
   be aneuploid than ER+/PR+ tumors. Furthermore, three times as many
   ER+/PR- tumors as ER+/PR+ tumors expressed HER-1 (25\% versus 8\%;
   P<.001) and 50\% more overexpressed HER-2 (21\% versus 14\%; P<.001).
   Among all tamoxifen-treated women, recurrence was higher among women
   with HER-1-expressing tumors than with HER-1-negative tumors (HR = 1.9,
   95\% CI = 1.0 to 3.5; P=.05); a stronger association between worse DFS
   and HER-2 overexpression was observed (FIR = 2.3, 95\% CI = 1.2 to 4.3;
   P=.006). However, results varied by PR status. Among tamoxifen-treated
   women with ER+/PR+ tumors, HER-1 or HER-2 status was not associated with
   worse DFS. Among women with ER+/PR- tumors, however, both HER-1
   expression (HR = 2.4, 95\% CI = 1.0 to 5.4; P=.036) and HER-2
   overexpression (HR = 2.6,95\% CI = 1.1 to 6.0; P=.022) were associated
   with a higher likelihood of recurrence. Conclusions: ER+/PR- tumors
   express higher levels of HER-1 and HER-2 and display more aggressive
   features than ER+/PR+ tumors. As in laboratory models, lack of PR
   expression in ER+ tumors may be a surrogate marker of aberrant growth
   factor signaling that could contribute to the tamoxifen resistance
   observed in these tumors.}},

Title = {{New constant-temperature operating mode for graphite calorimeter at
   LNE-LNHB}},

Abstract = {{The realization of the unit of absorbed dose at LNE-LNHB is based on
   calorimetry with the present GR8 graphite calorimeter. For this reason
   the calorimetric technique must be maintained, developed and improved in
   the laboratory. The usual quasi-adiabatic operating mode at LNHB is
   based on the thermal feedback between the core (sensitive element) and
   the jacket (adjacent body). When a core-jacket temperature difference is
   detected, a commercially available analogue PID (Proportional, Integral,
   Derivative) controller sends to the jacket an amount of electrical power
   to reduce this difference. Nevertheless, the core and jacket
   temperatures increase with irradiations and electrical calibrations
   whereas the surrounding is maintained at a fixed temperature to shield
   against the room temperature variations. At radiotherapy dose rates,
   fewer than ten measurements, or electrical calibrations, per day can be
   performed. This paper describes the new constant-temperature operating
   mode which has been implemented recently to improve flexibility in use
   and, to some extent, accuracy. The core and the jacket temperatures are
   maintained at fixed temperatures. A steady state is achieved without
   irradiation. Then, under irradiation, the electrical power needed to
   maintain the assigned temperature in the core is reduced by the amount
   of heat generated by ionizing radiation. The difference between these
   electrical powers, without and with irradiation, gives the mean absorbed
   dose rate to the core. The quality of this electrical power substitution
   measurement is strongly dependent upon the quality of the core and
   jacket thermal control. The core temperature is maintained at the set
   value using a digital PID regulator developed at the laboratory with
   LabView software on PC for this purpose. This regulator is versatile and
   particularly well suited for calorimetry purposes. Measurements in a
   cobalt-60 beam have shown no significant difference (< 0.09\%) between
   the two operating modes, with an equivalent reproducibility (1 sigma <
   0.06\%). These results corroborate the negligible difference of heat
   transfer between steady and irradiation periods when working in
   quasi-adiabatic mode with thermal feedback between the core and the
   jacket. The new constant-temperature mode allows numerous and fully
   automated measurements. The electrical calibration is an integral part
   of the measurement; no extra runs are needed. It also allows faster
   thermal equilibrium before starting runs. Moreover the quality of vacuum
   within the gaps between the bodies is less important.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: p53-Inducible ribonucleotide reductase small subunit 2 (p53R2)
   encodes a 351-amino-acid peptide, which catalyzes conversion of
   ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides
   required for DNA replication and repair. A recent study reported that a
   point mutation (G/T) in the p53 binding sequence in a colon cancer cell
   line completely impaired p53R2 protein activity.
   METHODS: We screened the p53R2 gene coding regions and a regulatory
   region which contains a p53 binding sequence in 100 patients with
   colorectal adenoma and 100 control subjects using PCR, cold SSCP, and
   direct DNA sequencing.
   RESULTS: Although we did not identify genetic variation in all nine
   exons, four regulatory-region variants were found, of which three were
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (nt 1 789 C/G, nt 1 928 A/G, 1
   933 T/C), and one was 20 bp insertion which replaced a ATTTT between nt
   1 831 and 1 835. Additionally, we determined the frequency of these
   p53R2 variants in a recently concluded case-control study of incident
   sporadic colorectal adenomas (163 cases and 210 controls).
   CONCLUSION: Although more detailed functional characterizations of these
   polymorphisms remain to be undertaken, these polymorphic sites may be
   useful for identifying alleles associated with mis-splicing, additional
   transcript factors and, more generally, in cancer-susceptibility
   association studies. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{AIM: To analyze retrospectively, our results about patients who
   underwent surgical treatment for adenocarcinoma of the cardia in
   relation to age, in order to evaluate surgical problems and prognostic
   factors.
   METHODS: From January 1987 to March 2003, 140 patients with
   adenocarcinoma of the cardia underwent resection in the authors'
   institution. They were divided into three groups with regard to age.
   Patients <70 and >60 year old (31) were excluded; we also excluded 18
   out of 109 patients with poor general status or systemic metastases. So,
   we compared 51 elderly (>= 70 year old) and 58 younger patients (<= 60
   year old). The treatment was esophagectomy for type I tumors, and
   extended gastrectomy and distal esophagectomy for type II and III
   lesions.
   RESULTS: Laparotomy was carried out in 91 patients (83.4\%), 38 in the
   elderly (74.5\%) and 53 in younger patients (91.3\%, P<0.05). Primary
   resection was performed in 81 cases (89\%) without significant
   differences between the two groups. Postoperative death was higher in
   the elderly (12.1\%) than the other group (4.1\%, P<0.05), while
   morbidity was similar in both groups. A curative resection (R0) was
   performed in 59 patients (72.8\%), 69.6\% in the elderly and 75\% in the
   younger group (P>0.05). The overall 3- and 5-year survival rates were
   26.7\% and 17.8\% respectively for the elderly and 40.7\% and 35.1\%
   respectively for younger patients (P = 0.1544). Survival rates were
   significantly associated with R0 resection, pathological node-positive
   category and tumor differentiation in both groups.
   CONCLUSION: As the age of the general population increases, more elderly
   patients with gastric cardia cancer will be candidates for surgical
   resection. Age alone should not preclude surgical treatment in elderly
   patients with gastric cardia cancer and a tumor resection can be carried
   out safely. Certainly, we should take care in defining the surgical
   treatment in elderly patients, particularly as regarding the surgical
   approach; although the surgical approach does not influence the survival
   rate, the transhiatal way still remains the best one due, to the lower
   incidence of respiratory morbidity and thoracic pain. (C) 2005 The WJG

Abstract = {{Magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR (SSNMR) studies of the beta 1
   immunoglobulin binding domain of protein G (GB1) are presented. Chemical
   shift correlation spectra at 11.7 T (500 MHz H-1 frequency) were
   employed to identify signals specific to each amino acid residue type
   and to establish backbone connectivities. High sensitivity and
   resolution facilitated the detection and assignment of every N-15 and
   C-13 site, including the N-terminal (M1) (NH3)-N-15, the C-terminal
   (E56) C-13', and side-chain resonances from residues exhibiting
   fast-limit conformational exchange near room temperature. The assigned
   spectra lend novel insight into the structure and dynamics of
   microcrystalline GB1. Secondary isotropic chemical shifts report on
   conformation, enabling a detailed comparison of the microcrystalline
   state with the conformation of single crystals and the protein in
   solution; the consistency of backbone conformation in these three
   preparations is the best among proteins studied so far. Signal
   intensities and line widths vary as a function of amino acid position
   and temperature. High-resolution spectra are observed near room
   temperature (280 K) and at < 180 K, whereas resolution and sensitivity
   greatly degrade substantially near 210 K; the magnitude of this effect
   is greatest among the side chains of residues at the intermolecular
   interface of the microcrystal lattice, which we attribute to
   intermediate-rate translational diffusion of solvent molecules near the
   glass transition. These features of GB1 will enable its use as an
   excellent model protein not only for SSNMR methods development but also
   for fundamental studies of protein thermodynamics in the solid state.}},

   interleukin-1 beta-induced chemokine secretion via MAP kinase signaling

Abstract = {{Intestinal epithelial cells can be induced to secrete the chemokine
   interleukin (IL)-8 during inflammation. The PAR-2 receptor is believed
   to play a proinflammatory role and is expressed in gut epithelial cells.
   The aim was to investigate PAR-2 signaling in Caco-2 intestinal
   epithelial cells, with respect to chemokine secretion. Activation of
   PAR-2 by high concentrations of the synthetic activating peptide
   (SLIGKV) did not induce secretion of IL-8, in contrast to stimulation
   with IL-1 beta. However, upon simultaneous treatment with activating
   peptide and IL-1 beta, a potentiating effect of PAR-2 stimulation was
   seen, resulting in a fivefold increase of IL-8. Available data suggest
   that NF-kappa B activation is required for IL-8 gene expression. Unlike
   IL-1 beta, PAR-2 stimulation did not activate NF-kappa B, which may
   explain the lack of IL-8 expression. However, PAR-2 stimulation led to
   rapid phosphorylation of two MAP kinases, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. ERK1/2 is
   known to activate the transcription factor AP-1, also involved in
   upregulation of IL-8 gene transcription. Inhibition of p38 MAPK led to
   decreased IL-8 following stimulation with IL-1 beta and/or activating
   peptide. These results suggest that maximal IL-8 expression requires
   coordination of several signaling pathways. Thus, identifying
   antagonists to the PAR-2 receptor may be beneficial by inhibiting
   potentiation of a proinflammatory response, through inhibition of p38
   and ERK MAP kinases. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The unique properties of magnetic nanocrystals provide them with high
   potential as key probes and vectors in the next generation of biomedical
   applications. Although superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocrystals have
   been extensively studied as excellent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   probes for various cell trafficking, gene expression, and cancer
   diagnosis, further development of in vivo MRI applications has been very
   limited. Here, we describe in vivo diagnosis of cancer, utilizing a
   well-defined magnetic nanocrystal probe system with multiple
   capabilities, such as small size, strong magnetism, high
   biocompatibility, and the possession of active functionality for desired
   receptors. Our magnetic nanocrystals are conjugated to a
   cancer-targeting antibody, Herceptin, and subsequent utilization of
   these conjugates as MRI probes has been successfully demonstrated for
   the monitoring of in vivo selective targeting events of human cancer
   cells implanted in live mice. Further conjugation of these nanocrystal
   probes with fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies enables both in vitro and
   ex vivo optical detection of cancer as well as in vivo MRI, which are
   potentially applicable for an advanced multimodal detection system. Our
   study finds that high performance in vivo MR diagnosis of cancer is
   achievable by utilizing improved and multifunctional material properties
   of iron oxide nanocrystal probes.}},

Abstract = {{An observational and modeling study of a bora event that occurred during

   aircraft in-situ measurements and airborne remote-sensing observations
   indicate the presence of strong low-level wave breaking and alternating
   surface wakes and jets along the Croatian coastline over the Adriatic
   Sea. The observed features are well captured by a high-resolution COAMPS
   simulation. Analysis of the observations and modeling results indicate
   that the long-extending wakes above the boundary layer are induced by
   dissipation associated with the low-level wave breaking, which locally
   tends to accelerate the boundary layer flow beneath the breaking.
   Farther downstream of the high peaks, a hydraulic jump occurs in the
   boundary layer, which creates surface wakes. Downstream of lower-terrain
   ( passes), the boundary layer flow stays strong, resembling
   supercritical flow.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy and fate of pesticides in soil strongly depend on sorption
   reversibility that is known to decrease with increasing contact time
   (aging). We elucidated the aging dynamics of eight different pesticides
   in two contrasting agricultural soils of tropical Brazil (Ustox and
   Psamments), using batch equilibrium experiments and sequential
   extractions of field samples. Adsorption was best described by Langmuir
   isotherms for the entire and by Freundlich equations for the lower
   concentration range. In field samples, water extractable pesticide
   fractions mostly dissipated at least twice as fast as did the solvent
   extractable fractions. Hence, in comparison to 0 days K-OC values,
   measured field K-OC values were higher by a factor of 2.6-38 for the
   clayey Ustox and 2.1-72 for the sandy Psamments toward the end of the
   experimental period at 80 days after application. The extent of such
   aging basically increased with increasing polarity of the pesticide. An
   absolute enrichment of polar pesticides within the final exhaustive
   acetone-ethyl acetate-water extracts was observed during the
   experimental period, so that we may deduce that pesticides had
   redistributed into stronger sorption sites. The time course of the K-OC
   development was well-described using a semiempirical equation, which had
   been employed for temperate soils before.}},

Title = {{Paleomagnetic quantification of upper-plate deformation during Miocene
   detachment faulting in the Mohave Mountains, Arizona}},
Journal = {{GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Paleomagnetic data from Miocene (similar to 20 Ma) volcanic rocks and
   dikes of west central Arizona reveal the tilt history of Proterozoic
   crystalline rocks in the hanging wall of the Chemehuevi-Whipple
   Mountains detachment fault. We obtained magnetization data from dikes
   and flows in two structural blocks encompassing Crossman Peak and
   Standard Wash in the Mohave Mountains. In the Crossman block the dike
   swarm records two components of primary magnetization: (1) CNH, a normal
   polarity, high-unblocking-temperature or high-coercivity component
   (inclination, I = 48.5 degrees, declination, D = 6.4 degrees), and (2)
   CRHm, a reversed polarity, high-temperature or high-coercivity component
   (I = -33.6 degrees, D = 197.5 degrees). Argon age spectra imply that the
   dikes have not been reheated above 300 degrees C since their
   emplacement, and a baked-contact test suggests that the magnetization is
   likely to be Miocene in age. CRHm deviates from the expected direction
   of the Miocene axial dipole field and is best explained as a result of
   progressive tilting about the strike of the overlying andesite flows.
   These data suggest that the Crossman block was tilted 60 degrees to the
   southwest prior to intrusion of the vertical dike swarm, and the block
   continued to tilt during a magnetic field reversal to normal polarity
   (CNH). Miocene dikes in the Crossman block are roughly coplanar, so the
   younger dikes with normal polarity magnetization intruded along planes
   of weakness parallel to the earlier reversed polarity swarm. An
   alternative explanation involves CNH magnetization being acquired later
   during hydrothermal alteration associated with the final stages of dike
   emplacement. In the Standard Wash block, the primary component of
   magnetization is a dual-polarity, high-temperature or high-coercivity
   component (SWHl, I = 7.2 degrees, D = 0.7 degrees). To produce agreement
   between the expected Miocene magnetic direction and the SWH component
   requires (1) correcting for a 56 degrees tilt about the strike of flow
   bedding and (2) removing a counterclockwise vertical-axis rotation of 20
   degrees. The two rotations restore the Standard Wash dikes to vertical,
   make parallel the dike layering in the Crossman and Standard Wash
   blocks, and align the strikes of bedding in both blocks. Geologic
   mapping, geochemical evidence, and paleomagnetic data are consistent
   with the upper plate of the Mohave Mountains having tilted in response
   to formation of the underlying detachment fault.}},

Abstract = {{Intrathecal administration of the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) was
   shown previously to exert antinociceptive effects in a variety of acute
   spinal pain paradigms including hotplate, tail-flick, and writhing
   tests. In the present study, we sought to determine whether some of
   these antinociceptive effects might be elicited via stimulation of
   low-affinity NTS2 receptors. We first established, using immunoblotting
   and immunohistochemical techniques, that NTS2 receptors were extensively
   associated with putative spinal nociceptive pathways, both at the level
   of the dorsal root ganglia and of the superficial layers of the dorsal
   horn of the spinal cord. We then examined the effects of intrathecal
   administration of NT or selective NTS2 agonists on acute thermal pain.
   Both NT and NTS2 agonists, levocabastine and Boc-Arg-Arg-Pro-Tyr
   Psi(CH2NH)Ile-Leu-OH (JMV- 431), induced dose-dependent antinociceptive
   responses in the tail-flick test. The effects of levocabastine and of
   JMV- 431 were unaffected by coadministration of the NTS1-specific
   antagonist 2-{[}(1-(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)- 5-( 2,6- dimethoxy- phenyl)
   pyrazol- 3- yl) carboxylamino] tricyclo)
   3.3.1.1.(3.7))-decan-2-carboxylic acid (SR48692), confirming that they
   were NTS2 mediated. In contrast, the antinociceptive effects of NT were
   partly abolished by coadministration of SR48692, indicating that NTS1
   and NTS2 receptors were both involved. These results suggest that NTS2
   receptors play a role in the regulation of spinal nociceptive inputs and
   that selective NTS2 agonists may offer new avenues for the treatment of
   acute pain.}},

Abstract = {{We report a case of a 74-year-old woman with a 16-year history of a
   double bilo-enteric anastomosis due to resected hilar cholangiocarcinoma
   {[}Type IIIb Klatskin tumor]. The patient presented with cholangitis
   secondary to benign anastomotic stenosis which resulted in a large
   intrahepatic biloma. In order to restore the patency of the anastomosis
   and overcome cholangitis, several attempts took place, including
   endobiliary stenting, balloon-assisted biloplasty and transhepatic
   billiary drainage. Anastomotic patency was achieved, complicated,
   however, by persistent upper gastro-intestinal bleeding, presented as
   hemobilia. A biloma-induced pseudoaneurysm of the left hepatic artery
   was diagnosed. This had ruptured into the biliary tract, and presented
   the actual cause of the hemobilia. Selective embolism of the
   pseudoaneurysm resulted in control of the hemorrhage, and was
   successfully combined with transhepatic dilatation of the anastomosis
   and percutaneous drainage of the biloma. The patient was ultimately
   cured and seems to be in excellent condition, 5 mo after treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{An experimental and theoretical study on He-3-Ne and He-4-Ne helical
   hollow cathode lasers is presented. Enhanced laser operation on the near
   IR NeI lines is observed when the natural isotope He-4 is substituted by
   the lighter isotope He-3. A four-fold increase in the laser output power
   and a three-fold increase in the laser gain for the strongest NeI 1.1523
   mu m line is measured in the He-3-Ne gas mixture compared to the He-4-Ne
   gas mixture.
   On the basis of the theoretical analysis done by means of a
   non-stationary kinetic model for the negative glow plasma of He-3-Ne and
   He-4-Ne hollow cathode lasers, a study on the changes in the particle
   kinetics is carried out and an explanation of the experimental results
   is proposed. In the He-3-Ne mixture the electron temperature is lower
   than in the He-4-Ne mixture, while the gas temperature is higher. As a
   result the helium triplet metastable density and the rate constant for
   excitation transfer to neon atoms are higher in the He-3-Ne mixture. The
   lower laser level de-excitation due to intra-multiplet mixing of
   2p(1-10)levels by He-3 atoms is more efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent ceramic materials with optical qualities comparable to
   single crystals of similar compositions have been developed in recent
   years, as a result of the improved understanding of
   powder-processing-fabrication-sintering-property inter-relationships.
   These high-temperature materials with a range of thermal and mechanical
   properties are candidate envelopes for focused-beam, short-arc lamps
   containing various fills operating at temperatures higher than quartz.
   This paper reviews the composition, structure and properties of
   transparent ceramic lamp envelope materials including sapphire,
   small-grained polycrystalline alumina, aluminium oxynitride, yttrium
   aluminate garnet, magnesium aluminate spinel and yttria-lanthana. A
   satisfactory thermal shock resistance is required for the ceramic tube
   to withstand the rapid heating and cooling cycles encountered in lamps.
   Thermophysical properties, along with the geometry, size and thickness
   of a transparent ceramic tube, are important parameters in the
   assessment of its resistance to fracture arising from thermal stresses
   in lamps during service. The corrosive nature of lamp-fill liquid and
   vapour at high temperatures requires that all lamp components be
   carefully chosen to meet the target life. The wide range of new
   transparent ceramics represents flexibility in pushing the limit of
   envelope materials for improved beamer lamps.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To establish a kind of standardization of the clinical
   chemotherapeutic prototypes for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas
   (HCC).
   METHODS: 10-Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) was applied through transcatheter
   arterial embolization (TAE) to HCC patients who were categorized into
   three groups: (1) test group: treatment with HCPT twice (HCPT d1 and 14)
   through TAE and portal venous embolization. (2) Control I: treatment
   with anticancer drugs without HCPT. (3) Control II: treatment with HCPT
   as a major component in anticancer drugs once (HCPT d1). A set of
   comparisons between test groups and control I and II groups were
   performed before and after the treatment to study the effectiveness of
   each treatment, in terms of tumor volumes, dynamic variations in serum
   alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), gamma-glutamyl transferase hepatoma-specific
   band (GGT-II), patient survival and adverse events.
   RESULTS: The general effectiveness rate of the test group reached 62.1\%
   (72/116), remarkably higher than that of control I (32.1\%, 40/124) and
   control II (54.7\%, 47/56), (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively).
   Especially, the reduction rate or disappearance of the portal vein tumor
   emboli was as high as 88.4\% (61/69) in the test group, in contrast with
   13.9\% (10/72) in control I and 35.9\% (18/51) in control II (P<0.01 and
   P<0.01, respectively). After treatment, AFP decreased or turned to
   negative levels at 52.3\% (34/65) in control I, 67.3\% (35/52) in
   control II, and 96.8\% (60/62) in the test group. Also GGT-II declined
   or became negative at 37.8\% (28/74) in control I, 69.5\% (57/82) in
   control II, and 94.7\% (89/94) in test group (P<0.01 and P<0.05,
   respectively).
   CONCLUSION: We have designed a good protocol (test group) to treat HCC
   with excellent advantages of high efficiency, low cost, low toxicity and
   low adverse events and easy application. It could be recommended as one
   of the standardizations for HCC treatment in clinical practice. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Studies of expressed sequence tag data sets have revealed large numbers
   of splicing variants for human genes, but it remains challenging to
   distinguish functionally important variants from aberrant splicing,
   clarify the nature of the alternative functions, and understand the
   signals that regulate splicing choices. To help address these issues, we
   have constructed and analyzed a large data set of 1,478 exon-skipping
   alternative splicing (AS) variants evolutionarily conserved in human and
   mouse. In about one-fifth of cases, one isoform appears subject to
   nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), supporting the idea that a major
   role of AS is to regulate gene expression; one-quarter of these
   NMD-inducing cases involve a conserved exon whose apparent sole purpose
   is to mediate destruction of the message when included. We explore
   sequence conservation likely related to splicing regulation, using in
   part a measure of the overall amount of conserved information in a
   sequence, and find that the increased conservation that has been
   observed within AS exons primarily affects synonymous sites, suggesting
   that regulatory signals significantly constrain synonymous substitution
   rates. We show that a lower frequency of the inclusion isoform relative
   to the exclusion isoform tends to be associated with weaker splice site
   signals, smaller exon size, and higher intronic sequence conservation,
   and provide evidence that all of these factors are under selection to
   control relative isoform frequencies. Some conserved instances of AS
   appear to represent aberrant splicing events that by chance have
   occurred in both species, and we develop a nonparametric likelihood
   approach to identify these.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular determinants of stimulation of -1 programmed ribosomal
   frameshifting (- 1 PRF) by RNA pseudoknots are poorly understood.
   Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) encodes a 28-nt mRNA pseudoknot that
   promotes -1 PRF between the P1 (protease) and P2 (polymerase) genes in
   plant luteoviruses. The solution structure of the ScYLV pseudoknot
   reveals a well ordered loop 2 (L2) that exhibits continuous stacking of
   A20 through C27 in the minor groove of the upper stem 1 (S1), with C25
   flipped out of the triple-stranded stack. Five consecutive triple base
   pairs flank the helical junction where the 3' nucleotide of L2, C27,
   adopts a cytidine 27 N3-cytidine 14 2'-OH hydrogen bonding interaction
   with the C14-G7 base pair. This interaction is isosteric with the
   adenosine N1-2'-OH interaction in the related mRNA from beet western
   yellows virus (BWYV); however, the ScYLV and BWYV mRNA structures differ
   in their detailed L2-S1 hydrogen bonding and L2 stacking interactions.
   Functional analyses of ScYLV/BWYV chimeric pseudoknots reveal that the
   ScYLV RNA stimulates a higher level of -1 PRF (15 +/- 2\%) relative to
   the BWYV pseudoknot (6 +/- 1\%), a difference traced largely to the
   identity of the 3' nucleotide of L2 (C27 vs. A25 in BWYV). Strikingly,
   C27A ScYLV RNA is a poor franeshift stimulator (2.0\%) and is
   destabilized by similar to 1.5 kcal(.)mol(-1) (pH 7.0,37 degrees C) with
   respect to the wild-type pseudoknot. These studies establish that the
   precise network of weak interactions nearest the helical junction in
   structurally similar pseudoknots make an important contribution to
   setting the frameshift efficiency in mRNAs.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, facile nonaqueous synthesis route to nanocrystalline lead
   zirconate titanate (PZT) powders is presented. Simple mixing of lead
   acetylacetonate with titanium and/or zirconium alkoxides in 2-butanone,
   followed by a solvothermal treatment at 200 degrees C, produced
   amorphous, nanosized precursor powders. According to X-ray diffraction
   and transmission electron microscopy investigations, calcination at
   comparably low temperatures yielded highly crystalline, phase-pure
   powders consisting of monocrystalline particles in the size range of
   about 10-30 nm. Thermogravimetric and infrared analyses of the as
   prepared samples showed a content of organic species of about 10 wt \%,
   which are decomposed between 200 and 330 degrees C. The lack of further
   weight loss above 400 degrees C proves the absence of PbO evaporation, a
   major drawback of previous PZT preparations. Crack-free thin films were
   obtained by simply casting a dispersion of precursor powders on a
   silicon substrate followed by thermal treatment. Scanning electron
   microscopy shows homogeneous films to some extent populated with
   regular, micrometer-sized spheres. However, thorough washing removed
   most of these larger objects to leave a plain film. According to atomic
   force microscopy measurements, the roughness of this film is in the
   nanometer-size regime, confirming that this route is a potential way to
   fabricate thin homogeneous piezoelectric films.}},

Abstract = {{Antizyme and its isoforms are members of an unusual yet broadly
   conserved family of proteins, with roles in regulating polyamine levels
   within cells. Antizyme has the ability to bind and inhibit the enzyme
   ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), targeting it for degradation at the
   proteasome; antizyme is also known to affect the transport of polyamines
   and interact with the antizyme inhibitor protein (AZI), as well as the
   cell-cycle protein cyclin D1. In the present work, NMR methods were used
   to determine the solution structure of a stable, folded domain of
   mammalian antizyme isoform-1 (AZ-1), consisting of amino acid residues
   87-227. The protein was found to contain eight beta strands and two
   alpha helices, with the strands forming a mixed parallel and
   antiparallel beta sheet. At the level of primary sequence, antizyme is
   not similar to any protein of known structure, and results show that
   antizyme exhibits a novel arrangement of its strands and helices.
   Interestingly, however, the fold of antizyme is similar to that found in
   a family of acetyl transferases, as well as translation initiation
   factor IF3, despite a lack of functional relatedness between these
   proteins. Structural results, combined with amino acid sequence
   comparisons, were used to identify conserved features among the various
   homologues of antizyme and their isoforms. Conserved surface residues,
   including a cluster of acidic amino acids, were found to be located on a
   single face of antizyme, suggesting this surface is a possible site of
   interaction with target proteins such as ODC. This structural model
   provides an essential framework for an improved future understanding of
   how the different parts of antizyme play their roles in polyamine
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Substitution of the C2-OH group by C2-H at
   4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside to give
   4-nitrophenyl-2-deoXy-beta-D-galactopyranoside causes (1) a change in
   the rate-determining step for beta-galactosidase-catalyzed sugar
   hydrolysis from formation to breakdown of a covalent intermediate; (2) a
   14 000-fold decrease in the second-order rate constant k(3)/K-d for
   enzyme-catalyzed transfer of the beta-D-galactopyranosyl group from the
   substrate to form a covalent adduct to the enzyme; and (3) a larger 320
   000-fold decrease in the first-order rate constant k(s) for hydrolysis
   of this covalent adduct. Only a small fraction (ca. 7\%) of the 2-OH
   substituent effect is expressed in the ground-state Michaelis complex,
   so that the (apparent) strong interactions between the enzyme and 2-OH
   group that stabilize the transition state for beta-D-galactopyranosyl
   transfer only develop upon moving from the Michaelis complex to the
   transition state. Mg2+ activates beta-galactosidase for cleavage of both
   4-nitrophenyl-beta-D- galactopyrano side and
   4-nitrophenyl-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranoside. This suggests that Mg2+
   activation does not involve interactions with the 2-OH group. The
   removal of Mg2+ from beta-galactosidase causes a change in the
   rate-determining step for enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of
   4-nitrophenyl-2-deoxy-beta-D-galactopyranoside from breakdown to
   formation of the covalent intermediate. The observed 2-OH effect would
   require a very large (10-11 kcal/mol) stabilization of the transition
   state for beta-D-galactopyranosyl group transfer to water by
   interactions between beta-galactosidase and the neutral 2-OH group. We
   suggest that the apparent effect of the neutral substituent is more
   simply rationalized by ionization of the 2-OH to form a 2-O(-)anion,
   which provides effective electrostatic stabilization of the cationic
   transition state for glycoside cleavage at an active site of relatively
   low dielectric constant.}},

   solid film. The characterization of the films investigated here was made
   by longitudinal and transverse optical (LO and TO, respectively)
   functions in the mid-infrared calculated through the Kramers-Kronig
   analysis of transmittance spectra. The infrared analysis showed that the
   films were formed by silicon-centered distorted tetrahedra of the
   following type: Si(CH3)(x)BU(2-0.5x), where 0 <= x <= 3 and BU stands
   for bridging unit. For the sample deposited in the absence of O-2 in the
   discharge, BU = CH2 and NH; for the samples deposited with an O-2 flow
   rate (f(O2)) of 2.5 and 10 sccm, BU = CH2, NH, and O; and for the sample
   deposited with f(O2) of 20 sccm, BU = NH and O. The Delta(LO-TO) for the
   Si-O asymmetrical stretching increased from 0 (f(O2) = 0 sccm) to 73
   cm(-1) (f(O2) = 20 sccm), while for the Si-N asymmetrical stretching it
   decreased from 20 (f(O2) = 0 sccm) to 3 cm(-1) (f(O2) = 20 sccm). These
   observations signal an increase in the Si-O-Si network and a decrease in
   the Si-NH-Si network as the oxygen flow increased. An interesting
   conclusion drawn from our analysis of the Si-H stretching mode position
   and Delta(LO-TO) for the AS1 band is that the films deposited in the
   presence of O-2 are not structurally homogeneous, but have domains with
   different proportions of O bridges.}},

Abstract = {{Protein design studies using coiled coils have illustrated the potential
   of engineering simple peptides to self-associate into polymers and
   networks. Although basic aspects of self-assembly in protein systems
   have been demonstrated, it remains a major challenge to create materials
   whose large-scale structures are well determined from design of local
   protein-protein interactions. Here, we show the design and
   characterization of a helical peptide, which uses phased hydrophobic
   interactions to drive assembly into nanofilaments and fibrils
   ({''}nanoropes{''}). Using the hydrophobic effect to drive self-assembly
   circumvents problems of uncontrolled self-assembly seen in previous
   approaches that used electrostatics as a mode for self-assembly. The
   nanostructures designed here are characterized by biophysical methods
   including analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, and
   circular dichroism to measure their solution properties, and atomic
   force microscopy to study their behavior on surfaces. Additionally, the
   assembly of such structures can be predictably regulated by using
   various environmental factors, such as pH, salt, other molecular
   crowding reagents, and specifically designed ``capping{''} peptides.
   This ability to regulate self-assembly is a critical feature in creating
   smart peptide biomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{The dissociation of prototypical metal-cationized amino acid complexes,
   namely, alkaliated alanine ({[}Ala(+)M](+), M+=Li+, Na+, K+), was
   studied by energy-resolved tandem mass spectrometry with an ion-trap
   mass analyzer and by density functional theory. Dissociation leads to
   formation of fragment ions arising from the loss of small neutrals. such
   as H2O, CO,), and the formation NH3, (CO+NH3) of Na+/K+. The order of
   appearance threshold voltages for different dissociation pathways
   determined experimentally is consistent with the order of critical
   energies (energy barriers) obtained theoretically, and this provides the
   necessary confidence in both experimental and theoretical results.
   Although not explicitly involved in the reaction, the alkali metal
   cation plays novel and important roles in the dissociation of alkaliated
   alanine. The metal cation not only catalyzes the dissociation (via the
   formation of loosely bound ion-molecule complexes and by stabilizing the
   more polar intermediates and transition structures), but also affects
   the dissociation mechanisms, as the cation can alter the shape of the
   potential energy surfaces. This compression/expansion of the potential
   energy surface as a function of the alkali metal cation is discussed in
   detail, and how this affects the competitive loss of H2O versus CO/
   (CO+NH,) from {[}Ala+M]+ is illustrated. The present study provides new
   insights into the origin of the competition between various dissociation
   channels of alkaliated amino acid complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To describe the main media narratives in the reportage of
   singer Kylie Minogue's illness with breast cancer; and to assess the
   impact of this coverage on bookings for screening for breast cancer by
   mammography in four Australian states.
   Setting: Government sponsored BreastScreen programs in Queensland,
   Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia.
   Main outcome measures: Narratives on breast cancer in television news
   programs 1727 May 2005; initial and re-screening bookings for
   mammograms.
   Participants: Women aged >= 40 years who booked for mammograms in
   BreastScreen programs in the 19 weeks before, the 2 weeks during, and
   the 6 weeks after the publicity.
   Results: There was a 20-fold increase in news coverage of breast cancer,
   which emphasised that young women do get breast cancer and that early
   detection was critical. Overall screening bookings rose 40\% in the 2
   weeks of the publicity, with a 101\% increase in non-screened women in
   the eligible age-group 40-69 years. Six weeks after the publicity,
   bookings remained more than a third higher in non-screened women.
   Conclusions: News coverage of Kylie Minogue's breast cancer diagnosis
   caused an unprecedented increase in bookings for mammography. Health
   advocates should develop anticipatory strategies for responding to news
   coverage of celebrity illness.}},

Abstract = {{Protracted venous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5FU) combined with mitomycin
   C (MMC) has demonstrated significant activity against metastatic

   with progressive disease during or within 6 months of second-line
   chemotherapy were treated with capecitabine (1250 mg m(-2) twice daily)
   days 1 - 14 every 3 weeks and MMC ( 7 mg m(-2) IV bolus) once every 6
   weeks. A total of 36 patients were recruited, with a median age of 64
   years ( range 40 - 77), and 23 patients (78\%) were performance status 0
   - 1. The objective response rate was 15.2\%. In all, 48.5\% of patients
   had stable disease. Median failure-free survival was 5.4 months (95\% CI
   4.6 - 6.2). Median overall survival was 9.3 months (95\% CI: 6.9 -
   11.7). Grade 3 toxicities were palmar-plantar erythema 16.7\%, vomiting
   8.3\%, diarrhoea 2.8\%, anaemia 8.3\%, and neutropenia 2.8\%. No
   patients developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Symptomatic improvement
   occurred for pain, bowel symptoms, and dyspnoea. Capecitabine in
   combination with MMC is an effective regimen for metastatic colorectal
   cancer resistant to 5FU and irinotecan with an acceptable toxicity

Abstract = {{Acousto-optic imaging of thick biological tissues can be obtained in
   real-time with an adaptive-wavefront holographic setup, where the
   holographic media is a self-developping photorefractive crystal. As a
   consequence, the interference signal resulting from the acousto-optic
   effect can be easily collected with a high etendue and fast single
   photodetector. We present a statistical model of the field propagating
   through the scattering media and show why the various acoustic frequency
   components contained in the speckle output pattern are uncorrelated. We
   then give a detailed description of the signal measured through the
   photorefractive effect, in order to explain the quadratic pressure
   response observed for the two commonly used configurations setup e.g an
   amplitude or a phase modulation of the ultrasound. (c) 2005 Optical

Journal = {{INORGANIC CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Total spin-state energy splittings are calculated for mono- and
   dications of the formula t{[}Re]-C-n-Re]\}(z+) where {[}Re] =
   eta(5)-(C5Me5)Re(NO)(PPh3). C-n is an even-numbered carbon chain with n
   ranging from 4 to 20, and z is 1 or 2. These complexes are
   experimentally known, and their potential role as molecular electronic
   devices initiated this work. We have considered the different total spin
   states monocation/doublet, monocation/quartet, dication/singlet, and
   dication/triplet. Data obtained for two density functionals BP86 and
   B3LYP{*} were compared to verify the internal consistency of the
   results. In both ionization states, the low-spin state is the ground
   state, but the spin-state splittings decrease as the chain gets longer.
   For the dications, the splitting reaches a nearly constant value of
   about 10 kJ/mol with BP86 and about 4 KJ/mol with B3LYP{*} when there
   are at least 14 carbon atoms in the chain, whereas for the monocations,
   no constant value appears to be reached asymptotically, not even if 20
   carbon atoms are in the chain, For monocations, the splittings range
   from 138 KJ/mol (n = 4) to 68 kJ/mol (n = 20) with BP86 and from 134
   KJ/mol (n = 4) to 73 KJ/mol (n = 20) with B3LYP{*} and are thus
   considerably higher than those of the dications. The spin-state
   splittings are qualitatively mirrored by the energy splitting between
   the highest-occupied molecular orbital with beta spin (HOMO beta) and
   the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital with (X spin (LUMO alpha) as
   obtained in the low-spin state. Furthermore, the HOMO alpha-LUMO alpha
   gaps decrease as the carbon chain lengthens. In addition, the local
   distribution of the, expectation value is analyzed for the
   monocation/doublet, the monocation/quartet, and the dication/triplet
   state using a modified Lowdin partitioning scheme. In the
   monocation/doublet and the dication/triplet state, the electron spin is
   distributed mainly on the metal centers and slightly delocalized onto
   the carbon chain. In the monocation/quartet state for chain lengths of
   more than 8 carbon atoms, the electron spin is mainly localized on
   selected atoms of the chain and not on the metal centers. In all cases,
   the spin delocalization onto the chain increases as the chain gets
   longer.}},

Abstract = {{With current concerns over issues such as global warming, the use of
   palaeoecological data to reconstruct past environments has gained a
   special significance, but much of the work on ostracod ecology and
   paleoecology has been qualitative in nature, or on a site-specific
   rather than integrated, regional basis. Furthermore, ostracod ecological
   relationships are complex, with each species occupying a
   multidimensional niche, and a range of statistical techniques can be
   employed to establish the significance of different environmental
   variables on species distribution.
   We employ logistic regression (LR) and canonical correspondence analysis
   (CCA) to define ostracod species niches and assemblage response to
   environmental gradients, using a modem dataset of 465 ostracod samples
   from the eastern Iberian Peninsula. In addition to these ecological
   analyses, we develop ostracod-based transfer functions for the
   quantitative reconstruction of past environmental change from a modem
   regional data-set of non-marine ostracod and limnological data, by means
   of weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration. Examples cited
   are primarily from modem and fossil ostracod samples from Iberian water
   bodies.
   Our results suggest that water chemistry (solute composition and
   concentration) and temperature are the factors to which non-marine
   ostracod species respond in a more clear and consistent way.
   Species-environment relationships modelled using the transfer-function
   approach of WA are strong for the above-mentioned variables, and
   therefore these models may be of great help in palaeoenvironmental
   reconstructions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis and properties of a novel type of
   5-{[}bis(1-heteroazulen-3-yl)methylidene]pyrimidine-2,4,6(1,3,5
   H)-triones(13a-c) and (14a-c) are studied. The synthetic procedure is
   based on addition of bis(1-heteroazulen-3-yl)methyl cations with
   barbituric acid and subsequent oxidation by o-chloranil. Structural
   characteristics of 13a-c and 14a-c were clarified on inspection of the
   C-13 NMR spectral data and X-ray crystal analysis. Based on the
   investigation of the UV-vis spectra of 13a-c and 14a-c and their
   protonated cations, conformational change of the heteroazulene-moiety
   and the barbituric acid-moiety is suggested. In the CV measurements of
   13a-c and 14a-c, two reversible reduction waves are observed, indicating
   the stabilizing ability of heteroazulenes toward the corresponding
   radical and anion species. Furthermore, 13a-c and 14a-c exhibit one
   irreversible oxidation wave and the corresponding reduction wave
   appearing in a far negative region, which suggested a conformational
   change in the radical cation during the redox process. The
   conformational change is rationalized on the basis of the MO
   calculations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The light attenuation in a photobioreactor is determined using a fully
   predictive model. The optical properties were first calculated, using a
   data bank of the literature, from only the knowledge of pigments
   content, shape, and size distributions of cultivated cells which are a
   function of the physiology of the current species. The radiative
   properties of the biological turbid medium were then deduced using the
   exact Lorenz-Mie theory. This method is experimentally validated using a
   large-size integrating sphere photometer. The radiative properties are
   then used in a rectangular, one-dimensional two-flux model to predict
   radiant light attenuation in a photobioreactor, considering a
   quasi-collimated field of irradiance. Combination of this radiative
   model with the predictive determination of optical properties is finally
   validated by in situ measurement of attenuation profiles in a torus
   photobioreactor cultivating the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,
   after a complete and proper characterization of the incident light flux
   provided by the experimental set-up. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The enhanced transmission of electromagnetic waves through an opaque
   object is reported in this paper. The samples are constructed as two
   different configurations: a subwavelength metallic mesh sandwiched
   either between two metallic plates with periodic fractal slots (ABA for
   short) or between two plastic plates with periodic metallic fractals
   (CBC for short). Such ABA or CBC configuration exhibits multiple
   transmission peaks, indicating the wave penetrations through the opaque
   metallic mesh. The experimental observations and theoretical simulations
   demonstrate that the transmission enhancements for two configurations
   are induced by local resonances in the sandwiching layers. (c) 2005

   to enable in situ XAS investigations of the anode catalyst using
   fluorescence detection. The development of the cell is described, in
   particular the modifications required for elevated temperature operation
   and humidification of the feed gasses. The impact of the operating
   conditions is observed as an increase in the catalyst utilisation, which
   is evident in the EXAFS collected at the Pt L-III and Ru K edges for a
   PtRu/C catalyst. The Pt component of the catalyst was found to be
   readily reduced by hydrogen in the fuel, while the Ru was only fully
   reduced under conditions of good gas flow and electrochemical contact.
   Under such conditions no evidence of O neighbours were found at the Ru
   edge. The results are interpreted in relation to the lack of surface
   sensitivity of the EXAFS method and indicate that the equilibrium
   coverage of O species on the Ru surface sites is too low to be observed
   using EXAFS. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Spinal cord NR1 serine phosphorylation and NR2B subunit suppression
   following peripheral inflammation}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PAIN}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Spinal cord N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) receptors are
   intimately involved in the development and maintenance of central
   sensitization. However, the mechanisms mediating the altered function of
   the NMDA receptors are not well understood. In this study the role of
   phosphorylation of NR1 splice variants and NR2 subunits was examined
   following hind paw inflammation in rats. We further examined the level
   of expression of these proteins following the injury.
   Results: Lumbar spinal cord NR1 subunits were found to be phosphorylated
   on serine residues within two hours of the induction of hind paw
   inflammation with carrageenan. The enhanced NR1 serine phosphorylation
   reversed within six hours. No phosphorylation on NR1 threonine or
   tyrosine residues was observed. Likewise, no NR2 subunit phosphorylation
   was observed on serine, threonine or tyrosine residues. An analysis of
   NR1 and NR2 protein expression demonstrated no change in the levels of
   NR1 splice variants or NR2A following the inflammation. However, spinal
   cord NR2B expression was depressed by the hind paw inflammation. The
   expression of NR2B remained depressed for more than one week following
   initiation of the inflammation.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that NR1 serine phosphorylation leads to
   an initial increase in NMDA receptor activity in the spinal cord
   following peripheral injury. The suppression of NR2B expression suggests
   compensation for the enhanced nociceptive activity. These data indicate
   that spinal cord NMDA receptors are highly dynamic in the development,
   maintenance and recovery from central sensitization following an injury.
   Thus, chronic pain therapies targeted to NMDA receptors should be
   designed for the exact configuration of NMDA receptor subunits and
   post-translational modifications present during specific stages of the
   disease.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{{[} 1] The amount and distribution of snowfall in the Arctic has
   significant effects on global climate. However, measurements of snowfall
   from gauges are strongly biased. A new method is described for
   reconstructing snowfall from observed snow depth records, meteorological
   observations, and running the NASA Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction
   Project Catchment Land Surface Model ( NSIPP CLSM) in an inverse mode.
   This method is developed and tested with observations from Reynolds
   Creek Experimental Watershed. Results show snowfall can be accurately
   reconstructed on the basis of how much snow must have fallen to produce
   the observed snow depth. The mean cumulative error ( bias) of the
   reconstructed precipitation for 11 snow seasons is 29 mm snow water
   equivalent ( SWE) for the corrected gauge measurement compared to -77 mm
   SWE for the precipitation from the corrected snow gauges. This means the
   root-mean-square error of reconstructed solid precipitation is 30\% less
   than that of gauge corrections. The intended application of this method
   is the pan-Arctic landmass, where estimates of snowfall are highly
   uncertain but where more than 60 years of historical snow depth and air
   temperature records exist.}},

Abstract = {{Ca2+ and cAMP are important second messengers that regulate multiple
   cellular processes. Although previous studies have suggested direct
   interactions between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways, the underlying
   mechanisms remain unresolved. In particular, direct evidence for
   Ca2+-regulated cAMP production in living cells is incomplete.
   Genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based
   biosensors have made possible real-time imaging of spatial and temporal
   gradients of intracellular cAMP concentration in single living cells.
   Here, we used confocal microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy
   transfer, and insulin-secreting MIN6 cells expressing Epac1-camps, a
   biosynthetic unimolecular cAMP indicator, to better understand the role
   of intracellular Ca2+ in cAMP production. We report that depolarization
   with high external K+, tolbutamide, or glucose caused a rapid increase
   in cAMP that was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by
   nitrendipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, or 2', 5'-dideoxyadenosine, a
   P-site antagonist of transmembrane adenylate cyclases. Stimulation of
   MIN6 cells with glucose in the presence of tetraethylammonium chloride
   generated concomitant Ca2+ and cAMP oscillations that were abolished in
   the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and blocked by 2', 5'-dideoxyadenosine
   or 3- isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase.
   Simultaneous measurements of Ca2+ and cAMP concentrations with Fura-2
   and Epac1-camps, respectively, revealed a close temporal and causal
   interrelationship between the increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cAMP
   levels following membrane depolarization. These findings indicate highly
   coordinated interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in electrically
   excitable endocrine cells and suggest that Ca2+-dependent cAMP
   oscillations are derived from an increase in adenylate cyclase activity
   and periodic activation and inactivation of cAMP-hydrolyzing
   phosphodiesterase.}},

Abstract = {{The transcription factor Stat3 is activated by multiple cytokines,
   including leptin and those signaling through the gp130 receptor. In two
   independent studies, mice in which the Stat3 gene was inactivated using
   a RIP-Cre transgene led to glucose intolerance, defects in early-phase
   insulin secretion, and mild obesity {[}S. Gorogawa, Y. Fujitani, H.

   258]. However, since the RIP-Cre transgene is also expressed in the
   hypothalamus, and thereby Stat3 was deleted from neurons expressing the
   leptin receptor, it was not clear as to which of the metabolic defects
   were due to the loss of Stat3 from beta-cells or the hypothalamus. We
   have addressed this issue through the inactivation of Stat3 from
   pancreatic (3-cells using a Pdx1-Cre transgene. Complete loss of Stat3
   was observed in islets from mice, which carry two (foxed Stat3 alleles
   and the Pdx1-Cre transgene. However, these mice did not develop glucose
   intolerance or obesity over a period of 6 months, demonstrating that
   Stat3 is dispensable for the generation and physiology of beta-cells.
   Similarly, mice that express only the Pdx1-Cre transgene display a
   normal physiology. In contrast, mice that expressed only the RIP-Cre
   transgene developed glucose intolerance as early as 6 weeks of age. The
   finding that RIP-Cre transgenic mice in a C57B/6 dominated background
   develop glucose intolerance is important as this line has been used in
   several studies. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Direct routes of gene administration (intrathecal,
   intracerebroventricular or intraparenchymal infusion) have been used for
   effective and sustained gene delivery, but serious concerns exist about
   possible traumatic injury as well as neural damage that may lead to
   further tissue necrosis, apoptosis and cell death. We evaluated targeted
   retrograde gene delivery through the sternomastoid muscle (innervated by
   the spinal accessory nerves) into the injured cervical spinal cord using
   a recombinant adenovirus vector. LacZ gene expression in the cervical
   spinal cord was noted from 3 days to 4 weeks after the injection of
   vector into the sternomastoid muscles of the rats. Recombinant
   adenovirus vector was transferred via a retrograde mechanism into the
   injured cervical spinal cord with high transduction efficacy
   (80.6-98.9\%) over certain adenoviral titer and dosage. Transduction was
   less efficient when the vector was injected I and 2 weeks after spinal
   cord injury (44.2-56.8\%). Our results indicate retrograde delivery of
   recombinant adenovirus vector is possible immediately after spinal cord
   injury, and that this method is promising for gene delivery because it
   is effective, selective, less invasive to the injured spinal cord, has
   long-lasting gene expression, and is potentially feasible treatment
   choice for spinal cord injury. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction: In vascular smooth muscle cells, different types of K+
   channels participate in the regulation of membrane potential and
   consequently in the contractile behavior of the vessel. There is little
   information about the properties and role of K channels in human
   internal mammary artery (HIMA), the vessel of choice for coronary
   revascularization.
   Methods: Patch-clamp technique on isolated HIMA smooth muscle cells was
   used.
   Results: This work presents for the first time single-channel properties
   of the high conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BKCa) of HIMA. It
   presents a single-channel conductance of 228 +/- 4 pS (n=44, 8 cells),
   is sensitive to 100 nM iberiotoxin, and its open probability is Ca2+-
   and voltage-dependent. Inside-out results show that BKCa channels in
   HIMA are directly activated by increasing the pH of intracellular media
   (NPo=0.096 +/- 0.032 at pH 7.4 and NPo=0.459 +/- 0.111 at pH 7.6, n=12
   cells, p < 0.05) and inhibited by lowering this pH(NPo = 0.175 +/- 0.067
   at pH 7.4 and NPo = 0.051 +/- 0.019 at pH 6.8, n = 13 cells, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The evidences presented about single-channel properties and
   intracellular pH sensitivity of BKCa from HIMA smooth muscle cells
   provide useful information to elucidate physiological or pathological
   mechanisms in this vessel, as well as for future studies where drugs
   could have BKCa channels as targets for pharmacological therapies. (c)

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the diabetes-associated neuropathy and prevent
   effects of cyclohexenonic long-chain fatty alcohol, a neurotrophic
   substance, in trachea, we studied its effect on streptozotocin-diabetic
   hyper-reactivity in the rat trachea. Diabetes was induced in 8-week-old
   male Sprague-Dawley rats by administering an intraperitoneal injection
   of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). The rats were divided randomly into four
   groups and were maintained for four weeks: age-matched control rats,
   diabetic rats without treatment with cyclohexenonic long-chain fatty
   alcohol, and diabetic rats treated with cyclohexenonic long-chain fatty
   alcohol (2 and 8 mg/kg, i.p. every day). The serum glucose and insulin
   levels were determined, and the contractile responses of the trachea
   induced by carbachol and KCl were investigated. Treatment with
   cyclohexenonic long-chain fatty alcohol did not alter the rats' diabetic
   status, i.e., body weight, thickness of the trachea, serum glucose
   levels, and serum insulin levels, but significantly improved the
   diabetic-induced hyper-reactivity of the rat trachea in a dose-dependent
   manner. There was no significant difference in either the carbachol- or
   KCl-induced contractile forces between groups with or without mucosa in
   the functional studies. In histological examinations, thinning of
   cricoid cartilage, thickness of basal membrane, and degeneration,
   fragmentation of elastic fibers in the submucosal layer, and hypertrophy
   of smooth muscle bundle in the membranous wall of trachea were observed
   in the diabetic rat trachea, which were improved by treatment with
   cyclohexenonic long-chain fatty alcohol. Our data indicate that this
   drug can prevent hyper-reactivity in the diabetic trachea. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the matrix proteoglycan, versican, may
   perform a functional role during early events of limb skeletogenesis
   largely by virtue of its spatiotemporal expression pattern in
   precartilage mesenchymal aggregations. The versican-deficient hdf
   transgenic mouse has provided the first model to explore the
   implications of a null mature versican on limb chondrogenesis. Due to
   lethality of hdf homozygous embryos prior to limb cartilage
   differentiation, high-density micromass cultures were employed to
   compare the chondrogenic capacity of hdf mutant limb mesenchyme to that
   of wild-type. In homozygous hdf mesenchyme, aggregation was severely
   compromised and neither cartilage-characteristic Type 11 collagen nor
   alcian blue positive foci were detected during a 6-day period of
   culture. Three-dimensional culture of hdf mutant mesenchyme, however,
   showed that in a permissive environment mutant cells also expressed Type
   II collagen. Results strongly suggest that mature versican proteoglycan
   is essential for precartilage aggregation and subsequent cartilage
   differentiation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The target of rapamycin ( TOR), a highly conserved serine/ threonine
   kinase, plays a central role in the control of eukaryotic cell growth.
   TOR exists in two functionally and structurally distinct complexes, TOR
   complex 1 ( TORC1) and TOR complex 2 ( TORC2). TORC1 controls cell
   growth via a rapamycin- sensitive signaling branch regulating
   translation, transcription, nutrient uptake, ribosome biogenesis, and
   autophagy. TORC2 controls the organization of the actin cytoskeleton
   through a rapamycin- insensitive signaling branch and in yeast consists
   of the six proteins AVO1, AVO2, AVO3, BIT61, LST8, and TOR2. Here we
   have focused on the characterization of TORC2. Our studies suggest that
   TORC2 is oligomeric, likely a TORC2- TORC2 dimer. AVO1 and AVO3 bind
   cooperatively to the N- terminal HEAT repeat region in TOR2 and are
   required for TORC2 integrity. AVO2 is a nonessential peripheral protein
   associated with AVO1 and AVO3. LST8 binds separately to the C- terminal
   kinase domain region in TOR2 and appears to modulate both the integrity
   and kinase activity of TORC2. TORC2 autophosphorylates sites in AVO1 and
   AVO3, but TORC2 kinase activity is not required for TORC2 integrity. We
   have demonstrated that mammalian TOR is also oligomeric. The
   architecture of TORC2 is discussed in the context of TORC2 assembly and
   regulation.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We discuss localized ground states of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC's)
   in optical lattices with attractive and repulsive three-body
   interactions in the framework of a quintic nonlinear Schrodinger
   equation which extends the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to the
   one-dimensional case. We use both a variational method and a
   self-consistent approach to show the existence of unstable localized
   excitations which are similar to Townes solitons of the cubic nonlinear
   Schrodinger equation in two dimensions. These solutions are shown to be
   located in the forbidden zones of the band structure, very close to the
   band edges, separating decaying states from stable localized ones (gap
   solitons) fully characterizing their delocalizing transition. In this
   context the usual gap solitons appear as a mechanism for arresting the
   collapse in low-dimensional BEC's in optical lattices with an attractive
   real three-body interaction. The influence of the imaginary part of the
   three-body interaction, leading to dissipative effects in gap solitons,
   and the effect of atoms feeding from the thermal cloud are also
   discussed. These results may be of interest for both BEC's in atomic
   chips and Tonks-Girardeau gas in optical lattices.}},

   (1.42 mg/dL +/- 0.14 vs 1.68 mg/dL +/- 0.3), at 1 month (1.45 mg/dL +/-
   0.1 vs 1.39 mg/dL +/- 0.11), 3 months (1.46 mg/dL +/- 0.09 vs 1.32 mg/dL
   +/- 0.14), and 1 year (1.29 mg/dL +/- 0.08 vs 1.19 mg/dL +/- 0.09), but
   not at 6 months (1.42 +/- 0.37 vs 1.10 +/- 0.07; P = .001), were
   comparable between groups. The 1-year patient and graft survival rates
   were 98.3\% for group 1 and 94.5\% for group 2. When evaluated for acute
   rejection, infection, and metabolic differences, we conclude that both
   tacrolimus and cyclosporine are effective and safe calcineurin
   inhibitors for short-term use in kidney transplantation. A similar study
   is proposed to evaluate the long-term effects of both agents.}},

Abstract = {{Several traditionally extracellular pathogens not known to possess
   invasive capacity have been shown to invade various mucosal epithelial
   cells. The mucosal epithelium performs an important barrier function and
   is not typically amenable to bacterial invasion. Valuable clues to the
   underlying basis for bacterial invasion have emerged from recent studies
   examining the invasion of bladder epithelial cells by uropathogenic
   Escherichia coli and alveolar epithelial cells by Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa. In both cases, bacterial invasion is achieved through
   targeting of molecules specifically found within distinct
   glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched microdomains called lipid
   rafts. The importance of lipid rafts in promoting bacterial invasion was
   shown as disruptors of lipid rafts blocked cellular invasion by both E
   coli and P aeruginosa. In addition, molecular components of lipid rafts
   were found to be highly enriched in membranes encasing these
   intracellular bacteria. Furthermore, caveolin proteins, which serve to
   stabilize and organize lipid raft components, are necessary for
   bacterial entry. Taken together, targeting of lipid rafts appears to be
   an effective but poorly recognized mechanism used by pathogenic bacteria
   to circumvent the mucosal barriers of the host.}},

Abstract = {{Classic game theory considers defection to be the rational choice in the
   Prisoner's Dilemma. Although defection maximizes a player's gain
   regardless of the opponent's choice, many players cooperate. We suggest
   that cooperation can be explained in part by expectations of reciprocal
   behavior, that is, by the belief that players facing the same situation
   probably will come to the same decision. In Experiment 1, expectations
   of reciprocity were experimentally manipulated. As predicted,
   cooperation increased monotonically with these expectations. In
   Experiment 2, experimentally manipulated expectations of opponent
   cooperation were not associated with higher rates of cooperation. These
   findings are interpreted in light of a general model of payoff
   maximization, and implications for other models (e.g., social value
   orientation) are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Status epilepticus (SE) appears to cause cognitive dysfunction
   as well as other serious neurologic sequelae. To confirm whether SE
   produces a subsequent intellectual decline, we evaluated intellectual
   function prospectively in adult epilepsy patients with and without SE.
   Methods: Of 1,685 patients with epilepsy who underwent comprehensive
   neuropsychological testing in two national hospitals in Japan, 15
   patients experienced an episode of SE afterward and underwent the second
   neuropsychological examination after the SE episode. Forty clinically
   matched patients with epilepsy, but without an episode of SE since their
   initial neuropsychological examination, were also reevaluated. We
   compared IQs and subscores from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
   Scale-Revised between the two groups by repeated measures analysis of
   variance. In the patients who experienced an SE episode, SE-related
   variables (i.e., age at the SE episode and type and duration of SE) and
   epilepsy-related variables such as epilepsy type, lateralization of EEG
   abnormalities, the presence of mesial temporal sclerosis, and previous
   history of SE, were evaluated in relation to intellectual outcome.
   Results: Patients with SE, in comparison to those without SE, failed to
   show any significant post-SE intellectual decline. Furthermore, neither
   the SE-related variables nor the clinical characteristics were
   correlated with intellectual outcome.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that SE does not lead to a significant
   intellectual decline in adult patients receiving treatment for epilepsy.}},

   stereochemistry of the coordination compounds of lanthanides(III)
   derived from
   4{[}N-(2'-hydroxy-1'-naphthalidene)aminolantipyrinesemicarbazone
   (HNAAPS) has been studied. The general composition of the present
   complexes is LnX(3) center dot n (HNAAPS) center dot DPSO (Ln = La, Pr,
   Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy or Ho; X = NO3, n = 1, X = NCS or ClO4, n = 2). All
   these complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, molecular
   weight, molar conductance, magnetic susceptibility, infrared and
   electronic spectra. The infrared studies reveal that the HNAAPS behaves
   as a neutral tridentate (N, N, O), while DPSO is coordinated to the
   metal ion via its lone oxygen atom. Nitrates are bicovalently bonded,
   while thiocyanate is coordinated through strong N-atom. Perchlorato ions
   are not participating in coordination sphere. From electronic spectral
   data, nephelauxetic effect (beta), covalence factor (b(1/2)), Sinha
   parameter (delta\%) and the covalence angular overlap parameter (eta)
   have been calculated. XRD of two representative compounds were also
   investigated. Antibacterial properties of these complexes were also
   performed. Thermal stabilities of these complexes were studied by
   thermogravimetric analysis. In conclusion, the coordination number of
   lanthanides (111) in the present compounds is either seven or ten
   depending on the coordinating anions.}},

Title = {{Comparing the utility of a standard pediatric resuscitation cart with a

Abstract = {{Background. Access to resuscitation equipment is a critical component in
   delivering optimal care in pediatric arrest situations. Historically,
   children's hospitals and clinics have used a standard pediatric
   resuscitation cart ({''} standard cart{''}) in which drawers are
   organized by intervention ( eg, intubation module, intravenous module),
   requiring multiple drawers to be opened during a code. Many emergency
   departments, however, use a pediatric resuscitation cart based on the
   Broselow tape ({''} Broselow cart{''}) in which each drawer is color
   coded and organized by patient length and weight ranges; each drawer
   contains all necessary equipment for resuscitation of a patient in that
   specific length/ weight range. A literature review has revealed no
   studies examining the utility of either cart.
   Objectives. To compare which resuscitation cart organization ( standard
   versus Broselow) allows for faster access to equipment, more accurate
   selection of appropriately sized equipment, and better user
   satisfaction.
   Methodology. We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled,
   crossover trial in which 21 pediatric health care providers were
   assigned the role of obtaining the appropriate equipment during 2
   standardized, simulated codes alternately using either a standard or
   Broselow cart. Time to and accuracy of the selection of appropriate
   medical equipment along with posttesting satisfaction were measured. All
   simulations were performed in the Center for Advanced Pediatric
   Education at Stanford University Medical Center ( Stanford, CA), a
   training facility designed to replicate the real medical environment
   with the technology to allow for videotaping of scenarios.
   Results. Of the 21 subjects, 62\% found the Broselow cart `` easy{''} or
   `` very easy{''} to use versus 33\% for the standard cart. Of the 21
   subjects, 67\% preferred the Broselow cart, 10\% preferred the standard
   cart, and 23\% indicated no preference. Intubation supplies and
   nasogastric tubes were found significantly faster when using the
   Broselow cart ( mean time: 29.1 and 20 seconds, respectively) versus the
   standard cart ( mean time: 38.7 and 38.2 seconds, respectively). Correct
   equipment was provided a statistically significant 99\% of the time with
   the Broselow cart versus 83\% of the time with the standard cart. Ten
   percent of the subjects had prior experience with the Broselow cart
   versus 62\% having experience with the standard cart.
   Conclusions. Despite less prior experience with the Broselow cart,
   subjects in this study found it easier to use and preferred it over the
   standard cart. In addition, subjects located intubation equipment and
   nasogastric tubes significantly faster when using the Broselow cart, and
   correct equipment was provided significantly more often with the
   Broselow cart. These data suggest that sites caring for pediatric
   patients should consider modeling their resuscitation carts after the
   Broselow cart to enhance provider confidence and patient safety.}},

Abstract = {{The regulatory mechanisms of neuropeptide-metabolizing enzymes often
   play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neuronal damage. A systemic
   administration of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), an antagonist of GABA(A)
   receptor ion channel binding site, causes generalized epilepsy in an
   animal model. In the present study, we examined the involvement of
   prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), thimet oligopeptidase/neurolysin (EP
   24.15/16) and glial proteins in PTZ-treated rat brain regions, and the
   suppressive effect of MK-801, a non-competitive NMDA receptor
   antagonist, pretreatment for their proteins. The activity of POP
   significantly decreased in the hippocampus at 30 min and 3 h, and in the
   frontal cortex at 3 h. after PTZ treatment, and pretreatment with MK-801
   recovered the activity in the cortex at 3 h. The activity of EP 24.15/16
   significantly decreased in the hippocampus at,3 h and I day, and in the
   cortex at 3 h after the PTZ administration, whereas pretreatment with
   MK-801 recovered the change of the activity. The Western blot analysis
   of EP 24.15 showed significant decrease of the protein level in the
   hippocampus 3 h after the PTZ treatment, whereas pretreatment with
   MK-801 recovered. The expression of GFAP and CD11b immunohistochemically
   increased in the hippocampus of the PTZ-treated rat as compared with
   controls.. Pretreatment with MK-801 also recovered the GFAP and CD11b
   expression. These data suggest that PTZ-induced seizures of the rats
   cause indirect activation of glutamate NNMA receptors, then decrease POP
   and EP 24.15/16 enzyme activities and EP 24.15 immunoreactivity in the
   neuronal cells of the hippocampal formation. We speculate that changes
   of those peptidases in the brain may be related to the levels of the
   neuropeptides regulating PTZ-induced seizures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We test the hypothesis that the passage of the Financial Services
   Modernization Act (FSMA) of 1999 has spillover effects cross-nationally,
   using a sample of US, non-US transactional (Australian, Canadian, and
   UK), and relationship (German, Japanese, Dutch, and Swiss) banks. Our
   results suggest that financial modernization in the US has limited
   cross-national effects. We find strong evidence that US banks were
   affected favorably. Although we detect some evidence of significant
   reactions by banks in certain countries, a closer examination reveals
   that the reaction is most likely attributable to events in the
   respective countries during the event period. We do find, however, that
   non-US transactional banks have been more likely to elect financial
   holding company status compared to relationship banks, suggesting they
   are positioning themselves to exploit the expanded opportunity set
   created by the FSMA. Nonetheless, the majority of elections have been
   made by US banks. In general, the results suggest that the respective
   banking markets are efficient in filtering events that are largely

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of propofol and propofol-ketamine on
   hemodynamics, sedation level, and recovery period in pediatric patients
   undergoing cardiac catheterization. We performed a prospective,
   randomized, double-blind study. The study included 60 American Society
   of Anesthesiologists physical status II or III (age range, 1 month-13
   years) undergoing cardiac catheterization for evaluation of congenital
   heart disease. Propofol and ketamine were prepared in 5\% glucose
   solution to a final concentration of 5 and 1 mg/ml, respectively;
   similar injectors containing 5\% glucose solution only were prepared.
   Fentanyl (1 pg/kg) and propofol (1.5 mg/kg) were given to both groups.
   Then, group I received 0.5 ml/ kg, of 5\% glucose and group 2 0.5 ml/kg
   of ketamine solution by an anesthesiologist who was unaware of the
   groups of patients. Local anesthesia with 1\% lidocane was administered
   before intervention in all patients. The noninvasively measured mean
   arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen
   saturation were recorded at the baseline, following drug administration,
   at 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes and then at 15-minute intervals
   until the end of the procedure. Additional drug and fentanyl
   requirements to maintain a sedation level of 4 or 5 were recorded. After
   the procedure, the time to a Steward recovery score of 6 and adverse
   effects in the first 24 hours were recorded. The number of patients with
   more than a 20\% decrease in mean arterial pressure was 11 in group 1
   and 3 in group 2(p < 0.05). The number of patients who experienced more
   than a 20\% decrease in heart rate was 12 in group I and 5 in group 2) =
   0.054). Ten patients in group I and 3 patients in group 2 required
   additional fentanyl doses (p = 0.057). The number of additional propofol
   doses was lower in group 2) < 0.05). Propofol combined with low-dose
   ketamine preserves mean arterial pressure better without affecting the
   recovery and thus is a good option in pediatric patients undergoing
   cardiac catheterization.}},

Abstract = {{Dried sugar beet pulp, an agricultural solid waste by-product, was used
   as an biosorbent for the removal of copper(H) from aqueous solution. A
   series of experiments were conducted in a batch system to assess the
   effect of the system variables, i.e. initial pH, temperature and initial
   metal ion concentration. The results indicated that at 250 mg 1(-1)
   initial copper(II) concentration dried sugar beet pulp exhibited the
   highest copper(II) uptake capacity of 28.5 mg g(-1) at 25 degrees C and
   at an initial pH value of 4.0. The equilibrium data were analyzed using
   the Freundlich, Langmuir, Redlich-Peterson and Koble-Corrigan isotherm
   models depending on temperature. The Langmuir model was found to best
   describe the data in the concentration and temperature ranges studied.
   Simple mass transfer and kinetic models were applied to the experimental
   data to examine the mechanisms of biosorption and potential
   rate-controlling steps such as external mass transfer, intraparticle
   diffusion and biosorption process. It was found that the intraparticle,
   diffusion played an important role in the biosorption mechanisms of
   copper(II), and biosorption kinetics followed pseudo first- and pseudo
   second-order kinetic models rather than the saturation type kinetic
   model for all temperatures studied. The activation energy of biosorption
   (EA) was determined as -58.47 kJ mol(-1) using the Arrhenius equation.
   Using the thermodynamic equilibrium coefficients obtained at different
   temperatures, the thermodynamic constants of biosorption (Delta G
   degrees, Delta H degrees and Delta S degrees) were also evaluated. (c)

Abstract = {{Purpose of review This review deals with the current situation of mental
   health practice in Arab countries. Despite the complexity and importance
   of the topic, the Arab world still shows a lack of awareness regarding
   mental health problems and a dearth of mental health services and
   professionals. The main purpose of this paper is to examine changes in
   the area of mental health, and what still needs to be developed or
   investigated.
   Recent findings Mental health patients in Arab countries tend to express
   their psychological problems in terms of physical symptoms, thereby
   avoiding the stigma attached to mental illness. They also tend to
   underutilize mental health services and to hold negative attitudes
   toward formal mental health services. Reliance upon a deity and
   religious leaders as a means of coping with mental health issues is
   another prevalent theme in the Arab world. Another issue is that of
   mental health practices in politically volatile and violent regions,
   where higher rates of mental health problems and psychiatric diagnoses
   have been found. In addition, women in Arab/Muslim countries are at
   paramount risk from mental health problems.
   Summary The findings have implications for professional service
   delivery. Further research, intervention and activism are needed in the,
   field of mental health systems in Arab countries to improve awareness of
   mental health problems. Further research is also needed regarding issues
   such as cultural competence and the suitability of mental health
   treatment and services for the non-Western communities in many
   Arab/Muslim countries.}},

Abstract = {{Adrenornedullin (AM) is an endogenous regulatory peptide, which exerts
   growth promoting and neoangiogenic actions in several normal and
   neoplastic tissues. Evidence has been provided that AM and the
   pro-angiogenic peptide vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) are
   expressed in the adrenal gland, and we investigated whether their gene
   transcription is modified in a model of rapid rat adrenal growth, namely
   regeneration after enucleation and contralateral adrenalectomy.
   Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that AM and VEGF mRNAs
   were significantly increased in regenerating adrenals with respect to
   the intact adrenocortical tissue of sham-operated control rats.
   Subsequent studies were carried out on dispersed rat adrenocortical
   cells cultured in vitro for 72 h. Conventional PCR demonstrated that
   cultured cells expressed AM and VEOF mRNAs. Moreover, real-time PCR
   showed that 24 h exposure to 10(-8) M AM or 50 ng/ml VEGF significantly
   raised the expression of VEGF and AM, respectively, without affecting
   that of their own mRNA, suggesting the occurence of autocrine-paracrine
   up-regulatory mechanisms. Taken together, our findings allow us to
   conceive that the coordinate up-regulation of AM and VEGF expression may
   favor cell proliferation and neoangiogenesis, thereby leading to a rapid
   restoration of morphology and function of regenerating adrenals.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of Mo, Ga and Fe, and their combinations on the corrosion
   resistance of mechanically alloyed NiAl has been studied using
   potentiodynamic polarization curves and linear polarization resistance
   techniques at room temperature. The corrosive medium consisted of 0.5 M
   H2SO4 and 0.5 M HNO3. The NiAl+6Mo alloy exhibited the best corrosion
   resistance in 0.5M H2SO4; however, this alloy showed the lowest
   corrosion resistance in 0.5M HNO3. With the exception of 6Ga and 2Mo+2Ga
   additions, all the other additions in the NiAl alloy had a detrimental
   effect on the corrosion resistance in 0.5 M H2SO4 and presented no
   passivation except for the alloy containing 6Fe. With respect to 0.5 M
   HNO3 solution, all the additions decreased the corrosion rate of the
   NiAl-base alloy by two orders of magnitude while their passivity was
   reduced. When the film formed on the alloy was flaw-free, the underlying
   region did not suffer severe corrosion and was not pitted, while for
   films containing flaws or any other discontinuities, the alloy suffered
   from corrosion. (c) 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate parameters of thyroid
   function and indices of peripheral thyroid hormone action (such as SHBG)
   in patients whose hypothyroidism was considered well controlled under
   current criteria. Eighty-five patients with T4-treated hypothyroidism,
   28 of whom had athyria, were compared with 114 normal individuals with
   the same TSH levels. T3 levels were significantly lower in
   hypothyroidism although mean T4 and fT4 levels were significantly
   higher. Furthermore, mean SHBG levels were significantly lower in
   hypothyroidism independently of age. The difference remained when
   stricter criteria for adequate treatment were applied (TSH < 2.5 mu
   U/ml). Significant negative correlations were found between logTSH and
   T3. The slopes of the regression lines of T3 to TSH were significantly
   different in the control group and the hypothyroid group: thus, for the
   same TSH levels, T3 levels were lower in the hypothyroid group. We
   conclude that patients with T4-treated hypothyroidism have lower T3
   levels, lower T3/T4 ratio and lower SHBG than normal individuals with
   the same TSH, perhaps indicating relative tissue hypothyroidism in the
   liver. TSH levels used to monitor substitution, mostly regulated by
   intracellular T3 in the pituitary, may not be such a good indicator of
   adequate thyroid hormone action in all tissues. The co-administration of
   T3 may prove more effective in this respect, provided novel suitable
   preparations are developed. Until this is accomplished, substitution in
   hypothyroidism should aim at low normal TSH, to ensure normal T3 levels.}},

Abstract = {{Gaucher disease (GD) is a disorder of glycosphinglipid metabolism caused
   by deficiency of lysosomal acid beta-glucosidase (GC), resulting in
   progressive deposition of glucosylceramide in macrophages. The glucose
   analogue, N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ, Miglustat), is an inhibitor
   of the ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase (CSG) which catalyzes the
   first step of glycosphingolipids biosynthesis and is currently approved
   for the oral treatment of type 1 GD. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we
   constructed plasmids containing wild-type and several mutations in
   glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. The plasmids were transfected into COS-7
   cells and stable transfected cell lines were obtained by geneticin
   (G418) selection. Cells were cultured during 6 days with medium with or
   without 10 mu M NB-DNJ. The addition of NB-DNJ to COS-7 cell medium
   leads to 1.3-, 2.1-, 2.3-, 3.6-, and 9.9-fold increase in the activity
   of S364R, wild-type, N370S, V15M, and M123T GC, respectively. However,
   no significant changes were observed in the activity of the L444P,
   L336P, and S465del mutated proteins, but a small decrease in the rare
   P266L variant was observed.
   These results suggest that NB-DNJ, in addition to the inhibitory effect
   on CSG, also works as a ``chemical chaperone{''}, increasing the
   activity of acid beta-glucosidase of wild-type and several GC mutated
   proteins, including the most frequent N370S mutation.
   The specific location of the Miglustat binding site in GC is unknown.
   Potential binding sites in the enzyme have been searched for using
   computational molecular docking. The searching strategy identified three
   potential GC binding sites for Miglustat, one being the
   substrate-binding site of the enzyme, which was the best-ranked site by
   AutoDock program. Therefore, it is possible that Miglustat exerts its
   chaperoning activity on acid beta-glucosidase by acting as an inhibitor
   bound at the active site.
   This increase on the activity of the acid beta-glucosidase would imply
   that Miglustat is not only a substrate reducer but also an inhibitor of
   the GC degradation, with very promising clinical implications for the
   treatment of GD patients. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   capsular with adjacent muscle invasion. During the next 3 years, the
   patient remained well. The disease recurred in 2001, with hypertensive
   episodes and peritonitis carcinomatosa. Further investigation revealed
   no other metastatic sites. Peritoneal metastasis is very rare in
   malignant pheochromocytoma and generally is attributed to direct

Abstract = {{Aim. The aim of this study was to describe the employment conditions of
   women with chronic venous disorders of the lower limbs.
   Methods. Cross sectional study conducted by general practitioners who
   describe the first 3 women, between 18 and 65 years of age, who were
   employed and who presented with at least CEAP stage I venous disorders.
   Results. Occupations held by these women indicate significant departures
   from the general population with an over representation of industrial
   workers (18.6\% vs 11.9\%) and an under representation of intermediate
   professions (12.5\% vs 26.6\%), (P<0.001). At work, 78.2\% (n=4 143) of
   the women remained standing for 6.2 +/- 2.4 hours per day and/or 52.3\%
   (n=2 771) were seated for prolonged periods, 28.9\% (n=1 503) were
   exposed to sources of high heat on the legs and 18.2\% (n=947) wore
   garments that compressed the abdomen Conditions favorable to the
   ergonomic evolution of their workstation are limited: only 9.2\% (n=397)
   thought it possible to reduce the time they spend standing; 10.1\%
   (n=319) the time they spend sitting; 12.9\% (n=189) their exposure to
   heat. Combating these factors appears difficult: 74.3\% (n=3 883) state
   that they do not have sufficient breaks to rest their legs, 38.9\% (n=2
   053) that they do not have the opportunity to stretch their legs and
   42.5\% (n=1 395) that compression stockings would be permitted, but
   would be a hindrance in their work (85.6\%, n=4 503). For 27\% (n=1 424)
   of respondents, these problems significantly increase the arduousness of
   their work and 73.7\% (n=3 870) think their working conditions have
   worsened their venous distress.
   Conclusion. Women who consult for venous problems are employed in work
   which are characterized by unavoidable conditions constituting
   undeniable venous risk factors for venous disease and occupational
   medicine does not pay enough attention to the ``ladies legs{''} at work.}},

Abstract = {{Insertion of ventilation tubes is regarded as a simple, effective and

   effusions. We conducted a prospective observational study of 112
   children to ascertain what early post-operative complications were
   experienced. Our findings were consistent with previously published
   figures for post-surgical otorrhoea and obstruction rates, at 13.5 per
   cent and 4 per cent (by ear), respectively, using intra-operative
   administration of antibiotic/steroid ear drops. We identified unique
   characteristics of differing ethnic groups with regard to findings at
   surgery and postoperative outcomes. There was a tendency for grommets
   placed in the left car to be extruded early and Maori and Pacific
   Islanders were significantly more likely to have a non-functioning tube
   (blocked or extruded) in the early post-operative period. Overall, one
   in four children developed a post-operative complication (otorrhoea or
   non-functioning tube) suggesting that early and close follow up may
   allow timely identification and intervention where required.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Teaching about evidence-based medicine (EBM)
   is widespread, yet physicians still use rapid references preferentially
   over EBM techniques such as literature searching and appraisal of
   original research. The Internet now provides rapid access to
   preappraised evidence. We provided clinically integrated teaching of
   using the Internet to answer clinical questions for third-year medical
   students and assessed the change in their search skills. Methods: The
   curriculum included two 90-minute computer lab sessions with teaching of
   search skills related to clinical questions. Immediately before the
   first and after the second session, students recorded sites searched,
   time needed for searching, and answers found for three standardized
   questions. Pretest and posttest questions were matched and reversed with
   each block. Results: Eighty-six students completed pretests and
   posttests. For two questions about conventional medical care, posttest
   answer quality was significantly higher, and posttest search times were
   significantly shorter, by 1.6 minutes for question I (mean pretest
   search time 6.3 minutes, mean posttest search time 4.7 minutes) and 1.9
   minutes for question 2 (mean pretest search time 8 minutes, mean
   posttest search time 6.1 minutes). For a question about herbal medicine,
   results were similar, but there were smaller differences that did not
   reach statistical significance. Students used or found significantly
   fewer sites on the posttest than on the pretest to find answers for all
   three question types (absolute difference=0.3 sites for each question).
   Conclusions: Introducing students to useful Web sites, practicing
   answering clinical questions, and integrating this process with clinical
   rotation experiences can reduce the effort that students need to find
   answers and improve the quality of answers they find.}},

Abstract = {{Increased oleate content of soybean {[}Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] oil may
   be useful for food and industrial applications requiring increased
   oxidative stability. The objective of this study was to determine if
   transgressive segregates for oleate content could be found in crosses
   between three mid-oleate lines: FA22 from Iowa State University,
   N98-4445A from the USDA-ARS/North Carolina State University, and M23
   from Saga University, Japan. Single-cross populations of FA22 X M23,
   FA22 X N98-4445A, and N98-4445A X M23 were developed. Plants with
   significantly greater oleate than the highest oleate parent were
   observed in the three populations in the F-2 and F-3 generations. For
   the F-3:4 lines grown in Puerto Rico, there were four lines with
   significantly greater oleate than the highest parent in the cross FA22 X
   M23, one line in FA22 X N98-4445A, and 27 lines in N98-4445A x M23. The
   F-3:4 line with the greatest oleate content had 689 g kg(-1) in the
   population FA22 x M23, 672 g kg(-1) in FA22 X N98-4445A, and 730 g
   kg(-1) in N98-4445A X M23 compared with 542 g kg(-1) for FA22, 589 g
   kg(-1) for N98-4445A, and 583 g kg(-1) for M23. Transgressive segregates
   from the populations should be useful as parents in a breeding program
   to develop cultivars with elevated oleate content.}},

Abstract = {{Radially acquired fast spin-echo data can be processed to obtain
   T-2-weighted images and a T-2 map from a single k-space data set. The
   general approach is to use data at a specific TE (or narrow TE range) in
   the center of k-space and data at other TE values in the outer part of
   k-space. With this method high-resolution T-2-weighted images and T-2
   maps are obtained in a time efficient manner. The mixing of TE data,
   however, introduces errors in the T-2-weighted images and T-2 maps that
   affect the accuracy of the T-2 estimates. In this work, various k-space
   data processing methods for reconstructing T-2-weighted images and T-2
   maps from a single radial fast spin-echo k-space data set are analyzed
   in terms of the accuracy of T-2 estimates. The analysis is focused on
   the effect of image artifacts, object dependency, and noise on the T-2
   estimates. Results are presented in computer-generated phantoms and in

Abstract = {{The opportunistic character of adaptation through natural selection can

   that promote the extinction of the population. Such pathologies include

   tragedy of the commons, adaptation to temporally unreliable resources,
   cheating and other antisocial behavior, infectious pathogen carrier
   states, parthenogenesis, and cancer, an intraorganismal evolutionary
   pathology. It is known that hierarchical population dynamics can protect
   a population from invasion by pathological genes. Can it also alter the
   genotype so as to prevent the generation of such genes in the first
   place, that is, suppress the evolvability of evolutionary pathologies? A
   model is constructed in which one locus controls the expression of the
   pathological trait, and a series of modifier loci exist that can prevent
   the expression of this trait. It is found that multiple evolvability
   checkpoint genes can evolve to prevent the generation of variants that
   cause evolutionary pathologies. The consequences of this finding are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Several Anglo-American studies found that vertical social
   characteristics made a difference in the utilization of cardiac
   rehabilitation programmes. A social gradient was also demonstrated for
   prevalence of risk factors, psychological strain and psychosocial
   resources. This study investigated `social differences for these factors
   in a group of 536 patients who had suffered from a myocardial
   infarction. In contrast to findings in other industrialized countries,
   German patients of higher status groups made less use of cardiac
   rehabilitative services than patients with a lower and middle class
   status. However, similar to Anglo-American findings, patients with a
   lower socioeconomic status were more likely to be smokers and more
   likely to be obese than other patients. Also they had higher levels of
   comorbidity and depression and lower self-efficacy expectations. Thus
   while there were no social disadvantages in terms of participation in
   cardiac rehabilitation programmes, which seems to be largely due to the
   specific characteristics of the German health care system, patients of
   lower socio-economic status seem to have worse baseline conditions and
   as a result of this a specific need for rehabilitative support.}},

Abstract = {{The widely used JPEG lossy baseline coding system is known to produce,
   at low bit rates, blocking effects and Gibbs phenomenon. This paper
   develops a method to get rid of these artifacts without smoothing images
   and without removing perceptual features. This results in better looking
   pictures and improved PSNR. Our algorithm is based on an adapted total
   variation minimization approach constrained by the knowledge of the
   input intervals the unquantized cosine coefficients belong to. In this
   way, we reconstruct an image having the same quantized coefficients than
   the original one, but which is minimal in term of the total variation.
   This discourages blocking effects and Gibbs phenomenon to appear while
   edges are kept as sharp as possible. Although the proposed subgradient
   method is converging in infinite time, experiments show that best
   results are obtained with a very few number of iterations. This leads to
   a simple and fast algorithm that may be applied to the great set of JPEG
   images to decompress them more efficiently.}},

   complete evolution of an initially 2.7 M circle dot star all the way
   from the zero-age main sequence to the white dwarf stage. We find that
   most of the original H-rich material of the post-AGB remnant is burnt
   during the post-LTP evolution, with the result that, at entering its
   white dwarf cooling track, the remaining H envelope becomes 10(-6) M
   circle dot in agreement with asteroseismological inferences for some ZZ
   Ceti stars.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is known that emergency surgery for colorectal cancer is
   associated with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was
   to assess the presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with
   complicated colorectal cancer. Risk factors for morbidity and mortality
   were also evaluated.
   Methods: From 1991 to 2002, the medical records of 107 consecutive
   patients undergoing emergency surgery for obstructing or perforating
   colorectal carcinoma were retrospectively reviewed. Information
   regarding patient and tumor characteristics, treatment, and outcome was
   recorded. Risk factors were assessed by multivariate analysis.
   Results: Eighty-three patients (78 \%) had complete obstruction and 24
   (22 \%) had perforation. Overall and major complications occurred in 70
   \% and 34 \%, respectively. The mortality rate was 15 \%. Independent
   risk factors for major morbidity were perioperative blood transfusion
   and high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, whereas
   those for mortality were older. age and high Acute Physiology and
   Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score.
   Conclusions: Emergency surgery for complicated colorectal carcinoma
   carries high rates of morbidity and mortality. To achieve improvements
   in outcome, intensive treatment, after surgery in patients with risk
   factors is recommended. (c) 2005 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A 45 year old man presented with abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and
   significant weight loss over a period of about four weeks. Imaging of
   the abdomen showed a mass in the region of the head of the pancreas. In
   view of the size of the mass and the clinical picture, a Whipple's
   procedure was performed. Histological evaluation of the pancreatic
   tumour showed an adenosquamous carcinoma ( predominantly composed of
   squamous carcinoma), which was extensively infiltrative with perineural
   invasion and involvement of peripancreatic lymph nodes. Areas of
   pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia grade III and merging of the
   squamous and adenocarcinoma components were evident. Unusual
   histological features that characterised this case included a pronounced
   acantholytic pattern within the squamous carcinoma component, and the
   presence of both osteoclastic and pleomorphic giant cells. Giant cells
   have not been documented previously in association with an adenosquamous

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A thermogram or thermal image provides a two-dimensional map of skin
   temperature distribution. The technique, which uses the IR radiation of
   objects as the source for imaging, has significantly developed since it
   was launched for medical imaging in the 1960s. Modern focal array
   equipment provides both high spatial and high temperature resolution.
   Body temperature measurement is a traditional approach to estimating the
   time of death. A number of protocols have been described for that
   purpose. Another application for IR imaging is the assessment of
   environmental conditions of detected corpses (water, cars, weather
   conditions). Skin burns can be easily visualized by thermal images.
   Thermal imaging was also used to investigate the skin temperature at the
   entry point after shots were fired from 0.22-0.38-calibre handguns.
   Whiplash injuries gained importance in liability cases after car
   crashes. Occasionally thermal images can provide additional information
   in this pathology, but this might not be always unambiguous. Thermal
   imaging was successfully used as an alternative to Polygraph testing. In
   this application, psychological effects on blood flow are investigated,
   and an accuracy of 78\% in detecting deceptive subjects is reported.
   Thermal imaging can be used as a method of temperature measurement in a
   number of applications of forensic medicine. When used for medico-legal
   evidence, it is important that a standard protocol for subject
   preparation, image capture and analysis is used. A scheme for
   standardization of the latter is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Current guidelines for the treatment of bipolar type II (BP II) major
   depressive episode (MDE) recommend using either mood stabilizer
   monotherapy or the combination of a mood stabilizer with a selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). These guidelines are the result of
   concern over SSRI-induced manic switch episodes. We previously showed
   that fluoxetine monotherapy may be effective as an initial treatment for
   BP II and BP NOS MDE with a low manic switch rate. We now present the
   results of a double-blind, placebo-substitution continuation study of
   fluoxetine monotherapy in BP II and BP NOS patients who have recovered
   from their MDE. This was a two-phase study. In study phase I, patients
   received open-label fluoxetine monotherapy 20 mg daily for up to 8
   weeks. Responders with a final 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for
   Depression (HAM-D) score <= 9 were enrolled into study phase II which
   consisted of double-blind, placebo-substitution continuation therapy
   with fluoxetine 20 mg daily for up to 6 months. Outcome measures
   included the 17-item HAM-D and Young Mania Rating (YMR) scales. Changes
   in YMR scores were assessed using generalized estimating equation
   analysis. Relapse was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and
   Fisher's exact test In study phase II, 43\% of fluoxetine-treated
   patients and 100\% of placebo-treated patients relapsed during
   continuation therapy (P=0.08). The mean increase in YMR score in study
   phase II was slightly higher in the fluoxetine-treated patients (3.0 +/-
   1.8) versus placebo-treated patients (0.2 +/- 0.4) (P=0.01). However,
   this difference was not clinically meaningful. No hypomanic switch
   episodes were observed during study phase II. Despite the limited sample
   size resulting in insufficient power to detect statistical significance
   in relapse rates or change in YMR scores between treatment conditions,
   these preliminary data appear to support previous observations
   demonstrating that initial and continuation fluoxetine monotherapy may
   be safe and effective for some patients with BP II or BP NOS MDE with a
   low manic switch rate. Larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these
   findings. Int Clin Psychopharmacol. (c) 2005 Lippincott Williams \&

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the impact of a school-based nutrition education
   intervention aimed at increasing the consumption of fruits and
   vegetables.
   Design: The intervention programme increased the provision of fruits and
   vegetables in schools and provided a range of point-of-purchase
   marketing materials, newsletters for children and parents, and teacher
   information. Curriculum materials at age 6-7 and 10-11 years were also
   developed and utilised. Evaluation was undertaken with groups of younger
   (aged 6-7 years) and older (aged 10-11 years) children. Methods included
   3-day dietary records with interview and cognitive and attitudinal
   measures at baseline, with follow-up at 9 months, in intervention and
   control schools.
   Setting: The work was undertaken in primary schools in Dundee, Scotland.
   Subjects: Subjects comprised 511 children in two intervention schools
   with a further 464 children from two schools acting as controls.
   Results: Children (n=64) in the intervention schools had an average
   increase in fruit intake (133 +/- 1.9 to 183 +/- 17.0 g day(-1)) that
   was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than the increase (100 +/- 11.7 to
   107 +/- 14.2 g day(-1)) estimated in children (n=65) in control schools.
   No other changes in food or nutrient intake were detected. Increases in
   scores for variables relating to knowledge about fruits and vegetables
   and subjective norms were also greater in the intervention than in the
   control group, although taste preferences for fruits and vegetables were
   unchanged.
   Conclusions: It is concluded that a whole school approach to increasing
   intakes of fruits and vegetables has a modest but significant effect on
   cognitive and attitudinal variables and on fruit intake.}},

Abstract = {{Sedimentation field flow fractionation (SdFFF) is an emerging
   high-performance analytical tool for separation and determination of
   size and adsorption characteristics of colloidal particles. This study
   demonstrates how SdFFF can be used to characterize nanoparticles
   prepared for in vivo applications including (1) the quantification of
   polymer uptake on nanoparticles where surface coverage is crucial and
   (2) the coupling of cell adhesive peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp
   motif (RGD). Quantitative information about polymer adhesion in order to
   prepare a bioinert surface and an accurate determination of ligand
   uptake are both of obvious importance for the understanding of, for
   example, relations between the number of attached molecules for
   biointeraction and an observed therapeutic effect. In addition, the
   present work highlights the necessity to perform careful
   characterization of commercially available particulate starting
   materials, in terms of size and polydispersity, prior to biological
   experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{We report the cases of 2 boys and 1 girl suffering from Netherton
   syndrome. Both boys presented with a non-bullous congenital erythroderma
   and were diagnosed early as Netherton syndrome with hair biopsies. Both
   had severe failure to thrive, signs of atopy, several episodes of
   bacterial infection, and rickets (with a high blood level of vitamin D
   in the first boy, and vitamin D deficiency in the second). In the third
   case, the pilar abnormality appeared at the age of 3 years. The girl had
   ichtyosis linearis circumflexa, failure to thrive and severe
   constipation. Netherton syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by
   severe ichtyosis, signs of atopy, immune deficiency and failure to
   thrive. The disease is severe and comprises many complications in early
   infancy. It is due to a genetic disorder of recessive autosomal
   transmission, and the gene, SPINK5, is located in the chromosome 5.
   Prenatal diagnosis is possible. Two of our patients had rickets, which
   has never been described in such patients population. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The establishment of new in vitro cultures from mature woody plants is
   often a difficult task due to the little growth of initial explants.
   Since the explant origin plays an important role, in this work the
   effect of the origin of the explants (micropropagated or conventionally
   propagated plants) on both establishment and multiplication of the in
   vitro cultures has been studied using different culture media. Best
   results during establishment were obtained with explants taken from
   micropropagated plants. The multiplication rate of new cultures was
   strongly affected by the type of propagation of the mother plants. Thus,
   while the cumulative number of shoots increased sharply in cultures
   originated from micropropagated plants, cultures originated from
   cutting-derived plants showed only a moderate increase. Culture medium
   composition influenced the multiplication rate. After nine subcultures,
   a significantly lower number of shoots was found on QL medium than on MS
   or on WP. The positive effect of micropropagation of donor plants on the
   establishment and multiplication of new in vitro cultures is discussed
   in terms of a possible reinvigoration during in vitro culture. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Eggs from five clutches of Chamaeleo calyptratus were incubated at 25,

   were slightly biased toward females at all temperatures but did not

   Egg survival was sufficiently high that sex-biased temperature-induced
   mortality cannot account for the lack of departure from 1:1 sex ratios.
   I conclude that the veiled chameleon has genetic sex determination (GSD)
   and that anecdotal accounts of temperature-dependent sex determination
   (TSD) for this species, and other chameleons are likely to reflect
   reporting or statistical bias.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1923-1932}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Oxidation of LDL is thought to be involved in both initiating and
   sustaining atherogenesis through the formation of proinflammatory lipids
   and the covalent modification of LDL particles. Platelet- activating
   factor (PAF; 1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a potent
   phospholipid mediator involved in inflammation. Upon oxidation of LDL,
   oxidized phospholipids with PAF-like structure are generated, and some
   of them may act via the PAF receptor. We evaluated the contribution of
   1-0-hexadecyl-2-acetylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C16:0 PAF) and of
   other PAF analogs on the PAF-like bioactivity formed upon Cu2+-
   initiated oxidation of LDL. Reverse-phase HPLC purification and
   electrospray ionization-MS analyses showed that upon oxidation of LDL
   with inactivated PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), C16:0 PAF accounted for >
   30\% of PAF-like biological activity and its sn-2 butenoyl analog
   accounted for > 50\%. However, upon LDL oxidation in the presence of
   exogenous 1-0-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PAF) without
   PAF-AH inactivation, C16:0 PAF formation accounted for > 90\% of the
   biological activity recovered. We suggest that the C16:0 PAF, despite
   being a minor constituent of the LDL peroxidation products, may
   contribute substantially to the bioactivity formed in oxidized LDL. The
   higher bioactivity of C16:0 PAF, and the higher selectivity of the
   LDL-attached lyso-PAF transacetylase toward very short acyl chains
   {[}acetate (C2) vs. butanate (C4)], may explain the contribution
   described above.}},

Abstract = {{Power generation from nuclear reactors provides an almost inexhaustive
   power source due to the huge quantities of nuclear fuel existent in our

   Interest has been shifted to the so-called hybrid reactors
   {[}accelerator-driven systems (ADS)] as an alternative technology for
   power generation and transmutation, thus requiring precise knowledge
   about nuclear structure and nuclear reaction characteristics. Research
   groups from Instituto de Fisica, Universidade de Sao Paulo and Brazilian
   Center for Research in Physics made a joint effort to develop a computer
   program, CRISP, to calculate the intranuclear cascade proprieties and
   the nuclear evaporation process, present in all nuclear reactions with
   energies above a few tens of mega-electron-volts, using Monte Carlo
   techniques. Some reaction channels were included in these programs,
   resulting in a more realistic representation of the processes involved,
   aiming at reactor physics studies and academic studies about hadron and
   meson properties in nuclear matter. Some results obtained with this code
   and a comparison with experimental data are presented. Although all
   these results are preliminary, they are very consistent with the
   available experimental data. Since the applicability of the CRISP
   package has a wide range of options, especially in ADS, some results
   describing the effectiveness of the code were achieved.}},

   individuals. Cohort members were followed from 1 January 1998 to 31
   December 2002. With regard to preventing hospitalization due to
   pneumonia, we observed a decrease in the incidence of 1/10000
   person-months and a reduction in the relative risk of 38\% in the
   vaccinated cohort compared with the non-vaccinated subjects. A decrease
   in the risk of hospital admission for asthma, acute otitis media,
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory infections
   was also observed in vaccinated compared with non-vaccinated subjects.
   The specificity of these findings was confirmed by the lack of a
   protective effect from vaccination for those outcomes, such as
   hospitalization `for all causes' and,other otorhinolaryngological
   diagnoses', that were not directly related to pneumococcal disease.}},

Abstract = {{A new kind of conservatism has evolved and has taken center stage in
   many nations, one that is best seen as ``conservative modernization.{''}
   Although parts of these conservative positions may have originated
   within the New Right, they are now not limited to what has traditionally
   been called the Right. They have been taken up by a much larger segment
   of government and policy makers and have also even been appropriated by
   groups that one might least expect to do so, such as African American
   activists in cities like Milwaukee.
   In this article, we examine a growing phenomenon: the growth of
   seemingly conservative sentiments among some of the least powerful
   groups in this society. Perhaps the most significant organization to
   emerge has been the Black Alliance for Educational Options (BAEO). It
   has mobilized around voucher advocacy for urban working-class
   communities of color. BAEO has attracted significant attention not just
   for its iconoclastic alignment with conservative educational reform, but
   also for accepting funding from far-Right foundations. This article
   analyzes the complexity of the discursive and sociopolitical space that
   BAEO occupies. The organization's awareness of its critics, allies, and
   the limited range of educational options within which low-income African
   American families must act belies the notion, put forward by some, that
   BAEO is simply a front organization for the educational Right.
   Nevertheless, BAEO's importance to the larger rightist project in
   education cannot be overstated.
   At the core of our analysis is a concern about what is at stake for all
   of us if a rightist educational agenda succeeds in redefining what and
   whose knowledge is of most worth and what our social and educational
   policies are meant to do. Yet, no matter what one's position is on the
   wisdom of BAEO's strategic actions, this case provides a crucial example
   of the politics of how social movements and alliances are formed and
   reformed out of the material and ideological conditions of daily life. A
   critical but sympathetic understanding of groups such as BAEO may enable
   us to avoid the essentialism and reductionism that enters into critical
   sociological work on the nature of ongoing struggles over educational
   reform. It can provide a more nuanced sense of social actors and the
   possibilities and limits of strategic alliances in a time of major
   conflicts over educational reform during a period of conservative
   modernization.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The Mexican government is offering universal access to
   antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. The cost of doing so, despite aggressive
   price negotiation with the pharmaceutical industry, remains high. Even
   with a low prevalence, about 150,000 Mexicans are estimated to be living
   with HIV and will require ARV treatment. Estimating the resources needed
   to fund this gap should consider how patient and provider
   characteristics affect health care costs.
   Methods. Using a sample of patients from 11 facilities in three Mexican
   cities representing a large proportion of AIDS patients in the country,
   we developed a fixed-effect model, which by controlling the facilities
   and individual heterogeneity estimates predicted costs using patient
   demographic and socioeconomic characteristics as well as physician
   training
   Results. The estimated model explains about 45\% of the variation in
   costs. Additional education is significantly and positively associated
   with cost. Increasing age is also associated with higher costs.
   Conclusions. Socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics
   explain an important proportion of variation in care costs for AIDS,
   despite AIDS being such a heterogeneous disease. Such characteristics
   will need to be taken into account when resource needs are estimated. A
   priority-setting or process considering the principles of equity in the
   fair distribution of resources is needed to help reduce the social
   burden of HIV/AIDS in Mexico. (c) 2005 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Injuries to the lateral collateral ligament and posterolateral corner of
   the knee, particularly when combined with anterior cruciate or posterior

   reconstruction of the posterolateral corner has had less predictable
   results, with residual pathologic laxity especially in the chronic
   situation. This has stimulated many surgeons to recommend acute repair
   of posterolateral knee injuries. This article describes a more anatomic
   reconstruction of the posterolateral corner for chronic instability,
   recreating the lateral collateral ligament and popliteofibular ligament
   using either autogenous or allograft soft tissue and an interference
   screw technique. In a small clinical series, this has proven to restore

Abstract = {{Historical mining, processing and refinement of arsenic in purpose built
   calciners in Cornwall, UK, have resulted in extremely high contamination
   of soils with arsenic in some localized areas. The x-ray absorption
   spectroscopic methods XANES (x-ray absorption near-edge structure) and
   EXAFS (extended x-ray absorption fine structure) were used to retrieve
   arsenic molecular information, i.e. oxidation state and local structure
   around As atoms, in the soil from a calciner ` s residue dump near
   Camborne (which contained 8.82 wt\% arsenic) and identify the most
   abundant modes of As bonding. The results show that arsenic is
   predominantly in pentavalent form, tetrahedrally bound to oxygen atoms

Abstract = {{Immunocompetence may be a good measure of offspring quality, however,
   factors affecting variation in immune responses are not clear. Research
   suggests that immune function can vary due to differences in genetics,
   development conditions and individual quality. Here, I examined factors
   affecting variation in immune response among nestling European starlings
   through a split-nest cross-fostering brood manipulation that included
   two important covariates: spleen size and nest temperatures.
   Immunocompetence was assessed via a cell-mediated immune response to
   phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). This paper provides the first direct evidence
   that individuals with large spleens also mount strong immune responses.
   Exposure to PHA did not cause splenomegaly, as there was no difference
   in spleen size between control birds and those injected with PHA.
   Offspring immune function was affected by common origin and by rearing
   environment, though rearing environment appeared to exert its influence
   only through nest temperatures. A comparison of the immune performance
   of siblings reared in their home nest versus those reared in other nests
   revealed a strong effect of maternal quality. As the difference in natal
   clutch size increased, the magnitude of the difference in immune
   performance between home-reared nestlings versus out-reared nestlings
   increased. Overall, nestling immune function appears to be determined by
   the combination of genetic, maternal and environmental effects.}},

Abstract = {{The increase of reproductive dysfunction cases, such as diminution of
   count and spermatic functionality, precocious puberty in children, the
   increase of breast, prostate and testicles cancer and of malformations
   associated with hormonal problems generates certain uneasiness. At the
   same time, the description of alterations in the reproductive function
   of an increasing number of wild species, by exposure to persistent
   chemical substances, like pesticides, detergents, dioxins and furans,
   has promoted an intense activity of research that has given these
   compounds a central role in the interference (disruption) of the
   hormonal homeostasis. These compounds, endocrine disruptors, are
   characterized in the laboratory taking into account their hormonal or
   anti-hormonal capacity, and whether they can alter the homeostasis of
   the endocrine reproductive system. Some recognized disruptors are
   phytoestrogens, organochloride pesticides, alkylphenol-polyethoxylates,
   chlorophenols, PCBs, phtalates, artificial estrogens (contraceptive),
   dioxins, furans and aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons, which are commonly
   used in our daily life. The recognition of their disruption capacity,
   implies a reframing of the regulation and control systems of
   approximately 50,000 new chemicals, many of wich with potential
   disruption capacity. This includes new toxicological tests and new
   research objectives, renewed evaluation methodology of chemical
   compounds and the re-evaluation of the existing one, using the risk
   estimation system as a principle. Thus, these priorities are considered:
   an international network, with a global data base; the validation of new
   biological tests for the detection of disruptor compounds, and the
   unification of criteria for the risk and associated damage
   characterization on the basis of epidemiological studies.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{777-785}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted to determine the performance of experimental
   stationary knives when ginning upland cotton. Pima cotton was also used
   for comparison. Three knives were modified to allow an opening between
   the knife and the ginning roller of 2.4-, 4.0-, and 5.6-mm (0.095-,
   0.158-, and 0.221-in.) depth, respectively. (A standard stationary knife
   has practically no opening.) The hypothesis is that linters (short
   fibers) cannot be pulled from the seed if the distance between the seed
   and the gripping point is increased beyond their length. As it is now,
   linters have a tendency to be scalped from the seed at the ginning point
   and allow shorter fibers (linters) to be included with the lint. If
   there is less scalping, there should be fewer short fibers. As expected,
   most of the fiber and cottonseed properties were affected by variety and
   were at acceptable levels. The only fiber and cottonseed properties that
   were affected by stationary-knife design included color reflectance,
   color yellowness, foreign matter content in the lint, and cottonseed
   linters content. Foreign matter content in the lint, measured by the
   Shirley Analyzer, increased as the opening between the stationary knives
   and ginning roller increased. The foreign matter content may have
   contributed to the fiber appearing different, and hence the differences
   in color reflectance and color yellowness. There were obvious
   differences, both visually and statistically, in cottonseed linters; the
   lowest linters content occurred when using the stationary knife with the
   2.4-mm (0.095-in.) deep opening between the knife and ginning roller.
   Short fiber content was not affected by stationary-knife design as
   hypothesized. Ginning rate was affected by knife design; the highest
   rate was obtained with a 2.4-mm (0.095-in.) deep opening between the
   stationary knife and ginning roller.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of popular peer-to-peer ( P2P) based systems such as
   Napster and Kazaa, for the exchange of music files and other content,
   has demonstrated that P2P is a viable model for content delivery, but.
   awed with content theft. The Internet is now a major distribution
   channel for digital goods and services. Consequently, it has also
   developed into a medium for the communication of information required to
   complete monetary transactions. These monetary transactions are made
   difficult in the P2P domain, where the infrastructure and its
   participants are not trusted. We describe our concept of cascading
   payments to ensure all participants in a P2P content exchange network
   are compensated, followed by a detailed description of our CasPaCE
   framework, which enables cascading payments and ensures that
   transactions are carried out in a trusted and secure manner. The CasPaCE
   framework implements an Overlay network of `bank' peers which ensures
   non-repudiation of payment as well as content delivery in the P2P

Abstract = {{Study objectives: ( 1) To analyse the impact of flexible employment on
   mental health and job dissatisfaction; and ( 2) to examine the
   constraints imposed by flexible employment on men's and women's
   partnership formation and people's decision to become parents. For the
   two objectives the potentially different patterns by sex and social
   class are explored.
   Design: Cross sectional health survey. Multiple logistic regression
   models separated for sex and social class ( manual and non-manual
   workers) and controlling for age were fitted. Four types of contractual
   arrangements have been considered: permanent, fixed term temporary
   contract, non-fixed term temporary contract, and no contract.
   Setting: Catalonia ( a region in the north east of Spain).
   Participants: Salaried workers interviewed in the 2002 Catalonian health
   survey with no longstanding limiting illness, aged 16 - 64 ( 1474 men
   and 998 women).
   Main results: Fixed term temporary contracts were not associated with
   poor mental health status. The impact of other forms of flexible
   employment on mental health depended on the type of contractual
   arrangement, sex, and social class and it was restricted to less
   privileged workers, women, and manual male workers. The impact of
   flexible employment on living arrangements was higher in men. Among both
   manual and non-manual male workers, those with fixed term temporary
   contracts were less likely to have children when married or cohabiting
   and, additionally, among non-manual male workers they also were more
   likely to remain single (aOR = 2.35; 95\% CI = 1.13 to 4.90).
   Conclusion: Some forms of temporary contracts are related to adverse
   health and psychosocial outcomes with different patterns depending on
   the outcome analysed and on sex and social class. Future research should
   incorporate variables to capture situations of precariousness associated
   with flexible employment.}},

Abstract = {{Several entomopathogenic fungi produce toxins that could be used as

   fumosoroseus is currently used for the biological control of the
   whiteflies Bemisia tabaci and B. argentifolii. Supernatants from
   submerged batch culture, where the fungus produced abundant dispersed
   mycelium, conidia and blastospores, were toxic to the whitefly nymphs.
   The most abundant metabolite was purified by HPLC and identified by mass
   spectrometry and NMR as dipicolinic acid. Both the dipicolinic acid
   produced by the fungus and the chemically synthesized compound had
   insecticidal activity against third-instar nymphs of the insect.
   Dipicolinic acid was toxic to the whitefly nymphs in bioassays involving
   topical applications. In submerged culture, the specific growth rate of
   R fumosoroseus was 0.054 h(-1), the specific glucose consumption rate
   was 0.1195 g g(-1) h(-1) and the specific dipicolinic acid production
   rate was 0.00012 g g(-1) h(-1). Dipicolinic acid was detected after 24 h
   when the fungus started growing; and dipicolinic acid production was
   directly correlated with fungal growth. Nevertheless, the yield was low
   and the maximal concentration was only 0.041 g l(-1). The maximal

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity of the Mixing
   Ability Test to detect improvement of masticatory function in subjects
   on transition from old to new removable partial dentures. Thirty-two
   subjects (seven males, 25 females, mean age 65.0 years) with distal
   extension partially edentulous area in mandible and/or maxilla
   participated in the study. The following reasons were presented for
   replacing the old removable partial dentures with new ones: fracture
   and/or poor fitness of retainers, extraction of abutment teeth, poor
   fitness of denture base, severe wear of artificial teeth and request for
   metal base dentures. Masticatory function with old and new removable
   partial dentures after an adaptation period (mean 27.4 weeks) was
   evaluated by the Mixing Ability Test. Subjects were asked to masticate
   five two-coloured wax cubes with each removable partial denture. Mixing
   Ability Index was obtained from the colour mixture and shape of the
   masticated cubes. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test the
   difference of Mixing Ability Indexes between old and new removable
   partial dentures. The mixing ability indexes with new removable partial
   dentures (mean +/- s.d.: 0.70 +/- 0.68) was significantly higher (P <
   0.001) than those with old removable partial dentures (-0.11 +/- 1.13).
   The results suggest that the Mixing Ability Test was capable of
   detecting improvement in masticatory function with new removable partial
   dentures.}},

   capacitors (about 0.2 eV). On the other hand, E-a is strongly dependent
   on the size of contact areas on the upper electrodes of the capacitors
   (0.1 to 0.2 eV). This result suggests that imprint degradation is mainly
   due to the characteristics of ferroelectric-electrode interfaces, and is
   not due to the edges of the capacitors. We reached this conclusion

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{187-192}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Endocrine dysfunction may produce symptoms that are difficult
   to distinguish from the clinical manifestations of psychiatric
   disorders. In particular, the function of the hypothalamic - pituitary -
   thyroidal axis is known to be associated with a number of psychiatric
   abnormalities, such as depression and anxiety. In this study, we tested
   the hypothesis that depression is more commonly encountered in
   hypothyroidism, while anxiety is more prevalent in hyperthyroidism.
   Additionally, we aimed to evaluate the correlations of the intensity of
   the psychiatric symptomatology in these patients with the specific
   parameters of thyroid function, such as levels of TSH, T3 and T4.
   Method: Patients newly diagnosed as having thyroid disorders were
   included in the study. They were classified into five study groups (
   according to the results of thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH), free
   triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4) and autoantibody
   (anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and anti-microsomal antibodies)
   measurements): hypothyroid, hyperthyroid, subclinical hypothyroid,
   subclinical hyperthyroid, and euthyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
   Psychopathological symptoms were evaluated on the 17-item Hamilton
   Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS), Brief Symptom Inventory ( BSI), BSI
   Sub-scales and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( HAD). Psychiatric
   diagnoses were performed using DSM-IV-SCID ( Structured Clinical
   Interview for DSM). The relationship between the results of the
   psychiatric evaluation and thyroid function tests was assessed
   statistically by ANOVA and Pearson correlation tests. Results: Eighty
   patients ( 68 female and 12 male), with a mean age of 42.5 +/- 13.4
   years, were evaluated. A positive correlation between the total BSI
   scores and TSH levels ( r = 0.65, P = 0.01) was noted in the hypothyroid
   ( n = 25) group. Hyperthyroid patients ( n = 22) showed a positive
   correlation between HDRS scores and fT4 levels ( r = 0.62, P = 0.01).
   The BSI scores in hypo- and hyperthyroidism were significantly higher
   than normal ( P< 0.05). In the subclinical hypothyroid ( n = 7),
   subclinical hyperthyroid ( n = 11), and euthyroid Hashimoto's
   thyroiditis ( n = 15) groups no correlation was found between thyroid
   function tests and HDRS, BSI, and HAD scores. Conclusion: The results
   indicate that patients with thyroid disorders have high levels of
   anxiety and depressive symptoms. Thirty-five patients (43\%) out of 80
   had an axis I psychiatric disorder. However, our findings did not
   support an association between high levels of depression and
   hypothyroidism or between high levels of anxiety and hyperthyroidism.
   Moreover, this study did not reveal any specific psychiatric
   manifestation of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.}},

Title = {{Uniform shear flow in dissipative gases: Computer simulations of
   inelastic hard spheres and frictional elastic hard spheres}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3, 1}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the preceding paper, we have conjectured that the main transport
   properties of a dilute gas of inelastic hard spheres (IHSs) can be
   satisfactorily captured by an equivalent gas of elastic hard spheres
   (EHSs), provided that the latter are under the action of an effective
   drag force and their collision rate is reduced by a factor (1+alpha)/2
   (where alpha is the constant coefficient of normal restitution). In this
   paper we test the above expectation in a paradigmatic nonequilibrium
   state, namely, the simple or uniform shear flow, by performing Monte
   Carlo computer simulations of the Boltzmann equation for both classes of
   dissipative gases with a dissipation range 0.5 <=alpha <= 0.95 and two
   values of the imposed shear rate a. It is observed that the evolution
   toward the steady state proceeds in two stages: a short kinetic stage
   (strongly dependent on the initial preparation of the system) followed
   by a slower hydrodynamic regime that becomes increasingly less dependent
   on the initial state. Once conveniently scaled, the intrinsic quantities
   in the hydrodynamic regime depend on time, at a given value of alpha,
   only through the reduced shear rate a({*})(t)proportional to a/root
   T(t), until a steady state, independent of the imposed shear rate and of
   the initial preparation, is reached. The distortion of the steady-state
   velocity distribution from the local equilibrium state is measured by
   the shear stress, the normal stress differences, the cooling rate, the
   fourth and sixth cumulants, and the shape of the distribution itself. In
   particular, the simulation results seem to be consistent with an
   exponential overpopulation of the high-velocity tail. These properties
   are common to both the IHS and EHS systems. In addition, the EHS results
   are in general hardly distinguishable from the IHS ones if alpha greater
   than or similar to 0.7, so that the distinct signature of the IHS gas
   (higher anisotropy and overpopulation) only manifests itself at
   relatively high dissipations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a stylized partially observed Markov decision
   process (POMDP) framework to study a dynamic pricing problem faced by
   sellers of fashion-like goods. We consider a retailer that plans to sell
   a given stock of items during a finite sales season. The objective of
   the retailer is to dynamically price the product in a way that maximizes
   expected revenues. Our model brings together various types of
   uncertainties about the demand, some of which are resolvable through
   sales observations. We develop a rigorous upper bound for the seller's
   optimal dynamic decision problem and use it to propose an
   active-learning heuristic pricing policy We conduct a numerical study to
   test the performance of four different heuristic dynamic pricing
   policies in order to gain insight into several important managerial
   questions that arise in the context of revenue management.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation is in continuation with the earlier studies on
   diarrhea epidemic due to rotavirus, that occurred at Jawhar western
   India, among tribal children during Dec 2000-Jan 2001 published by
   National Institute of Virology, Pune. Three rotavirus strains were
   isolated in cell culture from fecal specimens of affected children.
   Monoclonal antibody ELISA and RT-PCR typed the isolates as G3P {[}8].
   Two isolates agglutinated guinea pig erythrocytes thereby indicating
   their animal origin. Antiserum against simian G3, SA11 neutralized both
   the isolates largely than antiserum against human G3 (YO). Nucleotide
   sequencing of VP7 gene, nested PCR product of three isolates, and two
   original fecal specimens showed 100 \% identity with both simian G3,
   SA11 prototype and ROSVP7, SA11 strains whereas, lower identity (82 \%)
   with human G3 (YO) strain. Partial sequence analysis of the VP4 gene of
   fecal specimen FS-006964 \& isolate 1-006964 showed 99 \% identity with
   G1 P{[}8] strain, while 80 \% identity with simian G3P{[}2], SA11
   strain. Thus, the strains appeared to be reassortants between human and
   simian origin. Serological studies further supported the identity of the
   causative agent as simian G3, SA11 like strains. Neutralizing antibody
   titers at very low level against simian G3, SA11 as well as human G3
   (YO) strains among the population at Jawhar suggested an overall lack of
   immunity against the virus. Seroconversion against simian G3, SA11 was
   shown by six out of seven child patients. Thus, simian G3, SA11 like
   strains are claimed for the first time as etiological agents of diarrhea
   in humans. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical composition and physical properties of the rose absolute
   produced from rose concretes and the extract, supplied by three

   rose absolute consists mainly of beta-phenylethyl alcohol, citronellol,
   geraniol, nerol, eugenol, methyl eugenol, geranyl acetate, benzyl
   alcohol, nonadecane, nonadecene and farnesol. The solid residue, which
   is the by-product of absolute production, was further divided on a
   silica gel column into three fractions by solvents having different
   polarities (n-hexane, 5\% diethyl ether in n-hexane, and diethyl ether
   alone). A fraction eluated with n-hexane was analysed directly by GC and
   GC-MS. Two other fractions, after saponification, were converted to
   their methyl ester derivatives and then analysed by GC and GC-MS. It was
   observed that the solid residue contains mainly straight-chain saturated
   hydrocarbons with high molecular weight (C-15-C-31) and the esters of
   carboxylic acids and a homologous series between them exists. It was
   also concluded that the extract obtained by solvent extraction from the
   residue of rose flower (Rosa damascena Mill.) which was subjected to
   steam distillation is also a valuable raw material. Copyright (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Background: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a
   life-threatening complication following organ transplantation. The
   greatest risk is seen in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seronegative patients
   receiving allografts from EBV-seropositive donors. We demonstrate a new
   approach of pre-transplant prophylaxis of EBV related PTLD, suggesting
   that, prior to living-related renal transplantation, blood transfusion
   from an EBV-seropositive donor to an EBV-seronegative recipient could
   induce primary EBV infection in the recipient, developing EBV immunity
   and decreasing risk of PTLD. Methods: Recipients underwent weekly
   donor-specific blood transfusion (3 x 100 nil,) before transplantation.
   EBV-mRNA expression, viral load, serological tests, and clinical signs
   of EBV infection were assessed following blood transfusion. Results: We
   explored a new approach in 2 young EBV-seronegative renal allograft
   recipients. Both patients developed primary EBV infection following
   blood transfusion before transplantation and showed symptom-free
   seroconversion post-transplantation without persistent EBV activation.
   There were no signs of PTLD during 5-year follow-up. Conclusions: A new
   effective and inexpensive approach is suggested for development of EBV
   immunity and probably for prophylaxis of EBV-associated PTLD.}},

Number = {{8-9}},
Pages = {{915-936}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Displacement, an operation of cartographic generalization, resolves
   congestion and overlap of map features that is caused by enlargement of
   map symbols to ensure readability at reduced scales. Algorithms for
   displacement must honour spatial context, avoid creating secondary
   spatial conflicts, and retain spatial patterns and relations such as
   alignments and relative distances that characterize the original map
   features. We present an algorithm for displacement of buildings based on
   optimization. While existing approaches directly displace the individual
   buildings, our algorithm first forms a truss of of elastic beams to
   capture important spatial patterns and preserve them during
   displacement. The algorithm proceeds in two phases. The first phase
   analyses spatial relationships to construct a truss as a weighted graph.
   The truss is initially based on the minimum spanning tree connecting the
   building centroids, with beam stiffness determined by spatial
   relationships. The second phase iteratively deforms the truss to
   minimize energy until a user-defined distance is achieved. At each
   iteration, it computes forces on the truss, calculates truss
   deformations, and adjusts all build positions simultaneously. A
   prototype has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the
   approach. The results are cartographically pleasing; in particular,
   spatial relationships between buildings are preserved.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{195}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{140-147}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study, we described the spontaneous recovery of
   respiratory motor function in adult rats subjected to a left C2
   hemisection 6-16 weeks post-injury without any therapeutic intervention.
   We extend the previous findings by demonstrating in the present study
   that rats subjected to a left C2 hemisection with bilateral carotid body
   excision will also recover respiratory-related activity in the paralyzed
   ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. However, in this instance, recovery is
   significantly accelerated; i.e., it is evident as early as 2 weeks after
   spinal cord injury.
   Two experimental groups (and noninjured and sham-operated controls) of
   rats were employed in the study. H-CBE animals were subjected to a left
   C2 hemisection plus bilateral carotid body excision while H-CBI animals
   were subjected to a left C2 hemisection only. Carotid body excision was
   confirmed by the sodium cyanide test. The animals were allowed to
   survive for 2 weeks after hemisection. Thereafter, electrophysiologic
   assessment of respiratory activity was conducted in all animals.
   Spontaneous recovery of respiratory-related activity in the paralyzed
   hemidiaphragm (indicated by left phrenic nerve activity) was detected in
   all H-CBE animals while H-CBI animals did not express spontaneous
   recovery of diaphragmatic activity. The magnitude of recovered activity
   when expressed as a function of contralateral phrenic nerve activity was
   48.8 +/- 3.8\%. When expressed as a function of the homolateral phrenic
   nerve in noninjured animals, the magnitude amounted to 25.6 +/- 2.8\%.
   Although the mechanisms responsible for the apparent early onset of
   spontaneous recovery are unknown, it is likely that a reorganization of
   the respiratory circuitry in the CNS may be involved. The significance
   of the findings is that it may be feasible to modulate the onset of
   functional recovery following cervical spinal cord injury by
   specifically targeting peripheral chemoreceptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Specific features of excitation and propagation of transverse and
   longitudinal subsurface waves in solids are determined. Dependences of
   the parameters of the acoustic field generated in a solid body on the
   acoustic properties of a probe's wedge and of the tested body are found
   experimentally and compared to theoretical results. Using the amplitude
   and the directivity characteristic of the principal transverse mode and
   of accompanying secondary modes (longitudinal and Raleigh), the optimum
   solutions for identifying subsurface flaws characterized by low
   reflectivity are determined. Studies of the passage of an acoustic
   signal through a magnetic-fluid acoustic guide and analysis of the
   magnetic-fluid's acoustic properties enable conclusions to be drawn
   regarding expediency of the usage of such media for excitation
   (detection) of longitudinal and transverse subsurface waves in materials
   with low velocity of sound (plastic, etc.)}},

Abstract = {{Defining the mechanism of infection with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) or
   Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an important clinical
   issue. HHV-8 has been linked to Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) development in
   HIV-1-infected individuals, and KS develops in 40\% of those infected
   with both viruses. A series of epidemiological data suggest that sexual
   transmission is one of the routes of transmission for HHV-8. In our
   studies, we sought to assess the cellular reservoirs of HHV-8 DNA in the
   semen of HIV-1-infected men and the potential role of HHV-8 infected
   spermatozoa in horizontal transmission.
   A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ PCR (ISPCR) and a
   sodium iodide (NaI) DNA isolation technique that extracts both nuclear
   and episomal DNA were utilized to amplify specific genes in vitro and
   within intact cells to evaluate the types of seminal cells infected with
   HHV-8 in HIV-1-infected and uninfected men.
   HHV-8 was present in the spermatozoa and mononuclear cells of the semen
   in 64 of 73 (88\%) HIV-1 infected individuals. Both the sperms as well
   as the mononuclear cells of the semen specimens of HIV-1 infected men
   were found to be infected with HHV-8. Multiplex ISPCR revealed that a
   significantly higher percentage of semen cells were infected with HHV-8
   than HIV-1 (p > 0.001). Rare (less than one in a 100,000) sperm cells
   were co-infected with both viruses. A co-culture of HHV-8 infected sperm
   with uninfected 293 or Sup-T1 cell lines resulted in an abortive
   infection of these cells with HHV-8. DNA isolation by NaI yielded 73\%
   of the positive sperm, whereas the standard phenol/chloroform method
   resulted in significantly lower positives (45\%) from the same
   specimens.
   Design and methods: Our data strongly suggest a potential
   sexual/horizontal route of transmission of HHV-8, via the HHV-8 infected
   sperm and other semen cells, where a large percentage of HIV-1 infected
   men's sperm and other semen cells are infected with HHV-8. Co-culture
   studies have further supported the observations that HHV-8 in the sperm
   cells is infectious and capable of transmission of the virus to
   uninfected cells.}},

Abstract = {{1 The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a major site of opioid
   analgesic action, and a significant site of cellular adaptations to
   chronic morphine treatment (CMT). We examined m-opioid receptor ( MOP)
   regulation of voltage-gated calcium channel currents (I-Ca) and
   G-protein-activated K channel currents (GIRK) in PAG neurons from CMT
   mice.
   2 Mice were injected s.c. with 300 mg kg(-1) of morphine base in a slow
   release emulsion three times over 5 days, or with emulsion alone
   (vehicles). This protocol produced significant tolerance to the
   antinociceptive effects of morphine in a test of thermal nociception.
   3 Voltage clamp recordings were made of I-Ca in acutely isolated PAG
   neurons and GIRK in PAG slices. The MOP agonist DAMGO
   (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N-Me-Phe-Gly-ol enkephalin) inhibited I-Ca in neurons
   from CMT mice (230 nM) with a similar potency to vehicle (150 nM), but
   with a reduced maximal effectiveness (37\% inhibition in vehicle
   neurons, 27\% in CMT neurons). Inhibition of ICa by the GABA(B) agonist
   baclofen was not altered by CMT.
   4 Met-enkephalin-activated GIRK currents recorded in PAG slices were
   significantly smaller in neurons from CMT mice than vehicles, while GIRK
   currents activated by baclofen were unaltered.
   5 These data demonstrate that CMT-induced antinociceptive tolerance is
   accompanied by homologous reduction in the effectiveness of MOP agonists
   to inhibit I-Ca and activate GIRK. Thus, a reduction in MOP number
   and/or functional coupling to G proteins accompanies the characteristic
   cellular adaptations to CMT previously described in PAG neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Physical activity might reduce the risk for lung cancer by various
   mechanisms, but the evidence is, inconclusive. We therefore examined the
   relationship between physical activity and risk for lung cancer in a
   large population-based Danish cohort with detailed information about
   number of hours per week spent on specific physical activities as well
   as lifetime smoking patterns. Between 1993 and 1997, a total of 57,053
   persons aged 50-64 years, agreed to participate in the cohort. After
   exclusions of persons with cancer diagnosis before invitation and
   persons for whom data regarding study variables were missing, 26,070 men
   and 28,352 women remained for study. By 31 December 2002, lung cancer
   had been diagnosed in 194 men and 175 women. A questionnaire registered
   average number of hours per week spent on each of 6 types of leisure
   time physical activity. Level of occupational physical activity was
   registered in 5 categories. Cox's proportional hazard model stratified
   according to age at entry (1-year intervals) was adjusted for smoking,
   school education, possible occupational exposure to lung carcinogens and
   intake of fruit and vegetables. No significant association was found
   between number of hours per week spent on 6 types of physical activity
   during leisure time and the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for lung cancer.
   For each type of activity, the IRR of lung cancer was lower for active
   compared to nonactive women, whereas for men lower IRRs were only
   observed for sports and gardening. Higher levels of occupational
   physical activity had no protective effect; the lowest IRR was found for
   sitting work. Our study shows no convincing protective effect of
   physical activity on lung cancer risk. (C) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{95-115}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{We have used Yohkoh and GOES X-ray observations to investigate flares
   with a long rising phase. We have found that a characteristic feature Of
   Such flares is a long time interval, Delta t >= 20 min, between the
   temperature maximum and the maximum of the emission measure. We have
   carried out detailed analysis for 10 limb flares of this type. Time
   variation of the heating function, E-H(t), has been determined for their
   loop-top X-ray kernels. The time variation of E-H(t), together with the
   temperature-density diagnostic diagrams, have been used to explain the
   large value of the time interval, Delta t. The main point is that for
   these flares the heating function E-H(t) decreases so slowly after the
   temperature maximum, that for the long time, Delta t, the energy flux
   reaching flare foot points is sufficient to maintain significant
   chromospheric evaporation. Investigation of the flare evolution in the
   temperature-density diagnostic diagrams allowed us to work out a new
   method of determination of the density for flare kernels. This method
   can be applied to all the kernels for which their altitudes can be
   estimated. The advantage of this method is that for the density
   determination it is not necessary to assume what is the extension of the
   emitting plasma along the line of sight.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a new biologically motivated algorithm for representing
   natural images using successive projections into complementary
   subspaces. An image is first projected into an edge subspace spanned
   using an ICA basis adapted to natural images which captures the sharp
   features of an image like edges and curves. The residual image obtained
   after extraction of the sharp image features is approximated using a
   mixture of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA) model.
   The model is consistent with cellular, functional, information
   theoretic, and learning paradigms in visual pathway modeling. We
   demonstrate the efficiency of our model for representing different
   attributes of natural images like color and luminance. We compare the
   performance of our model in terms of quality of representation against
   commonly used basis, like the discrete cosine transform (DCT),
   independent component analysis ( ICA), and principal components analysis
   (PCA), based on their entropies. Chrominance and luminance components of
   images are represented using codes having lower entropy than DCT, ICA,
   or PCA for similar visual quality. The model attains considerable
   simplification for learning from images by using a sparse independent
   code for representing edges and explicitly evaluating probabilities in
   the residual subspace.}},

   four-tap decision feedback equalization to compensate for the losses in
   the channel at 6.4 Gbps. The transceiver core is built in LSI's 0.13-mu

Abstract = {{From June 1998 to May 1999, the water temperature, salinity and
   turbidity, together with the macrofaunal (nekton and hyperbenthos)
   abundance, biomass and number of species, were estimated in the
   Guadalquivir estauary at five sampling stations (8, 20, 30, 40 and 50 km
   from the river mouth). Samples were taken from an anchored boat by using
   nets with a 1-mm mesh. There was a horizontal salinity gradient along
   the estuary: monthly mean salinities ranged from 17 to 27 at the
   outermost sampling station, whilst salinity was rarely higher than 4 in
   the inner estuary. Water temperature was homogenous throughout the
   estuary, with maximum values in summer (28 degrees C) and minimum values
   in winter (10 degrees C). Turbidity was also relatively homogenous
   throughout the estuary, with a maximum in winter (362 NTU) and a minimum
   in summer (10 NTU). Maximum turbidity occurred in the zone where
   seawater and freshwater merge. Results of stepwise multiple regression
   analysis indicated that both the distance to the river mouth and the
   freshwater input (in the previous month) from the Alcala del Rio dam
   (110 km from the river mouth) explained 70\% of the variance in
   salinity, but that the freshwater input only explained 17\% of the
   variance in water temperature and turbidity. Salinity explained 50\% of
   the variance in the number of species, whereas salinity and temperature
   were the environmental variables that controlled the macrofaunal
   abundance and biomass. Salinity and temperature together explained 75\%
   and 71\% of the variance for nekton abundance and biomass, respectively,
   and 54\% and 48\% of the variance for the abundance and biomass of
   hyperbenthos, respectively. Salinity was, in all eases, the individual
   variable that explained the highest portion of variance.}},

Abstract = {{Gao et al. (PNAS, 100, 5597-5600 (2003)) have argued that load-bearing
   mineralized hard tissues. including bones, shells, and teeth, are
   nanocomposites, in which the mineral phase has nanoscale dimensions that
   ensure optimum strength and flaw tolerance. In particular, it has been
   claimed that the thickness of these brittle building blocks, being
   smaller than a critical size, h{*}, of the order of tens of nanometers,
   renders them insensitive to the presence of crack-like flaws and enables
   them to achieve near-theoretical strength, which is why Nature employs
   nanoscale features in mineralized biological composites. We find this
   point of view, which Gao et al. and others have quoted in subsequent
   publications and presentations, unpersuasive and present several
   counterexamples which show that biological structures, as a result of
   being comprised of relatively fragile constituents that fracture at
   stress levels several orders of magnitude smaller than the theoretical
   strength, adopt various strategies to develop mechanical responses that
   enable them to mitigate catastrophic failure. Nanoscale structural
   features are not a result of an innate resistance to very high stresses.}},

Abstract = {{One frequently described feature of depression is an increased
   vulnerability to pain complaints, and chronic pain is frequently
   accompanied by symptoms of depression. In contrast to this, a decreased
   sensitivity to experimental pain has been described in major depression.
   The physiological basis of this phenomenon is yet elusive. We
   investigated 30 patients suffering from a major depressive disorder and
   matched controls. Pain testing (threshold and tolerance) was performed
   on both sides of the body and included assessment of thermal, electrical
   and ischemic pain. While confirming hypoalgesia to heat and electrical
   pain in comparison to controls, we found hyperalgesia to ischemic muscle
   pain. Furthermore, thermal pain tolerance and electrical pain tolerance
   were significantly increased on the right hand side confirming previous
   results of a lateralized perception of pain in depression. Our main
   finding suggests that painful stimuli are processed differentially
   depending on the localization of pain induction in depression. This
   knowledge may enable us to understand and ultimately treat pain
   complaints more appropriately in depressed patients. (c) 2005

   heterostructure after 20-keV phosphorus ion implantation followed by

   disordering. These features are attributed to the nature of the damage

Abstract = {{We give general expressions for the vector asymmetry in the angular
   distribution of protons in the nonmesonic weak decay of polarized
   hypernuclei. From these we derive an explicit expression for the
   calculation of the asymmetry parameter, a(Lambda), which is applicable
   to the specific cases of He-5(Lambda) and C-12(Lambda) described within
   the extreme shell model. In contrast to the approximate formula widely
   used in the literature, it includes the effects of three-body kinematics
   in the final states of the decay and correctly treats the contribution
   of transitions originating from single-proton states beyond the s-shell.
   This expression is then used for the corresponding numerical computation
   of a(Lambda) within several one-meson-exchange models. Besides the
   strictly local approximation usually adopted for the transition
   potential, we also consider the addition of the first-order nonlocality
   terms. We find values for a(Lambda) ranging from -0.62 to -0.24, in
   qualitative agreement with other theoretical estimates but in

Abstract = {{IMAZAQUIN SORPTION AND DESORPTION IN SOILS WITH DIFFERENT MINERALOGICAL,
   PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the sorption and desorption of
   imazaquin in soils with different granulometric, chemical and
   mineralogical characteristics. Isotherms and kinetics studies were
   carried out to quantify the hysteresis between sorption and desorption
   processes. The soils were classified as Rhodic Hapludox (LVdf), Typic
   Hapludox (LVA) and Typic Quartzipsamment (RQ). The soils were air-dried
   and passed through a 2 mm mesh sieve, and the chemical, physical and
   mineralogical properties characterized. The radiolabeled molecule (C-14)
   was imazaquin, an herbicide of the imidazolinone group. Radioactivity
   was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The trials were
   carried out under controlled temperature conditions (25 +/- 2 degrees
   C). Five imazaquin concentrations were used (0.67; 1.34, 2.68, 5.36, and
   10.72 mu mol L-1) for the sorption isotherms. The experimental data were
   fitted to the Freundlich equation so that sorption parameters were
   obtained. Subsequently, four extractions were performed with a 0.005 mol
   L-1CaCl2 solution in order to determine desorption parameters in a
   similar way for sorption. For sorption kinetics, the sorbed imazaquin
   amount (2.99 mu mol L-1) was determined after different time intervals
   (0; 0.5, 1; 3; 6; 12; 24, and 48 h after imazaquin application), and the
   results adjusted to the Elovich equation. Imazaquin generally presented
   low sorption to the three soils, with higher sorption coefficients in
   the soils with higher clay and organic carbon content. The desorption
   coefficients were higher than those of sorption, evidencing the
   occurrence of hysteresis. Sorption kinetics showed that imazaquin is
   sorbed in two phases - a rapid one that presented the largest sorbed
   fraction, and another slower one. The application of Fick's Law to the
   kinetic data showed that diffusion mechanisms might be involved in this
   process.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{939-955}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the film casting process has been simulated using a new
   model developed recently using the framework of multiple natural
   configurations to study crystallization in polymers (see Rao and
   Rajagopal Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 53 (2002) 265-, Polym. Eng. Sci. 44(1)
   (2004) 123; Simulation of the film blowing process for semicrystalline
   polymers, in press, 2004). In the film casting process, the material
   starts out as a viscoelastic melt and undergoes deformation and cooling,
   resulting in a semi-crystalline solid. In order to model the complex
   changes taking place in the material and predict the behavior of the
   final solid it is important to use models that are capable of describing
   these changes. The model used here has been formulated within a general
   thermodynamic framework that is capable of describing dissipative
   processes. In addition it handles in a direct manner the change of
   symmetry in the material; it thus provides a good basis for studying the
   crystallization process in polymers. The polymer melt is modeled as a
   rate type viscoelastic fluid and the crystalline solid polymer is
   modeled as an anisotropic elastic solid. The initiation criterion,
   marking the onset of crystallization and equations governing the
   crystallization kinetics arise naturally in this setting in terms of the
   appropriate thermodynamic functions. The mixture region, wherein the
   material transitions from a melt to a semi-crystalline solid, is modeled
   as a mixture of a viscoelastic fluid and an elastic solid. This is in
   marked contrast to earlier approaches where in the simulation has been
   done assuming that the material was a viscous fluid and the transition
   to a solid like behavior is achieved by increasing the viscosity to a
   large value resulting in a highly viscous fluid and not an elastic
   solid. The results of our simulations compare well against experimental
   data available in literature. In addition to these quantitative
   comparisons have carried out parametric study to study the influence of
   the different parameters on the film casting process. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Injury and pain experienced by the infant results in immediate changes
   in pain sensitivity that last into adulthood. These long-term changes
   are likely initiated by altered gene expression. Here we measured how
   injury alters gene expression in the lumbar spinal cord early and late
   in the preweaning period of the rat. The expression of large numbers of
   genes was altered significantly at 3 days of age, when injury has
   long-term consequences. The functional classes of altered genes included
   transcription factors, cell death related and metal ion genes. The
   intensity of the stimulus in the 3-day-old pups induced changes in
   different classes of genes. Fewer changes were noted at 21 days of age.
   The increased expression of transcription factors and decreased
   expression of genes whose products are protective against cell death are
   hypothesized to underlie the long-term changes that are seen after
   injury in the neonate. (c) 2005 International Association for the Study

Abstract = {{We report here the molecular cloning of new members of the penaeidin
   family from two Atlantic penaeids from Brazil, Litopenaeus schmitti and
   Farfantepenaeus paulensis. The presence of penaeidins in the granular
   hemocytes of both shrimps was first evidenced by immunofluorescence,
   using polyclonal antibodies raised against L. vannamei penaeidin Litvan
   PEN3-1. cDNAs from the hemocytes of both Brazilian species were obtained
   by reverse transcription and the sequences encoding penaeidins were
   amplified by PCR, using primers based on penaeidin consensus sequences.
   Five penaeidin clones were obtained. According to the international
   penaeidin classification (PenBase, http://www.penbase.immunaqua.com),
   the deduced amino acid sequences of two clones from L. schmitti and two
   from F. paulensis belong to the PEN2 subgroup and one clone from L.
   schmitti to the PEN4 subgroup of penaeidins. Surprisingly, no penacidin
   from the PEN3 subgroup was obtained in both shrimp species, even though
   this subgroup appears to be the most commonly expressed in the hemocytes
   of penaeids. (c) 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Abstract = {{The adaptive immune response is tightly regulated to limit responding
   cells in an Ag-specific manner. On B cells, coreceptors CD21/CD19
   modulate the strength of BCR signals, potentially influencing cell fate.
   The importance of the CD95 pathway was examined in response of B cells
   to moderate affinity Ag using an adoptive transfer model of
   lysozyme-specific Ig transgenic (HEL immunoglobulin transgene (MD4)
   strain) B cells. Although adoptively transferred Cr2(+/+) MD4 B cells
   are activated and persist within splenic follicles of duck egg
   lysozyme-immunized mice, Cr2(-/-) MD4 B cells do not. In contrast,
   Cr2(-/-) MD4 lpr B cells persist after transfer, suggesting that lack of
   CD21/CD35 signaling results in CD95-mediated elimination. Cr2 deficiency
   did not affect CD95 levels, but cellular FLIP (c-FLIP) protein and mRNA
   levels were reduced 2-fold compared with levels in Cr2(+/+) MD4 B cells.
   In vitro culture with Cr2(+/+) MD4 B cells demonstrated that equimolar
   amounts of rHEL-C3d(3) were more effective than hen egg lysozyme alone
   in up-regulating c-FLIP levels and for protection against CD95-mediated
   apoptosis. Collectively, this study implies a mechanism for regulating B
   cell survival in vivo whereby the strength of BCR signaling (including
   coreceptor) determines c-FLIP levels and protection from CD95-induced
   death.}},

Abstract = {{The present study quantified dietary fatty acid flux in healthy men (n =
   6) who were fed a liquid formula through a duodenal feeding tube
   (continuous feeding group) or who consumed the same formula in meals
   (meal feeding group). A triacylglycerol (TAG) stable isotope was added
   to the formula to determine the entry of dietary fatty acids into the
   serum and its clearance to the liver and resecretion into serum via
   VLDL. The contribution of dietary fatty acids to serum nonesterified
   fatty acids (NEFAs) was higher with meal feeding (24.4 +/- 2.6\%)
   compared with continuous feeding (10.8 +/- 2.9\%, P < 0.01) and, when
   multiplied by the NEFA concentration, resulted in similar absolute fatty
   acid spillover. Diet-derived NEFAs subsequently represented 10.6 +/-
   1.2\% and 4.7. +/- 1.3\% of hepatic VLDL-TAG (meal feeding vs.
   continuous feeding, respectively, P = 0.004). Chylomicron remnant uptake
   by the liver contributed 9.3 +/- 1.9\% of fatty acids to hepatic
   VLDL-TAG synthesis with meal feeding compared with continuous feeding
   (4.4 +/- 0.8\%, P < 0.03). These data suggest that the extent of dietary
   fatty acid recycling via serum NEFAs and VLDL.-TAG is determined by the
   rate of delivery of dietary fat toy the intestine. The inefficient
   removal of dietary fat from the circulation may maintain VLDL-TAG
   production but may also result in prolonged postprandial lipemia.}},

Abstract = {{The constants of binding of five peptide analogs to the active site of
   the HIV-1 aspartic-protease are calculated based on a novel sampling
   scheme that is efficient and does not introduce any approximations in
   addition to the energy function used to describe the system. The results
   agree with experiments, The squared correlation coefficient of the
   calculated vs. the measured values is 0.79. The sampling scheme consists
   of a series of molecular dynamics integrations with biases. The biases
   are selected based on an estimate of the probability density function of
   the system in a way to explore the conformational space and to reduce
   the statistical error in the Calculated binding constants, The molecular
   dynamics integrations are done with a vacuum potential using a short
   cutoff scheme. To estimate the probability density of the simulated
   system, the results of the molecular dynamics integrations are combined
   using an extension of the weighted histogram analysis method (C.
   Bartels, Chem. Phys. Letters 331 (20(X)) 446-454). The probability
   density of the solvated ligand-protein system is obtained by applying a
   correction for the use of the short cutoffs in the simulations and by
   taking into account solvation with an electrostatic term and a
   hydrophobic term. The electrostatic part of the solvation is determined
   by finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann calculations the hydrophobic part
   of the solvation is set proportional to the solvent accessible surface
   area. Setting the hydrophobic surface tension parameter equal to 8
   mol(-1) K-1 A(-2), absolute binding constants are in the mu M to nM
   range, This is in agreement with experiments. The standard errors
   determined from eight repeated binding constant determinations are a
   factor of 14 to 411. A single determination of a binding constant is
   done with 499700 steps of molecular dynamics integration and 4500 finite
   difference Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. The simulations can be
   analyzed with respect to conformational changes of the active site of
   the HIV-1 protease or the ligands upon binding and provide information
   that complements experiments and can be used in the drug development
   process. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Four-part fracture of the proximal humerus is often an indication for
   hemiarthroplasty. Anatomic healing of the tuberosities is required to
   recover full range of motion. The authors describe their philosophy of
   postoperative care, which is different from the conventional wisdom. The
   patient is immobilized in a sling for 6 weeks until healing of the
   tuberosities is strong enough that motion of the shoulder will not cause
   the fracture fragments to displace. By prioritizing bone healing as more
   important than early motion, there is a possibility that arthrofibrosis
   may develop. However, arthroscopic release and lysis of adhesions
   provides a safe and reliable means to regain motion after the bone has
   healed. Because anatomic healing of the tuberosities is so critical to
   function after these fractures, we see no reason to jeopardize bone
   healing with ill-advised early motion because motion can virtually
   always be restored by means of a secondary capsular release.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a new sliding mode control algorithm for the third-order
   non-linear, time-varying, uncertain system subject to unknown
   disturbance is proposed. Since the conventional input constraints
   expressed by inequalities are often impractical, in this paper the
   situation is considered where the input signal is subject to elastic
   constraint. It is assumed that the threshold value of the system input
   signal is known and exceeding this value is undesirable but possible if
   justified by essential improvement of the system performance. The
   proposed algorithm employs a time-varying switching plane. At the
   initial time the plane passes through the point determined by the system
   initial conditions in the error state space and afterwards moves with a
   constant velocity to the origin of the space. The plane is designed in
   such a way that fast error convergence is achieved using limited control
   input. By this means, the reaching phase is eliminated, insensitivity of
   the system to external disturbance is ensured from the very beginning of
   the control action, and fast, monotonic error convergence to zero is
   achieved. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional input
   constraint expressed by an inequality is a limit case of the elastic
   constraint considered in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for
   Acinetobacter baumannii was developed and evaluated by using 40 clinical
   A. baumannii isolates recovered from outbreaks in Spanish and German
   hospitals during the years 1990 to 2001, as well as isolates from other
   European hospitals and two DSMZ reference strains of A. baumannii. For
   comparison, two isolates of Acinetobacter species 13 (sensu Tjernberg
   and Ursing), two clinical isolates, and three DSMZ strains of A.
   calcoaceticus (both belonging to the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii
   complex) were also investigated. Primers were designed for conserved
   regions of housekeeping genes, and 305- to 513-bp internal fragments of
   seven such genes-gltA, gyrB, gdhB, recA, cpn60, gpi, and rpoD-were
   sequenced for all strains. The number of alleles at individual loci
   ranged from 6 to 12, and a total of 20 allelic profiles or sequence
   types were distinguished among the investigated A. baumannii strains.
   The MLST data were in high concordance with the epidemiologic typing
   results generated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and amplified
   fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting. The MLST scheme provides a
   high level of resolution and an excellent tool for studying the
   population structure and long-term epidemiology of A. baumannii.}},

Abstract = {{Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is a rare systemic disease
   characterized by papulonodular skin lesions, gingivalhyperplasia, joint
   contractures, and osteolytic lesions on long bones and the skull. It has
   recently been reported that the disease is caused by mutations in the
   gene encoding capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG-2). To date, fewer
   than 60 cases have been published in the literature. Partial disease
   expression is common, but no cases featuring a solitary calvarial lesion
   have been reported.
   The authors discuss this 4-year-old boy with a solitary calvarial
   osteolytic lesion whose histopathological examination exhibited findings
   characteristic of JHF. Mutational analysis, however, revealed that there
   were no mutations in the CMG-2 gene. Two years after surgery, he was
   free of any complaints as well as gingival hyperplasia, joint
   contractures, and new skull or skin lesions. This patient's condition
   may represent clinical or genetic heterogeneity associated with JHF.
   Whether solitary lesions mimicking JHF can arise from somatic mutation
   of the CMG-2 gene remains to be proven.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the spontaneous, proton- and Al-III-catalysed hydrolyses
   of the C1-O4' bond in 1.5-anhydrocellobiito] have been measured at
   elevated temperatures (125.0-220.0 degrees C). Data for the first two
   processes extrapolate to the expression k = (8.6 +/- 2.1 X 10(-16)) +
   (1.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(-9-pH)) s(-1) at 25 degrees C. These room-temperature
   figures were used to model Cellulose depolymerization by the af Ekenstam
   equation. The spontaneous process is too slow to contribute to loss of
   paper strength on aging, and even the acid-catalysed process is
   significant only below similar to pH 4.0. However, the spontaneous
   hydrolysis readily accounts for the reduction of cellulose degree of
   polymerization (DP) during alkaline (e.g., kraft) pulping of cellulose
   fibres. Efficient electrophilic catalysis by Al-III was observed at
   150.0 degrees C in 0.1 mol/L succinate buffers of room temperature pH
   3.05 and 3.35 (k(2) = 8.1 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) and 4.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3)
   (mol/L)(-1) s(-1), respectively). The apparent activation energy of the
   Al-III-catalysed process was 31 +/- 4 kJ mol(-1), lower than that of the
   proton-catalysed path, suggesting the electrophilic catalysis increases
   in importance as the temperature approaches ambient. Consequently, it
   appears that the culprit in the impermanence of ``rosin-alum{''}-sized
   paper is Al-III. directly acting as a Lewis acid, not the Al-III
   hydration sphere as a Br phi nsted acid. Conservation measures should
   either address this or be generic (e.g., low-temperature storage).}},

Abstract = {{A method to estimate the lattice energies E-latt of nitrate salts is put
   forward. First, E-latt is approximated by its electrostatic component
   E-elec. Then, E-elec is correlated with Mulliken atomic charges
   calculated on the species that make up the crystal, using a simple
   equation involving two empirical parameters. The latter are fitted
   against point charge estimates of E-elec computed on available X-ray
   structures of nitrate crystals. The correlation thus obtained yields
   lattice energies within 0.5 kJ/g from point charge values. A further
   assessment of the method against experimental data suggests that the
   main source of error arises from the point charge approximation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper defines user adaptation as the cognitive and behavioral
   efforts performed by users to cope with significant information
   technology events that occur in their work environment. Drawing on
   coping theory, we posit that users choose different adaptation
   strategies based on a combination of primary appraisal (i.e., a user's
   assessment of the expected consequences of an IT event) and secondary
   appraisal (i.e., a user's assessment of his/her control over the
   situation). On that basis, we identify four adaptation strategies
   (benefits maximizing, benefits satisficing, disturbance handling, and
   self-preservation) which are hypothesized to result in three different
   individual-level outcomes: restoring emotional stability, minimizing the
   perceived threats of the technology, and improving user effectiveness
   and efficiency. A study of the adaptation behaviors of six account
   managers in two large North American banks provides preliminary support
   for our model. By explaining adaptation patterns based an users' initial
   appraisal and subsequent responses to an IT event, our model offers
   predictive power while retaining an agency view of user adaptation.
   Also, by focusing on user cognitive and behavioral adaptation responses
   related to the technology, the work system, and the self, our model
   accounts for a wide range of user behaviors such as technology
   appropriation, avoidance, and resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol abuse markedly increases the risk of sepsis-mediated acute lung
   injury. In a rat model, ethanol ingestion alone ( in the absence of any
   other stress) causes pulmonary glutathione depletion, increased
   expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-beta 1), and
   alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction, even though the lung appears
   grossly normal. However, during endotoxemia, ethanol-fed rats release
   more activated TGF-beta 1 into the alveolar space where it can
   exacerbate epithelial barrier dysfunction and lung edema. Ethanol
   ingestion activates the reninangiotensin system, and angiotensin II is
   capable of inducing oxidative stress and TGF-beta 1 expression. We
   determined that lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
   that decreases angiotensin II formation, limited lung glutathione
   depletion, and treatment with either lisinopril or losartan, a selective
   angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, normalized TGF-beta 1
   expression. The glutathione precursor procysteine also prevented
   TGF-beta 1 expression, suggesting that TGF-beta 1 may be induced
   indirectly by angiotensin II-mediated oxidative stress and glutathione
   depletion. Importantly, lisinopril treatment normalized barrier function
   in alveolar epithelial cell monolayers from ethanol-fed rats, and
   treatment with either lisinopril or losartan normalized alveolar
   epithelial barrier function in ethanol-fed rats in vivo, as reflected by
   lung liquid clearance of an intratracheal saline challenge, even during
   endotoxemia. In parallel, lisinopril treatment limited TGF-beta 1
   protein release into the alveolar space during endotoxemia. Together,
   these results suggest that angiotensin II mediates oxidative stress and
   the consequent TGF-beta 1 expression and alveolar epithelial barrier
   dysfunction that characterize the alcoholic lung.}},

Abstract = {{A population genetics study of the mosquito Ochlerotatus triseriatus was
   performed on 36 collections from adjoining regions of Iowa, Minnesota,
   and Wisconsin covering approximately 120 km(2). Single nucleotide
   polymorphism analysis was used to estimate variation in the
   mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) gene. The heated
   oligonucleotide ligation assay was used to identify the ND4 haplotype of
   each mosquito. No evidence of genetic isolation by distance was found,
   nor did Interstate 90 or the Mississippi River serve as barriers to gene
   flow. The effective migration rate varied from 18 to 45 reproductive
   migrants/generation, which is similar to estimates from an earlier
   study. The collections belong to a single, large, panmictic population.
   However, within this panmictic population, local genetic drift arises,
   possibly due to one or a few females ovipositing in larval breeding
   containers. From generation to generation, there is sufficient gene flow
   to mix families arising from individual breeding sites and eliminate
   founder effects due to drift.}},

Title = {{Providing end-of-life care to patients: Critical care nurses' perceived

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{395-403}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Critical care nurses care for dying patients daily. The
   process of dying in an intensive care unit is complicated, and research
   on specific obstacles that impede delivery of end-of-life care andlor
   supportive behaviors that help in delivery of end-of-life care is
   limited.
   OBJECTIVE To measure critical care nurses' perceptions of the intensity
   and frequency of occurrence of (1) obstacles to providing end-of-life
   care and (2) supportive behaviors that help in providing end-of-life
   care in the intensive care unit.
   METHODs An experimental, posttest-only, control-group design was used. A
   national, geographically dispersed, random sample of members of the
   American Association of Critical-Care Nurses was surveyed.
   RESULTS The response rate was 61.3\%, 864 usable responses from 1409
   eligible respondents. The highest scoring obstacles were frequent
   telephone calls from patients family members for information, patients
   families who did not understand the term lifesaving measures, and
   physicians disagreeing about the direction of a dying patient care. The
   highest scoring supportive behaviors were allowing patients family
   members adequate time alone with patients after death, providing
   peaceful and dignified bedside scenes after death, and teaching patients
   families how to act around a dying patient.
   CONCLUSIONS The biggest obstacles to appropriate end-of-life care in the
   intensive care unit are behaviors of'patients families that remove
   nurses from caring for patients, behaviors that prolong patients'
   suffering or cause patients pain, and physicians' disagreement about the
   plan of care.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the influence of depth and duration of

   {[}repetitive cycles of I min, 40 s with inspired oxygen fraction
   (Fi(O2)), 5 or 10\%, followed by 20-s normoxial, during 30 min or 4 h.
   Another group was exposed to 4 h of continuous hypoxia with 10\% Fi(O2),
   Twenty-four hours later, their hearts were isolated and subjected to a
   30-min no-flow global ischemia-120-min reperfusion sequence. For some
   hearts, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (a nonselective
   inhibitor of NOS) or 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD) (a selective
   mitochondrial K-ATP blocker) was infused before ischemia. Infarct size
   (in percentage of ventricles) was significantly reduced by prior IH for
   4 h (10\% Fi(O2)) (21.8 +/- 3.1 vs. 33.5 +/- 2.5\% in sham group). This
   effect was abolished by L-NAME or 5-HD. Infarct size was not different
   in groups subjected to either 30 min of IH or to continuous hypoxia
   compared with sham group. In contrast, IH for 4 h (5\% Fi(O2))
   significantly increased infarct size (45.1 +/- 3.6 vs. 33.5 +/- 2.5\% in
   sham group). Acute IH for 4 h with a minimal Fi(O2) of 10\% induced a
   delayed preconditioning against myocardial infarction in the rat, which
   was abolished by NOS inhibition and mitochondrial K-ATP channel
   blockade. Depth, duration, and intermittence of hypoxia appeared to be
   critical for cardioprotection to occur.}},

Abstract = {{We present in this paper a discrete temporal approach leading us to
   model the propagation of a signal ultra high frequency in a laminated
   medium. This stage will lead to a digital model calculating, starting
   from the equations of the lines of transmission whose parameters are
   adapted according to the propagation medium, the temporal shape of the
   reflected signal such as it is recorded by a reflectometer. A
   time-frequency analysis of the reflected signal allows, by varying the
   value of a threshold on the scallogramme of the signal, to detect a
   lossy thin zone which do not appear in the first results. the value of
   the threshold depends on the degree of attenuation of this zone.}},

   surgical patients with massive bleeding despite surgical control.
   Fifteen trauma and general surgical patients underwent major operative
   procedures and developed coagulopathy requiring massive blood product
   transfusion. All patients had continued life-threatening hemorrhage
   despite surgical control of bleeding. The mean base deficit was 6 and
   arterial lactate was 9.0 mmol/L. An initial dose of rFVIIa was given
   intravenously, followed by a second dose if there was evidence of at
   least a partial response. Twelve of 15 patients who had been expected to
   die from hemorrhage survived for greater than 48 hours, and 7 survived
   to hospital discharge. A partial or complete hemostatic response to
   rFVIIa was noted in 12 of 15 patients. The number of blood products
   received after administration of rFVIIa was significantly reduced and
   the International Normalized Ratio (INR) decreased. Our experience
   demonstrates that rFVIIa may reduce or completely arrest coagulopathic
   bleeding in trauma and surgical patients after vascular control.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Although West African fisheries have been the subject of considerable
   study, little attention has paid to the role of gender in the
   development process and, more specifically, the work done by women in
   the overall management of fisheries. Lack of attention to the gender
   dimension of fisheries management can result in policy interventions
   missing their target of creating sustainable livelihoods at the
   community level. There is little doubt that fishing-dependent
   communities have a vital role to play in the overall development process
   of many coastal West African States, but without a complete
   understanding of the complexity of gender roles, the goal of sustainable
   livelihoods is unlikely to be achieved. In a bid to improve knowledge
   about gender roles in fishing communities, and to provide policy makers
   with some guidance as to where interventions might be most useful, a
   workshop was held in Cotonou, Benin (West Africa) in December 2003. This
   paper provides a brief introduction to the theory oil gender and
   fisheries development and then goes on to report the findings of the
   workshop. The most significant conclusion is that policy interventions
   which help strengthen institutional capacity in coastal artisanal
   communities would have the greatest over all impact. A move toward
   collecting gender and fisheries disaggregated data would also help
   expand existing knowledge about what are often marginal and isolated
   economic sectors. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The central nervous system contains the nuclei at the origin of
   autonomic and neuroendocrine pathways to the uterus. Although the
   anatomical basis of these pathways is known, the conditions of their
   recruitment and their interactions in the context of copulation remain
   to be explored. We tested the hypothesis that some central mechanisms
   could simultaneously recruit both pathways to the uterus. In this aim,
   we recorded intrauterine pressure changes in anesthetized female rats at
   the estrus stage after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of
   oxytocin (OT). Doses of 0.3-300 ng elicited increases of frequency and
   amplitude of uterine contractions. These effects were partly mimicked by
   the OT agonist {[}Thr(4),Gly(7)] OT but not by arginine vasopressin.
   They were blocked by the OT receptor antagonist atosiban delivered
   either ICV or intravenously. The latter suggests that ICV OT activated
   the systemic release of OT. The effects of OT were also blocked by
   hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocking agent, by atropine, a muscarinic
   receptor antagonist, and by N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an
   inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis. The results reveal that ICV OT
   recruits autonomic efferent pathways to the uterus. These results
   support our hypothesis that the activation of central nuclei can promote
   uterine contractility, and that OT may be a central coordinator of
   autonomic and neuroendocrine pathways. The hypothalamus, the source of
   direct OT-ergic projections to the pituitary, the brain stem, and the
   spinal cord, may be a target of central OT.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of persistent inflammation of the temporomandibular (TMJ)
   region on Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) evoked by acute noxious
   stimulation of the same or opposite TMJ was assessed in male and cycling
   female rats. Two weeks after inflammation of the TMJ by complete
   Freund's adjuvant (CFA, 25 mu g) the selective small fiber excitant,
   mustard oil (MO, 20\%), was injected into the arthritic or opposite TMJ
   under barbiturate anesthesia. MO stimulation of the arthritic TMJ
   increased Fos-LI ipsilateral, but not contralateral, to MO compared to
   naive subjects in superficial laminae at the trigeminal subnucleus
   caudalis/upper cervical cord (Vc/C-2) junction independent of sex
   hormone status. Unexpectedly, MO stimulation of the opposite TMJ in
   arthritic rats also produced a greater Fos-LI response ipsilateral to MO
   than naive animals. Fos-LI produced in the dorsal paratrigeminal region
   (dPa5) and Vc/C-2 junction after MO stimulation of the normal TMJ was
   significantly greater in proestrous than diestrous females or male
   monoarthritic rats. In contrast to naive animals, Fos-LI was produced in
   deep laminae at the Vc/C-2 junction ipsilateral to MO in CFA-treated
   animals independent of the site of prior CFA inflammation or sex hormone
   status. These results indicated that persistent monoarthritis of the TMJ
   region enhanced the excitability of trigeminal brainstem neurons to
   subsequent TMJ injury that occurred bilaterally in multiple regions of
   the lower trigeminal brainstem complex and depended on sex hormone
   status. (c) 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Abstract = {{Since its introduction in 1994, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
   (LRYGB) has rapidly gained popularity for the treatment of morbid
   obesity. Historically, the operation is performed in a retrocolic
   fashion; however antecolic LRYGB has been advocated as a safe
   alternative. We reviewed our experience with both techniques. From
   January 2003 to November 2004, the new UCLA Laparoscopic Bariatric
   Surgery Program performed 341 LRYGBs. In March 2004, our program
   transitioned from a retrocolic to an antecolic approach for all gastric
   bypass procedures. Institutional review board approval was obtained, and
   the data for all patients was collected into a prospective database. The
   patient characteristics for the two groups were similar. The significant
   differences between the two groups were average body mass index and the
   percentage of patients with diabetes and sleep apnea. The complication
   profiles for the two groups were also similar. There were significant
   differences between the two groups in the reoperation rate, antecolic
   2.0 per cent versus retrocolic 7.8 per cent, and length of stay,
   antecolic 2.57 versus retrocolic 2.89 days. There were no anastomotic
   leaks or deaths in either group. Antecolic LRYGB is safe and may be
   associated with fewer complications. Only long-term weight loss results
   and complication rates will provide a definitive answer.}},

   when going from MgB2 to AlB2 is consistent with the calculated larger
   E-cov energy of the Al-B bond compared to the Mg-B bond. We further
   explain this result by the filling of bonding states in the boron-p-Al-p
   bonds as revealed by the energy resolved covalent bond energy E-cov(E).}},

Abstract = {{Background The manifestations of otherothrombosis such as myocardial
   infarction, ischemic stroke, limb ischemia, or cardiovascular death pose
   a global health care burden. Additional therapies to decrease ischemic
   events in patients with established vascular disease or at risk for
   developing vascular disease are necessary. We sought to characterize the
   risk factors and treatments of a diverse contemporary population of
   patients with atherothrombosis.
   Methods The CHARISMA trial has enrolled 15603 patients from around the
   world. Patients with established coronary, cerebrovascular, or
   peripheral arterial disease, or those at high risk of developing
   atherothrombosis due to multiple risk factors, have been randomized to
   receive either the adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonist clopidogrel
   or placebo, in addition to background therapy with low- to moderate-dose
   aspirin.
   Results A high percentage of enrolled patients are being treated with
   statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In the CHARISMA
   population, a total of 75.6\% of the population had an abnormal body
   mass index: 42.2\% were overweight and 33.4\% were obese, with
   particularly high rates in the United States, especially of morbid
   obesity. Correspondingly, the prevalence of diabetes was 42\%.
   Conclusion The CHARISMA trial will further characterize atherothrombosis
   and provide insight into the role of dual antiplatelet therapy in
   improving outcomes in patients with multiple risk factors or established
   vascular disease. Of note, the rates of obesity and diabetes in patients
   with otherothrombosis throughout the world are particularly alarming.}},

Abstract = {{In utero hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (IUT) results in
   limited chimerism and tolerance to alloantigens. We studied the relative
   role of B7.1 and B7.2 expression by dendritic cells (DCs) in engraftment
   and in generating donor-specific tolerance in fetal mice. Mature
   dendritic cells (mDCs) from B7.1(-/-) or B7.2(-/-) donors and wild-type
   (WT) lineage-depleted (lin(-)) C57BL/6 (B6) bone marrow (BM) were
   injected into BALB/c fetuses. Six weeks after IUT, B7.1(-/-) recipients
   had multilineage engraftment (4.7\% +/- 0.8\% T cells and 5.7\% +/-
   1.1\% granulocytes) associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and
   decreased survival, but by 12 weeks only donor CD3(+) cells (2.1\% +/-
   1.3\%) were present. Recipients of B7.2(-/-) mDCs and lin- WT B6 BM had
   exclusively CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells (11.8\% +/- 8.5\% at 6 weeks and 6.5\%
   +/- 2.5\% at 12 weeks). Most of the cells were T-helper 2, although
   10.4\% +/- 1.4\% were of the T-regulatory (T-reg) phenotype, ie,
   CD4(+)CD25(+). Donor T-g cells were detected both in the thymus and
   spleen, thus suggesting an effect on both central and peripheral
   immunity. The animals with Treg cells had better survival (82.3\% versus
   47.4\%; P <.01) and no GVHD (0\% versus 65\%; P <.001). This group alone
   demonstrated multilineage engraftment of donor hematopoietic cells after
   postnatal transplantation with megadoses of donor lin- BM. Both the
   engrafted donor CD4(+)CD25(-) and CD4(+)CD25(+) cells induced comparable
   in vitro suppression of T-cell proliferation, thus suggesting their role
   in the persistence of the donor T cells in vivo. The CD4(+)CD25(-) cells
   produced interleukin 10 or interleukin 4 and were inhibited by
   anti-T-helper 2 cytokine-neutralizing antibodies, whereas the
   CD4(+)CD25(+) cells showed no evidence of any involvement of a
   cytokine-like soluble mediator and expressed cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
   antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and foxp3 constitutively. Donor mDCs and donor CD4 T
   cells were detected among the thymocytes of the recipients of B7.2(-/-)
   mDCs and lin- WT B6 BM. Thus, it seems that costimulatory molecule
   expression of donor DCs can play a significant immunomodulatory role in
   survival, GVHD, engraftment, and homing of allogeneic BM cells after IUT
   through the generation of Treg cells. (c) 2005 American Society for

Abstract = {{Alternative fuels exhibit different features respect to traditional
   fuels and require an experimental characterization in conditions similar
   to those of practical applications (high temperature, high heating rate,
   low residence time). In this work, a lab-scale drop tube reactor is
   characterized and an experimental procedure is developed to test a
   bituminous coal and a biomass fuel at high heating rate in oxidative
   conditions. Thermogravimetric, size and SEM analyses are used to
   determine the conversion degree, the reactivity and the morphological
   variations (swelling, fragmentation, agglomeration) of solid residues in
   different operating conditions.
   Furthermore, a model is developed in order to simulate the fluidynamics,
   the energy balance and the mass transfer during the partial oxidation of
   fuel particles. The application of this model allows the residence time
   and the thermal history of the particle inside the drop tube to be
   estimated. The experimental and model results are in agreement,
   considering both configurations, namely, constant diameter and density
   models. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the feasibility of MR colonography (MRC) with air using
   two-dimensional (2D)) T1-weighted fast spin-echo (T1wFSE) in patients
   scheduled for conventional colonoscopy (CC) after classic bowel
   preparation, and assess the ability of the technique to detect colonic
   lesions. The distention was sufficient for diagnosis, and the technique
   provided adequate delineation of the wall in the majority of segments.
   Residual fluid obscured the wall in different segments, especially in
   the ascending and descending colon (supine position) and in the cecum,
   transverse, and sigmoid colon (prone position). These findings were
   consistent with CT colonography. MRC visualized three lesions, missed
   one lesion >10 mm, visualized none of four lesions <5 mm, and yielded
   one false-positive lesion (5-10 mm). Missed lesions can be due to
   inconsistency in the slice positions between consecutive breath-holds,
   which is inherent to the multishot technique. Residual fluid may have
   obscured the smaller lesions. The shortcomings of the technique are
   limited coverage and signal drop-off at the borders of the field of view
   (FOV). Before multishot 2D TlwFSE colonography can become a valid
   screening method, improved patient preparation and a more practical
   technique are needed.}},

Abstract = {{TPK1 ( formerly KCO1) is the founding member of the family of two-pore
   domain K 1 channels in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana), which
   originally was described following expression in Sf9 insect cells as a
   Ca2(+)- and voltage- dependent outwardly rectifying plasma membrane K 1
   channel. In plants, this channel has been shown by green fluorescent
   protein fusion to localize to the vacuolar membrane, which led to
   speculations that the TPK1 gene product would be a component of the
   nonselective, Ca2+ and voltage- dependent slow-vacuolar (SV) cation
   channel found in many plants species. Using yeast ( Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae) as an expression system for TPK1, we show functional
   expression of the channel in the vacuolar membrane. In isolated vacuoles
   of yeast yvc1 disruption mutants, the TPK1 gene product shows ion
   channel activity with some characteristics very similar to the SV-type
   channel. The open channel conductance of TPK1 in symmetrically 100mM KCl
   is slightly asymmetric with roughly 40 pS at positive membrane voltages
   and 75 pS at negative voltages. Similar to the SV-type channel, TPK1 is
   activated by cytosolic Ca2+, requiring micromolar concentration for
   activation. However, in contrast to the SV- type channel, TPK1 exhibits
   strong selectivity for K+ over Na+, and its activity turned out to be
   independent of the membrane voltage over the range of +/- 80mV. Our data
   clearly demonstrate that TPK1 is a voltage- independent, Ca2+-
   activated, K+- selective ion channel in the vacuolar membrane that does
   not mediate SV- type ionic currents.}},

Abstract = {{Solitary fibrous tumours (SIFT) of the central nervous system are rare.
   They resemble meningioma in clinical presentation, imaging features and

   cell mesenchymal neoplasms should also be considered in the differential
   diagnosis. Although the histogenesis of this tumour is still debated,
   strong CD34 reactivity of the tumour cells suggests that SFT is
   mesenchymal. We present the clinical, radiological, and pathological
   features of an SFT located in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). A
   55-year-old female presented with 6 months of headache. The MRI scan
   showed a contrast enhancing :ovoid mass in the left CPA. At craniotomy,
   the tumour was completely resected. Histolopathological diagnosis was of
   meningioma. Three years later, the symptoms recurred and an MRI scan
   demonstrated tumour recurrence. A repeat craniotomy was performed and
   the lesion was again completely excised. Tumour morphology on
   histopathology and immunoreactivity for CD34 of the tumour cells
   supported the diagnosis of SFT. Review of the original tumour also
   disclosed immunoreactivity for CD34. Ki67 labeling indices were less

Abstract = {{Aim Recently, low-frequency polymorphisms in the coding region of the
   ghrelin gene were suggested to be involved in the aetiology of obesity
   and to modulate glucose-induced insulin secretion in different ethnic
   study groups. The objective of the present large study was to
   investigate whether the Leu72Met polymorphism of the ghrelin gene
   associates with features of the metabolic syndrome (MS) in the Danish
   population.
   Methods The variant was examined, using PCR-RFLP, in the DanMONICA
   cohort, a population-based sample of 2413 subjects. The metabolic
   syndrome was defined using the National Cholesterol Education
   Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII) criteria.
   Results The allelic frequency of the Met72 allele was
   8.6\%{[}6.3-10.9\%] in the MS group and 7.8\%{[}7.0-8.6\%] among
   subjects classified as not having the MS (NS). Similarly, there were no
   significant differences across the three groups of genotypes with
   respect to any of the examined variables, including BMI, waist
   circumference, fasting serum lipids, plasma glucose, serum insulin and
   HOMA estimates of insulin resistance and insulin secretion
   Conclusion In conclusion, the Leu72Met polymorphism of the ghrelin gene
   is not associated with the metabolic syndrome or related quantitative
   traits in the Danish population.}},

   arundinacea Schreb.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.). Also,
   ammonia emissions were compared using both semiopen chamber and

   yield and N uptake over broadcasting by 6.9 and 6.8\%, respectively. The
   SSD increased yield and N uptake over surface banding by 4.4 and 7.5\%,
   respectively. The relative effectiveness of the techniques on yield
   varied among experiments. In the ammonia volatilization trials
   (micrometeorological method), loss of applied total ammoniacal N in the
   2 wk after application ranged from 36 to 61\% for broadcast manure
   compared with 17 to 32\% for SSD-applied manure. With both
   micrometeorological and semiopen chamber, ammonia emissions from applied
   manure were 46 to 48\% lower with the SSD than with broadcasting.
   Emissions from surface-banded manure (chamber method) averaged 33\%
   greater with surface banding than with the SSD. The results indicate
   that the SSD manure applicator reduced ammonia loss and increased yield

Abstract = {{The present article addresses the hypothesis that inefficient skeletal
   muscle lipid utilization may relate to the development of obesity and
   insulin resistance. In practice, there is evidence of impaired muscle
   fatty acid utilization in the obese state, and studies indicate that
   differences in muscle fatty acid oxidative capacity might play a role in
   the pathogenesis of obesity. The link between obesity and insulin
   resistance has been recognized for many years. There is accumulating
   evidence that a disturbed muscle fat oxidative capacity results in the
   accumulation of the lipid intermediates diacylglycerol and Fatty acid
   acyl coenzyme A (CoA), which may interfere with insulin signaling and
   result in an inhibition of insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Underlying
   mechanisms for disturbed fatty acid handling may relate to impaired
   adipose tissue lipolysis, abnormal muscle fatty acid uptake and a

Abstract = {{Aim To investigate if weight gain during adulthood has effects on the
   risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or Type 2 diabetes
   beyond effect of attained weight.
   Research design and methods Data were obtained from a longitudinal study
   of two cohorts: one of juvenile-onset obese (n = 248) and one of
   randomly selected control (n = 320) men, weighed at average ages of 20,
   33, 44 and 51 years, respectively.
   Results For any given BMI, the risk of IGT was higher the greater the
   weight gain since age 20 (odds ratio of 1.10 per unit kg/m(2) of BMI
   gain, confidence interval 1.03-1.17, P = 0.004), and weight gain during
   both the early and later ages contributed to the increased risk. Obese
   men, maintaining weight since age 20, had lower risk of IGT than
   non-obese men who became similarly obese by age 51. The risk of Type 2
   diabetes increased by weight gain in early adult life, but not by more
   recent weight gain in the later periods, probably because of the
   development of Type 2 diabetes leading to weight loss.
   Conclusions Independent of attained level of body weight in middle-aged
   men, weight gain is associated with increased risk of IGT, and is
   greater in those not overweight in childhood.}},

   consider the possible benefits that other stakeholders, including
   consumers and other domestic producers, may derive from lower import

Abstract = {{Prior work has shown that coincident inputs became corepresented in
   somatic sensory cortex. In this study, the hypothesis that the
   corepresentation of digits required synchronous inputs was tested, and
   the daily development of two-digit receptive fields was observed with
   cortical implants. Two adult primates detected temporal differences in
   tap pairs delivered to two adjacent digits. With stimulus onset
   asynchronies of >= 100 ms, representations changed to include two-digit
   receptive fields across the first 4 wk of training. In addition,
   receptive fields at sites responsive to the taps enlarged more than
   twofold, and receptive fields at sites not responsive to the taps had no
   significant areal change. Further training did not increase the
   expression of two-digit receptive fields. Cortical responses to the taps
   were not dependent on the interval length. Stimuli preceding a hit,
   miss, false positives, and true negatives differed in the ongoing
   cortical rate from 50 to 100 ms after the stimulus but did not differ in
   the initial, principal, response to the taps. Response latencies to the
   emergent responses averaged 4.3 ms longer than old responses, which
   occurs if plasticity is cortical in origin. New response correlations
   developed in parallel with the new receptive fields. These data show
   corepresentation can be caused by presentation of stimuli across a
   longer time window than predicted by spike-timing-dependent plasticity
   and suggest that increased cortical excitability accompanies new task
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Prolonged swimming performances of two as yet unnamed species of
   three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus spp., were compared. The two
   fishes (not yet formally described, referred to here as benthic and
   limnetic) inhabit different niches within Paxton Lake, Texada Island,
   British Columbia, Canada, and are recent, morphologically distinct
   species. Linmetics had longer endurance during prolonged swimming than
   did benthics. The mean regression of the log(10) of fatigue time (F-t,
   s) on swimming speed (U, standard length, L-S s(-1)) for limnetics
   (log(10)F(t) = 7.03 - 0.46U) had a similar slope, but a significantly
   higher intercept than that for benthics (log(10)F(t) = 5.55 - 0-43U).
   Adult benthics were larger, heavier and deeper-bodied fish than
   limnetics. Limnetics, however, had a significantly greater pectoral fin
   edge:base ratio (mean +/- S.E.: lininetics, 4.58 +/- 0-43; benthics,
   3.63 +/- 0.27). In addition, limnetics had significantly lower drag
   coefficients (CD) than benthics (limnetics, log(10)C(D)) =
   -0.49log(10)R(e) + 0.66; benthics, log(10)C(D) = -0-26log(10)R(e) -
   0-30) where R, is the Reynolds number {[}(LSU (v(-1)), where U and v are
   swimming velocity and the kinematic viscosity of the water,
   respectively]. Compared to their ancestral form, the anadromous
   three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus L., limnetics and
   benthics had significantly longer and shorter endurance times,
   respectively. In addition, both these fishes had significantly higher
   fast-start velocities than their ancestral form. Selection due to
   differential resource use may have lead to divergence of body form, and,
   therefore, of steady swimming performance. Therefore predation may be
   the selective force for the similar high escape performance in these two
   fishes. (c) 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.}},

   reliability of ultrathin high-dielectric-constant/SiO2 MOS gate stacks.
   It has been observed that for high enough T-A the conduction becomes
   more inhomogeneous, leading to the formation of leaky spots that could
   be a problem for the integration of these layers in a standard CMOS
   microelectronic process. The CAFM has also revealed that the values of
   some parameters related to the dielectric reliability, such as the area
   of the breakdown spot (i.e. a region that has lost its insulating
   properties owing to electrical stress), are of the same order for SiO2
   layers and high-dielectric-constant/SiO2 stacks. Moreover, different
   conduction regimes, which cannot be detected by standard electrical

Abstract = {{Uterine myomas are common but erythrocytosis caused by these is rarely
   seen. We report a case that illustrates the conjunction of various
   aetiological factors required for this clinical entity to evolve. A
   voluminous, retroperitoneally located and focally degenerated myoma was
   associated with severe secondary erythrocytosis (haematocrit: 65.5\%)
   which resolved after hysterectomy. It has been demonstrated previously
   that myomatous tissue is the source of excessive production of
   erythropoietin. Local tissue hypoxia, which is more prone to develop in
   a pedunculated myoma, stimulates the process. Other prerequisites are a
   very large size of the myoma and the absence of menometrorrhagia of a
   severity such as to cause a depletion in iron reserves.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{6501-6507}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effects of influent variability and model
   parameter uncertainty when utilizing enhanced coagulation modification
   to bring existing treatment plants into compliance with a stricter
   arsenic regulation. Enhanced coagulation modification options include:
   (1) increased ferric chloride dose, (2) addition of an acid dose, and
   (3) a combination of the individual options. Arsenic removal is
   described by adsorption to hydrous ferric oxide with a surface
   complexation model and subsequent removal through sedimentation and
   filtration. The leastcost modification for reliably satisfying the
   arsenic regulation is determined using an optimization algorithm that
   explicitly includes variability and uncertainty. The ferric chloride
   only modification is always the least-cost treatment modification. The
   ferric chloride and acid modification could be the least-cost option
   when considering waste handling processes due to a tradeoff between
   modification cost and sludge production. By inclusion. of variability
   and uncertainty, the relative importance of individual parameter
   distributions for determining whether the arsenic regulation is reliably
   satisfied is assessed. Influent arsenic concentration variability is
   always critical, while variability in the influent pH and sulfate
   concentrations and uncertainty in the filter removal efficiency and
   equilibrium adsorption constant for the =(FeOHCa2+)-O-s surface species
   are critical or important, depending on influent conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine if complementary and

   respect to their preferred role in decision-making (measured by the
   problem-solving decision-making or PSDM scale). A survey was mailed in
   spring 2001 to a random sam- ple of 696 men (selected from the Ontario
   Cancer Registry), aged 18 years or older and diagnosed with prostate
   cancer in the preceding 2 years. Less than 5\% of the 489 (72.1\%
   response rate) men (mean age 68.6 years) who responded to the PSDM
   question in our survey were classified as having an autonomous role
   preference, while almost 1/3 of the respondents reported using CAM for
   their prostate cancer. The majority of respondents were classified as
   preferring a shared role and a substantial minority was classified as
   preferring a passive role. There was no statistically significant
   difference between CAM users and non-users with respect to their
   preferred rote. The hypothesis that CAM Users are more autonomous
   problem solvers and decision makers is not supported by these findings;
   however, the generalizability of our results is limited by the fact that
   we surveyed a relatively older mate population only. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a new boundary integral equation dedicated to the solution of
   the boundary problem of a perfectly electrically conducting surface for
   the harmonic Maxwell equations in unbounded domains. Any solution of the
   harmonic Maxwell equations is represented as the electromagnetic field
   generated by a combination of electric and magnetic potentials. These
   potentials are those appearing in the classical combined field integral
   equation (CFIE), but their coupling is realized by an operator (Y) over
   tilde (+) instead of a coefficient. Therefore, the integral equation
   obtained can be viewed as a generalization of the CFIE. In this paper,
   we propose an explicit construction of the coupling operator (Y) over
   tilde (+) which is designed to approximate the exterior admittance
   operator of the scattering obstacle. A local approximation by the
   admittance operator of the tangential plane seems to be relevant thanks
   to the localization effects related to high-frequency phenomena. The
   provided numerical simulations show that this formulation leads to
   linear systems that are better conditioned compared to more classical
   integral equations, which speeds up the resolution when solved with
   iterative techniques.}},

   the best existing calculations of positron annihilation rates in jellium
   and crystal lattices, pointing in this way at deficiencies of existing
   theories of electron positron interaction in these materials. In the
   present work, the local enhancement factors due to e+-e(-)interaction in

   for core and as concerns lithium also for conduction electrons and
   compared to the results of existing approximations to this problem which
   avoid direct many-body calculations in metals, i.e., the local density,
   generalized gradient and weighted density approximations, as well as to
   experimental data. Conclusions about positron lifetime and e+-e(-)

Abstract = {{The advent of plastics and the wide range of fillers that are available
   have made modification as precise as the tailored resins themselves.
   Compounds are prepared from poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and two

   concentrations (up to 40 wt\%). The effects of both the fillers on the
   mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, salt spray performance;
   rheological as well as optical properties of filled PMMA are measured.
   The impact strength of PMMA increased with increasing concentrations of
   talc and SSAS up to 20 and 15\% loading, respectively, and thereafter
   declined continuously in both the cases. Increase in impact strength is
   more in the case of talc-filled PMMA than that of SSAS-filled PMMA.
   Tensile strength decreased with increasing concentration of both the
   fillers continuously: The elongation at break decreased drastically for
   PMMA with increasing concentrations of both the fillers. Electrical
   properties remained almost unchanged with respect to the concentration
   of the fillers. The zero shear viscosity increased with increasing
   concentration of both the fillers, but the rate of increase was more for
   SSAS than that for talc.}},

Abstract = {{In arctic streams, depth of thaw beneath the stream channel is likely a
   significant parameter controlling hyporheic zone hydrology and
   biogeochemical cycling. As part of an interdisciplinary study of this

   investigated three sites characterized by low-energy water flow, organic
   material lining the streambeds, and water depths ranging from 0-2 to 2
   m. We acquired data using a 200 MHz pulsed radar system with the
   antennas mounted in the bottom of a small rubber boat that was pulled
   across the stream while triggering the radar at a constant rate. We
   achieved excellent results at all three sites, with a clear continuous
   image of the permafrost boundary both peripheral to and beneath the
   stream. Our results demonstrate that GPR can be an effective tool for

Abstract = {{A new numerical model based on the incompressible, nonhydrostatic
   Navier-Stokes equations for free surface flow is developed. The
   equations are transformed vertically to the sigma coordinate system and
   laterally to an orthogonal curvilinear system and solved in a fractional
   step manner in which the pressure is split into hydrostatic and
   nonhydrostatic components. The model treats the nonhydrostatic term
   implicitly and uses a collocated grid and pressure interpolation to
   prevent checkerboard solutions that occur when the velocity and pressure
   become decoupled. Advection and hydrostatic pressure terms are
   integrated explicitly with a second-order accurate predictor-corrector
   scheme. The corrector utilizes fluxes that are computed in a
   Godunov-based manner by solving a Riemann problem at each cell face.
   Flow variables are reconstructed at each cell face to obtain
   second-order spatial accuracy. Numerical simulations of Stokes, cnoidal,
   and solitary waves with the proposed method and a reference method in
   which the hydrostatic pressure is implicitly integrated are compared
   with analytical solutions and experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{In 1701 the five Iroquois nations concluded a series of negotiations
   with the French in Canada and the English in New York. Important
   outcomes of the New York talks, which were held in Albany, included a
   deed conveying Iroquois hunting territory to the British Crown and a map
   outlining the extent of the land transferred. In November 2002, one of
   us ``rediscovered{''} a copy of the deed at the Public Record Office in
   Kew, United Kingdom, and examined it, along with the 1701 map, which
   itself had been ``rediscovered{''} in 1999, at close hand. We offer a
   reconsideration of both documents and of the events leading to their
   creation. Conventional wisdom has it that the deed was never properly
   received or filed by Crown authorities, and of late, the map has been
   characterized as an example of one Englishman's imperfect knowledge of
   geography. Previous research has been hampered by reliance on the
   published version of the deed instead of the original (which differ on
   key points) and by the fact that the map has been unknown to scholarship

   of brain damage and outcome in pneumococcal meningitis in rats treated
   with ceftriaxone from 28 h after infection.
   Rats treated with fucoidin from time of infection had an excess risk of
   a fatal outcome compared to rats not receiving fucoidin (25/63 versus
   5/34,p =0.012), whereas the risk of cortical damage in surviving animals
   was comparable (16/44 versus 9/29, p =0.8). Pre-treatment with fucoidin
   attenuated CSF pleocytosis 24 h after infection (median 400 versus 800 x
   10(6) cells/l, p =0.01) without affecting CSF bacterial counts (2.3 x
   10(5) versus 3.6 x 10(5) CFU/ml, p =0.54). A significant increase in
   blood bacterial counts was found among rats pre-treated with fucoidin
   (median 9.6 x 10(2) versus 5.2 x 10(2) CFU/ml, p = 0.03). Furthermore,
   blood bacterial count was found to be an important predictor of fatal
   outcome as shown by multivariate logistical regression analysis (OR
   4.43, 95\% Cl {[}1.16-17.0] p = 0.03).
   In summary, blocking leukocyte entry to the central nervous system in
   experimental pneumococcal meningitis compromises the survival prognosis
   but does not affect the risk of brain damage or level of infection in
   this compartment. Conversely, poorer prognosis was associated with an
   increase in bacterial load in blood, suggesting that leukocyte blockage
   affects the host's ability to control systemic infection. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Parental conflicts can lead to antagonistic coevolution of the sexes and
   of parental genomes. Within a population, the resulting antagonistic
   effects should balance, but crosses between populations can reveal
   conflict. Parental conflict is less intense in self-pollinating plants
   than in outcrossers because outcrossing plants are pollinated by
   multiple pollen donors unrelated to the seed parent, while a
   self-pollinating plant is primarily pollinated by one individual
   (itself). Therefore, in crosses between plants with differing mating
   systems, outcrossing parents are expected to ``overpower{''} selfing
   parents. We call this the weak inbreeder/strong outbreeder (WISO)
   hypothesis. Prezygotically, such overpowering can alter pollination
   success, and we argue that our hypothesis explains a common pattern of
   unilateral incompatibility, in which pollen from self-incompatible
   populations fertilizes ovules of self-compatible individuals but the
   reciprocal cross fails. A postzygotic manifestation of overpowering is
   aberrant seed development due to parent-of-origin effects such as
   genomic imprinting. We evaluate evidence for the WISO hypothesis by
   reviewing published accounts of crosses between plants of different
   mating systems. Many, but not all, of such reports support our
   hypothesis. Since parental conflicts can perturb fertilization and
   development, such conflicts may strengthen reproductive barriers between
   populations, contributing to speciation.}},

Abstract = {{NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes can induce apoptosis in
   virus-infected and transformed target cells via the granule exocytosis
   pathway. The key components of the cytolytic granules are perforin and
   several serine esterases, termed granzymes. While the cellular
   distribution of human granzymes A (GrA) and B (GrB) has been well
   characterized much less is known about the expression pattern of human
   granzyme K (GrK). In this study GrA, GrB, and GrK expression was
   analyzed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes using flow cytometry.
   There was a distinct population of GrK expressing CD8(+) T cells with a
   CD27(+)/CD28(+)/CCR5(high)/CCR7(-)/Perforin-/(low)/IFN-gamma(+)
   memory-like phenotype, while all CD56(bright) NK cells were also
   positive for GrK. In addition, GrK was also expressed in subpopulations
   of CD56(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, and TCR gamma delta(+) T cells. In
   contrast, GrB was primarily expressed in CD56(dim) NK cells and
   differentiated memory CD8(+) T cells with the
   CD27(-/low)/CD28(-/low)/CCR5(-/low)/CCR7(-)/ CD11b(+)/perforin(high)
   phenotype. Only few CD8(+) T cells expressed both GrB and GrK. GrA was
   found to be co-expressed in all GrB- and GrK-expressing T cells. Our
   findings suggest that granzyme expression during the differentiation
   process of memory CD8(+) T cells might be as follows:
   GrA(+)/GrB(-)/GrK(+) --> GrA(+)/GrB(+)/GrK(+) --> GrA(+)/GrB(+)/GrK(-).}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Impedance cardiography (IC) and Doppler echocardiography
   (DE) are two noninvasive methods to evaluate hemodynamics in patients
   with dual-chamber pacemakers. The aim of the present study was to
   compare both techniques in respect to their ability of AV-interval
   optimization in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) based on cardiac
   output (CO) measurements.
   Methods and Results: Twenty-four patients (64 +/- 8 years) with
   congestive heart failure (EF < 35\%; NYHA III-IV) and LBBB (> 150 ms)
   were evaluated at baseline and 1 month after implantation of a CRT-D.
   The optimal AV interval was defined by IC and subsequently by
   transaortic flow DE as the interval corresponding to the highest CO
   measured at different AV intervals, varying from 60 to 200 ms (with 20
   ms increments). For standardization and comparison of both techniques, a
   fixed atriobiventricular pacing rate of 90 beats/min was used. Absolute
   values of COmax were higher by IC (5.8 +/- 0.9 l/min) as compared to DE
   (4.6 +/- 0.9 l/min, p < 0.01). The optimal AV interval as determined by
   IC varied interindividually from 80-180 ms (mean: 121 +/- 18 ms). In DE,
   the range was also 80-180 ms with the mean optimal AV interval of 128
   +/- 23 ms. Thus, there was a strong correlation for AV-interval
   optimization in CRT between both methods (r = 0.74; p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: In CRT, AV-interval optimization based on CO values
   determined by IC correlates closely to those measured by transaortic
   flow DE. Impedance cardiography as an easy and cost-effective technique
   for AV-interval optimization is a promising alternative for routine
   management of heart failure patients on a beat-to-beat analysis during
   CRT follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{A method for calculating proximity-effect losses in a discontinuous-mode
   power-factor-correction inductor is examined with regard to simple
   multifilar windings. Calculation of effective winding AC resistance R-ac
   is performed for each switching pulse, which in turn is multiplied by
   the square of the I-rms for that pulse. The loss value for each pulse is
   then summed for all pulses to determine the winding loss. This
   calculation is sensitive to conductor diameter and winding arrangement,
   particularly the number of layers. Calculations are then used to target
   the optimum winding arrangement, within the application constraints, for
   minimum winding loss and compared with measured results. The general
   agreement between calculation and results demonstrates that this
   approach is a useful tool in the initial design of such an inductor. The
   tenor of the paper is the examination of `limited-resource' or
   low-volume solutions to the aforementioned losses; therefore Litz-wire
   versions are not examined, as they represent initial `high-cost'
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of infant-father attachment and other aspects of father-child
   relationships burgeoned during the 1980s and 90s, in step with new
   expectations for greater father participation in childrearing, but less
   is known about how involved fathers experience themselves as attachment
   figures, socialization agents, and playmates/companions of their young
   children. In an attempt to investigate these topics from a relationship
   perspective, we administered the Parent Attachment Interview (PAI) to 49
   married fathers from dual career families who, based on current
   literature, were expected to be active participants in caring for and
   interacting with their preschool children. The 22 open-ended PAI
   questions were designed to probe fathers' thoughts and feelings about
   parent-child attachment, but also elicited extensive descriptions of
   other aspects of fathering, including socialization and companionship.
   In addition, fathers reflected on similarities and differences between
   the father- and mother-child relationships, and these accounts were
   compared with corresponding discussions by their wives. Among new issues
   raised by the study were the role of affection in attachment
   relationships, evidence for the attachment hierarchy construct, issues
   of parental self-control in relation to discipline, conceptual overlaps
   between attachment and other aspects of parenting, and the diverse
   meanings of father-mother differences and disagreements in the three

Abstract = {{Background: The Campaign to Prevent Antimicrobial Resistance in
   Healthcare Settings was developed through 9 research projects: 1 to
   determine the name and image, 5 to test the 12-step programs, and 3 to
   evaluate the Campaign. This report analyzes data from 9 projects and
   reports key findings.
   Methods: Data from the 9 projects were analyzed by 4 topics: perceptions
   of the problem of antimicrobial resistance, barriers to preventing
   antimicrobial resistance, most and least important steps and strategies,
   and preferences for materials and information sources.
   Results: Data from 21 in-depth interviews, 19 focus groups, and 3
   surveys were analyzed. A total of 695 clinicians participated: 564
   (81.2\%) were physicians; 98 (14.1\%) were nurses; and 33 (4.7\%) were
   other healthcare professionals. Differences by both occupation and
   medical specialty area were observed. A majority of participants agreed
   that antimicrobial resistance is a problem nationally, whereas fewer
   agreed that it is a problem in their institution or practice. Of the
   Campaign's 4 strategies, ``Diagnose and Treat Infection Effectively{''}
   and ``Use Antimicrobials Wisely{''} were considered most important,
   whereas ``Prevent Infection{''} and ``Prevent Transmission{''} were
   considered least important. Frequently cited preferences for materials
   included posters and professional resources such as journal articles and
   presentations at conferences or annual meetings of professional
   societies.
   Conclusion: The findings highlight important issues that could influence
   the success of implementation of the Campaign to Prevent Antimicrobial
   Resistance in Healthcare Settings. Tailoring the campaign messages and
   supporting materials to individual institutions or clinician types are
   encouraged to address or acknowledge these issues and facilitate
   behavior change.}},

Abstract = {{Propionate is a very abundant carbon source in soil, and many
   microorganisms are able to use this as the sole carbon source.
   Nevertheless, propionate not only serves as a carbon source for
   filamentous fungi but also acts as a preservative when added to glucose
   containing media. To solve this contradiction between carbon source and
   preservative effect, propionate metabolism of Aspergillus nidulans was
   studied and revealed the methylcitrate cycle as the responsible pathway.
   Methylisocitrate lyase is one of the key enzymes of that cycle. It
   catalyzes the cleavage of methylisocitrate into succinate and pyruvate
   and completes the et-oxidation of propionate. Previously,
   methylisocitrate lyase was shown to be highly specific for the substrate
   (2R,3S)-2-methylisocitrate. Here, the identification of the genomic
   sequence of the corresponding gene and the generation of deletion
   mutants is reported. Deletion mutants did not grow on propionate as sole
   carbon and energy source and were severely inhibited during growth on
   alternative carbon sources, when propionate was present. The strongest
   inhibitory effect was observed, when glycerol was the main carbon
   source, followed by glucose and acetate. In addition, asexual
   conidiation was strongly impaired in the presence of propionate. These
   effects might be caused by competitive inhibition of the NADP-dependent
   isocitrate dehydrogenase, because the K-i of (2R,3S)-2-methylisocitrate,
   the product of the methylcitrate cycle, on NADP-dependent isocitrate
   dehydrogenase was determined as 1.55 mu M. Other isomers had no effect
   on enzymatic activity. Therefore, methylisocitrate was identified as a
   potential toxic compound for cellular metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory batch experiments have been performed with sediment and
   groundwater obtained from two sites in Denmark to study the aerobic
   biodegradation of vinyl chloride (VC) and cis- 1,2-dichloroethylene
   (c-1,2-DCE) to assess the natural aerobic biodegradation potential at
   two sites. The experiments revealed that VC was degraded to below the
   detection limit within 204 and 57 days at the two sites. c-1,2-DCE was
   also degraded in the experiments but not completely. At the two sites
   50\% and 35\% was removed by the end of the experimental period of 204
   and 274 days. The removal of c-1,2-DCE seems to occur concomitantly with
   VC indicating that the biodegradation of c-1,2-DCE may depend on the
   biodegradation of VC. However, in both cases natural groundwater was
   mixed with sediment and consequently there may be other compounds (e.g.
   ammonium, natural organic compound etc.) that serves as primary
   substrates for the co-metabolic biodegradation of c-1,2-DCE. At one of
   the sites methane was supplied to try to enhance the biodegradation of
   VC and c-1,2-DCE. That was successful since the time for complete
   biodegradation of VC decreased from 204 days in the absence of methane
   to 84 days in the presence of methane. For c-1,2-DCE the amount that was
   biodegraded after 204 days increased from 50\% to 90\% as a result of
   the addition of methane. It seems like a potential for natural
   biodegradation exists at least for VC at these two sites and also to
   some degree for c-1,2-DCE. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Guava (Psidium guajava L.) is a tropical fruit that presents fast
   post-harvest ripening; therefore it is a very perishable product.
   Inappropriate storage temperature and retail practices can accelerate
   fruit quality loss. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   respiratory activity (RA), the ethylene production (EP) and Q(10) of
   guava fruit at different storage temperatures. `Paluma' guava fruits
   were harvested at maturity stage 1 (dark-green skin) and stored at
   either 1, 11, 21, 31 or 41 C; RA and EP were determined after 12, 36, 84
   and 156 h of storage. RA and EP rates at 1 and 11 C were the lowest -
   0.16 and 0.43 mmol CO2 kg(-1) h(-1) and 0.003 and 0.019 mu mol C2H4
   kg(-1) h(-1), respectively. When guavas were stored at 21 C, a gradual
   increase occurred in RA and EP, reaching 2.24 mmol CO2 kg(-1) h(-1) and
   0.20 mu mol C(2)H4 kg(-1) h(-1), after 156 h of storage. The highest RA
   and EP were recorded for guavas stored at 31 C. In spite of high RA,
   guavas stored at 41 C presented EP similar to guavas stored at 11 C, an
   indicator of heat-stress injury. Considering the 1-11 C range, the mean
   Q(10) value was around 3.0; the Q(10) value almost duplicated at 11-21
   degrees C range (5.9). At 21-31 degrees C and 31-41 degrees C, Q(10) was
   1.5 and 0.8, respectively. Knowing Q(10), respiratory variation and
   ripening behavior in response to different temperatures, fruit storage
   and retail conditions can be optimized to reduce quality losses.}},

Abstract = {{The recently emerging conviction that thick disks are prevalent in disk
   galaxies, and their seemingly ubiquitous old ages, means that the
   formation of the thick disk, perhaps more than any other component,
   holds the key to unravelling the evolution of the Milky Way, and indeed
   all disk galaxies. In Paper I, we proposed that the thick disk was
   formed in an epoch of gas-rich mergers at high redshift. This hypothesis
   was based on comparing N-body SPH simulations to a variety of Galactic
   and extragalactic observations, including stellar kinematics, ages, and
   chemical properties. Here we examine our thick-disk formation scenario
   in light of the most recent observations of extragalactic thick disks.
   In agreement, our simulated thick disks are old and relatively metal
   rich, with V - I colors that do not vary significantly with distance
   from the plane. Furthermore, we show that our proposal results in an
   enhancement of alpha-elements in thick-disk stars as compared with
   thin-disk stars, consistent with observations of the relevant
   populations of the Milky Way. We also find that our scenario naturally
   leads to the formation of an old, metal-weak, stellar halo population
   with high alpha-element abundances.}},

Abstract = {{The landslide electoral victory of Thaksin Shinawatra and his Thai Rak
   Thai (TRT) Party in February 2005 means that the most powerful elements
   of big domestic capital will continue to manage the affairs of the Thai
   state. In this article, we focus on the relationship between this
   capitalist state and the politics of labour, with considerable emphasis
   on the organized elements of the working class. We argue that the TRT,
   during its first term in office, pursued a clutch of labour-specific
   policies, with two broad objectives: first, to facilitate the creation
   of a more flexible and better-skilled labour force, seen as necessary
   for the development of a restructured, globally competitive capitalism;
   and second, through the construction of a new social contract, to deal
   with some of the inevitable tensions that have been generated by
   structural change and wage labour's deepening exposure to the vagaries
   of local, regional and global market forces. The TRT is also embarking
   on further reforms, the nature of which indicate that, for business and
   the state, labour's interests will be further subordinated to the
   shifting demands of capital accumulation. Now that domestic capital has
   mostly recovered from the economic crisis, the populism of the TRT's
   first electoral campaign, which appeared to reject neo-liberal reform,
   is being replaced by a populism that accepts neo-liberal restructuring.
   Most notably, privatization, which the TRT opposed when it was part of
   IMF-sponsored reform, is now being embraced by the party, and looms as a
   key area for further tension between organized labour and the
   government.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose was to examine whether or not participation in an
   e-mail discussion group would affect use of selected complementary and
   alternative medicine (CAM) modalities during an Internet-based, 1-year
   randomized, controlled trial on back pain management.
   Methods: Intervention subjects (n = 190) participated in a closed,
   moderated e-mail discussion group; control subjects (11 = 231) received
   usual care. At 1 year, we compared CAM use over the previous 6-month
   period during which intervention subjects had had interactive
   discussions about them. Differences in CAM use between groups were
   compared using Chi-square and t-tests.
   Results: Subjects did not differ statistically between groups (p >
   0.05). They were Caucasian (similar to 91\%), male (similar to 60\%), in
   their mid-40s, well educated, had similar to 13 years back pain
   duration, a disability level similar to 10 (Roland-Morris scale: 0-23;
   23 = worst), and > 80\% had used the Internet for greater than a year
   before the randomized trial. During the study period, only small
   proportions in either group had initiated use of glucosamine (13\%
   versus 8\%), chiropractic services (5\% versus 4\%), acupuncture (3\%,
   both), yoga (6\% versus 4\%), or magnets (6\%, both).

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate the effect of 10 years of treatment with
   tibolone on aortic stiffness and endothelial function.
   Design Cross-sectional study of women currently participating in an
   open-label, nonrandomized study of the long-term efficacy of tibolone. A
   total of 113 recently postmenopausal women were recruited in 1988.
   Fifty-eight agreed to take tibolone 2.5 mg daily and 55 were followed
   during the study as matched controls (who chose not to take any form of
   hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the duration of the study). The
   groups were matched for age, weight and time since last menstrual
   period.
   Setting A Central London Teaching Hospital.
   Subjects After 10 years, 60 women remained in the study, 32 in the
   tibolone group and 28 in the control group. All of these women were
   invited to participate in this pilot study and attend the Menopause
   Research Unit. Fourteen women from each group agreed to attend. The main
   outcome measures were aortic stiffness, measured by pulse wave velocity,
   and endothelial function, as assessed by flow-mediated dilatation of the
   brachial artery.
   Results Pulse wave velocity was significantly lower in the tibolone
   group (10.4 +/- 1.2) than in the control group (11.6 +/- 1.2), p =
   0.042. The flow-mediated dilatations were similar in both groups.
   Conclusion In this study, long-term use of tibolone over 10 years has a
   beneficial effect on aortic stiffness. The differences seen in brachial
   artery vasoreactivity failed to reach statistical significance. Whether
   this is a true indication of the effects of long-term tibolone on
   brachial artery vasoreactivity will only be determined by performing a
   larger, placebo-controlled, randomized study.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To reduce the number of transgressions to the rule, the
   occurrence of violent acts and to prevent injuries, Hockey Quebec
   adopted the Fair-Play Program (FPP). The objective of the present study
   was to evaluate the effectiveness of the FPP.
   Methods: 52 Bantam (14-15 years) teams participated in this cohort
   study. In total, 49 games (13 with the FPP, 36 without FPP) were
   systematically assessed for transgressions to the rule. Body checking
   was allowed in all games. Transgressions to the rule data were obtained
   using a real time observation system in a natural setting, while injury
   data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. Data were
   analysed using generalised linear models with generalised estimating
   equations accounting for potential team effect.
   Results: The number of penalties per game was significantly lower (p <
   0.01) for games played with the FPP. Overall, no difference was noted in
   the number of transgressions observed during games played with or
   without the FPP. Players in leagues where the FPP was used held their
   opponents more frequently (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, players in
   leagues without the FPP shoved and hit more (p = 0.05). No difference
   was noted in the injury rate for games played with or without the FPP.
   Conclusions: This study showed that the FPP is one of the tools
   available to help those in the hockey world promote fair play values.
   Moreover, this project clearly showed the importance of program
   evaluation and the value of direct observation in a natural setting.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of Co2+ ions on the homogeneous nucleation of ZnO is
   examined. Using electronic absorption spectroscopy as a dopant-specific
   in-situ spectroscopic probe, Co2+ ions are found to be quantitatively
   excluded from the ZnO critical nuclei but incorporated nearly
   statistically in the subsequent growth layers, resulting in crystallites
   with pure ZnO cores and Zn1-xCoxO shells. Strong inhibition of ZnO
   nucleation by Co2+ ions is also observed. These results are explained
   using the classical nucleation model. Statistical analysis of nucleation
   inhibition data allows estimation of the critical nucleus size as 25 +/-
   4 Zn2+ ions. Bulk calorimetric data allow the activation barrier for ZnO
   nucleation containing a single Co2+ impurity to be estimated as 5.75
   kcal/mol cluster greater than that of pure ZnO, corresponding to a 1.5 x
   10(4)-fold reduction in the ZnO nucleation rate constant upon
   introduction of a single Co2+ impurity. These data and analysis offer a
   rare view into the role of composition in homogeneous nucleation
   processes, and specifically address recent experiments targeting
   formation of semiconductor quantum dots containing single magnetic
   impurity ions at their precise centers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the role of Anna Wetherill Olmsted (1888-1981) in
   the organization of the Ceramic National exhibitions between 1932 and
   1941. These aimed to continue the legacy of the influential Arts and
   Crafts ceramicist Adelaide Alsop Robineau (1865-1929) in pioneering new
   developments in ceramics, but,by the end of the 1930s they had become
   the showcase for new work in ceramics in the USA. Yet, surprisingly, the
   history of the Ceramic National exhibitions and the activities of
   Olmsted have received little attention from historians. As this paper
   demonstrates, Olmsted was part of a social and cultural matrix which
   linked the Ceramic National exhibitions, local and regional art and
   cultural institutions which, by the mid-1930s, initiated, developed and
   managed New Deal projects, the local Syracuse pottery industry,
   individual artists/designers/craft-makers, and new strategies for higher

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate homecare nurses'
   knowledge of wound assessment using digital images and case studies.
   DESIGN: A descriptive design was used.
   SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Subjects were a convenience sample of 33
   registered nurses from a Washington, DC, metropolitan-based home health
   agency.
   METHODS: Participants were asked to complete a demographic data sheet
   and a wound assessment checklist, while viewing projected digital images
   of 10 different wounds. A case study accompanied each image and provided
   wound assessment data that could not be visualized. Frequencies were
   calculated to determine the percentage of homecare nurses who were
   accurate in their assessment.
   RESULTS: The most common error in staging was a lack of recognition of
   wounds that were not stageable. The majority of the homecare nurses were
   able to accurately identify wound bed and periwound characteristics; the
   greatest variability was found in the ratings for wound bed color.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the difficulty of interpreting digital images of
   wounds, the study findings support the value of using them to evaluate
   nurses' knowledge of the visual aspects of wound assessment as a basis
   for educational programs.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of nonmonotonic changes in the redox state of P700, the
   primary electron donor of PSI, was investigated on predarkened barley
   (Hordeum vulgare L.) leaves exposed to far-red light. To accomplish
   this, the relaxation kinetics of absorbance changes at 830 nm,
   reflecting the dark reduction of P700(+), were measured at different
   stages of the induction curve. The onset of far-red light resulted in
   rapid oxidation of P700, which was followed by its partial reduction and
   subsequent slow oxidation of P700 to a steady-state level. This
   steady-state level was usually attained within 10 s under far-red light.
   The relative contribution of the slow kinetic component of P700(+)
   reduction decreased in parallel with the transient photoreduction of
   P700(+) and increased upon a subsequent stage of P700 photooxidation.
   The contribution of the middle component to the dark reduction of P700'
   increased monotonically with the length of far-red light irradiation.
   The relative amplitude of the fast component of P700(+) reduction
   increased sharply during the first 3 s of irradiation and decreased upon
   longer light exposures. The rates of fast and slow components of dark
   reduction of P700(+) remained constant upon illumination of dark-adapted
   leaves with far-red light for I s and longer periods. Thus, nonmonotonic
   changes in the redox state of P700 in barley leaves exposed to far-red
   light reflect variable contributions of few alternative electron
   transport pathways characterized by different rates of electron donation
   to PSI. The results show the principle possibility of switching-over
   between alternative pathways of PSI-related electron transfer within one
   complex of this photosystem. Such switching may occur irrespective of
   active operation or inhibition of ferredoxin-dependent electron
   transport.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of artificial structures in coastal areas can cause
   fragmentation and loss of natural habitats. Previous studies found that
   variation in colonisation of space at mid-shore levels could account for
   differences in mature assemblages between seawalls and vertical surfaces
   on adjacent rocky shores in Sydney Harbour (Australia). This study tests
   the model that the nature of the substratum is responsible for different
   patterns of early colonisation between vertical ledges of rocky shores
   and seawalls. According to this model, patterns in early colonisation
   would differ between cleared areas created on vertical surfaces on rocky
   shores and seawalls, but not between standard surfaces (panels)
   installed on each structure. Early colonisation of space differed
   between seawalls and rocky shores, regardless of the type of substratum
   (clearings versus panels). Differences in relative abundances between
   structures were evident on both types of substrata for some taxa, while
   they varied between substrata for others. No taxa, however, showed
   consistent differences between structures in only the clearings. In
   addition, the abundance of some taxa differed between panels on the
   different structures, suggesting that the effects of the substratum were
   modulated by factors operating differentially between rocky shores and
   seawalls. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   glycidyl methacrylate-based, DEAE-modified anion-exchange Biospher GMB
   1000Q column. It was verified that separation is based not only on an
   anion-exchange mechanism but also on secondary interactions of the bases
   with the stationary phase. Notably different retention was observed for
   oligonucleotides differing only in the position of one base in the
   sequence. The nature of these secondary interactions and the effect of
   sequence on retention is discussed. The effect on retention of the type
   and concentration of organic mobile phase modifier, mobile phase pH,
   sample molecular weight, and the bases in the sample was investigated. A
   linear relationship was found between retention and the molecular weight
   of mixed-sequence oligonucleotides with lengths from 15 to 40.
   Resolution of N - 1 synthetic by-products from the full-length product
   was also evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Ultracold bosons in optical superlattices are expected to exhibit
   fractional-filling insulating phases for sufficiently large repulsive
   interactions. On strictly one-dimensional systems, the exact mapping
   between hard-core bosons and free spinless fermions shows that any
   periodic modulation in the lattice parameters causes the presence of
   fractional-filling insulator domains. Here, we focus on two recently
   proposed realistic two-dimensional structures where such mapping does
   not hold, i.e., the two-leg ladder and the trimerized kagome lattice.
   Based on a cell strong-coupling perturbation technique, we provide
   quantitatively satisfactory phase diagrams for these structures, and
   give estimates for the occurrence of the fractional-filling insulator
   domains in terms of the intercell to intracell hopping amplitude ratio.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{478-484}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: There has never been a large, randomized controlled trial to
   assess the impact of intraoperative imaging on the success of carotid
   endarterectomy (CEA). This comparison involves cost-effectiveness
   analysis.
   METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic model to compare
   effectiveness and costs of intraoperative ultrasound (IUS) and
   completion angiography as adjuncts to CEA. Data on procedural mortality,
   morbidity, and costs were obtained from the English-language literature.
   The review included a total of 52 reports, encompassing more than 22,000
   patients. The main components of costs were those of the monitoring
   interventions and the care of perioperative stroke.
   RESULTS: Mean perioperative outcome without completion imaging is
   approximately 96.7\% of what it would be in the absence of perioperative
   stroke or death. IUS and completion angiography each result in
   approximately 2\% improvement in expected outcome. Mean perioperative
   costs are \$396.50 for IUS, \$721.30 for no monitoring, and \$840.90 for
   completion angiography. Because IUS is significantly more effective at
   detecting technical errors that would likely result in perioperative
   stroke than no imaging and is significantly less costly than
   angiography, this strategy dominates the other two (i.e., it provides
   greater effectiveness at lower cost).
   CONCLUSION: Although surgical complications are uncommon, IUS
   substantially lowers the rate of perioperative stroke and mortality and
   thus is significantly more cost-effective than either completion
   angiography or no operative imaging.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an application of work-domain analysis (WDA) to the
   domain of the command and control of a multipurpose naval frigate-the
   Canadian Halifax Class frigate. This represents an application of this
   approach to a real system and, to the authors' knowledge, is the most
   extensive WDA of a naval work domain. In particular, and in contrast to
   other applications of cognitive work analysis, the authors extended the
   basic WDA framework to handle a multipurpose, loosely bound work domain.
   In addition, the naval domain is value driven, and this affects naval
   decision making. Values were incorporated as a social organizational
   analysis into the work-domain model and were represented as a type of
   soft constraint. A total of 38 submodels of the work domain were
   developed, whose primary models are discussed in this paper. From these
   models, 132 information requirements were extracted, substantiating that
   WDA is a worthwhile technique for supporting interface design. This
   paper makes a theoretical contribution by extending the WDA framework
   and a practical contribution by demonstrating the usefulness of the
   framework in a real design context. This paper concentrates on
   presenting WDA as a process, not as a finished product, showing
   intermediate levels of models and the design requirements that can be
   extracted from the early stages of the WDA.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the current usage, relevance, and
   preferences for electronic health information (EHI) in the participant
   surgeons' clinical, research, and teaching activities. The
   Internet-Based Health Information Survey (IBHIS) was conducted from
   August to December 2003. Thirty-seven doctors (primarily practicing in
   East Africa) participated, all of whom had been using the Ptolemy
   resources for at least 6 months. Survey questions concerned time spent
   reading medical literature, preferred information sources, preferred
   type of publication, relevance, preference for western versus local
   medical literature, and academic productivity. Among the 75 eligible
   participants, 37 (48\%) responded. From these responses it was found
   that African surgeons with access to EHI read more than articles than
   they did before they had such access, and they find that the information
   obtained is highly relevant to their clinical, teaching, and research
   activities. They prefer electronic journals to textbooks and are more
   inclined to change their practice based on information found in western
   journals than local journals. Ptolemy resources helped the respondents
   who reported academic work write a total of 33 papers for presentation
   or publication Overall, access to EHI enables doctors in Africa to read
   more, is relevant, and contributes directly to academic productivity;
   thus Western medical literature is useful in the developing world, and
   EHI delivery should continue to expand.}},

Abstract = {{The use of education and experience minimum qualifications (MQs) is
   nearly ubiquitous in employment settings, yet it appears to be rare that
   such MQs are validated by the end user (either via content validity or
   criterion-related validation approaches). In this article, we present a
   method of content-validating MQs that is related to a procedure noted by
   Levine, Maye, Ulm, and Gordon (1997), and we demonstrate the method's
   application for an upper-level management position in a state agency.
   Our procedure is based on adherence to the Uniform Guidelines and sound
   professional practice. In addition, the procedure was heard in a federal
   court proceeding (deposition and expert testimony in relation to 3
   jobs), was approved by that court, and we discuss the court's findings.
   In particular, the court found, ``The MQ development process used by the
   State Personnel Department (SPD) is consistent with the requirements of
   the Guidelines and leads to content-valid MQs.{''} Given data available
   to us for another job, we also show that the obtained MQs may result in

Abstract = {{Measurements of cross-shore velocity (u) at z=3 cm and suspended
   sediment concentration (SSC) at z=1-33 cm were collected from the swash
   zones of gently sloping (Perranporth, UK) and steep (Sennen, UK)
   beaches, during morphodynamic conditions ranging from highly dissipative
   to almost reflective and breaker heights ranging from 0.8 to 2.2 m. Nine
   swash-zone data collection runs were used to compare the performance of
   simplified versions of Bagnold-type energetics sediment transport models
   on the two different beaches. Models originally designed for suspended
   load, where the sediment transport (I) is approximately proportional to
   u(4), showed no apparent improvement over those intended for bedload,
   where I proportional to u(3). It is suggested that the lowest SSC
   sensors could be measuring high concentrations in the sheet-flow layer,
   where previous laboratory results suggest a u(3) model is most
   appropriate. The overall performance of the model is better (average
   r(2)=76\%) on the gently sloping beach than on the steep beach (average
   r(2)=49\%). Modifications to account for processes, such as bore
   turbulence, may improve the model's performance, particularly on steep
   reflective beaches.}},

Abstract = {{In a study among 609 secondary school students, the affective reactions

   frequent responses implying a self-focus than an other-focus. The most
   frequent response was self-focused identification with an upward
   comparison target, that is, the hope that one might in the future
   receive a good grade similar to that of the target. In general, girls
   showed more altruistic and empathic responses, and boys more egocentric
   and hostile responses to social comparison. Those with a low performance
   level responded more often to downward comparison with the fear that
   they would receive a similar low grade on a next test.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondria generate oxygen-derived free radicals that damage
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as nuclear DNA and in turn promote
   carcinogenesis. The mtDNA G10398A polymorphism alters the structure of
   Complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, an important
   site of free radical production. This polymorphism is associated with
   several neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesized that the 10398A
   allele is also associated with breast cancer susceptibility. African
   mitochondria harbor the 10398A allele less frequently than Caucasian
   mitochondria, which predominantly carry this allele. Nlitochondrial
   genotypes at this locus were therefore determined in two separate
   populations of African-American women with invasive breast cancer and in
   controls. A preliminary study at Vanderbilt University (48 cases, 54
   controls) uncovered an association between the 10398A allele and
   invasive breast cancer in African-American women, {[}odds ratio (OR),
   2.90; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 0.61-18.3; P = 0.11]. We
   subsequently validated this finding in a large, population-based,
   case-control study of breast cancer, the Carolina Breast Cancer Study at
   the University of North Carolina (654 cases, 605 controls).
   African-American women in this study with the 10398A aflele had a
   significantly increased risk of invasive breast cancer (OR, 1.60; 95\%
   CI, 1.10-2.31; P = 0.013). The 10398A allele remained an independent
   risk factor after adjustment for other well-accepted breast cancer risk
   factors. No association was detectable in white women (879 cases, 760
   controls; OR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.81-1.31; P = 0.81). This study provides
   novel epidentiologic evidence that the mtDNA 10398A allele influences
   breast cancer susceptibility in AfricanAmerican women. mtDNA
   polymorphisms may be underappreciated factors in breast carcinogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{When the IMF turns southward, a great amount of magnetic energy is
   stored in the magnetotail, and the electric field across the magnetotail
   substantially enhances. As long as magnetic reconnection (MR) in the
   magnetotail initiates and continues, the magnetic field and plasma in
   the central plasma sheet are carried away to the near-Earth and down to
   the tail, the magnetic field and plasma in the lobe region enter the CPS
   and are involved in MR. We call this process ``Continuous Lobe
   Reconnection (CLR){''}. In this paper a detailed analysis of Cluster
   observation of MR through 2001-2003 is made. Plenty of CLR events are
   found that led to considerable changes of tail configuration, appearance
   of BBF, as well as large-scale bubbles in which both plasma temperature
   and number density substantially decrease. It is shown that in general
   CLR events last for dozens of minutes and have good correspondence to
   substorm initiation under the condition of continuous southward IMF.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, studies are presented on proton exchanged (PE) and
   annealed proton exchanged (APE) waveguides in Y-cut magnesium doped
   lithium niobate based on our systematic fabrication and
   characterizations. The analysis is focused on the optical and structural
   properties from the measurements of prism coupler, X-ray diffraction and
   infrared absorption. The evolution of the index profile with annealing
   is studied. Unlike the Gaussian index profile for the APE waveguides in
   pure LiNbO3, the index profile of APE waveguides in MgO:LiNbO3 still
   keeps the characteristics of step-like profile though with a long index
   tail. From the measurement results of X-ray diffraction, the strain
   induced by proton exchange depends on the exchange condition in Y-cut
   MgO:LiNbO3. The lattice distortion in the guiding layer of an
   as-exchanged waveguide in Y-cut MgO:LiNbO3 can be up to +0.73\%, which
   can be restored to +0.20\% by annealing for a short time. The proton
   exchange causes more serious non-uniformity of the strain in Y-cut
   MgO:LiNbO3 than that in pure LiNbO3 in our study. It was also found that
   HNbO3 phase of high hydrogen concentration can be formed more easily in
   Y-cut MgO:LiNbO3 by proton exchange from the analysis of 3300 cm(-1)
   peak in the IR spectra. The intensity of the infrared absorption peak at
   3500 cm(-1) decreases and the broad peak at 3300 cm(-1) disappears after
   annealing in Y-cut MgO: LiNbO3 waveguides. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a questionnaire
   assessing symptoms associated with pediatric functional gastrointestinal
   disorders (FGIDs) and to provide preliminary evidence for its validity
   and reliability in a tertiary care setting.
   Methods: The Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS)
   was designed as both a parent report and child self-report measure based
   on the pediatric Rome II criteria for FGIDs. It was constructed in
   English, translated into French, and pilot tested in both languages.
   Initial validation was performed using the French version. Participants
   were 315 consecutive new patients aged 4 to 18, and their parents,
   presenting to a gastroenterology clinic and classified as having a
   functional problem. Content validity, item discrimination capacity, and
   reliability (parent-child concordance and temporal stability) were
   examined.
   Results: Analyses of parent and child reports indicated that all items
   were pertinent and variably distributed. Although children were reliable
   reporters, up to 42\% of parents did not know about their children's
   gastrointestinal functioning. As many as 60\% of parents of children 10
   to 18 could not respond to questions about defecation and subjective
   symptoms. Concordance was generally fair to good, with Kappas and
   intraclass correlations of 0.40 to 0.70 on most items. Test-retest
   reliability was moderate to good for the majority of items.
   Conclusion: This study supports the content validity of the QPGS. Form A
   is a reliable measure for parents of children 4 to 9 years old, but the
   child self-report Form C appears to be more reliable for 10 to 18 year
   olds.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have investigated the classification of living things. Our
   study deals with a different problem: the attribution of life to one
   component of a living organism, specifically the bones. The task
   involves not only specifying what we mean by `alive', but also requires
   `informed thinking' leading to an understanding of the concept of life
   itself. This study is part of an education programme at the Civic
   Zoological Museum of Rome. The questions ``Are bones alive when they are
   inside the living body? What evidence do you have to this effect? What
   are bones made of? Can bones grow? How do they grow? Do children or
   newborn animals have the same bones as adults?{''} were addressed to a
   sample of 189 students aged 7 to 12 taking part in the programme, and to
   a sample of over one hundred 17-18 year old students visiting the
   Museum. Not only did the younger students consider bones as non-living
   entities, so did a high percentage of lower and higher secondary school
   students, although many of them mentioned their ``having cells{''} and
   acknowledged their growth. In this paper, we argue that the acquisition
   of the concept of life should be a priority in the study of biology but,
   on the contrary, it is rarely the object of deliberate and informed
   teaching in our schools.}},

Abstract = {{Post-conflict elections in Mozambique, held in 1994, 1999 and 2004,
   established a formally competitive and pluralistic system. This paper
   examines the country's emerging two-party system as an essential feature
   affecting prospects for democratic deepening and consolidation. The
   condition for political parties to actually help the establishment of
   democratic politics is their development as durable, socially rooted,
   country-wide effective and legitimate organisations. The paper contends
   that the current party system has indeed been a major instrument for
   political expression and for the. channelling and peaceful management of
   conflicts. It shows how both Frelimo and Renamo - and the competition
   between them - have deep-seated historical origins and well-established
   regional roots. Yet, a number of aspects' concerning the Mozambican
   party system negatively affect the deepening of den ocratic politics:
   the legitimacy, of the party system is weakened by post-conflict
   polarisation and uncertain mutual recognition; the ethno-regional
   entrenchment of the two main parties bestows a communal connotation on
   electoral competition; and-most importantly, the party system remains
   unbalanced and unevenly institutionalised, with Frelimo's disciplined
   and fundamentally institutionalised organisation opposed by a strongly
   personalistic and weakly organised Renamo, which struggles to operate
   withirtstate institutions and to accommodate internal differences.}},

   variants is summarized with emphasis on the most significant
   contributions of individuals involved in the initial recognition of
   CPV-2 and subsequent discoveries that have advanced our knowledge of the
   nature and evolution of this novel canine virus.
   Time has obscured the observations of many veterinary clinicians and
   researchers throughout the world who sensed the presence of a new
   disease when CPV-2 first made its appearance in 1978 and then, within
   1-2 years, spread worldwide. Since 1979, nearly 600 articles, papers,
   numerous text chapters and monographs have been published on the subject
   of CPV-2. The early history is well known by veterinary infectious
   diseases specialists and noteworthy publications are recorded on the
   National Library of Medicine (USA) website, PubMed and in review
   articles. Because of the great number of publications, it is not
   practicable to cite them individually; however, reference is made to
   certain individuals, reviews and selected papers that I consider
   particularly relevant to the history of progress in the understanding of
   CPV-2 and the disease it causes.
   The clinical disease caused by CPV-2 and its variants, the immune
   response to infection or vaccines, host range and the development of
   practical diagnostic assays are noted in historical context. The basic
   biological properties and the physical, molecular and antigenic
   structure of CPV-2 and its variants are also discussed briefly. Finally,
   key players who have contributed to the antigenic and DNA sequence
   (evolutionary) relationships between CPV-2 and the other autonomous
   parvoviruses of carnivores are noted and hypotheses regarding the origin
   and evolution of CPV-2 and its variants are mentioned.}},

Volume = {{71}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A simple model for a superconductor with tunable critical current is
   studied theoretically. The model consists of a thin superconducting film
   with one vortex interacting with one magnetic dipole, whose magnetic
   moment is free to rotate, in the presence of a magnetic field applied
   parallel to the film surfaces. The pinning potential for the vortex is
   calculated exactly in the London limit. It is found that, due to the
   dipole freedom to rotate, the dependence of the pinning potential on the
   applied field is non-trivial, and allows both the spatial dependence and
   strength of the pinning potential to be changed by the field. As a
   consequence, the critical current can be tuned by the applied field. The
   critical current is obtained numerically as a function of the applied
   field. Order-of-magnitude changes in the critical current resulting from
   changes in the direction and magnitude of the applied field are
   reported, with discontinuous changes taking place in some cases.
   Possible application to vortices in low-T-c superconducting films pinned
   by arrays of magnetic dots are briefly considered.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although patients are increasingly involved in agenda setting
   within specific fields of health research, they rarely participate in
   decision-making on the entire breadth of health research, including
   biomedical research. This might be attributable to a widely held view
   that patients are incapable of adequate research prioritization due to a
   lack of relevant knowledge, a failure to look beyond their own
   individual problems or an inability to objectively consider long-term
   targets.
   Aims By conducting transparent and structured consultations with asthma
   and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients regarding
   their health research priorities, we aim to assess the ability of
   patients to prioritize research in a well-argued way.

   meeting, and a questionnaire. The focus groups and the feedback meeting
   aimed to explore the entire breadth of patients' problems experienced in
   relation to their diseases, while the questionnaire aimed to investigate
   patients' prioritization of possible research targets focused on solving
   these problems.
   Results The focus groups produced a wide range of problems, including
   those related to health-care organization, social environment, therapy
   and costs. In terms of research prioritization, patients focused
   primarily on biomedical issues, particularly aetiology, comorbidity and
   effective medication.
   Conclusions The consultation procedure successfully elicited patients'
   research priorities including the underlying arguments. Our results
   indicate that asthma and COPD patients are capable of research
   prioritization in a well-argued way and that they highly value
   biomedical research. Furthermore, as they prioritized some research
   topics that are not covered by current Dutch research programmes, we
   argue that patient participation can broaden research agenda setting.}},

Abstract = {{The leaf cuticular morphology of extant species of Platanus was
   investigated using light and scanning electron microscopy. All species
   are shown to possess trichome bases of the same type as those commonly
   found in Proteaceae. Of particular significance are compound forms that
   consist of an annular surface scar associated with more than one
   underlying epidermal cell. These are found on the adaxial leaf surfaces
   of all species of Platanus and are also clearly evident on the abaxial
   surface of Platanus orientalis. This type of trichome base is therefore
   interpreted as the first detected nonreproductive morphological
   synapomorphy linking Proteaceae and Platanaceae. Also, the laterocytic,
   sometimes paracytic, or anomocytic arrangement of subsidiary cells in
   Platanus is distinct from the general state in Proteaceae, which is
   brachyparacytic and presumably derived. In Bellendena, possibly the most
   basal genus of extant Proteaceae, subsidiary cell arrangements resemble
   those of Platanus. These results are discussed with respect to leaf
   fossil records of Proteales, where it is concluded that the combination
   of brachyparacytic stomata and compound trichome bases is strong
   evidence for Proteaceae.}},

Abstract = {{gamma-Al2O3 materials with small mesopores are hydrophobised by
   reactions with organochlorosilanes in liquid media. The structure of the
   modified materials is studied by means of physisorption and
   high-resolution SEM. A good measure of the decrease in surface polarity
   can be obtained from BET-fits of the N-2 isotherms. It was found that
   many pores become blocked by using chlorosilanes with bulky organic
   groups, while a more open structure is preserved for
   methylchlorosilanes. Using toluene as a solvent leads to a higher extent
   of modification than ethanol, as observed for methylchlorosilanes.
   Multifunctional organochlorosilanes (i.e. with 2 or 3 Cl-groups) are
   more reactive but also give rise to blockage of some of the microporous
   part as a result of polymerisation reactions. Mono- and difunctional
   methylchlorosilanes give the best results for alumina materials with
   small mesopores, preserving an open structure and leading to homogeneous
   modification. Modification with methylchlorosilanes in toluene leads to
   the lowest surface polarity. The results give clues for optimising the
   procedures for hydrophobisation of porous materials with small
   mesopores. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cyclone Kalunde has had three main morphologic effects on the sandy
   coasts of Rodrigues: the lowering of beaches, comprised between 0,20 and
   1 in, dune receding which reached 7 m in some places and the breaking of
   barrier beaches which were overflooded by rivers. The importance of
   these manifestations varied significantly from one place to another
   along the eastern coast of Rodrigues. Beach profiles which were
   established three months after this event revealed the unequal
   resilience of beaches. Whereas some of them had entirely recovered from
   the erosion due to the cyclone, others had not. The author of this paper
   analyzes the role of coral reefs and dunes in the recent evolution of
   beaches. She emphasizes on the two different functions of coral reefs
   which should act as breakwaters and as a source of sediment for beaches.
   Where they don't play efficiently these roles as in Rodrigues, they
   contribute to beach erosion. Coral reefs limit the transfer of sediments
   from the submerged sandy plain and the reef flat to the beach itself.}},

Abstract = {{We show that electron recombination using positively charged excitons in

   entanglement from electron spins onto photon polarizations. We propose a
   scheme for the production of entangled four-photon states of GHZ type.
   From the GHZ state, two fully entangled photons can be obtained by a
   measurement of two photons in the linear polarization basis, even for
   quantum dots with observable fine structure splitting for neutral
   excitons and significant exciton spin decoherence. Because of the
   interplay of quantum mechanical selection rules and interference,
   maximally entangled electron pairs are converted into maximally
   entangled photon pairs with unity fidelity for a continuous set of
   observation directions. We describe the dynamics of the conversion
   process using a master-equation approach and show that the

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to determine the survival of
   untreated stage I and II in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
   Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of medical charts of all
   patients diagnosed with early stage NSCLC, between January 1990 and
   December 2001, was conducted and patients who were not treated were
   identified. Data on patient's age, gender, stage of the disease,
   pathology, reason for non-treatment and cause of death were reviewed.
   Results: Thirty-nine patients with untreated stage I and II NSCLC were
   identified. The median age at diagnosis was 77 years; 66.7 \% were men
   and 33.3 \% were women. All patients were Caucasian and 66.7 \% had
   stage I disease, 46.2 \% had squamous cell carcinoma, while
   adenocarcinoma was found in 28.2 \%. The major reason for non treatment
   was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (64.1 \%) and the main cause
   of death was metastatic disease (48.7 \%). The overall mean survival was
   11.9 months. The mean survival at stage I was not statistically
   different from the mean survival at stage II (13.7 months vs. 8.4
   months) (p < 0.12). Conclusion: Patients with untreated early stages
   NSCLC have a very poor prognosis. Alternative therapies that are better
   tolerated should be investigated in these patients with early stage
   NSCLC who cannot be offered standard treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Following recent increases in the financial value of sport sponsorship
   programs, some commentators believe this has been accompanied by the
   development of sponsorship management practices. Despite this, there are
   still widespread concerns about some of these practices. This study
   therefore sets out to examine and comment upon the practice of
   sponsorship management from an English perspective, specifically in
   soccer. This is an area of sponsorship that has previously been examined
   and is a sport in which there have been significant commercial
   developments in recent years. Using face-to-face interviews and
   questionnaires, 43 corporations provided information about their
   sponsorship programs. While there is some evidence of good practice, a
   continuing failure to effectively manage sport sponsorship programs is
   clear. The study thus concludes by making recommendations about the
   future development of sport sponsorship management.}},

Abstract = {{Protection in experimental rabbit syphilis has been previously assessed
   by lesion development following intradermal challenge with Treponema
   pallidum. We have recently reported that passive immunization using
   monoclonal antibody M131 conveys partial protection as evidenced by
   significant lesion delays following intradermal challenge (D. R. Blanco
   et al., Infect. Immun. 73:3083-3095, 2005). To determine whether such
   delays in time to lesion appearance corresponded to decreases in the
   numbers of spirochetes, we used real-time PCR to quantitate T. pallidum
   genomic DNA copy numbers in lesion biopsies taken throughout the course
   of lesion development. Three groups of animals were given one
   prechallenge passive immunization with immune rabbit serum (IRS), M131,
   or control monoclonal antibody (CMAb) and then challenged with
   treponemal admixtures of IRS or monoclonal antibody in normal rabbit
   serum (NRS). As compared to the CMAb NRS controls, delays in the mean
   time to lesion appearance of 5.8 days for IRS and 8.8 days for M131 were
   observed. At the earliest time point (10 days postchallenge), real-time
   PCR showed a mean T. pallidum DNA copy number per mu g of rabbit DNA in
   the CMAb NRS group of 7.65 X 10(3) copies, while no T. pallidum DNA
   could be detected in the M131 group. At approximately the mean time to
   lesion appearance in the IRS and M131 groups (17 and 20 days,
   respectively), the numbers of T. pallidum DNA copies were still 5- and
   30-fold less, respectively, than those in the control group at these
   times. By 30 days postchallenge, the T. pallidum DNA copy numbers were
   similar in all three groups. These findings indicate that the delays in
   appearance of syphilitic lesions conferred by IRS and M131 corresponded
   to a marked decrease in treponemal numbers during the course of lesion
   development.}},

   at both the front and back sides of a transparent object, as well as
   internal reflection, thus delivering interactive realistic transparency
   effects on a commodity PC. The real-time performance is made possible by
   a new acceleration data structure, called geocube, that enables the use
   of GPU for fast ray-surface intersection testing. In addition, within
   the same framework, we introduce the novel use of the mip-map for a
   hierarchical representation of a sequence of key prefiltered environment
   maps to simulate translucency. By taking ray depth into account and
   using GPU to interpolate the key filtered maps to produce the desired
   blurring effects, we achieve real-time realistic translucency rendering
   of slightly scattering media that allows show-through of background

Abstract = {{Objective: Primary lymphoma of the uterine cervix is rare, with less
   than 60 cases reported. We present a series of 6 patients with cervical
   lymphoma and review the literature. Study design: Between 1988 and 2003,
   we identified 6 women with primary lymphoma of the uterine cervix
   treated at our institutions. Data for analysis were obtained from
   hospital charts, office records, and tumor registry files. We also
   reviewed 20 published reports on cervical lymphoma, providing
   information on 58 additional patients.
   Results: The median age at diagnosis was 52 years (range 40-76). Three
   patients had an abnormal Papanicolaou test within 6 months of the
   diagnosis. Mean tumor size was 8.3 cm (range 3-14 cm). On the basis of
   the Ann Arbor system of staging where ``E{''} denotes extranodal tumor
   origin, 2 patients had stage IE, 1 had stage IIIE, and 3 had stage IVE
   disease. The median follow-up for these 6 women was 33 months (range
   12-120). Adding the 6 patients in our series to the 58 patients obtained
   from published reports, 43 had stage IE, 14 had stage IIE, 2 had stage
   IIIE, and 5 had stage IVE disease. There was no consistent pattern of
   treatment identified from our literature review.
   Conclusion: Primary lymphoma of the uterine cervix is a rare malignancy.
   Most patients present with stage IE disease. Women with localized
   disease typically respond to various combinations of surgery,
   chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Combination chemotherapy with tailored
   radiotherapy appears to be the preferred treatment option in women with
   advanced disease. (c) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEST}},

Volume = {{128}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Study objectives: Inhaled, short-acting beta-agonists and systemic
   corticosteroids form the mainstay, of therapy in acute asthma
   exacerbation. Asthma, however, is an inflammatory disease of the
   airways, and its underlying pathology is not impacted by short-acting
   beta-agonists. While the efficacy, of ad-lib beta-agonist administration
   in outpatient management of asthma symptoms is well established, little
   data exist to support this strategy, in patients with acute, severe
   asthma. We postulate that as long as patients hospitalized with severe
   asthma exacerbation receive systemic corticosteroids, regular, scheduled
   administration of short-acting beta-agonists is unnecessary. Similar
   therapeutic outcomes can be achieved with the ad-lib administration of
   the short-acting beta-agonists.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
   Setting: Pulmonary floor of a 600-bed municipal hospital.
   Patients or participants: Sixty-two patients hospitalized for acute
   asthma. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either
   albuterol. nebulizations (regular albuterol group) or saline solution
   nebulizations (ad-lib group) every 4 h with management of breakthrough
   symptoms with albuterol metered-dose inhaler or nebulizations for both
   groups. All patients received systemic corticosteroids. Peak expiratory
   flows, asthma symptoms, and need for rescue bronchodilator were followed
   up on each patient until discharge.
   Results: There was no significant difference in the length of
   hospitalization (median length, 48 h for ad-lib group vs 57.5 h for
   regular albuterol group, p = 0.82), rate of improvement in peak flow, or
   symptoms between the two groups. Ad-lib P-agonist use compared to
   regular albuterol scheduled use resulted in a significant reduction in
   the total number of albuterol treatments administered (median, 7
   treatments vs 19 treatments, p = 0.001) during hospitalization.
   Conclusions: In the management of asthma exacerbation, ad-lib
   administration of albuterol is therapeutically, as effective as regular;
   scheduled administration. This method of drug administration also
   reduces the total dose of beta-agonists received by the hospitalized
   patient.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Formation and transport of glucuronide metabolites were studied in
   LLC-PK1 cells. Glucuronidation of 17 beta-estradiol, 1-naphthol,
   mycophenolic acid, and 4-methylumbelliferone was examined in microsomes
   prepared from LLC-PK1 cells, human livers, human kidneys, and human
   intestines. The rate of glucuronide metabolite formation observed with
   LLC-PK1 microsomes was comparable to rates observed with various human
   tissue microsomes. The fate of the glucuronide metabolite formed in the
   LLC-PK1 cells was studied by examining its extracellular transport using
   mycophenolic acid as a model substrate. After administration of
   mycophenolic acid, the amount of the glucuronide metabolite exiting to
   the extracellular compartments significantly decreased in the presence
   of MK-571, an inhibitor for the multidrug resistance-associated protein
   (MRP) transporter. However, the intracellular levels of the glucuronide
   metabolite did not change, suggesting that MK-571 was probably blocking
   metabolite efflux. In summary, these results suggest that the
   glucuronidating enzyme(s) expressed in the LLC-PK1 cells are capable of
   sufficient glucuronidation activity and that endogenous transporter(s)
   in LLC-PK1 cells are active and determine the distribution of the formed
   metabolites. Since these cells have been previously used to study drug
   transport, they may be a useful tool in future studies to explore the
   effect of drug transporters on glucuronidation.}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been identified as an important growth
   regulator of lung cancer cells. Elevation of serum levels of IL-6 has
   been found in a subpopulation of lung cancer patients, but rarely in
   patients with benign lung diseases. Approximately 15 \% of non-small
   cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors exhibit neuroendocrine (NE) properties
   (NSCLC-NE) and have been suggested to have the biological
   characteristics similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with early
   metastasis and initial responsiveness to chemotherapy. We recently
   showed that IL-6 promotes cell proliferation and downregulates the
   expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE, one of the major NE markers)
   in NSCLC-NE cells. In this study, we show that IL-6 stimulates a
   transient increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in a
   dose-dependent fashion. Inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway by either
   AG-490 (JAK2-specific inhibitor) or overexpression of STAT3Y705F (a
   dominant-negative STAT3) reverses NSE expression in IL-6treated NSCLC-NE
   cells. In addition, IL- 6 induces phosphorylation and activation of p38
   MAPK. SB-203580, a p38 MAPK- specific inhibitor, inhibits IL-6-induced
   p38 MAPK phosphorylating activity and suppresses IL-6-stimulated cell
   proliferation. Together, our results indicate that STAT3 signaling
   pathway is involved in IL-6-induced NE differentiation and that p38 MAPK
   is associated with IL-6-stimulated growth regulation in NSCLC-NE cells.
   These data suggest that both kinase pathways play critical roles in the
   pathogenesis of NSCLC-NE malignancies, providing new molecular targets
   for future therapeutic approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Goals of work: The effectiveness of cancer pain management (CPM) is
   influenced by nurses' willingness to maximize opioid analgesia for
   severe cancer pain. The purposes of this study were to identify the
   willingness of nurses to provide maximum-dose opioids whenever needed
   for CPM and to determine its associated predictors. Methods: This
   multicenter study was conducted among the entire total of registered
   nurses in seven large hospitals in Korea. Its overall response rate was
   41.6\%, and the data from 930 who responded (40.1\%) were analyzed. We
   utilized a three-step, multidimensional, multiple logistic regression to
   identify the predictors of nurses' willingness. Main results: Only 255
   nurses (27.4\%) indicated that they recommended the maximum dose of
   opioids whenever it was needed. The respondents who were more likely to
   recommend morphine showed the following characteristics: older nurses
   (odds ratio, OR, 1.57; confidence interval, Cl, 1.13-2.19); they knew
   the effectiveness of opioids for CPM (OR 1.53; CI 1.06-2.20); rarely
   concerned about a patient's addiction to opioids (OR 2.16; Cl
   1.48-3.15), or to a family member's addiction (OR 1.81; Cl 1.20-2.73);
   prior experience with pain assessment tools (OR 1.62; Cl 1.11-2.37);
   practical experience caring for cancer patients with pain over 51\% (OR
   1.55; Cl 1.09-2.19). Conclusions: Our multicenter study suggested that
   in order to improve nurses' willingness to recommend opioids liberally
   in CPM: (1) attitudes about fear of opioid addiction must be changed;
   (2) the efficiency of opioids in CPM must be taught; and (3)
   implementation of pain assessment tools must be undertaken.}},

Abstract = {{The emissions of two types of organic solutes during the coagulation
   process were simulated using Jar Test equipment and two additives,
   coagulant and polymer, to evaluate the volatilization characteristics
   under various operating conditions. The solute volatilization rates were
   found to be a function of the liquid mixing intensity, the chemical
   properties of the additives, and the properties of solutes, including
   molecular weight (M), Henry's law constant (H), and water solubility
   (S). The volatilization rates of the high H solutes increased sharply as
   the mixing intensity increased. Moreover, the volatilization rates of
   selected compounds were only slightly dependent on the coagulant
   concentrations due to the inorganic property of the coagulant. On the
   other hand, the effective volatilization reduction of the high H solutes
   in the existence of organic flocculant was a result of the enhancement
   of solutes solubility in water solutions. However, the above inhibition
   effects decreased significantly when the mixing intensity increased.
   Finally, the emission rates of the low H solutes were weakly correlated
   with both the solution properties and the operating parameters, due to
   their high affinity with the solution and the major volatilization
   resistance existing in the gas phase. Two different approaches, i.e.,
   the two-film theory and the modified Knudsen diffusion equation, we're
   used to explain the solute volatilization characteristics in the
   simulation process.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To investigate the association between added sugar and
   macronutrient and micronutrient intakes, and to assess whether added
   sugar intake is related to biochemical indices of nutritional status,
   Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) score, body mass index (BMI) and
   performance on physical function tests.
   Design: A cross-sectional, analytical study.
   Setting and subjects: Convenient sample of 285 institutionalised and
   community-dwelling black South African men and women aged 60 + y.
   Methods: An interviewer-administered 24-h dietary recall and MNA were
   performed. Serum albumin, vitamin B-12, ferritin, cholesterol,
   haemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) folate and plasma vitamin C were
   measured. Handgrip strength, BMI, `sit-to-stand' and `get-up-and-go'
   tests were measured. Outcome variables were analysed according to
   tertiles of added sugar, in grams and as a percentage of total energy
   (\% E).
   Results: In each tertile of sugar intake, mean MNA score fell in the
   `at-risk' classification. In women, energy, protein, \% E protein,
   fibre, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, pantothenic
   acid, biotin, vitamin C, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc,
   copper and selenium intake were significantly lowest in subjects in the
   highest \% E sugar tertile. In men, no differences were found for
   micronutrient intake according to tertiles of total added sugar or \% E
   added sugar. Physical function declined with increasing sugar intake,
   and suboptimal RBC folate and plasma ascorbic acid status was associated
   with increasing sugar intake ( in women). No relationship was found
   between added sugar intake and the very high prevalence (65\%) of
   obesity in women.
   Conclusion: A nutrient-diluting effect of added sugars intake was
   demonstrated in elderly black South African women. Further studies in
   this population are required in order to develop food-based dietary
   guidelines, which include messages on added sugar intake.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the biological functions related to pathogenicity and virulence
   reside in the fungal cell wall, which, being the outermost part of the
   cell, mediates the host-fungus interplay. For these reasons much effort
   has focused on the discovery of useful inhibitors of cell wall glucan,
   chitin, and mannoprotein biosynthesis. In the absence of a
   wide-spectrum, safe, and potent antifungal agent, a new strategy for
   antifungal therapy is directed towards the development of monoclonal
   antibodies (MAbs). In the present study the MAb A9 (immunoglobulin Gl
   {[}IgGl]) was identified from hybridomas raised in BALB/c mice immunized
   with cell wall antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus. The immunoreactive
   epitopes for this IgGl MAb appeared to be associated with a peptide
   moiety, and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed its binding
   to the cell wall surface of hyphae as well as with swollen conidia. MAb
   A9 inhibited hyphal development as observed by MTT
   {[}3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay
   (25.76\%), reduced the duration of spore germination, and exerted an in
   vitro cidal effect against Aspergillus fumigatus. The in vivo protective
   efficacy of MAb A9 was also evaluated in a murine model of invasive
   aspergillosis, where a reduction in CFU (> 4 log(10) units) was observed
   in kidney tissue of BALB/c mice challenged with A. fumigatus (2 X 10(5)
   CFU/ml) and where enhanced mean survival times (19.5 days) compared to
   the control (7.1 days) and an irrelevant MAb (6.1 days) were also
   observed.}},

Abstract = {{The gastric aspirate shake test (GST) was evaluated in 77 newborns with
   respiratory distress for predicting hyaline membrane disease (HMD) at
   KEM Hospital, Pune, India.
   Methods: Over 0.5 ml of gastric fluid was obtained within 30 min of
   birth and mixed with an equal volume of normal saline for 10 sec; 1 ml
   of 95\% ethanol was then added and the mixture agitated for 10 sec.
   After standing for 15 min, the air-liquid interface was examined for
   bubbles.
   Results: All 21 infants with a negative GST developed HMD. However, 12
   infants with an intermediate and nine with a positive test also
   developed HMD. None of the infants with other respiratory disorders,
   e.g. transient tachypnoea and pneumonia, had a negative GST. A negative
   GST had a specificity of 100\%, sensitivity of 70\% and positive

Title = {{Self-consistent generalized Langevin equation for colloidal mixtures}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A self-consistent theory of collective and tracer diffusion in colloidal
   mixtures is presented. This theory is based on exact results for the
   partial intermediate scattering functions derived within the framework
   of the generalized Langevin equation formalism, plus a number of
   conceptually simple and sensible approximations. The first of these
   consists of a Vineyard-like approximation between collective and tracer
   diffusion, which writes the collective dynamics in terms of the memory
   function related to tracer diffusion. The second consists of
   interpolating this only unknown memory function between its two exact
   limits at small and large wave vectors; for this, a phenomenologically
   determined, but not arbitrary, interpolating function is introduced: a
   Lorentzian with its inflection point located at the first minimum of the
   partial static structure factor. The small wave-vector exact limit
   involves a time-dependent friction function, for which we take a general
   approximate result, previously derived within the generalized Langevin
   equation formalism. This general result expresses the time-dependent
   friction function in terms of the partial intermediate scattering
   functions, thus closing the system of equations into a fully
   self-consistent scheme. This extends to mixtures a recently proposed
   self-consistent theory developed for monodisperse suspensions
   {[}Yeomans-Reyna and Medina-Noyola, Phys. Rev. E 64, 066114 (2001)]. As
   an illustration of its quantitative accuracy, its application to a
   simple model of a binary dispersion in the absence of hydrodynamic
   interactions is reported.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the response of early growth of maritime pine seedlings to
   combined levels of light and phosphorus. Seedlings were grown under
   three levels of phosphorous availability, i.e., two relative addition
   rates (RAR = 2 and 4 g P ( 100 g(-1)) P d(-1)) and a free-access to P,
   crossed with two light levels (photosynthetic photon flux densities of
   150 and 450 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively). Relative growth rate
   (RGR) and relative uptake rate of phosphorus (RUR) were computed, as
   well as the amount of light absorbed per seedling. We found that
   phosphorus and light acted as limiting factors with a complex
   interaction. Under low light and at the lowest P level, P and light were
   co-limiting, i.e., growth was enhanced only when P and light were
   increased together. Light was the limiting factor for growth under low
   light conditions at all other levels of P availability. P was the
   limiting factor at a RAR of 2\% under high light. Enhancing P from 4\%
   to free access did not significantly improve growth under high light.
   RUR was controlled systematically by P availability at 2 and 4\% RAR.
   RGR values were close to RUR values except under free access to P.
   Therefore, growth-independent accumulation of P was observed under high
   P conditions. The differences in biomass production among P treatments
   were explained primarily by the reduced amount of radiation intercepted
   by the seedlings as a consequence of their reduced leaf area. No effect
   of P treatments were observed on the calculated radiation-use efficiency
   ( RUE), which was found to be larger under low light. This confirms that
   pine seedlings adjust to moderate phosphorus deficiency mainly by
   changing their morphology (leaf area, dry-mass partitioning) while
   biochemical and photochemical limitations of photosynthesis play only a
   very secondary role.}},

   knowledge of the Hessian of the objective function, and involving only a
   reduced and controlled amount of storage and computational cost. The new
   scheme allows us to obtain asymptotically the Newton's direction by
   improving the accuracy in the ODE solver associated with the implicit
   scheme. We will present extensive and encouraging numerical results on
   some well-known test problems, on the problem of computing the square

Abstract = {{This study is focused on climate-induced variation of sea level in
   Stockholm during 1873-1995. After the effect of the land uplift is
   removed, the residual is characterized and related to large-scale
   temperature and atmospheric circulation. The residual shows an overall
   upward trend, although this result depends on the uplift rate used.
   However, the seasonal distribution of the trend is uneven. There are
   even two months (June and August) that show a negative trend. The
   significant trend in August may be linked to fresh water input that is
   controlled by precipitation. The influence of the atmospheric conditions
   on the sea level is mainly manifested through zonal winds, vorticity and
   temperature. While the wind is important in the period January-May, the
   vorticity plays a main role during June and December. A successful
   linear multiple-regression model linking the climatic variables (zonal
   winds, vorticity and mean air temperature during the previous two
   months) and the sea level is established for each month. An independent

Abstract = {{Objective: Current protein-protein interaction (PPI) detection via
   high-throughput experimental methods, such as yeast-two-hybrid has been
   reported to be highly erroneous, leading to potentially costly spurious
   discoveries. This work introduces a novel measure called IRAP, i.e.
   ``interaction reliability by alternative path{''}, for assessing the
   reliability of protein interactions based on the underlying topology of
   the PPI network.
   Methods and materials: A candidate PPI is considered to be reliable if
   it is involved in a closed loop in which the alternative path of
   interactions between the two interacting proteins is strong. We devise
   an algorithm called AtternativePathFinder to compute the IRAP value for
   each interaction in a complex PPI network. Validation of the IRAP as a
   measure for assessing the reliability of PPIs is performed with
   extensive experiments on yeast PPI data. All the data used in our
   experiments can be downloaded from our supplementary data web site at
   http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/similar to chenjin/data.html.
   Results: Results show consistently that IRAP measure is an effective way
   for discovering reliable PPIs in large datasets of error-prone
   experimentally-derived PPIs. Results also indicate that IRAP is better
   than IG2, and markedly better than the more simplistic IG1 measure.
   Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate that a global, system-wide
   approach-such as IRAP that considers the entire interaction network
   instead of merely local neighbors-is a much more promising approach for
   assessing the reliability of PPIs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: To demonstrate the degree of the cerebral blood flow (CBF)
   estimation bias that could arise from distortion of the arterial input
   function (AIF) as a result of partial-volume effects (PVEs) in dynamic
   susceptibility contrast (DSC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Materials and Methods: A model of the volume fraction an artery occupies
   in a voxel was devised, and a mathematical relationship between the
   amount of PVE and the measured baseline MR signal intensity was derived.
   Based on this model, simulation studies were performed to assess the
   impact of PVE on CBF. Furthermore, the effectiveness of linear PVE
   compensation approaches on the concentration function was investigated.
   Results: Simulation results showed a nonlinear relationship between PVE
   and the resulting CBF measurement error. In addition to AIF
   underestimation, PVE also causes distortions of AIF frequency
   characteristics, leading to CBF errors varying with mean transit time
   (MTT). An uncorrected AIF measured at a voxel with a partial-volume
   fraction of <= 50\% could produce a CBF overestimation of more than
   fourfold. Linear compensation of the concentration curves did not
   produce correct CBF estimates.
   Conclusion: PVE can induce significant CBF estimation biases. In
   addition, the MTT dependence of CBF accuracy raises doubts of the
   validity of adopting a single cross-calibration factor (i.e., setting
   normal white matter to 22 mL minute(-1) (100 g)(-1)) to obtain CBF
   values with absolute units. The impact of PVE, may be reduced by
   decreasing the maximum arterial signal drop in the perfusion images. To
   correct the AIF distortions introduced by PVE, the nonlinear
   relationship between the impact of PVE on MR signal intensity and
   contrast concentration function must be considered.}},

Abstract = {{A recombinant Escherichia coli strain carrying a plasmid with an
   antibiotic resistance marker and expressing the green fluorescent
   protein was inoculated at a concentration of 3.8x10(8) CFU/g into
   direct-cut wheat (348 g of dry matter kg(-1)), wilted wheat (450 g of
   dry matter kg(-1)), and corn (375 g of dry matter kg(-1)). The forages
   were ensiled in mini-silos. The treatments included control (no E. coli
   added), application of tagged E. coli, and delayed sealing of the
   inoculated wheat. Three silos per treatment were sampled on
   predetermined dates, and the numbers of E. coli were determined on
   Chromocult TBX medium with or without kanamycin. Colonies presumptively
   identified as E. coli were also tested for fluorescence activity.
   Addition of E. coli at the time of ensiling resulted in a more rapid
   decrease in the pH but had almost no effect on the chemical composition
   of the final silages or their aerobic stability. E. coli disappeared
   from the silages when the pH decreased below 5.0. It persisted longer in
   silages of wilted wheat, in which the pH declined more slowly. Control
   silages of all crops also contained bacteria, presumptively identified
   as E. coli, that were resistant to the antibiotic, which suggests that
   some epiphytic strains are naturally resistant to antibiotics.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric/metal bilayer diffusion barriers with different silicon
   carbide films (SiCO, SiCN, and SiC) were fabricated for use in Cu/porous
   low-k damascene interconnects. The bilayer sidewall barriers show
   significant performance improvements in terms of breakdown strength and
   leakage current characteristics compared with conventional physical
   vapor deposited metal barriers. SiC/Ta and SiCN/Ta bilayer barriers are
   good candidates for use in Cu/porous low-k damascene interconnects due
   to their superior electrical performance even after long-time
   thermal/electrical stress. However, the electrical characteristics of
   SiCO/Ta bilayer barrier showed a significant degradation after long-time
   thermal/electrical stress. This divergence may be attributed to the
   influence of the underlying dielectric layer on Ta texture in the
   bilayer barrier structure. The preferred a-phase Ta barrier was formed
   when deposited on SiCN or SiC, but the beta-phase Ta was formed when
   deposited on SiCO or directly on porous low-k dielectric. The unstable
   oxygen content in porous low-k dielectric as well as the SiCO layer are
   likely to be responsible for the electrical degradation of the

Abstract = {{Influence of total aluminum concentration (CAlT) on the generation and
   transformation of nanosized Al-13 and Al-30 in hydrolytic polyaluminum
   aqueous solutions was investigated using high field Al-27 NMR and
   time-developed Al-Ferron complex colorimetry. When prepared at the
   optimal basicity (B) of Al-13 generation and 80 degrees C, the Al-13
   species in polyaluminum solution tends to further polymerize and convert
   to Al-30 and higher polymers when CAlT > 0.2 mol(.)L(-1), but Al-13 does
   not convert to Al-30 quantificationally, as the formation of Al-u from
   Al-13 and Al-30 is accelerated in the same way. The conversion rate of
   Al-13 is accelerated by the increase in CAlT. When CAlT > 0.75
   mol(.)L(-1), Al-13 content decreases rapidly, and Al-30 content
   increases continuously and becomes the dominant nanometer polynuclear
   aluminum species. Al-m is one of prerequisites of Al-13 conversion to
   Al-30. When CAlT increases and B reduces, the polymerization rate
   between Al-13 and Al-m increases, and at the same time, the dissociation
   reaction rate of Al-13 and Al-30 by H+ also increases. The latter
   becomes the dominant reaction in polyaluminum solution with low B value,
   so Al-30 decreases with the increasing CAlT. The hydrolytic polyaluminum
   solution with Al-13 content beyond 80\% can only be prepared under the
   condition of CAlT < 0.5 mol(.)L(-1) and optimal B value.}},

Abstract = {{In a planar waveguide excited by a line source, we show that infinite

   with the permittivity -epsilon(0) and permeability -mu(0). When a small
   retardation exists in LHAA, the infinite guided modes reduce to a few
   discrete numbers. However, an extremely high power density is generated
   and transmitted along the super waveguide. Compared with the
   conventional air-filled waveguide, the transmitted power density in the
   super waveguide is nearly 4x10(8) times larger if the retardation is
   10(-4). We further show that the extremely high power density can be
   generated and transmitted when the LHAA contains a small loss, and high
   power can still be achieved even when relatively large retardation and

   This study used data collected from a national sample of police media
   personnel to fill this gap, and concluded that the police and media
   valued their interdependent relationship, but for different reasons.
   Police public information officers recognize the power of the media and
   attempt to use this power to promote the organization. News personnel
   are satisfied because the police provide data so they can easily produce

Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate the effects of positioning and number of repeated
   measurements on intra- and interobserver variability of
   echocardiographic measurements in dogs.
   Design-Prospective study.
   Animals-4 healthy dogs.
   Procedure-Each observer performed 24 examinations, separately assessing
   each dog 6 nonconsecutive times (3 times with the dog in lateral
   recumbency and 3 with the dog in a standing position). Variables
   evaluated included M-mode measurements of left ventricular end-diastolic
   and left ventricular end-systolic diameters, left ventricular free-wall
   thickness in diastole and systole, interventricular septal thickness in
   diastole and systole, left ventricular shortening fraction, and
   2-dimensional measurements of the left atrial diameter-to-aortic
   diameter ratio.
   Results-All coefficients of variation (range, 3.4\% to 26.6\%) were
   similar between operators and positions and were < 15\% for 27 of 32
   values. For both operators, repeatability of the measurements was better
   for left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left ventricular free-wall
   thickness in diastole, left ventricular free-wall thickness in systole,
   and the left atrial diameter-to-aortic diameter in the standing
   position, and similar for both positions for shortening fraction and
   left ventricular end-diastolic diameter. No effect of cardiac cycle was
   observed.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Within-day variability of
   conventional echocardiography performed with the dog in the standing
   position was at least as good as that obtained with the dog in lateral
   recumbency for most measured variables. Single measurements of each
   variable may be sufficient for trained observers examining dogs that do
   not have an arrhythmia. The standing position should be used,
   particularly for stressed or dyspneic dogs.}},

Abstract = {{Background Progression of ossification of the posterior longitudinal
   ligament in patients may lead to serious neurological deterioration. A
   government-funded study group established a manual method of measurement
   on plain radiographs to detect progression of the ossified lesion.
   However, this method did not gain wide acceptance because it was
   time-consuming and complicated, for which drawings of many lines and
   points are required. We have applied a computer-assisted measurement
   system to this task and have evaluated interand intraexaminer
   reliability, showing that it is quicker to use and more accurate than
   the manual method.
   Methods. Eight board-certified spine surgeons, acting as the examiners,
   measured the sizes of the ossified lesions on nine lateral cervical
   spine radiographs using the computer-assisted measurement system.
   Following insertion of digitized radiographic image data into a
   computer, the corners of the vertebral bodies on the displayed images
   are marked by the examiners, and the software automatically sets
   reference lines and points. The examiners identify upper, lower, and
   posterior margins of the ossified lesions, and the software calculates
   the dimensions, of the ossified lesions. Data obtained from eight
   examiners for length and thickness underwent rigorous statistical
   analysis by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficients with
   95\% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine interexaminer reliability
   and Pearson's correlation coefficients between the two measurements by
   the same examiner to determine intraexaminer reliability.
   Results. The intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.927 and 0.968
   with 95\% CIs of 0.883-0.955 and 0.956-0.978 for measurements of length
   and thickness, respectively, of the ossified lesions. The Pearson's
   correlation coefficients for the two measurements by the same examiners
   were 0.943-0.985 for length and 0.957-0.991 for thickness.
   Conclusions. The inter- and intraexaminer reliability using this
   measurement system was excellent. The method can detect progression of
   ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) on plain
   radiographs with high precision and could become a standard method for
   measuring the size of OPLL.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a flexible marginal modelling approach for statistical
   inference for clustered and longitudinal data under minimal assumptions.
   This estimated estimating equations approach is semiparametric and the
   proposed models are fitted by quasi-likelihood regression, where the
   unknown marginal means are a function of the fixed effects linear
   predictor with unknown smooth link, and variance-covariance is an
   unknown smooth function of the marginal means. We propose to estimate
   the nonparametric link and variance-covariance functions via smoothing
   methods, whereas the regression parameters are obtained via the
   estimated estimating equations. These are score equations that contain
   nonparametric function estimates. The proposed estimated estimating
   equations approach is motivated by its flexibility and easy
   implementation. Moreover, if data follow a generalized linear mixed
   model, with either a specified or an unspecified distribution of random
   effects and link function, the model proposed emerges as the
   corresponding marginal (population-average) version and can be used to
   obtain inference for the fixed effects in the underlying generalized
   linear mixed model, without the need to specify any other components of
   this generalized linear mixed model. Among marginal models, the
   estimated estimating equations approach provides a flexible alternative
   to modelling with generalized estimating equations. Applications of
   estimated estimating equations include diagnostics and link selection.
   The asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimators for the model
   parameters is derived, enabling statistical inference. Practical
   illustrations include Poisson modelling of repeated epileptic seizure
   counts and simulations for clustered binomial responses.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the geometrical complexity of chaotic
   attractors in optically injected lasers by calculating the Kaplan-Yorke
   dimension (D-KY) together with the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). For
   the first time to the best of our knowledge, a color map is constructed
   indicating regions in the parameter space with high and low
   dimensionality. It is shown that as the injection power K of the master
   to the slave laser is increased to high values, the dimension of the
   attractor decreases for all ranges of the frequency detuning omega. The
   relation between the trace of the Jacobian matrix and the Kaplan-Yorke
   dimension shows that the optically injected laser is a system capable to
   span the dimension anywhere between 2 and 3. A qualitative analysis is
   finally made in order to identify the material parameters of the slave
   device for this coupled laser system for a result in the maximized
   possible dimension, leading to the need for a high electron lifetime and
   a high linewidth enhancement factor that occur at low temperature
   operation for a solitary slave semiconductor laser.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Air seeding threshold (P-a) of xylem vessels from current year growth
   rings were measured along the vertical axis of mature sugar maple trees
   (Acer saccharum Marsh.), with sampling points in primary leaf veins,
   petioles, 1-, 3-, and 7-year-old branches, large branches, the trunk and
   roots. The air seeding threshold was taken as the pressure required to
   force nitrogen gas through intervessel pit membranes. Although all
   measurements were made on wood produced in the same year, P-a varied
   between different regions of A. saccharum, with distal organs such as
   leaves and petioles having lower P-a than basal regions. Mean (SE) P-a
   ranged from 1.0 (+/- 0.1) MPa in primary leaf veins to 4.8 (+/- 0.1) MPa
   in the main trunk. Roots exhibited a P-a of 2.8 (+/- 0.2) MPa, lower
   than all other regions of the tree except leaf veins and petioles. Mean
   xylem vessel diameter increased basipetally, with the widest vessels
   occurring in the trunk and roots. Within the shoot, wider vessels had
   greater air seeding thresholds, contrasting with trends previously
   reported. However, further experimentation revealed that differences in
   P-a between regions of the stem were driven by the presence of primary
   xylem conduits, rather than differences in vessel diameter. In
   1-year-old branches, P-a was significantly lower in primary xylem
   vessels than in adjacent secondary xylem vessels. This explained the
   lower values of P-a measured in petioles and leaf veins, which possessed
   a greater ratio of primary xylem to secondary xylem than other regions.
   The difference in P-a between primary and secondary xylem was attributed
   to the greater area of primary cell wall (pit membrane) exposed in
   primary xylem conduits with helical or annular thickening.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric aerosols consist of a complex heterogeneous mixture of
   particles. Single-particle analysis techniques are known to provide
   unique information on the size-resolved chemical composition of
   aerosols. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) combined with a
   thin-window energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector enables the
   morphological and elemental analysis of single particles down to 0.1 mu
   m with a detection limit of 1 - 10 wt \%, low-Z elements included. To
   obtain data statistically representative of the air masses sampled, a
   computer-controlled procedure can be implemented in order to run
   hundreds of single-particle analyses (typically 1000-2000) automatically
   in a relatively short period of time (generally 4-8 h, depending on the
   setup and on the particle loading). However, automated particle analysis
   by SEM-EDX raises two practical challenges: the accuracy of the particle
   recognition and the reliability of the quantitative analysis, especially
   for micrometer-sized particles with low atomic number contents. Since
   low-Z analysis is hampered by the use of traditional polycarbonate
   membranes, an alternate choice of substrate is a prerequisite. In this
   work, boron is being studied as a promising material for particle
   microanalysis. As EDX is generally said to probe a volume of
   approximately 1 mu m(3), geometry effects arise from the finite size of
   microparticles. These particle geometry effects must be corrected by
   means of a robust concentration calculation procedure. Conventional
   quantitative methods developed for bulk samples generate elemental
   concentrations considerably in error when applied to microparticles. A
   new methodology for particle microanalysis, combining the use of boron
   as the substrate material and a reverse Monte Carlo quantitative
   program, was tested on standard particles ranging from 0.25 to 10 mu m.
   We demonstrate that the quantitative determination of low-Z elements in
   microparticles is achievable and that highly accurate results can be
   obtained using the automatic data processing described here compared to
   conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{The glucan that was produced by glucosyltransferases (GTFs) from
   Streptococcus mutans was examined for its stimulating functions toward
   murine peritoneal macrophages. Soluble glucan was obtained by the
   reaction with cell-free crude GTFs and sucrose, followed by ethanol
   precipitation, dispersion in water and reprecipitation by ethanol.
   Soluble glucan, those average molecular weight was about 3 x 101, was
   composed of mixture of alpha-1,6 and alpha-1,3 linkages in a 3:1 ratio.
   When 30 and 60 mu g/ml of the glucan was incubated with peritoneal
   macrophages, the lysosomal phosphatase activity was increased in a
   dose-dependant manner, indicating that soluble glucan may activate
   macrophages. To examine its effects on the various functions of
   macrophages, soluble glucan was orally administered daily at a level of
   100 mg/kg of body weight to C57BL/6 mice. Significant stimulation of the
   production of H2O2 by the macrophages was observed without any increase
   in NO production. The production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha) by the macrophages was also stimulated from 538.73-555.06
   pg/ml to 585.73-596.40 pg/ml during 15 days of oral administration of
   soluble glucan. The cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages against B16
   tumor cells was significantly enhanced by 25-38\% during 15 days of oral
   administration. These results may indicate that soluble glucan
   stimulates the immune functions of macrophages.}},

Abstract = {{Coal fly ash is a cheap and abundant industrial waste obtained from

   degrees C, and a coal fly ash dosage of 3.5 g/L. The removal
   efficiencies for 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L of phosphate under the optimal
   conditions were all over 90 \%. In addition, the coal fly ash was able
   to remove TOC (Total Organic Carbon) simultaneously with a removal
   efficiency over 85 \%. To improve the adsorption capacity of the coal
   fly ash, it was treated with chemical reagents such as HCI, NaOH, EDTA,
   and NH4HCO3. The adsorption capacity of the coal fly ash treated with 11
   M HCI was four times higher than that of raw coal fly ash. These results

Abstract = {{A novel silicon carbide (SiC) normally off lateral channel vertical
   junction field-effect transistor (LC-VJFET), namely a source-inserted
   double-gate structure with a supplementary highly doped region (SHDR),
   was proposed for achieving extremely low power losses in high-power
   switching applications. The proposed architecture was based on the
   combination of an additional source electrode inserted between two
   adjacent surface gate electrodes and a unique SHDR in the vertical
   channel region. Two-dimensional numerical simulations for the static and
   resistive switching characteristics were performed to analyze and
   optimize the SiC LC-VJFET structures for this purpose. Based on the
   simulation results, the excellent performance of the proposed structure
   was compared with optimized conventional structures with regard to total
   power losses. Finally, the proposed structure showed about a 20\%
   reduction in on-state loss (P-on) compared to the conventional
   structures, due to the effective suppression of the JFET effect.
   Furthermore, the switching loss (P-sw) of the proposed structure was
   found to be much lower than the results of the conventional structures,
   about a 75\% similar to 95\% reduction, by significantly reducing both
   input capacitance (C-iss) and reverse transfer capacitance (C-rss) of
   the device.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a reliability-based network design problem. A
   network reliability concept is embedded into the continuous network
   design problem in which travelers' route choice behavior follows the
   stochastic user equilibrium assumption. A new capacity-reliability index
   is introduced to measure the probability that all of the network links
   are operated below their capacities when serving different traffic
   patterns deviating from the average condition. The reliability-based
   network design problem is formulated as a bi-level program in which the
   lower level sub-program is the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium
   problem and the upper level sub-program is the maximization of the new
   capacity reliability index. The lower level sub-program is solved by a
   variant of the method of successive averages using the exponential
   average to represent the learning process of network users on a daily
   basis that results in the daily variation of traffic-flow pattern, and
   Monte Carlo stochastic loading. The upper level sub-program is tackled
   by means of genetic algorithms. A numerical example is used to
   demonstrate the concept of the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of CdS nanotetrahedrons, pencil-shaped nanorods,

   has been, respectively, achieved by adjusting the ratio of two solvents
   ethylenediamine and ethylene glycol under the solvothermal condition.
   None of the surfactants or other templates was needed in the process.
   The reaction time and temperature can be used as the additional means to
   control the size and morphology. By closely inspecting the growing
   process of the tetrapod structure and the crystallographic analysis of
   the products, we proposed that the lattice space match and the location
   match of ions at the interface of the zinc blende core and the wurtzite
   arms are two important structural factors to guide this furcate growth.
   Also, the anisotropic adsorption ability of ethylenediamine at the
   different surfaces of wurtzite CdS crystals results in the 1D growth of
   the arms. The possible growing mechanisms of CdS with other shapes were
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Notch signals are necessary for the functional outcomes of T cell

   metabolism. Furthermore, the trophic effects of Notch signaling were
   mediated by the pathway of phosphatidylinositol- 3- OH kinase and the
   kinase Akt, such that expression of active Akt overcame the requirement
   for Notch in beta- selection. Collectively, our results demonstrate
   involvement of Notch receptor - ligand interactions in the regulation of

Abstract = {{Seminal fluid proteins show striking effects on reproduction, involving

   seminal proteins using genomic resources in a tissue-specific study. We
   found extensive signatures of positive selection when comparing 161
   human seminal fluid proteins and 2,858 prostate-expressed genes to those
   in chimpanzee. Seven of eight outstanding genes yielded statistically
   significant evidence of positive selection when analyzed in divergent
   primates. Functional clues were gained through divergent analysis,
   including several cases of species-specific loss of function in
   copulatory plug genes, and statistically significant spatial clustering
   of positively selected sites near the active site of kallikrein 2. This
   study reveals previously unidentified positive selection in seven

   content {[}i.e., control, or modified with beet pulp (Beta vulgaris L.),

   Each diet was fed to one of eight pens of pigs according to a 2 X 4,
   full-factorial design, replicated over three time blocks with different
   groups of animals and random assignment of diets. Manure from each
   treatment was characterized and stored in a separate, ventilated, 200-L
   vessel. Repeated measurements of odor, carbon dioxide (CO2). methane
   (CM), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the vessels were taken
   every two weeks for eight weeks. Manure from high-protein diets had
   higher sulfur concentration and pH (P <= 0.05). High-NSP (beet pulp)
   diets resulted in lower manure nitrogen and ammonia concentrations and
   pH (P <= 0.05). Odor level and hedonic tone of exhaust air from the
   storage vessel headspaces were unaffected by the dietary treatments.
   Mean CO2 and CH4 emissions (1400 and 42 g d(-1) m(-3) manure,
   respectively) increased with lower dietary protein (P <= 0.05). The
   addition of xylanase to high-protein diets caused a decrease in manure
   CO2 emissions, but an increase when added to low-protein diets (P <=
   0.05). Nitrous oxide emissions were negligible. Contrary to other
   studies, these results do not support the use of dietary protein
   reduction to reduce emissions from stored swine manure.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Labor analgesia with the combined spinal epidural approach
   has been associated with maternal hypotension and fetal heart rate (FHR)

   Methods: In a prospective double blind trial, 100 healthy patients with
   term singletons received intramuscular ephedrine 25 mg or placebo by
   random allocation before combined spinal opidural. During the first hour
   after analgesia, maternal heart rate, blood pressure, and need for

   Results: Prophylactic ephedrine reduced the incidence of maternal
   hypotension after combined spinal epidural (P < .007). In controls,
   there was a significant increase in the incidence and frequency of late
   decelerations in the hour following combined spinal epidural compared
   with the previous hour (P < .005 and P < .01). Compared with controls,
   there was an increased incidence of fetal tachycardia in patients who
   received prophylactic ephedrine (P < .006), which was associated with
   increased FHR reactivity (P < .03).
   Conclusion: Although prophylactic ephedrine prevents maternal
   hypotension and fetal late decelerations, it is associated with fetal
   tachycardia, The value of prophylactic ephedrine at combined spinal
   epidural should be weighed against potential changes in fetal heart rate
   patterns.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of hcp Gd was calculated from first
   principles using the full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method. It
   was found that the principal contributions to the MAE are the
   dipole-dipole interaction between the localized 4f spins and the
   spin-orbit interaction of the valence band states. The dipole
   contribution has the form 1/2K(1)(d)(1-cos 2 theta), where theta is the
   angle between the magnetization direction and the c axis. The
   contribution of the spin-orbit interaction is shown to arise from the
   polarization of the conduction band that becomes exchange split due to
   exchange interaction with the localized 4f electrons. We argue that this
   leads to significant contributions from higher order anisotropy
   constants. An imposed reduced 4f moment leads to a repopulation of the
   electronic states at the Fermi level and a reduced exchange splitting of
   the valence states, which we demonstrate leads to a modification of the
   MAE. This modification is in qualitative agreement with the observed
   temperature dependence of the MAE. In addition, the dependence of the
   MAE on the c/a ratio has been studied.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to identify patterns of diversity in a below-ground community
   of microarthropods (mites and Collembola) after 15 months of a nutrient
   (calcium and nitrogen) manipulation experiment, located at the Natural
   Environment Research Council (NERC) Soil Biodiversity Site in Scotland,
   UK. We found that microarthropod densities increased with elevated soil
   fertility, but we detected no concurrent change in the diversity of soil
   microarthropods (mites and Collembola combined). That microarthropod
   density increased concurrently with improvements in soil fertility and
   plant productivity suggests that soil microarthropod communities are
   predominately regulated by bottom-up forces, driven by increased energy
   transfer via plant inputs to soil, providing increased food resources
   for fauna. However, that we found no concurrent change in the diversity
   of soil microarthropods provides little support for the idea that the
   diversity of soil fauna is positively related to their population
   density, primary productivity or improvements in soil conditions
   resulting from nutrient manipulations. However, we did find that
   microarthropod communities of more fertile sites contained a greater
   proportion of predators suggesting that more energy was transferred to
   higher trophic levels under elevated soil fertility. Our findings
   suggest that unlike plant communities, soil faunal diversity may not be
   strongly regulated by competition in productive situations, since
   competitive exclusion might not occur due to increased predation. Whilst
   we conclude that soil microarthropod diversity at our study site has not
   been affected by the nutrient additions to date, in the longer term we
   predict that changes in community composition and diversity could arise,
   most likely through top-down regulation of the soil food web. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{In comparative studies using model organisms, extant taxa are often
   referred to as basal. The term suggests that such taxa are descendants
   of lineages that diverged early in the history of some larger taxon. By
   this usage, the basal metazoans comprise just four phyla (Placozoa,
   Porifera, Cnidaria, and Cten-ophora) and the large clade Bilateria. We
   advise against this practice because basal refers to a region at the
   base or root of a phylogenetic tree. Thus, referring to an extant taxon
   or species as basal, or as more basal than another, can be misleading.
   While much progress has been made toward understanding some of the
   phylogenetic relationships within these groups, the relationships among
   them are still largely not known with certainty. Thus, sound inferences
   from comparative studies of model organisms demand continued
   illumination of phylogeny. Hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying
   metazoan evolution can be drawn from the study of model organisms in
   Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Placozoa, and Porifera, but it is clear that these
   model organisms are likely to be derived in many respects. Therefore,
   testing these hypotheses requires the study of yet additional model
   organisms. The most effective tests are those that investigate model
   organisms with phylogenetic positions among two sister groups comprising
   a larger clade of interest.}},

Abstract = {{The neural mechanisms underlying the sense of joint position and
   movement remain controversial. While cutaneous receptors are known to
   contribute to kinesthesia for the fingers, the present experiments test
   the hypothesis that they contribute at other major joints. Illusory
   movements were evoked at the interphalangeal (IP) joints of the index
   finger, the elbow, and the knee by stimulation of populations of
   cutaneous and muscle spindle receptors, both separately and together.
   Subjects matched perceived movements with voluntary movements of
   homologous joints on the contralateral side. Cutaneous receptors were
   activated by stretch of the skin (using 2 intensities of stretch) and
   vibration activated muscle spindle receptors. Stimuli were designed to
   activate receptors that discharge during joint flexion. For the index
   finger, vibration was applied over the extensor tendons on the dorsum of
   the hand, to evoke illusory metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion, and
   skin stretch was delivered around the IP joints. The strong skin stretch
   evoked the illusion of flexion of the proximal IP joint in 6/8 subjects
   (12 +/- 5 degrees, mean +/- SE). For the group, strong skin stretch
   delivered during vibration increased the perceived flexion of the
   proximal IP joint by eight times with a concomitant decrease in
   perceived flexion of the MCP joint compared with vibration alone (P <
   0.05). For the elbow, vibration was applied over the distal tendon of
   triceps brachii and skin stretch over the dorsal forearm. When delivered
   alone, strong skin stretch evoked illusory elbow flexion in 5/10
   subjects (9 +/- 4 degrees). Simultaneous strong skin stretch and
   vibration increased the illusory elbow flexion for the group by 1.5
   times compared with vibration (P < 0.05). For the knee, vibration was
   applied over the patellar tendon and skin stretch over the thigh. Skin
   stretch alone evoked illusory knee flexion in 3/10 subjects (8 +/- 4
   degrees) and when delivered during vibration, perceived knee flexion
   increased for the group by 1.4 times compared with vibration (P < 0.05).
   Hence inputs from cutaneous receptors, muscle receptors, and combined
   inputs from both receptors likely subserve kinesthesia at joints
   throughout the body.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Data on periodontal conditions in adolescents in the
   Dominican Republic are scarce. The aim of the present cross-sectional
   study was to estimate the prevalence of periodontal attachment loss
   among Dominican adolescents. This study did not attempt to classify the
   disease into aggressive and chronic periodontitis.
   Methods: A random sample of 2,007 Dominican adolescents was obtained. A
   probability, weighted sample was selected using a complex, multi-stage
   probability sampling design. The study was clustered in 26 schools and
   106 classes. The study subjects were clinically examined under field
   conditions by a single calibrated examiner who measured gingival
   recession and probing depth at six sites per tooth, with subsequent
   calculation of clinical periodontal attachment level for each site.
   Results: The prevalence of clinical attachment loss >= 1 mm was 49.5\%,
   with the prevalence ranging between 48.7\% and 50.2\%, depending on age
   and gender. Clinical attachment loss >= 2 mm was found in 15\% of the
   students and attachment loss >= 3 mm in 4.0\% of the students. Logistic
   regression model revealed that only age significantly increased the
   probability of having clinical attachment loss.
   Conclusion: We conclude that clinical attachment loss is common in
   adolescents in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, suggesting the
   necessity for improved standards of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
   of these lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Living organisms experience constant threats that challenge their genome
   stability. The DNA damage checkpoint pathway coordinates cell cycle
   progression with DNA repair when DNA is damaged, thus ensuring faithful
   transmission of the genome. The spindle assembly checkpoint inhibits
   chromosome segregation until all chromosomes are properly attached to
   the spindle, ensuring accurate partition of the genetic material. Both
   the DNA damage and spindle checkpoint pathways participate in genome
   integrity. However, no clear connection between these two pathways has
   been described. Here, we analyze mutants in the BRCT domains of fission
   yeast Crb2, which mediates Chk1 activation, and provide evidence for a
   novel function of the Chk1 pathway. When the Crb2 mutants experience
   damaged replication forks upon inhibition of the religation activity of
   topoisomerase 1, the Chk1. DNA damage pathway induces sustained
   activation of the spindle checkpoint, which in turn delays
   metaphase-to-anaphase transition in a Mad2-dependent fashion. This new
   pathway enhances cell survival and genome stability when cells undergo
   replicative stress in the absence of a proficient G(2)/M DNA damage
   checkpoint.}},

Abstract = {{Domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin and glutamate analog produced by
   certain species of the marine diatom Pseudonitzschia, is responsible for
   several human and wildlife intoxication events. The toxin
   characteristically damages the hippocampus in exposed humans, rodents,
   and marine mammals. Histochemical studies have identified this, and
   other regions of neurodegeneration, though none have sought to map all
   brain regions affected by domoic acid. In this study, mice exposed
   (i.p.) to 4 mg/kg domoic acid for 72 h exhibited behavioral and
   pathological signs of neurotoxicity. Brains were fixed by intracardial
   perfusion and processed for histochemical analysis. Serial coronal
   sections (50 mu m) were stained using the degeneration-sensitive cupric
   silver staining method of DeOlmos. Degenerated axons, terminals, and
   cell bodies, which stained black, were identified and the areas of
   degeneration were mapped onto Paxinos mouse atlas brain plates using
   Adobe Illustrator CS (TM). The plates were then combined to reconstruct
   a 3-dimensional image of domoic acid-induced neurodegeneration using
   Amira 3.1 (TM) software. Affected regions included the olfactory bulb,
   septal area, and limbic system. These findings are consistent with
   behavioral and pathological studies demonstrating the effects of domoic
   acid on cognitive function and neurodegeneration in rodents. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Purpose. To assess the feasibility, efficacy and toxicity of
   fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in the treatment of recurrent
   glioblastoma multiforme.
   Patients and Methods. From January 1995 to July 2003, 53 patients with
   histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme were treated at recurrence
   with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy. A median dose of 36 Gy
   using a median fractionation of 5 x 2 Gy/week was applied.
   Results. Median overall survival was 21 months, and median overall
   survival from the time point of re-irradiation was 8 months. The median
   time interval between primary and secondary radiation therapy was 10
   months. In this patient population, no variables predicting longer
   overall survival could be determined. However, neurosurgical resection
   at relapse was associated with increased survival after re-irradiation
   (p=0.04), but left progression-free survival unaltered. Treatment was
   well-tolerated and no severe toxicities developed.
   Conclusion. Stereotactically guided fractionated re-irradiation is a
   safe and effective treatment modality in selected cases of recurring
   glioblastoma multiforme. Since this is not a randomized study, further
   evaluation in larger patient collectives is warranted. Also, based on
   recent results of radiochemotherapy in the treatment of primary
   glioblastoma multiforme, concomitant chemotherapy at relapse might be
   considered in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that persists
   in the body for life after primary infection. The primary site of EBV
   persistence is the memory B lymphocyte, but whether the virus initially
   infects naive or memory B cells is still disputed. We have analyzed EBV
   infection in nine cases of X-linked hyper-immunoglobulin M (hyper-IgM)
   syndrome who, due to a mutation in CD40 ligand gene, do not have a
   classical, class-switched memory B-cell population (IgD(-) CD27(+)). We
   found evidence of EBV infection in 67\% of cases, which is similar to
   the infection rate found in the general United Kingdom population (60 to
   70\% for the relevant age range). We detected EBV DNA in peripheral
   blood B cells and showed in one case that the infection was restricted
   to the small population of nonclassical, germinal center-independent
   memory B cells (IgD(+) CD27(+)). Detection of EBV small RNAs, latent
   membrane protein 2, and EBV nuclear antigen 3C expression in peripheral
   blood suggests full latent viral gene expression in this population.
   Analysis of EBV DNA in serial samples showed variability over time,
   suggesting cycles of infection and loss. Our results demonstrate that
   short-term EBV persistence can occur in the absence of a germinal center
   reaction and a classical memory B-cell population.}},

Abstract = {{An antisense strategy by targeting both bcr3/abl2 and VEGF was designed
   to suppress the growth of Philadephia(1) leukemia cells in vitro and in
   vivo in mice. In vitro, although bcr3/abl2 or VEGF antisense
   oligodeoxyribonucleotides (AS-ODNs) alone was able to inhibit the
   proliferation of K562 cells, the combination of bcr3/abl2 and VEGF
   AS-ODNs produced an additive inhibitory effect on the growth of K562
   cells and significantly enhanced the sensibility of K562 cells to
   apoptosis-inducing stimuli including STI571. In vivo, the nude mice
   xenografted with K562 cells received intratumoral injections of
   bcr3/abl2 and VEGF AS-ODNs showed a significant reduction in leukemia
   tumor size and microvessel density and an increase of apoptosis in the
   tumors when compared to the mice that received an individual agent.
   These results demonstrate that targeting both bcr3/abl2 and VEGF can
   result in an additive tumor-suppressive action and may represent an
   excellent strategy to augment the efficacy of chemotherapy in CML.}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Dietary sitostanol has a hypocholesterolemic effect because it decreases
   the absorption of cholesterol. However, its effects on the sitostanol
   concentrations in the blood and tissues are relatively unknown,
   especially in patients with sitosterolemia and xanthomatosis. These
   patients hyperabsorb all sterols and fail to excrete ingested sitosterol
   and other plant sterols as normal people do. The goal of the present
   study was to examine the absorbability of dietary sitostanol in humans
   and animals and its potential long-term effect. Two patients with
   sitosterolemia were fed the margarine Benecol (McNeill Nutritionals, Ft.
   Washington, PA), which is enriched in sitostanol and campestanol, for
   7-18 wk. Their plasma cholesterol levels decreased from 180 to 167 mg/dL
   and 153 to 113 mg/dL, respectively. Campesterol and sitosterol also
   decreased. However, their plasma sitostanol levels increased from 1.6 to
   10.1 mg/dL and from 2.8 to 7.9 mg/dL, respectively. Plasma campestanol
   also increased. After Benecol withdrawal, the decline in plasma of both
   sitostanol and campestanol was very sluggish. In an animal study, two
   groups of rats were fed high-cholesterol diets with and without
   sitostanol for 4 wk. As expected, plasma and liver cholesterol levels
   decreased 18 and 53\%, respectively. The sitostanol in plasma increased
   fourfold, and sitostanol increased threefold in skeletal muscle and
   twofold in heart muscle. Campestanol also increased significantly in

Abstract = {{Higher level thought involves both critical and creative thinking
   skills. Although the psychological literature is rich with research on
   teaching critical thinking, relatively little published work addresses
   ways of promoting creative thinking. In this article we describe the use
   of poetry writing in an abnormal psychology class to encourage creative
   exploration and informed empathy. Content analyses suggested that the
   majority of students' poems communicated both accurate information and
   empathy. Furthermore, most students described the poetry assignment as a
   positive learning experience. Two examples demonstrate creative ways
   students' poems can distill and communicate information.}},

   following an authority's explicit command to make that choice. Results

Abstract = {{A survey has been carried out in Leeds, England, in the west Yorkshire
   industrial heartland, and in neighboring York, surrounded by
   agriculture, of melanic frequency in the moth species Biston betularia,
   Odontoptera bidentata, and Apamea crenata. All show a decline in
   melanics in the postindustrial environment, the first over almost the
   full range from nearly 100\% to less that 10\%, the others to smaller
   extents. Changes in several species over as great a magnitude and as
   wide an area must result from selection. The results are compared with
   others along a transect through northern England. The onset of response
   is progressively later from west to east. The rate of decline is lower
   at the extremes of the transect to west and east than it is in the
   center. We still do not have a clear picture of the causes of the
   changes. One major factor is likely to be selective predation, which is
   shown to be critically dependent on predation rate. As a consequence,
   differences in settling behavior between the species could account for
   different responses even if the species are attacked by the same

Abstract = {{Pseudo-stem from Musa acuminata Colla, var. cavendish was studied for
   its possible use as a source of pulp fibres. The chemical composition,
   i.e. the hollocellulose (60\%) and the low lignin content (12\%),
   encouraged its potential use in papermaking applications. A systematic
   study was conducted, aiming at fibre's characterisation and
   investigation of the physical and mechanical properties of the virgin
   pulps, as well as of those arising from two different blends (with
   eucalyptus and pine fibres). Pulping was carried out by soda, kraft and
   soda-anthraquinone cooking processes. The pulps obtained were
   fractionated and the morphology was determined in terms of fibre lengths
   and diameter of both global and fractionated fibres. It was revealed
   that the pulp contained a high amount of short fibres (70\% of the
   fibres, w/w \%, lengths less than 0.5 mm), alongwith fibres with a wide
   distribution of lengths (0.20-4.19 mm). Isotropic handsheets from
   unrefined pulps - were made and their physical and mechanical properties
   investigated. Scanning electron microscopy showed a fibrillation
   phenomenon. Finally, these fibres showed interesting potentialities in
   terms of burst index and breaking length, both when used alone or in
   combination with other common pulps.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous research suggests early postpartum fatigue (PPF)
   plays a significant role in the development of postpartum depression
   (PPD). Predicting risk for PPD via early identification of PPF may
   provide opportunity for intervention.
   Objective: To replicate and extend previous studies concerning the
   impact of PPF on symptoms of PPD and to describe the relationships among
   PPF, PPD, and other variables using the theory of unpleasant symptoms.
   Design: Correlational, longitudinal study.
   Setting: Participants' homes.
   Participants: Convenience sample of 42 community-dwelling women
   recruited before 36 weeks of pregnancy.
   Main Outcome Measures: PPF, depressive symptoms, and stress measured
   during prenatal weeks 36 to 38, and on Days 7, 14, and 28 after
   childbirth. Salivary cortisol was measured as a physiological marker of
   stress.
   Results: Significant correlations were obtained between PPF and symptoms
   of PPD on Days 7, 14, and 28, with Day 14 PPF levels predicting future
   development of PPD symptoms in 10 of 11 women. Perceived stress, but not
   cortisol, was also correlated with symptoms of PPD on Days 7, 14, and
   28. Women with a history of depression had elevated depression scores
   compared to women without, but no variable was as effective at
   predicting PPD as PPF.
   Conclusions: Fatigue by Day 14 postpartum was the most predictive
   variable for symptoms of PPD on Day 28 in this population.}},

Abstract = {{The rationale for the acute vasodilator test in idiopathic pulmonary
   arterial hypertension (IPAH) is to identify patients who have a
   vasoreactive component that justifies the use of non-selective
   vasodilators. We tested the ability of two different response criteria
   to identify such patients studying 34 patients with IPAH. The
   hemodynamic data from the right heart catheterization were collected at
   baseline and post-administration of inhaled nitric oxide. We describe
   the results obtained by two different response criteria: (A) a 20\%
   decrease in indexed pulmonary vascular resistance (PVRi) and in mean
   pulmonary artery pressure(PAPm)(classic criterion); (13) a fall in PAPm
   of at least 10 mm Hg to a pressure level of 40 mm Hg or lower(revised
   criterion).
   Patients who responded according to the revised criterion showed a
   higher cardiac index (CI) (3.45 +/- 1.94 vs. 1.99 +/- 0.44 L/min/m(2) p
   = 0.05) and lower PVRi (1247 +/- 746 vs. 2437 +/- 1105 dyn cm(-5) S
   m(2); p = 0.02) compared to non-responders. Responders according to the
   classic criterion had a statistically significant lower Cl (1.59 +/-
   0.40 vs. 2.43 +/- 1.14 L/min/m(2); p = 0.03) and higher PVRI (3130 +/-
   1173 vs. 1958 +/- 980 dyn cm(-5) s m(2); p = 0.04) also compared to
   non-responders.
   We conclude that the revised criterion seems to reflect the degree of
   vascular remodeling more accurately, identifying patients with better
   preserved cardiac function, possibly in an earlier phase of the disease.

Abstract = {{We consider linear multistage detectors with universal (large system)
   weighting for synchronous code-division multiple access (CDMA) in
   multipath fading channels with many users. A convenient choice of the
   basis of the projection subspace allows a joint projection of all users.
   Taking advantage of this property, the complexity per bit of multistage
   detectors with universal weights scales linearly with the number of
   users on the uplink CDMA channel, while other known multistage detectors
   with universal weights and different bases of the projection subspace
   keep the same quadratic complexity order per bit as the linear minimum
   mean-square error (LMMSE) detector. We focus on the design of two kinds
   of detectors with linear complexity. The detector of Type I is obtained
   as an asymptotic approximation of the polynomial expansion detector
   proposed by Moshavi et al. The detector of Type II has the same
   performance as the multistage Wiener filter (MSWF) in large systems.
   Additionally, general performance expressions for large systems,
   applicable to any multistage detector with the same basis of the
   projection subspace (e.g., linear parallel interference canceling
   detectors), are derived. As a by-product, the performance analysis
   disproves the widespread belief that the MSWF and the polynomial
   expansion detector are equivalent. We show that, in general, the MSWF
   outperforms the latter one and they are equivalent only asymptotically
   in the case of equal received powers.}},

Abstract = {{NKG2D is an activation receptor that allows natural killer (NK) cells to
   detect diseased host cells. The engagement of NKG2D with corresponding
   ligand results in surface modulation of the receptor and reduced
   function upon subsequent receptor engagement. However, it is not clear
   whether in addition to modulation the NKG2D receptor complex and/or its
   signaling capacity is preserved. We show here that the prolonged
   encounter with tumor cell-bound, but not soluble, ligand can completely
   uncouple the NKG2D receptor from the intracellular mobilization of
   calcium and the exertion of cell-mediated cytolysis. However, cytolytic
   effector function is intact since NKG2D ligand-exposed NK cells can be
   activated via the Ly49D receptor. While NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity is
   impaired, prolonged ligand exposure results in constitutive interferon
   gamma (IFN gamma) production, suggesting sustained signaling. The
   functional changes are associated with a reduced presence of the
   relevant signal transducing adaptors DNAX-activating protein of 10 kDa
   (DAP-10) and killer cell activating receptor-associated
   protein/DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (KARAP/DAP-12). That is likely
   the consequence of constitutive NKG2D engagement and signaling, since
   NKG2D function and adaptor expression is restored to normal when the
   stimulating tumor cells are removed. Thus, the chronic exposure to tumor
   cells expressing NKG2D ligand alters NKG2D signaling and may facilitate
   the evasion of tumor cells from NK cell reactions.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, thromboxane (TX) A(2) signals through two receptor isoforms,
   thromboxane receptor (TP)alpha and TP beta, which are transcriptionally
   regulated by distinct promoters, Prm1 and Prm3, respectively, within the
   single TP gene. The aim of the current study was to investigate the
   ability of the endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
   (PPAR)gamma ligand 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2))
   to regulate expression of the human TP gene and to ascertain its
   potential effects on the individual TP alpha and TP beta isoforms.
   15d-PGJ(2) suppressed Prm3 transcriptional activity and TP beta mRNA
   expression in the platelet progenitor megakaryocytic human
   erythroleukemia (HEL) 92.1.7 cell line but had no effect on Prm1 or Prm2
   activity or on TP alpha mRNA expression. 15d-PGJ(2) also resulted in
   reductions in the overall level of TP protein expression and TP-mediated
   intracellular calcium mobilization in HEL cells. 15d-PGJ(2) suppression
   of Prm3 transcriptional activity and TP beta mRNA expression was found
   to occur through a novel mechanism involving direct binding of PPAR
   gamma-retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers to a PPAR gamma
   response element (PPRE) composed of two imperfect hexameric direct
   repeat (DR) sequences centred at -159 and -148, respectively, spaced by
   five nucleotides (DR5). These data provide direct evidence for the role
   of PPAR gamma in the regulation of human TP gene expression within the
   vasculature and point to further critical differences in the modes of
   transcriptional regulation of TP alpha and TP beta in humans. Moreover,
   these data highlight a further link between enhanced risk of
   cardiovascular disease in diabetes mellitus associated with increased
   synthesis and action of thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)).}},

Abstract = {{Academic Pathology is a key player in human molecular science and in the
   powerful initiatives of the National Institutes of Health. Pathologists
   generate data crucial to virtually every molecular study of human
   tissue, and have the necessary skills and authority to oversee
   processing of human tissues for research analysis. We advocate that
   Academic Pathology is optimally positioned to drive the molecular
   revolution in study of human disease, through human tissue collection,
   analysis, and databasing. This can be achieved through playing a major
   role in human tissue procurement and management; establishing
   high-quality `Pathology Resource Laboratories'; providing the scientific
   expertise for pathology data sharing; and recruiting and training
   physician scientists. Pathology should position itself to be the local
   institutional driver of technology implementation and development, by
   operating the resource laboratories, providing the expertise for
   technical and conceptual design of research projects, maintaining the
   databases that link molecular and morphological information on human
   tissues with the requisite clinical databases, providing education and
   mentorship of technology users, and nurturing new research through the
   development of preliminary data. We also consider that outstanding
   pathology journals are available for the publication of research
   emanating from such studies, to the benefit of the pathology profession
   as an academic enterprise. It is our earnest hope that Academic
   Pathology can play a leading role in the remarkable advances to be made
   as the 21st century unfolds.}},

   clarkii. Despite the presence of alternative food (vegetation and leaf
   litter), embryo survival in the presence of P. clarkii was low for all
   species except Bufo bufo. However, newly hatched B. bufo tadpoles were
   readily consumed. P. clarkii reduced larval survival in all species,
   with those species that in nature have few contacts with predators at
   the larval stage suffering the highest mortalities. Most larvae reduced
   their activity and/or altered microhabitat use in the presence of P.

Abstract = {{Background The identification of novel proteins displaying cytostatic
   and/or cytotoxic actions that could eventually be used for gene therapy
   is a major issue in cancer research. Data from the literature suggested
   that the immediate-early ICP0 protein from herpes simplex virus type 1
   (HSV-1) could fulfill these properties as it had been observed that this
   protein is involved in arrest of cell growth at the G1/S and G2/M phases
   of the cell cycle and that deletion of ICP0 from HSV-1 or
   HSV-1-recombinant vectors significantly reduced their cytotoxicity. The
   molecular basis of its action is likely related to the ability of ICP0,
   which possesses E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, to target destruction of
   key cellular proteins, including centromeric proteins, resulting in
   abnormal chromosome segregation, unusual cytokinesis, and emergence of
   nuclear morphological aberrations. However, neither the gene therapy
   potential of ICP0 on its own nor its action on primary quiescent cells
   has been assessed to date. The aim of this work was therefore to
   evaluate the antiproliferative and cytotoxic properties of ICP0 on a
   human glioblastoma cell line and on quiescent primary cells, and to
   explore whether this protein has a potential for gene therapy of cancer.
   Methods HSV-1-based amplicon particles were generated following a
   recently described method that produces relatively high titers of vector
   stocks that are essentially free of helper virus. These vectors express
   either wild-type ICP0 or FXE a RING finger mutated inactive form of ICP0
   together with reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP). The vectors were
   used to infect Gli36 cells, which derive from a human glioblastome, and
   cultured rat primary cardiomyocytes and brain cells, two
   well-established models of non-dividing cells. Expression and
   localization of ICP0 and FXE, as well as their action on centromeres and
   nuclear morphology, were evaluated by Western blotting, indirect immune
   fluorescence, and confocal microscopy using specific antibodies and DAPI
   labeling. The impact of ICP0 on cell growth, toxicity, and viability was
   evaluated in the different cells using a variety of methods, including
   FACS analysis after propidium iodide and AnnexinV staining, crystal
   violet staining, clonogenic capability, caspase 3 activation, MTT tests,
   and release of lactate dehydrogenase, after infection with the different
   vectors.
   Results The three cell types under study showed high levels of
   transduction by amplicons and strong expression of GFP, ICP0, and FXE
   transgenic proteins. Wild-type ICP0, but not FXE, induced centromeric
   disruption, appearance of micronuclei, arrest of proliferation, and
   significant cell death in glioblastoma Gli36 cells. In contrast, neither
   micronuclei formation nor any other sign of cell toxicity could be
   observed in cultured primary cardiomyoctes or brain cells, as evaluated
   by MTT tests and crystal violet staining. Furthermore, in the case of
   cardiomyocytes, expression of ICP0 did not interfere with beating as
   cells continued to beat at the same frequency as non-infected cells for
   several days post-infection. Neither AnnexinV early staining nor caspase
   3 activation was observed in dying infected Gli36 cells, suggesting that
   these cells were not entering apoptosis. In contrast, release of lactate
   dehydrogenase by infected Gli36 cells suggested a necrotic way of death.
   Conclusions ICP0 induced a strong cytostatic action followed by
   significant cell death on the glioblastoma Gli36 cell line. In contrast,
   neither cell death nor any other evidence of ICP0-induced toxicity
   affecting major physiological parameters was observed in primary
   cultured cardiomyoctes and brain cells, two models of primary
   non-cycling cells. These results suggest that ICP0 has gene therapy
   potential and could represent the first member of a novel family of
   directly acting proteins that could be used to treat cancers. Copyright

Abstract = {{A novel method for positioning of InAs islands on GaAs (110) by cleaved
   edge overgrowth is reported. The first growth sample contains strained
   InxGa1-xAs/GaAs superlattice (SL) of varying indium fraction, which acts
   as a strain nanopattern for the cleaved-edge overgrowth. Atoms incident
   on the cleaved edge will preferentially migrate to InGaAs regions where
   favorable bonding sites are available. By this method InAs island chains
   with lateral periodicity defined by the thickness of InGaAs and GaAs of
   SL have been realized by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). They are observed
   by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM). The strain nanopattern's
   effect is studied by the different indium fraction of SL and MBE growth
   conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal crystallization of lidocaine (LC) in supersaturated
   LC/DuroTak (R) 87-2287 (DT2287) polyacrylate pressure sensitive adhesive
   (PSA) systems has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC). It was found that crystallization of LC in supersaturated
   LC/DT2287 systems was governed by the nucleation process, which in turn
   was dependent on temperature and composition of the systems. A critical
   temperature T-crit was found at similar to 26 degrees C, above which the
   crystallization of LC in LC/DT2287 systems becomes slow. The lack of
   dependence of T-crit on the composition of the mixtures indicates that
   the presence of the PSA affected the kinetics (diffusion) rather than
   the thermodynamics of the nucleation process. A critical degree of
   saturation S-crit of similar to 4 was also found, above which the
   nucleation rate sharply increases. Kinetic analysis based on the
   classical theory of nucleation indicates that nucleation of LC in the
   PSA medium is a diffusion-controlled process. The activation energy of
   crystallization had a two-phase dependence on temperature suggesting
   that the mechanism of crystallization may change at the transition
   temperatures. As the weight fraction of LC increased in the systems, the
   activation energy of crystallization, Delta G(c), was minimal at similar
   to 15 degrees C, indicating that the nucleation of LC in the LC/DT2287
   systems is at its fastest rate around this temperature. These
   fundamental analyses of nucleation and crystallization mechanisms are of
   practical significance in the design of supersaturated drug delivery
   systems. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists

Abstract = {{Background: Paracetamol is an extensively used. analgesic and
   antipyretic. Allergy to this drug is occasionally reported and is
   usually moderate.
   Materials and methods: We led a retrospective study of 119 cases of
   allergic reactions to paracetamol notified to the Tunisian centre of
   pharmacovigilance, between September 1990 and September 2000. These
   cases were validated according to the method of imputability of Begaud
   et al.
   Results: Our population comprised 64 women and 55 men, aged 1 month to
   70 years. Antecedents of allergy or atopy were found in many cases,
   including 10 cases of allergy to paracetamol and 6 to salicylates.
   Paracetamol was self-administered in 50\% of cases and taken with other
   drugs in 68\% of cases. The type of lesions varied, the most frequent
   being urticaria (34.4\%), macular and pustular eruption (30.2\%) and
   fixed drug eruption (12.6\%). Some reactions were serious, such as Lyell
   syndrome or anaphylactic shock. Resolution was favourable in all cases
   and paracetamol was definitively contraindicated for patients with
   scores of high or mild imputability.
   Conclusion: Allergy to paracetamol seems to be rare but not exceptional.
   Several risk factors seem to be important in triggering this side
   effect, particularly antecedents of allergy to this drug or to aspirin.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain hares (Lepus timidus) show high site fidelity even though they
   are non-territorial and sometimes make long excursions to new areas
   outside their home range. This study investigates how far apart
   consecutive annual and seasonal home ranges of the same individual are
   situated, how much they overlap and if habitat preference can explain
   the observed high site fidelity. The results show that hares usually
   overlap their previous home range, both between seasons and years,
   although the seasonal overlap is smaller, indicating that hares show a
   more pronounced change of areas between seasons than between years. The
   seasonal habitat selection was very distinct, tracking changing resource
   availability between seasons, while the annual selection was difficult
   to interpret as it mixed the seasonal patterns. Consequently, the annual
   selection seems to be merely an artefact from the more important
   seasonal selection. I therefore caution that results from habitat
   selection studies based on annual home ranges that are estimated from
   animals in seasonally differing environments should be treated with
   care. It appears that while seasonal home ranges are selected on the
   basis of resource availability, there is sufficient variation in the
   strength of this response to suggest that a mountain hare's local
   knowledge of an area could also explain fidelity to their annual home
   ranges.}},

Abstract = {{To gain insight into the role of luxS(Hi) in disease pathogenesis, we
   inactivated that gene in several non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae
   isolates with an antibiotic resistance cassette. Gene inactivation was
   confirmed by PCR and by Southern blot analysis in each strain. Culture
   filtrates from luxS(Hi) mutants contained a decreased amount of
   autoinducer-2 (AI-2) activity in comparison to the wild-type isolates
   using the Vibrio harveyi BB 170 bioassay. Culture filtrates from
   Escherichia coli strain DH5 alpha expressing a cloned luxS(Hi) contained
   350-fold more AI-2 activity per cell than E. coli DH5 alpha containing
   the vector alone. The growth rate in several liquid media, and the cell
   density after overnight growth were not significantly different between
   the parents and the luxS(Hi) mutants. Two clinical H. influenzae and
   their luxS(Hi) mutants produced an identical biofilm in a flow system.
   Invasion Of human cells by the luxS(Hi) mutants, in comparison to the
   wild-type parents was strain-dependent, and cell type-dependent, but the
   luxS(Hi) Mutants tended to be more invasive. The luxS(Hi) mutant of an
   otitis media isolate, strain R3157 appeared more virulent in the
   chinchilla model of otitis media: there were more bacteria in the middle
   ear, a greater inflammatory response and more goblet cell hyperplasia 10
   days after the inoculation. We conclude that the H. influenzae homologue
   of luxS modulates certain virulence traits. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Germany was the first country to issue a categorical refusal to support
   the US-led war in Iraq. Some have interpreted this as the result of a
   clash between the strategic cultures of Germany and the USA, others as a
   sign that a more nationalistic and assertive Germany is emerging. This
   article explains the apparently contradictory aspects of Germany's
   stance on Iraq by identifying two competing strands within Germany's
   strategic culture. It concludes that the German refusal signals neither
   a reversion to a pacifist stance nor that Germany is in a process of
   shedding the bonds and alliances that have so far framed the reunified
   Germany's military policy. Iraq simply showed that Germany, like most
   other countries, has conditions that have to be met - in Germany's case,
   conditions flowing from the coexistence of two competing schools of
   thought within Germany's strategic culture.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an overview of CT-Urography. With the advent of
   multislice CT scanners and the evolution of image processing methods
   this technique now affords optimal urographic images comparable to those
   obtained with conventional techniques.
   We describe the acquisition techniques and protocols used by the various
   authors. Effective radiation dose has conditioned the use of
   CT-Urography so that the tendency today is to reduce the number of scans
   by performing, after the nonenhanced scan, a single contrast-enhanced
   scan comprising both the nephrographic and urographic phase.
   With the use of multislice CT the quality of the urogram improves with
   the number of slices. We illustrate a variety of processing techniques,
   multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), maximum (MIP) and average intensity
   projection (AIP) and volume rendering (VR) and present a series of upper
   urinary tract tumours testifying to the superiority of the AIP technique
   over MIR We then review the results of comparative studies of
   CT-Urography with conventional urography in upper urinary tract
   diagnostics.
   Finally, we describe the advantages and limitations of CT-Urography.}},

Abstract = {{Two salt marsh cores were collected from the Venice Lagoon, Italy, and
   analysed for PCDD/Fs. The samples were undisturbed and had an
   approximately constant accumulation rate. Radiochemical chronologies
   were established for the different core sections. The PCDD/F pattern in
   the surficial layers was very similar to that of atmospheric deposition
   measured in the same area. However, the pattern changed with increasing
   depth and was very different in the deeper sections, where the highest
   PCDD/F concentrations were measured. This layer was dated around the
   1950s. Deeper layers have a profile similar to the surficial one.
   Undisturbed salt marsh cores appear to be a reliable tool for the
   reconstruction of temporal trends in the atmospheric deposition of
   persistent organic pollutants. It is proposed that the trends in the
   core reflect atmospheric deposition that probably results from the sum
   of two different contributions: emissions of the industrial district of
   Porto Marghera on the edge of the lagoon and the regional background.

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Posterior cortex epilepsies (PCEs) encompass a group of
   epilepsies originating from the occipital, parietal, or occipital border
   of the temporal lobe, or from any combination of these regions. When
   their seizures are refractory to pharmacologic treatment, these patients
   are usually referred for surgery. The aim of our study was to analyze
   clinical characteristics of all PCE patients referred for surgery from
   1994 to 2003, and to search for predictors of surgical outcome.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and
   laboratory data from 81 consecutive refractory PCE patients referred for
   surgery. Surgical and nonsurgical groups of patients were compared, and
   detailed analyses of all variables of the surgical cases were performed
   in the search for predictors of seizure outcome.
   Results: Risk factors for PCEs included gliosis (34.56\%), malformations
   of cortical development (33.33\%), tumors (8.64\%), brain trauma
   (3.70\%), Sturge-Weber disease (4.93\%), vascular malformations
   (3.70\%), family history of epilepsy (3.70\%), history of CNS infections
   (2.46\%), and low IQ (2.46\%). Of the 81 patients, 44 were submitted to
   surgery at the time of the completion of this study. Surgical treatment
   was highly effective in improving seizures (p < 0.001) when compared
   with previous pharmacologic treatment alone. Twenty-eight (65.11\%)
   patients became seizure free after surgery versus none in the
   nonsurgical group. Regarding outcome predictors, patients with shorter
   duration of epilepsy and those without neurologic abnormalities on
   clinical examination had higher chances of favorable evolution.
   Conclusions: Surgical treatment is effective for the treatment of PCEs
   and superior to pharmacologic therapy alone. In our series, shorter
   duration of epilepsy and normal neurologic examination were the only
   independent variables that predicted better surgical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{AIMS: Prevention of obesity is a public health agenda. There are only
   few longitudinal studies on prevention of overweight in children. The
   Kiel Obesity Prevention Study (KOPS) intends to characterise the
   determinants of childhood overweight and the effect of preventive
   measures within schools as well as within families.
   METHODS: Between 1996 and 2005, KOPS investigated 4997 German 5-7 and
   4487 9-11-y-old children or 41 and 37\% of the total population of all
   first and fourth graders in 32 primary schools in Kiel (248000
   inhabitants), northwest Germany. Main outcome measures were nutritional
   status, health habits and risk factors of disease. In addition, health
   promotion was performed each year in three schools for all first graders
   and their teachers (nutrition education and active school breaks)
   together with a family-oriented approach in families with obese and
   preobese children. Up to now, the children were followed for 4 y and
   were reinvestigated at age 10 y.
   RESULTS: The KOPS population was representative for all 5-7 and
   9-11-y-old children in Kiel. The prevalence of overweight/ obesity (>=
   90th/97th BMI reference percentile) was 7.0/5.8 and 11.3/6.3\% in 5-7
   and 9-11-y-old children, respectively. Parental overweight, a low
   socio-economic status and a high birth weight were identified as main
   risk factors for overweight in prepubertal children. The first results
   of the interventions show that obesity prevention was possible, but
   there were limited success rates in boys and children from low social
   class.
   CONCLUSION: Faced with the environmental contributors to the obesity
   problem societal rather than individual responsibilities are evident.
   This idea suggests that dissecting and tackling the obesogenic
   environment is necessary to complement school- and family-based
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{A sigma-pi separation analysis of the energies in Al4Li4 reveals that
   the system is more, pi-antiaromatic than the sigma-aromaticity in it.
   This is true also for C4H4 and Ga4Li4. Unlike C4H4 that has a very large
   component of pi-antiaromaticity, for these all-metal clusters, these
   energy scales are comparable though pi-antiaromaticity is the major
   driving force for the distortion of the molecules from the square
   (sigma-aromatic) structure to the rectangular (pi-antiaromatic)
   architecture. For the dianion Al4Li42-, the sigma-equalization prevails
   over the pi-distortion in Al4Li4, and for the dication Al4Li42+,
   pi-equalization is the driving force for the square symmetric structure.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Reasons for performing study: Little information exists regarding talus
   fractures in the horse and there have been no previously published case
   series of racehorses diagnosed with incomplete sagittal fracture of the
   talus.
   Objective: To describe the diagnosis, treatment and post injury
   performance of horses with incomplete sagittal fracture of the talus.
   Methods: Medical records of 11 racehorses (8 Standardbreds and 3
   Thoroughbreds) admitted between January 1992 and January 1999 were
   reviewed. Subject details, anamnesis, results of lameness examination,
   radiographs and nuclear scintigraphic findings were evaluated. Racing
   performance was assessed by comparing pre- and post injury race records.
   Results: Nuclear scintigraphic examination, performed in 8 of the 11
   horses, revealed focal increased radiopharmaceutical uptake in the
   proximal aspect of the affected talus. Fractures could best be seen on
   dorsal 10-20 degrees lateral-plantaromedial oblique radiographs; all had
   raced pre-injury. All horses were treated conservatively and follow-up
   information was available for 8 horses, of which 7 raced after injury.
   Performance in 3 horses was improved, in 1 it was unchanged and in 3
   horses performance declined.
   Conclusions: Horses with incomplete fracture of the talus have a good
   prognosis for return to racing after conservative management.
   Potential relevance: Incomplete sagittal fracture of the talus should be
   considered as a cause of hindlimb lameness in racehorses. Further
   research is necessary to determine the pathophysiology of these
   fractures.}},

Abstract = {{The smallpox vaccine is the prototypic vaccine, yet the viral targets
   critical for vaccine-mediated protection remain unclear in humans. We
   have produced protein microarrays of a near-complete vaccinia proteome
   and used them to determine the major antigen specificities of the human
   humoral immune response to the smallpox vaccine (Dryvax). H3L, an
   intracellular mature virion envelope protein, was consistently
   recognized by hightiter antibodies in the majority of human donors,
   particularly after secondary immunization. We then focused on examining
   113L as a valuable human antibody target. Purified human anti-H3L
   antibodies exhibited substantial vaccinia virus-neutralizing activity in
   vitro (50\% plaque reduction neutralization test {[}PRNT50] = 44 mu
   g/ml). Mice also make an immunodominant antibody response to 113L after
   vaccination with vaccinia virus, as determined by vaccinia virus protein
   microarray. Mice were immunized with recombinant 113L protein to examine
   H3L-specific antibody responses in greater detail. H3L-immunized mice
   developed hightiter vaccinia virus-neutralizing antibodies (mean PRNT50
   = 1:3,760). Importantly, H3L-immunized mice were subsequently protected
   against lethal intranasal challenges with 1 or 5 50\% lethal doses
   (LD50) of pathogenic vaccinia virus strain WR, demonstrating the in vivo
   value of an anti-H3L response. To formally demonstrate that neutralizing
   anti-H3L antibodies are protective in vivo, we performed anti-H3L serum
   passive-transfer experiments. Mice receiving H3L-neutralizing antiserum
   were protected from a lethal challenge with 3 LD50 of vaccinia virus
   strain WR (5110 versus 0/10; P < 0.02). Together, these data show that
   113L is a major target of the human anti-poxvirus antibody response and
   is likely to be a key contributor to protection against poxvirus
   infection and disease.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we describe a new spectral nodal method for solving
   discrete ordinates (S-N) neutron transport problems with anisotropic
   scattering for arbitrary order N of angular quadrature. The key to our
   new spectral nodal method is a consistent derivation of nonstandard
   auxiliary equations that relate angular neutron fluxes only in the
   upwind directions. These nonstandard equations are angularly coupled
   extensions of very basic auxiliary equations proposed by Edward W.
   Larsen in his extended diamond scheme of solving S-2 problems in the
   presence of scattering and free from spatial truncation error. The
   resulting method here is also free from spatial truncation error and, in
   contrast to previously developed spectral nodal methods, it is
   compatible with an efficient use of iteration on the scattering source
   and is free from the storage of cell-edge angular fluxes. (c) 2005

   the surgical treatment for ruptured discs. Only at the last century the
   precise diagnosis of a ruptured lumbar disc could be made after
   tremendous efforts of the many medical pioneers in the study of the

   transferred to the cervical spine. We describe the evolution of the
   clinical and surgical aspects about ruptured discs in the lumbar and
   cervical spine. An illustrative timeline of the major events regarding
   the surgical treatment for ruptured disks is outlined in a straight
   forward manner. Our understandings of the relation between symptoms and
   signs and of that between anatomy and pathophysiology have led to more
   successful surgical treatment for this disease. Nowadays lumbar and
   cervical discectomies are the most frequent operations carried out by
   neurosurgeons. Our current care of patients with this kind of spinal
   disorders is based on the work of our ancient medical heroes.}},

Abstract = {{It is established that androgens and unidentified Sertoli cell
   (SC)-derived factors can influence the development of adult Leydig cells
   (LC) in rodents, but the mechanisms are unclear. We evaluated adult LC
   development and function in SC-selective androgen receptor (AR) knockout
   (SCARKO) and complete AR knockout (ARKO) mice. In controls, LC number
   increased 26-fold and LC size increased by approximately 2-fold between
   12 and 140 d of age. LC number in SCARKOs was normal on d 12, but was
   reduced by more than 40\% at later ages, although LC were larger and
   contained more lipid droplets and mitochondria than control LC by
   adulthood. ARKO LC number was reduced by up to 83\% at all ages compared
   with controls, and LC size did not increase beyond d 12. Serum LH and
   testosterone levels and seminal vesicle weights were comparable in adult
   SCARKOs and controls, whereas LH levels were elevated 8-fold in ARKOs,
   although testosterone levels appeared normal. Immunohistochemistry and
   quantitative PCR for LC-specific markers indicated steroidogenic
   function per LC was probably increased in SCARKOs and reduced in ARKOs.
   In SCARKOs, insulin-like factor-3 and estrogen sulfotransferase (EST)
   mRNA expression were unchanged and increased 3-fold, respectively,
   compared with controls, whereas the expression of both was reduced more
   than 90\% in ARKOs. Changes in EST expression, coupled with reduced
   platelet-derived growth factor-A expression, are potential causes of
   altered LC number and function in SCARKOs. These results show that loss
   of androgen action on SC has major consequences for LC development, and
   this could be mediated indirectly via platelet-derived growth factor-A
   and/or estrogens/EST.}},

Abstract = {{We consider intrinsic autoregression models at multiple resolutions.
   Firstly, we describe a method to construct a class of approximately
   coherent Markov random fields (MRF) at different scales, overcoming the
   problem that the marginal Gaussian MRF is not, in general, a MRF with
   respect to any nontrivial neighbourhood structure. This is based on the
   approximation of non-Markov Gaussian fields as Gaussian MRFs and is
   optimal according to different theoretic notions such as
   Kullback-Leibler divergence. We extend the method to intrinsic
   autoregressions providing a novel multi-resolution framework. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{In this work, we report a microbiological survey for Mycoplasma spp.
   undertaken between 2001 and 2002 in 28 goat herds in Gran Canaria,
   Spain, an area where contagious agalactia is endemic. All herds were
   randomly selected and represented approximately 15.5\% of the total goat
   population of the island. A variable number of milk, articular and
   auricular swab samples were collected from each flock and cultured in
   specific mycoplasma culture media. There was a total of 38.5\% positive
   flocks from which 37 mycoplasma isolates were obtained.
   In contrast with previous data obtained in Spain, our results showed
   that the large colony variant of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm LC)
   was the most commonly isolated agent associated with contagious
   agalactia. This species was isolated from 90\% of the positive herds and
   accounted for 54.1\% of all isolations. M. agalactiae was isolated from
   40\% of the positive herds (27\% of all isolations) and in six herds M.
   arginini was isolated (18.7\% of all isolations). No M. capricolum or M.
   putrefaciens strains were isolated. Mycoplasmas were isolated from 21
   milk samples, 15 ear canals swabs and one articular sample. The
   association of several species was reported in several herds. These
   results are at variance with previous serological studies, which
   indicated a higher disease prevalence, and suggest that it could be
   necessary to use detection techniques such PCR to confirm the existence
   of contagious agalactia in goats. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This contribution describes a new laboratory experience that improves
   students' learning of chronobiology by introducing them to basic
   chronobiology concepts as well as to methods and statistical analysis
   tools specific for circadian rhythms. We designed an autorhythmometry
   laboratory session where students simultaneously played the role of
   researchers and experimental subjects. During this session, which lasted
   24 h, students recorded their own arterial pressure, heart rate, oral
   temperature, forced expiratory flow, glucose tolerance, muscular
   strength, reaction time, and sensorimotor coordination at regular
   intervals and also took the Horne and Ostberg test, after which they
   analyzed their own data. Furthermore, to gather information from
   subjects under normal sleep and eating schedules, some students acquired
   data at home. To guide and help students with their work, a dedicated
   web page was implemented with scientific references, cosinor analysis
   software, and other valuable information. All these ``raw{''} data were
   combined into a single database that students could use to evaluate
   whatever aspect of the data they seemed fit. A number of suggestions
   were offered to them as guidance. Students were then instructed to write
   a scientific article on the subject they had chosen. The experience was
   highly rewarding for both instructors and students alike. In view of the
   high level of absenteeism in Spanish universities and the fact that 93\%
   of the students attended the exam and 95\% of these passed, the
   experience was considered a great success.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Although disability levels have been declining in older
   adults, there is little current information on racial differences in
   disability.
   Methods. Our data came from a longitudinal, population-based study of
   6,158 Black and White adults aged 65 and older from the south side of
   Chicago. Data were collected during three face-to-face interviews
   between 1993 and 2002. We ascertained disability using three self-report
   measures and a performance-based measure of physical function. Using
   longitudinal data analysis, we examined overall racial differences in
   disability and the degree to which they varied by age and gender.
   Results. After an average of 6 years of follow-up, Blacks reported
   significantly higher disability levels than Whites after adjustment for
   age and sex. There was a significant increase in disability during
   follow-up oil all four measures. Racial differences in disability did
   not vary consistently by age at baseline or over time but were greater
   among women. Findings were largely similar for self-reported and
   perfomance-based measures of disability. Adjustment for socioeconomic
   status substantially reduced racial differences in disability, although
   some of the differences remained significant, especially among women.
   Conclusions. Racial disparities in disability have not been eliminated,
   are greater among women, and have their origins earlier in adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{Annual von Bertalanffy growth parameters of the Caribbean spiny lobster
   (Parulirus argus) in Cuban waters were estimated from a ions germ study
   (40 years) by length-based methods ELEFAN and the new version of SLCA.
   Data of around 800 000 lobsters (with carapace length ranging 14 to
   199mm) were randomly sampled in artificial shelters (a non selective
   fishing gear very common in the lobster Fishery), through the field
   monitory program established for this species since 1963 in 14
   localities of southwestern Cuban shelf. The software ELEFAN showed
   problems to converge in an optimal combination of the instantaneous
   growth coefficient and the asymptotic length (L-infinity) of the von
   Bertalanffy equation, whereas the new SLCA software produced value
   estimates of K between 0.20 and 0.27 year(-1) and values of L-infinity
   between 177 and 190 mm carapace length, all within the range reported in
   the literature. The standardized anomalies of both parameters showed the
   presence of cycles along the analyzed time series. Decadal variability
   in growth parameters was revealed through the spectral analysis
   indicating cycles of 16 and 20 years for K and of 16 years for
   L-infinity. The incidence of some Factors such as biomass and
   temperature that modulate growth in this crustacean was explored, using
   a nonlinear multiple regression model. These combined factors explained
   33\% and 69\% of the variability of K and L-infinity respectively. The
   growth coefficient appeared to be maximum with annual mean sea surface
   temperature of 28.1 degrees C and the largest L-infinity is reached at a
   annual men biomass level or 23 000 t. These results should be the basis
   to understand the Cuban lobster Population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Research on human rights consistently points to the importance of
   democracy in reducing the severity and incidence of personal integrity
   abuses. The prescriptive implications of this finding for policy makers
   interested in state building have been somewhat limited, however, by a
   reliance on multidimensional measures of democracy. Consequently, a
   policy maker emerges from this literature confident that ``democracy
   matters{''} but unclear about which set(s) of reforms is likely to yield
   a greater human rights payoff. Using data from the Polity IV Project, we
   examine what aspects of democracy are most consequential in improving a
   state's human rights record. Analysis of democracy's dimensions elicits
   three findings. First, political participation at the level of
   multiparty competition appears more significant than other dimensions in
   reducing human rights abuses. Second, improvements in a state's level of
   democracy short of full democracy do not promote greater respect for
   integrity rights. Only those states with the highest levels of
   democracy, not simply those conventionally defined as democratic, are
   correlated with better human rights practices. Third, accountability
   appears to be the critical feature that makes full-fledged democracies
   respect human rights; limited accountability generally retards
   improvement in human rights.}},

Title = {{Australian wattle species in the Drakensberg region of South Africa - An
   invasive alien or a natural resource?}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{An investigation into the spread of two alien wattle species (Acacia
   mearnsii and Acacia dealbata) in rural parts of the Drakensberg region
   of South Africa and the importance of the trees to the livelihoods of
   the local communities was carried out. With the aid of aerial
   photography two plots near the village were selected. Wattle aerial
   cover increased from 7\% and 20\% in the two plots, respectively, in
   1953, over 21\% and 33\% in 1975, to 48\% and 58\% in 2000. In 1995, a
   government-sponsored national programme, ``Working for Water{''} was
   established, with the expressed purpose of employing people described as
   being from the poorest and disadvantaged rural communities to clear
   areas of invasive alien species from river catchments and water courses.
   Whilst the programme provides an income to thousands of families in
   rural areas, it may also be jeopardising the livelihoods of the same
   communities.
   The wattle is an important resource for village households; virtually
   all households used it as their primary heat source and for building
   materials. Other uses included medicine extraction and 20\% of the
   interviewed households gained income from selling firewood.
   From the rural communities' perception, the greatest concern regarding
   the alien species is its high water consumption (although this did not
   affect them directly), and the fact that it provides cover to thieves
   and criminals. Consequently, most villagers wanted either a reduction of
   the wattle stands (58\% and 86\% in the 2001 and 2003 study,
   respectively), or that they remained as at present (42\% and 10\%,
   respectively).
   Leaves from woody legumes have demonstrated large potential as green
   manures and fodder providers in many agroecosystems. The abundance of
   the wattle in the study area suggested an exploration of alternative
   beneficial uses in the low input farming systems practiced. The wattle's
   potential as green manure was evaluated in a decomposition trial. In all
   treatments, the wattle litter immobilised nitrogen from soil, in spite
   of a high N content of the litter. Plant available P increased in soil
   after 4-5 months of incubation.
   We argue that the current practice of externally funded wattle control
   is not sustainable in the long term. We discuss alternative approaches
   with a higher level of community participation and ownership, and
   conclude that the current underutilization of land may, ironically, be
   one of the largest constraints for a viable solution to the spread of
   wattle. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This in vitro study evaluated the performance of 16-slice multidetector
   computed tomography (MDCT) in the assessment of carotid plaque
   components, with histology as the gold standard. Twenty-one specimens (
   n= 21) were scanned and reconstructed after optimization of the
   protocol. Three corresponding MDCT images and histologic sections were
   selected from each specimen. The Hounsfield values (HV) of the major
   plaque components ( calcifications, fibrous tissue and lipid) were
   assessed. Plaque areas (mm(2)) assessed with MDCT were compared with the
   results from histologic analysis. A value of 140 kVp and an intermediate
   reconstruction algorithm was the optimal protocol. In 15 out of 21
   specimens it was possible to match MDCT images with histology. The HV of
   calcifications, fibrous tissue and lipid were 45 +/- 21, 79 +/- 20 and
   960 +/- 491 HU ( P< 0.001), respectively. Plaque areas were compared in
   27 matched levels. The calcified and lipid areas on MDCT and histology
   correlate well ( R-2 = 0.83 and R-2 = 0.68, respectively). The mean
   difference in lipid area was 0.1 mm(2) (95\% CI = - 2.1 - 2.3 mm(2)).
   This in vitro study showed that MDCT is capable of characterizing and
   quantifying the lipid rich portion of the atherosclerotic plaque.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) Patients generally have a dismal
   prognosis, with median survival of 10-12 months. GBM with long-term
   survival (LTS) of >= 5 years is rare, and no definite markers indicating
   better prognosis have been identified till date. The present study was
   undertaken to evaluate GBMs with LTS in order to identify additional
   correlates associated with favourable outcome.
   The cases were evaluated for relevant clinicopathological data,
   proliferation index and expression of tumortumour suppressor gene (p53),
   cyclin-dependant kinase-inhibitors (p27 and p16) and epidermal growth
   factor receptor (EGFR) proteins.
   Six cases of GBM with LTS with an average survival of 9 years (range
   5-15 years) were identified. All were young patients with mean age of 27
   years (range 8-45 years). Histology of three cases was consistent with
   conventional GBM, while two showed prominent oligodendroglial component
   admixed with GBM areas. One was a giant cell GBM, which progressed to
   gliosarcoma on recurrence. The mean MIB-1LI was 12\% (range 6-20\%). p53
   was immunopositive in 4 out of 5 cases. EGFR and p27 were immunonegative
   in all, whereas p16 was immunonegative in 3 out of 5 cases.
   Currently, in the absence of specific molecular and genetic markers, GBM
   in young patients should be meticulously evaluated for foci of
   oligodendroglial component and/or giant cell elements, in addition to
   proliferative index and p53 expression, since these probably have
   prognostic connotations, as evident in this study. The role of p 16 and
   p27 however needs better definition with study of more number of cases.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is concerned with the analysis of the phonocardiogram signals
   (PCG) in the time-frequency domain. Three techniques are studied and
   evaluated in PCG signal analysis. These are the short time Fourier
   transform (STFT), the Wigner distribution function (WD) and the
   continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs). The analysis is first carried out
   on the second cardiac sound (S2) in order to show the aptitude of each
   method in distinguishing the internal components of this sound. The
   results we obtain show that the STFT cannot detect the two internal
   components of S2 (A2 and P2, respectively, the aortic and pulmonary
   components). The WD can provide time-frequency characteristics of S2,
   but with insufficient diagnostic information: the two components are not
   accurately detected and appear to be only one component. It is found
   that the CWT (it can also provide the time-frequency characteristic of
   S2) is capable of detecting its two components, A2 and P2, allowing
   therefore the measurement of the delay between them. This delay, called
   the split, is very important in the diagnosis of many pathological
   cases, as it is emphasized in the results we obtain by applying the CWT
   on different pathological cases (mitral stenosis, pulmonary stenosis and
   atrial septal defect). (C) 2005 American Association of Physicists in

   designed. Two faculty practice offices in the United States were chosen
   for the study. Forty GO patients and 40 general gynecology patients were
   selected from the most recent outpatient appointments of the two
   hospitals. We used the Urogenital Distress Inventory and the
   Incontinence Impact Questionnaire to elicit UI symptoms in GO patients
   and compared the results with their medical records. A control group,
   selected from a general gynecological practice, was included for
   comparison. The main outcome measures were to investigate the prevalence
   and detection rates of UI in GO patients. GO patients were significantly
   more likely to report UI symptoms on the questionnaire than their
   gynecologist was able to elicit during a consultation (P < 0.001). The
   survey found that 60\% (24/40) of the GO patients reported at least one
   symptom of UI, with 23\% complaining of ``severe{''} symptoms. Of those
   patients who reported the symptoms on questionnaire, only 5\% (2/40)
   were detected at the initial physician assessment (P < 0.01). Eighteen
   percent of the GO patients reported that the UI symptoms adversely
   affected their quality of life. The prevalence of symptoms was not
   associated with the primary cancer site. There was no difference in
   detection rates between the two practice settings. In a multivariate
   analysis, there was no factor that emerged as the best discriminator for
   a positive response to the questionnaire. A significant proportion of GO
   patients report severe UI symptoms that are not detected by gynecologic
   oncologists or gynecologists during routine consultations.}},

Abstract = {{Grammatical inference has been extensively studied in recent years as a
   result of its wide field of application, and in turn, recurrent neural
   networks have proved themselves to be a good tool for grammatical
   inference. The learning algorithms for these neural networks, however,
   have been far less studied than those for feed-forward neural networks.
   Classical training methods for recurrent neural networks suffer from
   being trapped in local minimal and having a high computational time. In
   addition, selecting the optimal size of a neural network for a
   particular application is a difficult task. This suggests that the
   problems of developing methods to determine optimal topologies and new
   training algorithms should be studied.
   In this paper, we present a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm which
   is able to determine the optimal size of recurrent neural networks in
   any particular application. This is specially analyzed in the case of
   grammatical inference: in particular, we study how to establish the
   optimal size of a recurrent neural network in order to learn positive
   and negative examples in a certain language, and how to determine the
   corresponding automaton using a self-organizing map once the training
   has been completed. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {{This paper presents partial findings of a larger research project
   focusing on what it means to live with a chronic illness. Getting in
   harmony with oneself is a movement towards, and a form of, acceptance of
   the chronic suffering and disease. Some patients achieve this level of
   acceptance, while for others the obstacles of everyday life make this
   movement towards acceptance difficult. Achieving harmony with oneself is
   conditioned by the existence of hope and spirit of life/life courage and
   by the pressure of doubts on this hope. Doubts can shake this hope so
   that instead of moving towards acceptance, the patient drifts towards
   hopelessness and despair. The research design is qualitative and uses a
   phenomenological-hermeneutic approach. A total of 18 patients were
   inter-viewed, divided into three groups of six patients diagnosed with
   `type I' diabetes, colitis ulcerosa and patients with coronary occlusion
   in the rehabilitation phase. The goal of the research was to derive
   patterns/themes common to the three diagnosed groups regarding the
   patients' view of health and disease in connection with chronic illness
   and to elucidate the significance of this view for how the patients
   coped with everyday life. The research method is inspired by Paul
   Ricoeur.}},

Abstract = {{A number of mutations that alter the form of the compound leaf in pea
   (Pisum sativum) has proven useful in elucidating the role that auxin
   might play in pea leaf development. The goals of this study were to
   determine if auxin application can rescue any of the pea leaf mutants
   and if gibberellic acid (GA) plays a role in leaf morphogenesis in pea.
   A tissue culture system was used to determine the effects of various
   auxins, GA or a GA biosynethesis inhibitor (paclobutrazol) on leaf
   development. The GA mutant, nana1 (na1) was analyzed. The uni-tac mutant
   was rescued by auxin and GA and rescue involved both a conversion of the
   terminal leaflet into a tendril and an addition of a pair of lateral
   tendrils. This rescue required the presence of cytokinin. The auxins
   tested varied in their effectiveness, although methyl-IAA worked best.
   The terminal tendrils of wildtype plantlets grown on paclobutrazol were
   converted into leaflets, stubs or were aborted. The number of lateral
   pinna pairs produced was reduced and leaf initiation was impaired. These
   abnormalities resembled those caused by auxin transport inhibitors and
   phenocopy the uni mutants. The na1 mutant shared some morphological
   features with the uni mutants; including, flowering late and producing
   leaves with fewer lateral pinna pairs. These results show that both
   auxin and GA play similar and significant roles in pea leaf development.
   Pea leaf morphogenesis might involve auxin regulation of GA biosynthesis
   and GA regulation of Uni expression.}},

Abstract = {{Input torque balancing through addition of an auxiliary, input torque
   balancing mechanism, is a well-known way for reducing drive speed
   fluctuations in high-speed camfollower mechanisms. This paper develops a
   methodology to design and optimize the so-called inverted cam mechanism
   (ICM), a simple, cam-based input torque balancing mechanism. It was
   already introduced in the 1950s, but the design methodologies proposed
   by Meyer zur Capellen (1964) and Michelin (1979) are, respectively,
   erroneous or too rough an approximation, and are corrected here. The
   describing equation that governs the ICM cam design, is shown to be a
   second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. It is solved by
   parameterizing its solution as a finite Fourier series, the coefficients
   of which are determined through a nonlinear least-squares problem. Based
   on this methodology, an ICM is designed for input torque balancing a
   high-speed, industrial cam-follower mechanism. The ICMs design
   parameters result from a design optimization, which aims at obtaining a
   compact and technologically feasible mechanism. The optimization problem
   is solved using a design chart, which is efficiently created based on a
   nondimensionalized analysis.}},

Abstract = {{SiLK is a polymer material developed for use as a thin-film dielectric
   in the interconnect structure of high-density integrated circuits. Among
   others, its thermomechanical properties play a dominant role for the
   integrity and reliability of the interconnect during processing,
   testing, and use. Being a polymer SiLK may show viscoelastic
   (time-dependent) behavior. In this paper we use nanoindentation
   techniques in combination kith analytical and finite element modeling
   (FEM) to determine the viscoelastic properties of a thin SiLK film on a
   silicon substrate. Indentation-creep experiments show that this SiLK
   film indeed responds in a viscoelastic way. This may be caused by the
   non fully cross-linked test samples prepared using nonstandard
   processing. Using the FEM simulation, we find that the behavior of this
   thin SiLK film can be described with a linear viscoelastic model up to
   the characteristic stress and strain levels of approximately 200 MPa and
   3\%, respectively. For higher stress and strain levels, the response
   becomes nonlinear. The results are validated with independent
   indentation load-unload measurements.}},

   China. Our study provides the first rigorous empirical analysis on the
   earlier performance of residential mortgage market in China based on a
   unique micro dataset of mortgage loan history collected from a major
   residential mortgage lender in China. We found that while the option
   theory fails to explain prepayment and default behavior in the
   residential mortgage market in China, other non-option theory related
   financial economic factors play major roles in determining the
   prepayment and default risks in China. We also found that borrower's
   characteristics are significant in determining prepayment behavior,
   hence may be used as an effective tool for screening potential high risk
   borrowers in the loan origination process. Adopting a risk-based pricing
   in residential mortgage lending in China can improve the efficiency of
   the market, and enhance the credit availability to the most needed

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the effect of the stator-rotor interference on the
   stage exit flow field of a transonic turbine operated under engine
   representative conditions in the von Karman Institute (VKI) compression
   tube facility. The test programme comprises three pressure ratios and
   two Reynolds numbers.
   The time-averaged radial distributions of total pressure and temperature
   downstream of the rotor are affected by the hub passage vortices and the
   interaction between the tip passage vortex and the rotor tip leakage
   vortex. The azimuthal distributions exhibit significant nonuniformities
   with a periodicity of one vane pitch. The amplitude of this
   non-uniformity is very sensitive to the pressure ratio. A simple model
   shows that, contrary to the common belief, the transport of the vane
   wake and secondary flows across the rotor is not enough to explain the
   magnitude of the variations. The pitch-wise vane exit static pressure
   distribution, which is significantly distorted owing to the transonic
   regime of the vane, should be taken into account.
   The amplitude of the time-resolved fluctuations of pressure and
   temperature, which are due to rotor blade passing events, also varies
   significantly depending on the probe location in a vane pitch. The
   measured time-accurate rotor relative inlet total pressure suggests that
   the rotor relative exit undergoes periodic excursions in the transonic
   regime.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper several high density polyethylene pipe resins are compared
   to polyethylene resins made in the Phillips Loop-Slurry Process
   (single-reactor), using a catalyst of chromium on modified
   aluminophosphate (Cr/AlPO4). A brief description of the Cr/AlPO4 system
   is presented along with polymer chain architecture (i.e., topology) and
   other structural aspects of polymers made from these catalysts. The
   physical properties of these resins and their fabricated pipe
   processing/performance properties were compared to both PE80 and
   conventional bimodal type PE-100 resins. Results from this study show
   that high-density polyethylene resins made from Cr/AlPO4 catalysts
   possess primary structural attributes that are truly unique for
   chromium-catalyzed resins. These multimodal resins have very high
   molecular weights (MW; M-w > 400 kg/mol) and exceptionally broad MW
   distributions (MWD; M-w/M-n > 50). Topologically, these resins were
   found to have uniform short chain branching distributions across the
   MWD; as in polymers made from single site metallocene catalysts) and
   significantly reduced levels (10 times less) of long chain branching
   when compared to resins made using chromium catalysts on conventional
   supports. Furthermore, results from rheological, fabricated pipe
   processing, and performance studies suggest that these resins should be
   especially well suited for high performance pipe applications. Pipe
   samples made from these resins were found to meet PE-100 requirements
   including low temperature impact properties.}},

Abstract = {{We use a displacement-controlled dual double-cantilever-based
   surface-force-type apparatus to dynamically probe perfluorooctyl

   substrates of 1 nm and 0.7 nm rms (root mean square) roughness,

   roughness. We record stiffness and damping constant as a function of
   compression load and deconvolute the elastic modulus using contact
   mechanical formulations. When mechanical intervention is limited to the
   terminal end of the molecule there is a strong viscous response and a
   low level of elastic response in consonance with the ability of the
   molecule to generate conformational defects freely. When the
   intervention penetrates into the molecular backbone the damping
   disappears dramatically and the molecule registers at a contact mean
   pressure of about 0.2 GPa a monotonic and steep rise in elastic
   resistance in response to further intervention by the probe. We offer a
   physical explanation of the process and describe this change as due to a
   phase transition from a liquidlike to a solidlike state as indicated by
   a large increase in relaxation time constant.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The initial stage of isotropic-nematic spinodal demixing kinetics of
   suspensions of very long and thin, stiff, repulsive rods is analyzed on
   the basis of the N-particle Smoluchowski equation. Equations of motion
   for the reduced probability density function of the position and
   orientation of a rod are expanded up to second order in spatial
   gradients and leading order in orientational order parameter. The
   resulting equation of motion is solved analytically, from which the
   temporal evolution of light-scattering patterns are calculated. It is
   shown that inhomogeneities in number density are enslaved by the
   temporal development of inhomogeneities in orientational order.
   Furthermore, demixing due to rotational diffusion is shown to be much
   faster as compared to translational diffusion. This results in an
   instable mode that is rotational, for which the corresponding
   eigenvector remains finite at zero wave vector. The scattered intensity
   nevertheless exhibits a maximum at a finite wave vector due to the
   wave-vector dependence of time-exponential prefactors. The wave vector
   where the intensity exhibits a maximum is therefore predicted to be a
   function of time even during the initial stage of demixing.}},

Journal = {{HEADACHE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To assess changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
   measures among patients receiving topiramate (TPM) 100 mg/d in two
   divided doses for migraine prevention in three randomized, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled, 26-week trials with similar protocols and study
   populations.
   Background-Migraine substantially impairs HRQoL and work productivity
   before, during, and after attacks. Approximately 50\% of patients with
   migraine could be recommended for preventive therapies, yet only 3\% to
   5\% of patients receive them. TPM is an effective and generally
   well-tolerated migraine prophylactic (preventive) therapy for adults, as
   demonstrated in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
   trials. The most common adverse events in double-blind,
   placebo-controlled studies of TPM in migraine prevention are
   paresthesia, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, taste alteration, and diarrhea.
   Design and Methods-The Migraine-Specific Questionnaire (MSQ, version
   2.1) was used to assess the effect of TPM 100 mg/d on the functionality
   and HRQoL of randomized intent-to-treat (ITT) and study-completer
   populations pooled from three randomized, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled trials. MSQ scores (0 to 100, higher score indicates
   better functioning) were assessed for the following three domains: role
   restriction (examines the degree to which performance of daily
   activities is limited by migraine), role prevention (examines the degree
   to which performance of daily activities is interrupted by migraine),
   and emotional function (examines feelings of frustration and
   helplessness due to migraine). Between-group differences from baseline
   in mean MSQ domain scores for TPM 100 mg/d and placebo were compared
   using a mixed-effects model with piecewise linear regression. Effect
   sizes were calculated to estimate the magnitude of change in HRQoL that
   can be associated with TPM therapy.
   Results-TPM 100 mg/d significantly improved all three MSQ domains
   compared with placebo for both the ITT (TPM, n = 372; placebo, n = 362)
   and study-completer (TPM, n = 220; placebo, n = 216) populations (P <
   .001 for all three domains, both populations). Effect sizes for TPM 100
   mg/d varied from 0.40 to 0.78, indicating that the changes in MSQ scores
   for TPM 100 mg/d were moderate and may be clinically significant.
   Conclusion-TPM 100 mg/d has been shown to be effective in the prevention

Abstract = {{Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes differ in their susceptibility to Fusarium
   wilt diseases. Ecotype Taynuilt-0 (Ty-0) is susceptible to Fusarium
   oxysporum forma specialis (f.) matthioli whereas Columbia-0 (Cot-0) is
   resistant. Segregation analysis of a cross between Ty-0 and Col-0
   revealed six dominant RESISTANCE TO FUSARIUM OXYSPORUM (RFO) loci that
   significantly contribute to f. matthioli resistance in Col-0 relative to
   Ty-0. We refer to the locus with the strongest effect as RFO1. Ty-0
   plants in which only the Col-0 allele of RFO1 (RFO1(col-0)) was
   introduced were resistant to f. matthioli. Surprisingly, RFO1(Col-0)
   also conferred resistance to f. raphani, demonstrating that
   RFO1-mediated resistance is not race specific. Expression of resistance
   by RFO2, RFO4, or RFO6 was dependent on RFO1(Col-0). Map-based cloning
   of RFO1(Col-0) showed that RFO1 is identical to the previously named
   Arabidopsis gene WAKL22 (WALL-ASSOCIATED KINASE-LIKE KINASE 22), which
   encodes a receptor-like kinase that does not contain an extracellular
   leucine-rich repeat domain. Consistent with these results, a Col-0 rfo1
   loss-of-function mutant was more susceptible to f. matthioli, f.
   conglutinans, and f. raphani. Thus, RFO1 encodes a novel type of
   dominant disease-resistance protein that confers resistance to a broad

Abstract = {{A new synthetic route, i.e. the radiated polymer gel (R-PG) method, has
   been developed and demonstrated for the production of LiCoO2 powders.
   The process involved two processes: (1) obtaining a gel by polymerizing
   a mixed solution of an acrylic monomer and an aqueous solution of
   lithium and cobalt salts under gamma-ray irradiation conditions and (2)
   obtaining LiCoO2 powders by drying and calcining the gel.
   Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron
   scanning microscopy (SEM) were employed to study the reaction process
   and the structures of the powders. Galvanostatic cell cycling, cyclic
   voltammetry and ac impedance spectroscopy were used to evaluate the
   electrochemical properties of the LiCoO2 powders. It was found that a
   pure phase of LiCoO2 can be obtained at the calcination temperature of
   800 degrees C. Both the particle size (micrometer range) and specific
   charge/discharge capacity of an RPG-LiCoO2 Powder increase with
   increasing the concentration of its precursor solution. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{The crystal structure of an open potassium channel reveals a kink in the
   inner helix that lines the pore (Jiang, Y. X., A. Lee, J. Y. Chen, M.
   Cadene, B. T. Chait, and R. MacKinnon. 2002. Nature 417: 523-526). The
   putative hinge point is a highly conserved glycine residue. We examined
   the role of the homologous residue (Gly466) in the S6 transmembrane
   segment of Shaker potassium channels. The nonfunctional alanine mutant
   G466A will assemble, albeit poorly, with wild-type (WT) subunits,
   suppressing functional expression. To test if this glycine residue is
   critical for activation gating, we did a glycine scan along the S6
   segment in the background of G466A. Although all of these double mutants
   lack the higher-level glycosylation that is characteristic of mature
   Shaker channels, one (G466A/V467G) is able to generate voltage-dependent
   potassium current. Surface biotinylation shows that functional and
   nonfunctional constructs containing G466A express at comparable levels
   in the plasma membrane. Compared with WT channels, the shifted-glycine
   mutant has impairments in voltage-dependent channel opening, including a
   right-shifted activation curve and a decreased rate of activation. The
   double mutant has relatively normal open-channel properties, except for
   a decreased affinity for intracellular blockers, a consequence of the
   loss of the side chain of Val467. Control experiments with the double
   mutants M440A/G466A and G466A/V467A suggest that the flexibility
   provided by Gly466 is more important for channel function than its small
   size. Our results support roles for Gly466 both in biogenesis of the
   channel and as a hinge in activation gating.}},

Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1574-1588}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Here we develop an integrative computational framework to model
   biophysical processes involved in viral gene delivery. The model
   combines reaction-diffusion-advection equations that describe
   intracellular trafficking with kinetic equations that describe
   transcription and translation of the exogenous DNA. It relates
   molecular-level trafficking events to whole-cell distribution of
   viruses. The approach makes use of the current understanding of cellular
   processes and data from single-particle single-cell imaging experiments.
   The model reveals two important parameters that characterize viral
   transport at the population level, namely, the effective velocity,
   V-eff, and the effective diffusion coefficient, D-eff. V-eff measures
   virus's net movement rate and D-eff represents the total dispersion
   rate. We employ the model to study the influence of microtubule-mediated
   movements on nuclear targeting and gene expression of adenoviruses of
   type 2 and type 5 in HeLa and A549 cells. Effects of microtubule
   organization and the presence of microtubule-destabilizing drugs on
   viral transport were analyzed and quantified. Model predictions agree
   well with experimental data available in literature. The paper serves as
   a guide for future theoretical and experimental efforts to understand
   viral gene delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Background Childhood asthma is characterized by inflammation of the
   airways. Structural changes of the airway wall may also be seen in some
   children early in the course of the disease. Matrix metalloproteinases (
   MMPs) are key mediators in the metabolism of the extracellular matrix (
   ECM).
   Objective To investigate the balance of MMP-8, MMP-9 and tissue
   inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 in the airways of children with
   asthma.
   Methods One hundred and twenty-four children undergoing elective
   surgical procedures also underwent non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar
   lavage (BAL). MMP-8, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were measured by ELISA.
   Results There was a significant reduction in MMP-9 in atopic asthmatic
   children (n=31) compared with normal children (n=30) {[}median
   difference: 0.57 ng/ mL (95\% confidence interval: 0.18 - 1.1 ng/ mL)].
   The ratio of MMP-9 to TIMP-1 was also reduced in asthmatic children.
   Levels of all three proteins were significantly correlated to each other
   and to the relative proportions of particular inflammatory cells in BAL
   fluid (BALF). Both MMP-8 and MMP-9 were moderately strongly correlated
   to the percentage neutrophil count (r=0.40 and 0.47, respectively,
   P<0.001).
   Conclusions An imbalance of MMPs and their inhibitors occurs in children
   with well-controlled asthma, which may indicate early derangement of the
   metabolism of the ECM.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify and describe the physical, historical, and
   clinicopathologic characteristics of diseases requiring emergency
   treatment in postpartum mares, and to evaluate the utility of these
   characteristics in making an accurate diagnosis in these mares.
   Design: Retrospective study.
   Setting: University large animal hospital.
   Animals: One hundred and sixty-three mares admitted for emergency
   treatment within 30 days following parturition between the years 1992
   and 2002.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and main results: Information obtained from the medical
   records included age, breed, date of admission, sex of the foal from
   this parturition, time from parturition to admission, duration of
   clinical signs prior to admission, and any report of dystocia or normal
   attended delivery, physical examination and clinicopathologic findings
   and diagnosis. Urogenital hemorrhage and large colon volvulus were the
   most common diagnoses, comprising 16.6\% and 15.9\% of total cases,
   respectively. Older mares were more likely to have a diagnosis of
   urogenital hemorrhage than younger mares. Mares with urogenital
   hemorrhage had a median age of 13 years and were admitted to the
   hospital significantly closer to parturition than mares with other
   diagnoses. Anemia, hypoproteinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia were
   significantly associated with a diagnosis of urogenital hemorrhage and
   occurred in 32\%, 36\%, and 26\% of the mares with urogenital
   hemorrhage, respectively. Dystocia was more commonly reported (70\%) in
   mares with metritis. Leukopenia was more common (88\%) in mares with
   uterine tears.
   Conclusions: Careful evaluation of clinicopathologic data can aid the
   emergency clinician in making a correct diagnosis in postpartum mares
   with emergent problems.}},

Abstract = {{The current research presents a system that learns to understand object
   names, spatial relation terms and event descriptions from observing
   narrated action sequences. The system extracts meaning from observed
   visual scenes by exploiting perceptual primitives related to motion and
   contact in order to represent events and spatial relations as
   predicate-argument structures. Learning the mapping between sentences
   and the predicate-argument representations of the situations they
   describe results in the development of a small lexicon, and a structured
   set of sentence form-to-meaning mappings, or simplified grammatical
   constructions. The acquired grammatical construction knowledge
   generalizes, allowing the system to correctly understand new sentences
   not used in training. In the context of discourse, the grammatical
   constructions are used in the inverse sense to generate sentences from
   meanings, allowing the system to describe visual scenes that it
   perceives. In question and answer dialogs with naive users the system
   exploits pragmatic cues in order to select grammatical constructions
   that are most relevant in the discourse structure. While the system
   embodies a number of limitations that are discussed, this research
   demonstrates how concepts borrowed from the construction grammar
   framework can aid in taking initial steps towards building systems that
   can acquire and produce event language through interaction with the
   world. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Signaling pathways mediating the divergent effects of FSH and LH on
   aromatase in immature rat granulosa cells were studied by infecting
   cells with increasing amounts of adenoviral vectors for the human LH
   receptor (hLHR) or FSH receptor (hFSHR). Increasing amounts of Ad-hLHR,
   used at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 or 200 viable viral
   particles/cell, increased human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) binding and
   hCG-induced cAMP and Akt phosphorylation, but inositol phosphates only
   increased in response to hCG in cells infected with 200 MOI Ad-hLHR. In
   contrast, hCG increased aromatase expression in cells infected with 20,
   but not in cells infected with 200, MOI Ad-hLHR. Cells infected with 20
   or 200 MOI Ad-hFSHR showed increased hFSH binding and hFSH-induced Akt
   phosphorylation, but the hFSH-induced cAMP response was unchanged
   relative to control cells. However, hFSH was able to stimulate the
   inositol phosphate cascade in the Ad-hFSHR-infected cells, and the hFSH
   induction of aromatase was abolished. We also found that activation of C
   kinase or expression of a constitutively active form of G alpha q
   inhibited the induction of aromatase by hFSH or 8Br-cAMP. We conclude
   that the differential effects of FSH and LH on aromatase in immature
   granulosa cells are highly dependent on gonadotropin receptor density
   and on the signaling pathways activated. We propose that aromatase is
   induced by common signals generated by activation of the FSHR and LHR
   (possibly cAMP and Akt) and that the activation of the inositol
   phosphate cascade in cells expressing a high density of LHR or FSHR
   antagonizes this induction.}},

   However, if the influence of experimental stimuli is to be analyzed, it
   cannot a priori be assumed that their expression is unaffected by
   stimulation. In the present study, the authors studied the expression of
   different housekeeping genes in the vascular endothelium of intact
   conduit vessels perfused in a unique biomechanical perfusion model. Ten
   control gene candidates were investigated by microarray expression
   analysis. Further, five of these genes were systematically analyzed by
   real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR gene quantification and their
   suitability as reference genes were evaluated. On the basis of these

   performed according to Gompertz model to describe the birds growth were
   based on mean weight gain. The birds growth rate was obtained by the
   Gompertz derivative model. When the males of each strain reached body
   weight of 2.5 kg, three broilers of replicate were slaughtered for
   carcass analyses. Samples of breast samples of two birds were taken for
   physical-chemical characteristics analyses. Cobb birds had higher weight
   gain and feed intake, followed by Parafso Pedres and ISA Label. Cobb
   birds exhibited higher values of growth potential, according to Gompertz
   equation. Cobb birds showed higher values of carcass yield, breast,
   drumstick, liver, intestines, and proventricule than the other strains,
   that did not differ between them. Cobb birds presented higher values of
   pH and water retention capacity of breast meat. Paraiso Pedres and ISA
   Label exhibited stronger red color intensity. Sex did not influence meat
   quality but influenced feet, drumisticks + upper drumstick, and heart,

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to ascertain the influence of acute and
   repeated methamphetarnine administration on metabolic activity of
   CYP2D2. The study was performed in the model of isolated perfused rat
   liver using dextromethorphan as a specific marker of CYP2D2 activity.
   Acute administration of methamphetamine (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg, i.p., once
   daily for two days) significantly increased dextrorphan O-formation in
   the isolated liver mediated by CYP2D2 at all investigated doses in the
   120th min of liver perfusion. Repeated administration of
   methamphetarnine (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg, i.p., once daily for six days)
   significantly stimulated dextromethorphan O-demethylation via CYP2D2
   dose-dependently. Thus, an induction of CYP2D2 metabolic activity was
   proved in these experiments. With regard to a high level of homology
   between human and rat CYP isoform studied, the results may have clinical
   impact in pharmacotherapy of methamphetamine abusers.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Managing the multiple demands of a chronic condition whilst negotiating
   the developmental tasks of adolescence and young adulthood is a process
   that is neither well described nor understood, particularly in relation
   to providing developmentally appropriate health care for young people.
   The importance of this issue is starting to be reflected within the
   literature, and although research into models of service delivery is
   emerging, a lack of user involvement in service development is apparent.
   This qualitative, user involvement study aimed to describe and
   understand the considered opinions of 19 young adults with diabetes who
   were receiving secondary care services about the provision of diabetes
   services for young people. The findings, gathered using semistructured
   interview and focus group methods, have potentially wide-reaching
   implications across primary and secondary health care, and across
   agencies providing services to children and young people, in terms of
   facilitating a person's transition through adolescence and into young
   adult life. Participants suggested key issues to address when developing
   services for young people, including staff consistency, civility, clinic
   structures which help a person navigate the health care system,
   provision of age-specific information, and support in relation to a
   range of health, emotional, social and developmental needs. Health care
   professionals can help young people to meet the expectations upon them
   as autonomous service users by modelling appropriate relationships,
   helping them to acquire skills and knowledge, and overcome barriers to
   them becoming active participants in their health care and achieving
   social participation in a fuller sense. It is somewhat arbitrary to
   delineate between adolescence and young adulthood in terms of age alone,
   but in this paper, `adolescence' refers to the period between 11 and 15
   years of age, and `young adulthood' between 16 and 25 years of age. The
   phrase `young people' will also be used to refer to people between 11
   and 25 years.}},

Abstract = {{The ancestry of introduced populations can be inferred from gene
   genealogies if an adequate sample can be obtained, and population
   structure can be elucidated, from the native range. Grape phylloxera was
   introduced to South Africa in the late 19th century and has caused
   considerable damage in this country, as elsewhere. A previous study
   suggested a single introduction to South Africa, independent of those in
   other viticultural regions of the globe. Here, a more extensive sampling
   of South African vineyards was obtained to test the hypothesis of a
   single introduction and infer the geographic and host plant source, or
   sources, of introductions. Genetic diversity was low, though in 36
   samples 10 mitochondrial haplotypes were observed, seven unique and only
   two common. Some differentiation between grape phylloxera among the
   three populations was observed. Two clades were found, differing by a
   number of substitutions. Both these haplotype clades are closely related
   to grape phylloxera collected from the native grapevine, Vitis riparia,
   from the northern United States of America and Canada. The results
   suggest at least two introductions, and the differentiation of one of
   the South African haplotype clades from other introduced populations
   around the world suggests a direct introduction from the native range.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Inflammatory arthropathies are rare complications of cystic
   fibrosis (CF). We describe three cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
   occurring in patients with this disease.
   Observations Among the 100 patients under the care of the adult CF
   centre in Lille 3 presented with RA. This developed at the ages of 17,
   44 and 19 years with a FEV1 of 53\%, 42\% and 94\% respectively. They
   were 2 women and 1 man, with CFTR gene mutation delta F508 (1 homozygote
   and 2 heterozygotes) and positive sweat tests. They were colonised with
   Staphylococcus aureus, and rheumatoid factor and/or anti CCP antibodies
   were positive. The appearance and progression of RA were associated with
   exacerbations of bronchial infection and deterioration of respiratory
   function. In 2 patients the RA was continuously progressive despite
   intensive treatment involving high dose cortico-steroids, methotrexate
   (ineffective) followed by leflunomide (complicated by intractable
   respiratory infection).
   Conclusion There is an increased incidence of RA in our patient
   population with CF. The new serum markers of RA including anti CCP are
   of diagnostic interest, The evolution of the two diseases is related and
   seems to be dependent on the level of infection leading to therapeutic
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{We subjected the genes encoding the 19.3-, 21.3c-, and 51-kDa
   iron-sulfur subunits of respiratory chain complex I from Neurospora
   crassa to site-directed mutagenesis to mimic mutations in human complex
   I subunits associated with mitochondrial diseases. The V135M
   substitution was introduced into the 19.3-kDa cDNA, the P88L and R111H
   substitutions were separately introduced into the 21.3c-kDa cDNA, and
   the A353V and T435M alterations were separately introduced into the
   51-kDa cDNA. The altered cDNAs were expressed in the corresponding
   null-mutants under the control of a heterologous promoter. With the
   exception of the A353V polypeptide, all mutated subunits were able to
   promote assembly of a functional complex I, rescuing the phenotypes of
   the respective null-mutants. Complex I from these strains displays
   spectroscopic and enzymatic properties similar to those observed in the
   wild-type strain. A decrease in total complex I amounts may be the major
   impact of the mutations, although expression levels of mutant genes from
   the heterologous promoter were sometimes lower and may also account for
   complex I levels. We discuss these findings in relation to the
   involvement of complex I deficiencies in mitochondrial disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The endoscopic management of inverted papilloma has gained
   increasing popularity over the last 10 years. Although early concerns
   over an increased risk of recurrence seem to have been allayed, the
   appropriate management of lesions involving the frontal sinus and
   frontal recess still has to be determined.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective review of the results of all
   patients with inverted papilloma from 2000 to 2004.
   Results: A total of 18 patients were treated between October 2000 and
   January 2004. Six patients had frontal sinus involvement at the time of
   initial evaluation. One of these patients had isolated frontal sinus
   involvement. These patients were managed with either initial endoscopic
   resection with determination for the need for an additional procedure at
   the time of endoscopic resection (n = 5) or open/endoscopic approach for
   isolated frontal sinus involvement (n = 1). Of the five patients who had
   their disease managed endoscopically, three patients were determined at
   the initial procedure to need an osteoplastic flap and, subsequently,
   were managed successfully with a combined approach. One other patient
   was initially successfully managed endoscopically but ultimately
   required an osteoplastic flap for definitive management. The fifth
   patient was managed entirely endoscopically with multiple procedures.
   All patients treated with this protocol remain disease free with an
   average follow-up of 13.3 months.
   Conclusion: The limitations of endoscopic resection of inverted
   papilloma of the frontal recess can be managed with staged procedures.
   Initial endoscopic resection of ethmoid/ maxillary disease with
   subsequent open treatment of the frontal sinus has been successful in
   our experience.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review Degenerative arthopathy resulting from recurrent
   hemarthrosis remains the largest source of noninfections morbidity for
   persons with hemophilia, Optimal treatment to prevent or reduce joint
   destruction remains controversial.
   Recent findings The most exciting developments in the past year have
   contributed to our understanding of the pathophysiology behind this
   destructive process. Particularly interesting is the possible role of
   the protooncogenes and angiogenic factors factors in the development of
   hypertrophic synovium and resultant bleeding, and can be used safely
   even in very young patients. Prophylactic factor replacements remains
   the mainstay to reduce or prevent joint damage. New approaches, chiefly
   dose escalation strategies, have shown promise instead of standard
   prophylactic regimens. Additionally aggressive on-demand approaches may
   be feasible. These techniques allow for fewer indwelling venous access
   devices in small children, as rates of complications with these devices
   in small children, as rates of complications with these devices are
   shown to be increasingly high. Whether prophylactic therapy can be
   safely stopped in certain patients is an evolving area of interest.
   Outcome measures are being validated to assess the impact of
   interventions on patient quality of life.
   Summary As hemophilia care evolves, current on-demand and prophylactic
   regimens will be optimized. Synovectomy will likely play a larger role
   in the control of synovitis, and validated quality of life scores will
   allow more consistent communication of outcomes. New understanding of
   the molecular mechanism of joint destruction will pave the way for new
   therapeutic options for persons with hemophilia.}},

Journal = {{CHEST}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1682-1689}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Positive relationships between hospital volume and outcomes
   have been demonstrated for several: surgeries and medical conditions.
   However, little is known about the volume-outcome relationship in
   patients admitted to medical ICUs.
   Objective: To determine the relationship between hospital volume and
   risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality for patients admitted to ICUs with
   respiratory, neurologic, and GI disorders.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: Twenty-nine hospitals in a single metropolitan area.
   Patients: Adult ICU admissions from 1991 through 1997.
   Methods: Using Cox proportional hazards models, we compared in-hospital
   mortality between tertiles of hospital volume (high, medium, and low)
   for respiratory (n = 16,949), neurologic (n = 13,805),: and GI (n =
   12,881) diseases after adjusting for age, gender,admission severity, of
   illness, admitting diagnosis, and source. Severity of illness was
   measured using the APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health
   evaluation) III methodology.
   Results: Among respiratory and neurologic ICU admissions, hazard ratios
   were similar (p >= 0.05) in patients in low-, medium-, and high-volume
   hospitals. However, among GI diagnoses, risk of mortality,was lower in
   high-volume hospitals, relative to low-volume hospitals (hazard ratio,
   0.68, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.54 to 0.85; p < 0.001), and,
   was somewhat lower in medium-volume hospitals (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\%
   CI, 0.68 to 1.01, p = 0.06). Among subgroups based on severity of
   illness, high-volume hospitals had lower mortality, relative to
   low-volume hospitals, among sicker patients (APACHE III score > 57) in
   the respiratory cohort (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.59 to 0.99) and
   the GI cohort (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.85).
   Conclusions: Associations between ICU volume and risk-adjusted mortality
   were significant for patients with GI diagnoses and for sicker patients
   with respiratory diagnoses. However, associations were not significant
   for patients with neurologic diagnoses. The lack of a consistent
   volume-outcome relationship may, reflect unmeasured patient complexity,
   in higher-volume hospitals, relative standardization of care across
   ICUs, or lack of effeacy of some accepted ICU processes of care.}},

Abstract = {{Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) were accepted as a
   potential cause of inadequate epoetin response in chronic kidney disease
   (CKD) patients. We aimed to determine the effects of valsartan, an
   angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), on serum ertyhropoietin levels and
   on certain biochemical and haematological parameters in hypertensive CKD
   patients. Twenty-two stage III-IV CKD patients (mean age; 56.8 +/- 8.9
   years, 12 male 10 female) were included in the study. Before initiating
   the treatment, current anti-hypertensive treatments (if any) were
   discontinued, and blood samples were collected after a washout period of
   3 weeks. Valsartan 80 mg/day was started, and additional
   anti-hypertensive agents were given according to study protocol if
   needed. One way Anova and paired t-tests were used for statistical
   comparisons. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid,
   potassium, haemoglobin and erythropoietin values were measured, and
   glomerular filtration rates were calculated before and 3, 6 and 90 days
   after valsartan treatment, a significant reduction in EPO level was
   observed at 3rd (19.6 +/- 24.0 vs. 13.8 +/- 8.5, p = 0.010), 6th (12.1
   +/- 7.6, p = 0.009), and 90th days (8.3 +/- 5.4, p = 0.007). When
   pre-treatment values were compared with 90th day results, no significant
   change was observed in terms of hgb, htc, serum BUN, creatinine, uric
   acid, potassium, and GFR values. In conclusion, valsartan, an ARB, did
   not decrease haemoglobin levels In stage III-IV CKD patients despite
   significant reduction in serum erryhropoietin levels, so ARBs may be
   preferred to ACEIs in CKD patients when indicated.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Many methods of glottic reconstruction have been described
   for patients undergoing vertical partial laryngectomy to reestablish the
   glottic integrity,
   Methods. Fifteen patients with T2 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis
   were included in this prospective clinical trial. All patients were
   treated by vertical partial laryngectomy with laryngeal reconstruction
   by platysma myofascial flap. The surgical procedure and flap design were
   described. Vocal function was assessed by videolaryngostroboscopy and
   subjective and objective voice analysis before and after surgery,
   Results. Complete neoglottic closure and acceptable voice quality were
   obtained by platysma myofascial flap in all cases. No statistically
   significant difference was found between the preoperative and
   postoperative acoustic parameters.
   Conclusions. Platysma myofascial flap provides the basic requirements
   for laryngeal reconstruction with its own favorable characteristics and
   also allows complete glottic closure without interfering with
   respiration and deglutition. This technique may be an effective
   alternative achieving an acceptable quality of voice. (c) 2005 Wiley

Abstract = {{A membrane-filter-based, fluorescent Gram stain method for bacterial
   detection in cerebrospinal fluid samples was developed and evaluated as
   a rapid, sensitive alternative to standard Gram stain protocols. A
   recently developed, modified version of the aluminium oxide membrane
   Anopore with low-fluorescence optical properties showed superior
   performance in this application. Other aspects of the fluorescent Gram
   stain system that were evaluated include membrane filter selection,
   strategies to reduce fluorescence fading and the effect of patient blood
   cells on bacterial detection in the fluorescently stained cerebrospinal
   fluid samples. The combination of the membrane filter's
   bacteria-concentrating ability and absolute retention along with
   high-contrast, fluorescent Gram discriminating dyes enabled rapid
   bacterial detection and Gram discrimination, with a 1 - 1(.)5 order of
   magnitude increase in the bacterial concentration limit of detection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anti-inflammatory action of Antithrombin III (AT III) is
   still not well understood in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In the
   present study, we aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory action of
   AT III on remote lung and local skeletal muscle tissue injury in a rat
   model of bilateral lower limb I/R model.
   Methods: Bilateral lower limb ischemia and reperfusion were produced by
   means of tourniquets occlusions and releases, respectively. Three groups
   of rats were used in this controlled study: sham group (sham, n=3)
   underwent 5 h of anesthesia only; control group (I/R, n=7) underwent 3 h
   of bilateral lower limb ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion; and AT
   III pretreated group (I/R-AT III, n=6) underwent the same procedure as
   the control group, but also received i.v. 250 U kg(-1) AT III 30 min
   before ischemia induction under midazolam and fentanyl anesthesia.
   Measurements and results: Lung and muscle tissue accumulation of
   polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were assessed by measuring tissue
   myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Histopathological changes in tissues
   were assessed by PMN counts in the lung, and muscle tissues and by
   histological lung injury score. Plasma 6-keto prostaglandin F-1 alpha
   and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were measured by an enzyme
   immunoassay technique. Myeloperoxidase activity could not be detected in
   the muscle tissues of all groups. The lung and muscle tissue PMN counts
   in the I/R group were significantly higher compared with the I/R-AT III
   group (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Data from the present study provides some evidence that AT
   III pretreatment attenuates remote lung and local skeletal muscle tissue
   injury caused by lower limb I/R.}},

Title = {{Effects of the 1999 earthquake on the completely blind living in and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL WORK}},
Year = {{2005}},

Pages = {{609+}},

Abstract = {{In August 1999 an earthquake with continuing aftershocks occurred in
   Turkey, causing massive physical destruction, loss of life, and social
   and psychological disturbances. Turkey is situated on one of the active
   earthquake zones; bearing the most risk, both of loss of life and of
   damage (Duyan, 2000). In the last century, Turkey experienced more than
   100 quakes and suffered their effects.
   Disasters create profound changes in humans and their environments.
   People face various events and react to them differently (Karatas,
   2000). According to Hodgkinson and Stewart (1998), reactions to
   disaster, complex as they are, can be understood essentially as the
   reactions of normal human beings to sudden, unexpected and terrifying
   events in their lives. In disasters, generally, people lose loved ones,
   relatives and property. Above all, in psychological terms, they lose
   faith in the fact that life has a certain consistency and meaning. The
   fabric of everyday existence is torn away to reveal death and precarious
   survival. For the survivor, the encounter involves a violation of
   tranquillity. Erol and Oner (1999) indicated that once a disaster has
   happened to individuals, they believe that life cannot ever be the same
   again; that they cannot go safely to bed at night and that they must
   have done something to deserve it. Thus they deal with the question of
   self-esteem and anxiety.
   After an earthquake more specifically, many survivors learn that the
   world is suddenly more unpredictable for them, thus changing the levels
   of anxiety (Barker, 1999) and self-esteem (Hodgkinson and, Stewart,
   1998). Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness, tension and sense of imminent
   danger (Barker, 1999), with trait anxiety as a relatively stable
   personality characteristic, and state anxiety as transient manifest
   feelings of insecurity (Meijer, 2001).
   Self-esteem is defined as the evaluation an individual makes and
   customarily maintains with regard to him- or herself (Coopersmith,
   1967). Self-esteem assessments may be positive or negative. According to
   Barker (1999), self-esteem is derived more from inner thoughts and
   values than from praise and recognition from others.
   After the Marmara earthquake many studies were conducted by different
   disciplines on the effects of that catastrophic event (Canat, 2001;
   Karatas et al., 2001; Kirimli, 2001; Mavili Akta and Duyan, 2001; Uner
   and Ozcebe, 2001; Ta delen, 2001; Tufan et al., 2001). However, none of
   these studies is about people with disabilities in general, and
   individuals with complete loss of sight, in particular. Anecdotally, the
   experience of an earthquake by these individuals has been a profound
   event with psychological outcomes. Thus, this study is pioneering effort
   in its focus. Complete loss of sight is defined by the eye care
   specialists as 100 percent loss of vision and consequent
   darkness.Disasters create profound changes in humans and their
   environments. People face various events and react to them differently
   (Karatas, 2000). According to Hodgkinson and Stewart (1998), reactions
   to disaster, complex as they are, can be understood essentially as the
   reactions of normal human beings to sudden, unexpected and terrifying
   events in their lives. In disasters, generally, people lose loved ones,
   relatives and property. Above all, in psychological terms, they lose
   faith in the fact that life has a certain consistency and meaning. The
   fabric of everyday existence is torn away to reveal death and precarious
   survival. For the survivor, the encounter involves a violation of
   tranquillity. Erol and Oner (1999) indicated that once a disaster has
   happened to individuals, they believe that life cannot ever be the same
   again; that they cannot go safely to bed at night and that they must
   have done something to deserve it. Thus they deal with the question of
   self-esteem and anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of tetraploid wheat and the divergence of diploid ancestors
   of wheat A and D genomes were estimated to have occurred 0.36 and 2.7
   million years ago, respectively. These estimates and the evolutionary
   history of 3159 gene loci were used to estimate the rates with which
   gene loci have been deleted and duplicated during the evolution of wheat
   diploid ancestors and during the evolution of polyploid wheat. During
   diploid evolution, the deletion rate was 2.1 x 10(-3) locus(-1) MY-1 for
   single-copy loci and 1.0 x 10(-2) locus(-1) MY-1 for loci in paralogous
   sets. Loci were duplicated with a rate of 2.9 x 10(-3) locus(-1) MY-1
   during diploid evolution. During polyploid evolution, locus deletion and
   locus duplication rates were 1.8 x 10(-2) and 1.8 x 10(-3) locus(-1)
   MY-1, respectively. Locus deletion and duplication rates correlated
   positively with the distance of the locus from the centromere and the
   recombination rate during diploid evolution. The functions of deleted
   and duplicated loci were inferred to gain insight into the surprisingly
   high rate of deletions of loci present apparently only once in a genome.
   The significance of these findings for genome evolution at the diploid
   and polyploid level is discussed.}},

   pathological changes have been reported in other countries. In
   Venezuela, the disease and its clinical aspects have been studied, but
   the disease has gotten less attention about the relevant gross and
   microscopic changes in vital organs and tissues. Fifteen dogs, 8 males
   and 7 females of various breeds and between 5 and 14 years old were
   necropsied. The gross and microscopic changes from organs and tissues of
   heart, lungs, spleen, liver and kidneys are reported. Blood smears were
   done showing the presence of typical microfilarias and parasitologic
   evaluation of adult forms were also done.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study is the development of a system based on the use
   of the ligninolytic enzyme Manganese Peroxidase (MnP) for the
   degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), of which
   anthracene was selected as an example. A main problem of these compounds
   is their poor solubility in aqueous media. Therefore, the addition of
   different water miscible organic solvents (acetone, methylethyl-ketone,
   methanol and ethanol) was considered as a previous step to increase the
   bioavailability of anthracene. Due to the maximal solubilisation of
   anthracene and the minimum loss of MnP activity, acetone was selected as
   the optimal cosolvent, allowing to enhance 140-fold the anthracene
   solubility for an acetone concentration of 36\% (v/v).
   The in vitro degradation of anthracene by MnP was investigated for
   different concentrations of the main cofactors and substrates that
   affect the catalytic cycle of MnP (Mn2+, H2O2, and organic acids) as
   well as for other environmental parameters (temperature, air/oxygen
   atmosphere and light source). The system attained a nearly complete
   degradation of anthracene, around 100\%, after 6 h of operation under
   optimal conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The H1 histone multigene family shows the greatest diversity of isoforms
   among the five histone gene families, including replication-dependent
   (RD) and replication-independent (RI) genes, according to their
   expression patterns along the cell cycle and their genomic organization.
   Although the molecular characterization of the RI isoforms has been well
   documented in vertebrates, similar information is lacking in
   invertebrates. In this work we provide evidence for a polyadenylation
   signature in the Mytilus ``orphon{''} HI genes similar to the
   polyadenylation characteristic of RI H1 genes. These mussel genes,
   together with the sea urchin H 1 delta genes, are part of a lineage of
   invertebrate ``orphon{''} H1 genes that share several control elements
   with vertebrate RI HI genes. These control elements include the UCE
   element, H1-box and H4-box. We provide evidence for a functional
   evolution of vertebrate and invertebrate RI H1 genes, which exhibit a
   clustering pattern by type instead of by species, with a marked
   difference from the somatic variants. In addition, these genes display
   an extensive silent divergence at the nucleotide level which is always
   significantly larger than the nonsilent. It thus appears that RI and RD
   H1 isoforms display similar long-term evolutionary patterns, best
   described by the birth-and-death model of evolution. Notably, this
   observation is in contrast with the theoretical belief that clustered RD
   H1 genes evolve in a concerted manner. The split of the RI group from
   the main RD group must therefore have occurred before the divergence
   between vertebrates and invertebrates about 815 million years ago. This
   was the result of the transposition of HI genes to solitary locations in
   the genome.}},

Abstract = {{The current study is a part of an extensive research program conducted
   to assess the use of Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) sheets in
   enhancing the flexural capacity of steel beams. The properties of a
   heavy-duty adhesive system that can be used to bond GFRP sheets to the
   flanges of steel beams were experimentally determined in a previous
   study. The excellent performance of a W-shaped steel beam strengthened
   using GFRP sheets has encouraged the authors to assess the applicability
   of this technique to composite steel bridges.
   The dimensions and cross section properties of a real composite steel
   plate girder bridge are considered in a case study analysis. A detailed
   nonlinear numerical model is developed for the bridge before and after
   attaching GFRP sheets to the bottom flange of its steel girders.
   Nonlinear moving load analyses are first conducted to determine the
   critical truck locations that will lead to maximum GFRP axial stresses,
   and maximum adhesive shear and peel stresses. Using these
   configurations, nonlinear analyses are then conducted to assess the
   increase in the bridge capacity that can be achieved by bonding 38 mm
   GFRP sheet to the bottom flange of its steel girders.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Goal: To assess the sensitivity/specificity of the serologic markers:
   perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and
   antisaccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) in children diagnosed with
   inflammatory bowel disease (11313), living in West Virginia.
   Background: in recent years, serologic markers have been used to
   differentiate between CD and UC diseases in children. The clinical
   usefulness of these markers in children was restricted by their low
   sensitivity and specificity. Racial and ethnic diversity may alter the
   accuracy of these markers in children. The demographic homogeneity of
   the West Virginia population may offer a better clinical setup to
   reassess the utility of those markers in children with IBD.
   Study: A retrospective analysis of all the charts of children diagnosed
   with IBD was performed at the gastroenterology clinics of Marshall
   University, Huntington, WV; and West Virginia University, Charleston
   Division, Charleston, WV The diagnosis of IBD was established according
   to clinical, radiologic, and endoscopic data. Laboratory data and serum
   markers were recorded, and their accuracy to diagnose UC or CD was
   assessed.
   Results: A total of 101 charts were reviewed, of which only 90 (89\%)
   included serologic markers and were considered for further analysis.
   Disease distribution included: UC-41, CD-44, and indeterminate colitis
   (IC)-7 (2 patients changed diagnosis after colectomy). Serum antibody
   pANCA had a sensitivity of 73\% and specificity of 84\% for UC, but only
   16\% and 35\% for CD, respectively. Serum antibody ASCA had a
   sensitivity of 58\% and specificity of 92\% for CD, but only 7\% and
   49\% for UC, respectively. The outer membrane porin to Escherichia coli
   antibody (anti-OmpC was available in 54 (59\%) children and demonstrated
   a very poor sensitivity for both diseases (sensitivity < 11\%).
   Conclusion: Despite our homogeneous patient population, pANCA and ASCA
   antibodies had an inadequate sensitivity/specificity for children with
   UC or CD. Those antibodies were not useful for our small number of
   patients with IC.}},

Abstract = {{Two phase 3, double-blind studies in hospitalized adults with
   complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI) determined the
   safety and efficacy of tigecycline versus that of vancomycin-aztreonam.
   Patients received tigecycline (100 mg, followed by 50 mg intravenously
   twice daily) or vancomycin (1 g intravenously twice daily) plus
   aztreonam (2 g intravenously twice daily) for up to 14 days. Populations
   were as follows: 1116 patients (566 treated with tigecycline, and 550
   treated with vancomycin-aztreonam) constituted the modified
   intent-to-treat (mITT) population, 1057 patients (538 treated with
   tigecycline, and 519 treated with vancomycin-aztreonam) constituted the
   clinical mITT (c-mITT) population, and 833 patients (422 treated with
   tigecycline, and 411 treated with vancomycin-aztreonam) constituted the
   clinically evaluable population. Clinical responses to tigecycline and
   vancomycin-aztreonam at test-of-cure were similar: c-mITT, 79.7\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI], 76.1\%-83.1\%) versus 81.9\% (95\% CI,

   82.9\%-89.6\%) versus 88.6\% (95\% CI, 85.1\%-91.5\%) (P = .4233).
   Adverse events were similar, with increased nausea and vomiting in the
   tigecycline group and increased rash and elevated hepatic
   aminotransferase levels in the vancomycin-aztreonam group. Tigecycline
   monotherapy is as safe and efficacious as the vancomycin-aztreonam
   combination in treating patients with cSSSI.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. - A multicentric study of practice was carried out in the
   laboratories of 95 french hospitals belonging to the college of
   bacteriology virology hygiene (ColBVH).
   Methods. - It consisted of the study of two quality control yeast
   strains, that had to be identified and whose antifungal susceptibility
   had to be tested using the techniques usually applied in these
   laboratories.
   Results. - The first, Candida krusei ATCC 6258 was correctly identified
   in 90\% of the cases and the second, Condida paropsilosis ATCC 22019 in
   93\%. The majority of the participants, 67/95 (70\%), tested at least
   one molecule and 24\% tested four molecules: amphotericine B (AMB),
   5-fluorocytosine (5FC), fluconazole (FCZ) and itraconazole (ITZ).
   Conclusion. - The great variability of the results of minimal inhibitory
   concentrations and clinical categorization obtained underlines the need
   for the biologists to profit from recommendations concerning the
   indication, the choice and the interpretation of the techniques used for
   testing antifungaL susceptibility. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits

Title = {{Long-term preservation of high endocytic activity in primary cultures of

Abstract = {{Together with Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs)
   constitute the most powerful scavenger system in the body. However,
   studies on LSEC function are hampered by the fact that the cells lose
   their scavenger ability and start deteriorating after a few days in
   culture. The purpose of the present study was to improve the conditions
   of cultivation to prolong the survival of pig LSECs in vitro. We used
   the high capacity receptor-mediated endocytosis of soluble waste
   molecules as a marker for functionally intact cells in the Cultures.
   Compared with two commercially-, and two other media specifically
   designed for use with either SECs or hepatocytes from rat, our newly
   developed serum-free medium, DM 110/SS, devoid of any components of
   animal origin, was superior in maintaining the endocytic activity. Of
   six growth factors studied for their effect on endocytosis, basic
   fibroblast, and recombinant epidermal, but not vascular endothelial
   growth factor, were found to be most beneficial. After 8 days in DM
   110/SS, LSECs maintained endocytosis via the scavenger receptor, mannose
   receptor, collagen a-chain receptor and the Fc-gamma receptor. All
   endocytosed ligands, except for aggregated IgG were degraded in
   8-day-old cultures. Using the new medium, the cells endocytosed ligands
   for up to 20 days, and survived for at least an additional 10 days,
   albeit without the high endocytic activity typical of intact LSECs.
   Importantly, DNA synthesis in prolonged cultures of LSECs was observed
   only when maintained in DM 110/SS medium. In conclusion, we describe a
   protocol for the maintenance of LSECs in culture for the longest period
   yet reported. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

   diabetes risk estimates}},
Journal = {{PEDIATRIC DIABETES}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{136-144}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR,DQ genotypes have
   been associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) risk, although it
   is unknown whether the association is due to alleles, haplotypes,
   genotypes, the formation of heterodimers, or all of the above. To
   characterize the role of the HLA-DR,DQ genotype and ethnicity on the
   onset age of T1DM, we analyzed these factors in patients with T1DM and
   the general population.
   Methods: One thousand three hundred twenty-two well-characterized
   patients with T1DM were compared with 3339 children from the general
   population of Denver, Colorado, USA. Because of the extensive available
   data across age and ethnic groups, this study population is unique.
   Results: The HLA-DR3/4,DQB1{*}0302, DRX/4,DQB1{*}0302 (where X = 1, 4,
   8, and 9), and HLA-DR3/3 genotypes were associated with T1DM, supporting
   previous research. Additionally, the DR3/9 genotype showed a positive
   association with T1DM, which has not previously been described in
   Caucasian populations. The HLA-DR3/4{*}0302 genotype was most strongly
   associated with T1DM in diabetic individuals with the youngest onset
   age. Genotype frequencies were similar between Hispanics and
   non-Hispanic whites, except for the DR3/3 genotype, which was more
   likely to be found in non-Hispanic whites.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that there are multiple alleles and
   genotypes associated with T1DM and that the risk associated with
   different genetic markers depends on the age of disease onset,
   suggesting that some markers may be involved in more rapid disease
   progression.}},

Abstract = {{Because the enamel adjacent to brackets may be affected by
   microorganisms, an antibacterial adhesive may be a useful choice to
   prevent and reduce demineralization. The purpose of this in vitro study
   was to determine the (1) shear bond strength of a self-etch and an
   antibacterial self-etch adhesive for orthodontic metal brackets and (2)
   bond failure interface of a self-etch and an antibacterial self-etch
   adhesive using a modified adhesive remnant index (ARI). Twenty-four
   defect-free premolars were randomly assigned into two groups. The teeth
   received the following treatments-group 1: Transbond Plus Self-Etching
   Primer + Transbond XT; group 2: antibacterial dentin bonding system
   (ABF) + Transbond XT. All samples were stored in deionized water at 37
   degrees C for 48 hours. Shear debonding tests were performed at a
   crosshead speed of five mm/min. The results in megapascals were (median,
   minimum, maximum) group 1: 8.53, 4.59, 12.63; group 2: 9.79, 4.01,
   22.10, respectively. Mann-Whitney test revealed that the difference
   between the groups was not statistically significant (P = .2, P > .05).
   Failed brackets were examined by an optical microscope at 16X
   magnification to determine the bond failure interface using a modified
   ARI The predominant mode of failure for both groups was at the
   bracket-adhesive interface. ABF may have sufficient mechanical
   properties and also an antibacterial effect that makes it a good choice
   for orthodontic bonding.}},

Journal = {{CATALYSIS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{43-52}},

Abstract = {{Supported Au catalysts are investigated for the oxidation of primary
   alcohols under solvent-free conditions in the absence of base. Three
   representative primary alcohols have been investigated: benzyl alcohol,
   octan-1-ol and geraniol using a range of supports for gold nanocrystals
   prepared using coprecipitation, deposition precipitation and
   impregnation. For benzyl alcohol and octan-1-ol selective oxidation to
   the corresponding aldehydes is observed, particularly with Au/CeO2,
   whereas for more acidic supports, e.g. Fe2O3, subsequent oxidation of
   the aldehydes to the corresponding acids, forming an ester (benzyl
   benzoate, octyl octanoate, respectively) by reaction with the alcohol,
   by a standard acid-catalysed mechanism. Alternatively, the mechanism of
   ester generation could involve hemiacetal formation between the aldehyde
   and residual alcohol, followed by direct oxidation to the observed
   ester. The reaction of geraniol is much more complex and the reaction is
   carried out in the presence and absence of acids to gain a full
   understanding of the interplay between oxidation and isomerisation
   reactions. Comparison with other active catalysts reveals that using Au
   catalysts in solvent free conditions gives very high turnover
   frequencies for the synthesis of the aldehydes with 100\% selectivity
   (150 h(-1) and 26 h(-1) for benzyl alcohol and octan-1-ol,
   respectively), which are comparable to the best reported to date for
   these reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Surgery in cervical spine disease using titanium cages is a common
   procedure to reduce the pain and neurological deficits. This study was
   aimed to evaluate the results in pain reduction using the wing cage
   intraoperatively. Method: In this prospective study demographic data
   were noted, whereas special emphasis was placed on pain, which was noted
   using a visual pain scale and the prolo score, neurological deficits and
   the causing pathology. Furthermore, questions about the use of
   analgesics and the duration of pain were asked. After operation with
   insertion of a wing cage instead of the disk, a neurological
   investigation 6,12 and 24 months later was done to evaluate the
   postoperative status. Results: 54 patients underwent a cervical
   discectomy in 64 segments as therapy for neck pain or a radiculopathy
   caused by osteochondrosis or disc disorder. Patients with brachialgia
   profited most from the operation. Less improvement was seen in cases of
   osteochondrosis or combined pathology. Conclusion: Patients with pain
   caused by discs in the cervical spine, have better improvement than
   patients with other pathologies. This should be taken into account when
   choosing the mode of therapy.}},

Abstract = {{End-product feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was first
   demonstrated in living animals by Schoenheimer 72 years ago. Current
   studies define Insig proteins as essential elements of this feedback
   system in mouse liver. In cultured cells, Insig proteins are required
   for sterol-mediated inhibition of the processing of sterol regulatory
   element-binding proteins (SREBPs) to their nuclear forms. We produced
   mice with germline disruption of the Insig2 gene and Cre-mediated
   disruption of the Insig1 gene in liver. On a chow diet, these
   double-knockout mice overaccumulated cholesterol and triglycerides in
   liver. Despite this accumulation, levels of nuclear SREBPs and mRNAs for
   SREBP target genes in lipogenic pathways were not reduced. Whereas
   cholesterol feeding reduced nuclear SREBPs and lipogenic mRNAs in
   wild-type mice, this feedback response was severely blunted in the
   double-knockout mice, and synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids was
   not repressed. The amount of HMG-CoA reductase protein was elevated out
   of proportion to the mRNA in the double-knockout mice, apparently owing
   to the failure of cholesterol to accelerate degradation of the enzyme.
   These studies indicate that the essential elements of the regulatory
   pathway for lipid synthesis function in liver as they do in cultured
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{This classic text reproduces Emil Kraepelin's inaugural lecture at the
   University of Dorpat in 1887. It represents one of the most succinct
   contemporary surveys of German psychiatric discourse in the 1880s. It
   also outlines Kraepelin's own research priorities in the early years of
   his career, providing important historical background to the motives
   that drove him to place such great emphasis on (and hope in)
   experimental psychology. Contrary to our contemporary image of Kraepelin
   as a grand clinical nosologist, this text shows that he was much more of
   a diagnostician and experimental psychologist than historians have
   generally assumed. ne document also reflects a wider `psychological
   turn' in German psychiatry, away from patho-anatomic study - a turn that
   has often been overlooked in the historiographic literature.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE Although patient-centered communication is associated with
   improved health and patient trust, information about the impact of
   patient-centered communication on health care costs is limited. We
   studied the relationship between patient-centered communication and
   diagnostic testing expenditures.
   METHODS We, undertook an observational cross-sectional study using
   covert standardized patient visits to study physician interaction style
   and its relationship to diagnostic testing costs. Participants were 100
   primary-care physicians in the Rochester, NY, area participating in a
   large managed care organization (MCO). Audio recordings of 2
   standardized patient encounters for each physician were rated using the
   Measure of Patient-Centered Communication (MPCC). Standardized
   diagnostic testing and other expenditures, adjusted for patient
   demographics and case-mix, were derived from the MCO claims database.
   Analyses were adjusted for demographics and standardized patient
   detection.
   RESULTS Compared with other physicians, those who had MPCC scores in the
   lowest tercile had greater standardized diagnostic testing expenditures
   (11.0\% higher, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 4.5\%-17.8\%) and
   greater total standardized expenditures (3.5\% higher, 95\% CI,
   1.0\%-6.1\%). Whereas lower MPCC scores were associated with shorter
   visits, adjustment for visit length and standardized patient detection
   did not affect the relationship with expenditures. Total (testing,
   ambulatory and hospital care) expenditures were also greater for
   physicians who had lower MPCC scores, an effect primarily associated
   with the effect on testing expenditures.
   CONCLUSIONS Patient-centered communication is associated with fewer
   diagnostic testing expenditures but also with increased visit length.
   Because costs and visit length may affect physicians' and health
   systems' willingness to endorse and practice a patient-centered
   approach, these results should be confirmed in future randomized trials.}},

Abstract = {{Pilonidal sinus disease is a common problem of sacrococcygeal region.
   However, it is also observed in the periumbilical area. There are only a
   few reports about umbilical pilonidal sinus in the literature. In this
   study, 26 patients (24 men (92 \%), 2 women (8 \%) with a mean age of 22
   years) with umbilical pilonidal sinus disease were included.
   Predisposing factors, patient characteristics, treatment modalities, and
   their results have been studied. Male sex, young age, hairiness, deep
   navel, and poor personal hygiene were found to be predisposing factors.
   Twenty-five patients were treated conservatively. However, two patients
   failed to respond to conservative treatment. Those patients underwent
   surgery where umbilectomy was carried out without reconstruction. One
   patient was also operated on for the preoperative misdiagnosis of
   irreducible umbilical hernia. Patients were followed for 14-96 months.
   We recommend conservative treatment in patients with umbilical pilonidal
   sinus. Surgery should be performed in recurrent cases resistant to
   conservative treatment. The importance of differential diagnosis of
   umbilical pilonidal sinus from other umbilical pathologies is also
   emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the current study was to assess the reliability of two enzyme
   immunoassays in detecting the Helicobacter pylori status of stool
   specimens of Turkish dyspeptic patients in the post-treatment period.
   Forty-eight patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia who were positive for H.
   pylori underwent a 1 week regimen of triple therapy. Stool samples of
   patients were obtained 2 and 6 weeks after eradication therapy and a
   {[}C-13]urea breath test was performed 6 weeks after therapy in order to
   assess the reliability of mAb-based (Amplified IDEIA HpStAR,
   DakoCytomation) and polyclonal-antiserum-based (Premier Platinum HpSA,
   Meridian Diagnostics) stool antigen test kits and to compare their
   diagnostic accuracies. Using a minimum cutoff OD450 value of 0.19 for
   Amplified IDEIA HpStAR and 0(.)16 for Premier Platinum HpSA the
   sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
   value and diagnostic accuracy of the tests were determined 2 and 6 weeks
   after completion of eradication therapy. At both the second and the
   sixth week in the post-treatment period the diagnostic accuracy of
   Amplified IDEIA HpStAR was significantly better than the Premier
   Platinum's (75\% versus 50\%, chi(2) = 6(.)4; P = 0(.)011, and 90\%
   versus 69\%, chi(2) = 6(.)316; P = 0(.)012, respectively). In light of
   these findings the mAb-based Amplified IDEIA HpStAR has a high
   diagnostic accuracy for H. pylori infection in Turkish dyspeptic

Abstract = {{Concentrations of trace metallic element as well as macronutrients were
   measured in water and plants from pond water. The aquatic macrophyte
   Salvinia sp. was evaluated for its trace metals removal potential in
   river water under laboratory conditions. The experiment were performed
   using several healthy acclimatized plants Salvinia sp. The water and
   grown plants were collected from ponds. For the trace element removals
   test, 30-35 grams of fresh aquatic plants were grown in river water into
   a greenhouse for ten weeks. Control plants were also grown during the
   experiment. Every two weeks, both plants and water samples were
   collected. After the end of each experiment, the growth rate was
   calculated. Trace element concentrations in plants and pond water were
   obtained using TXRF techniques. Values for the elements (K, Ca, Ti, Fe,
   Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn and Sr) concentrations in plant dry weight have been
   obtained after deducting metal contents of control plants. For each
   trace element, the aquatic Salvinia sp. plant showed to possess
   different affinity for the incorporation of the metals in its biomass.
   Results suggest the use of aquatic macrophytes Salvinia sp. for metal
   abatement in dilute wastewaters.}},

   and biological current interest. The present work describes the
   preparation and chelating properties of a new
   hydroxy-pyrimidinone-functionalized silica, (HOPY-PrN)-Si, with high
   affinity for hard metal ions. The new chelating matrix was obtained by
   coupling a 1-hydroxy-2-(1H)-pyrimidinone derivative, HOPY-PrN, to an
   epoxy-activated silica. It showed good stability at neutral and acidic
   conditions and high sequestering capacity for hard metal ions, namely
   Fe3+ and Al3+, as previously found for the corresponding sepharosic
   derivative. However, the fact that the present silica-gel derivative is
   considerably less expensive gives support to its potential interest as a
   sorbent of traces of toxic hard metal ions from water streams or even
   from physiological fluids, aided by extracorporeal devices containing
   the immobilized chelator. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   functional activation in the brain}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We have developed a novel near-infrared optical topography system that
   can acquire images of functional activation in the human brain at 10
   frames per second using 32 detectors. The image acquisition rate is
   inversely proportional to the number of detectors, so the maximum
   acquisition rate using four detectors is 80 Hz. 16 laser diode sources
   (8 at 785 and 8 at 850 nm) are illuminated simultaneously, and each of 8
   avalanche photodiode detectors records light from several sources at the
   same time. The contribution from each source is demultiplexed in
   software using fast Fourier transforms. This allows for a more flexible,
   smaller, and less complex system than is achievable using traditional
   hardware demodulation techniques, such as lock-in amplifiers. The system
   will eventually incorporate a total of 64 sources and 32 detectors,
   enabling the entire adult cortex to be imaged. The system is designed to
   be as flexible as possible, and to be applicable to a wide variety of
   experimental and clinical needs. To this end, it can operate in two
   distinct modes: As a frequency multiplexed system and as a time
   multiplexed system. We describe phantom and in vivo investigations that
   have been undertaken using the new instrument in its frequency
   multiplexed operating mode. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Epidermal Langerhans cells are the outmost guards of our immune defence
   system. These cells are directly involved in phenomena such as contact
   hypersensitivity and UV-induced immunosuppression. Some years ago we
   succeeded in introducing CD34(+)-derived Langerhans cells into a
   reconstructed human epidermis. Here we describe their reactivity after
   topical exposure of the reconstructed epidermis to known allergens,
   allergen-inducible cytokines, irritants and UV irradiation. Exposure to
   allergens for 24 h resulted in an activated appearance of the Langerhans
   cells and in some cases a decrease in their number. Concomitantly, IL-1
   beta and CD86 mRNA over-expressions were detected in the reconstructed
   epidermis. A topical treatment with TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta revealed that
   both cytokines induced an activated appearance of the Langerhans cells
   as early as 4 h following application. Irritants had no effect on the
   integrated Langerhans cells. Exposure of the reconstructed epidermis to
   Solar Simulated Radiation caused a dramatic decrease in the number of
   Langerhans cells and a loss of dendricity in the remaining cells 24 h
   after irradiation. The topical application of a large spectrum UVA/B
   filter before irradiation prevented these UV-induced alterations. In our
   hands, this model provides a promising tool to evaluate the
   sensitization potential of new compounds and to validate the efficacy of
   sunscreens to prevent UV-induced immunosuppression. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{While research demonstrates that parental tobacco and alcohol use

   Based upon self-reported information from Australian adolescents, their

   between siblings' tobacco and alcohol use. The relationship is
   consistent, moderately strong, and remains significant when controlling
   for a number of family-related factors, indicating that the shared
   environment cannot fully explain the extent of similarity in siblings'
   behaviors. In addition, sibling substance use has a greater effect on
   adolescent substance use than does smoking or drinking by parents. These
   findings indicate the need to include siblings and information regarding

Abstract = {{We perform MHD simulations in a spherical geometry of the evolution of
   the three-dimensional coronal magnetic field as a twisted magnetic flux
   tube emerges slowly into the low-beta corona previously occupied by a
   potential arcade. We study the evolution of the emerged flux rope in the
   corona as its twist and magnetic energy increases due to flux emergence.
   We find two distinct stages of the evolution. The earlier evolution is
   nearly quasi-static, with the flux rope being able to settle into an
   neighboring equilibrium when the emergence is stopped. When the twist in
   the emerged flux rope reaches some critical level, the flux rope is
   found to undergo kink motion and erupt through the arcade field at a
   localized region, with most of the arcade field remaining closed. The
   nonlinear evolution of the kink instability facilitates the loss of
   confinement of the flux rope by changing its orientation at the apex
   such that it becomes easier for the flux rope to part and erupt through
   the arcade. The eruption of the writhing flux rope produces prominence
   field with Lambda-shaped and cross-legged morphologies that have been
   seen in the cores of some CMEs.}},

Title = {{High spatial variation tropospheric model for GPS-data simulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{58}},

Pages = {{459-470}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Precise GPS simulated data requires accurate simulation of the two major
   sources of error in GPS measurements, namely the ionospheric and
   tropospheric delays. The ionospheric delay modelling has been handled in
   a previous work (Farah, 2002). In this paper the simulation of the
   tropospheric delay is discussed. The suggested model should be accurate
   in estimating the tropospheric delay as well as capable of simulating
   high spatial variations of the troposphere resulting in more realistic
   simulated GPS data. In this paper, the EGNOS tropospheric correction
   model is considered as a possible tool for simulating the tropospheric
   delay in order to obtain more realistic simulated GPS data. Comparing
   the total tropospheric zenith delays from the EGNOS model with the
   CODE-tropo spheric product has allowed the quality of the EGNOS model to
   be assessed. Four IGS-tracking stations have been selected for this
   study. Data from four non-consecutive weeks in different seasons over a
   period of one year were tested to assess the seasonal variation of the
   weather conditions. It is shown that the EGNOS model agrees well with
   the CODE-estimations with a mean zenith delay difference of
   approximately 2 cm. The maximum zenith delay difference between the
   EGNOS model and the CODE-estimations was in the range of 5 cm to 16 cm,
   which agrees well with previous studies. A second study has investigated
   the behaviour of the EGNOS model with other established tropospheric
   models such as the Saastamoinen, the Hopfield, the Marini and the Magnet
   model for three IGS-stations. It can be concluded from this study that
   the EGNOS model shows better agreement with the IGS estimations than the
   Magnet model and compares well with other models. The major shortcoming
   in the EGNOS model is its inability to simulate the variations in the
   troposphere over small regions. This shortcoming could be overcome by
   using the theory of Gaussian Random Fields, which has been previously
   used to model real life phenomena such as surface roughness (Chan,
   1999). This paper was first presented at ION GPS 2003, the 16th
   Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of
   Navigation held at Portland Oregon, USA.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence indicates an immunosuppressive role of the
   thymus-derived CD4(+) T-cell population constitutively expressing high
   level of CD25, T regulatory (Treg) cells, in autoimmune diseases. Here
   we show that the number of Treg cells in the blood is significantly
   lower in untreated myasthenia gravis patients than in age-matched
   healthy subjects, whereas it is normal or elevated in patients on
   immunosuppressive therapy (prednisone frequently associated with
   azathioprine). Therapeutic thymectomy (Tx) for either the thymoma or
   non-neoplastic thymic alterations that are often associated with
   myasthenia gravis provided unique material for studying intrathymic Treg
   cells and correlating them with their peripheral counterparts. We
   observed that Tx prevents the increase of Treg cells in the circulation
   that follows immunosuppressive therapy (particularly evident if the
   thymus is not neoplastic), indicating that the thymus contributes to
   Treg-cell normalization. However, thymic Treg cells are not modulated by
   immunosuppressive therapy and even in thymectomized patients Treg-cell
   numbers in the blood eventually recover. The present findings suggest
   that a deficiency in Treg cells favours the development of myasthenia
   gravis and that their normalization is an important clinical benefit of
   immunosuppressive therapy. Treg normalization appears to be largely
   thymus independent and possibly reflects the reported capacity of
   corticosteroids to promote Treg-cell development.}},

Abstract = {{The function of the middle ear is to resolve the acoustic impedance
   mismatch between the air in the ear canal and the fluid of the inner
   ear. Without this impedance matching, very little acoustic energy would
   be absorbed into the cochlea. The first step in this process is the
   tympanic membrane (TM) converting sound in the ear canal into vibrations
   of the middle ear bones. Understanding how the TM manages its task so
   successfully over such a broad frequency range should lead to more
   satisfactory and less variable TM repairs (myringoplasty). In addition,
   understanding the mechanics of the TM is necessary to improve the
   coupling between ossicular prostheses and the TM. Mathematical models
   have played a central role in helping the research community understand
   the mechanics of the eardrum. However, all models require parameters as
   inputs. Unfortunately, most of the parameters needed for modeling the TM
   are not well known. In this work, several approaches for inferring the
   material properties of the TM are explored. First, constitutive modeling
   is used to estimate an elastic modulus based on the elastic modulus of
   collagen and experimentally observed fiber densities. Second,
   experimental tension and bending test results from the literature are
   re-interpreted using composite laminate theory. Lastly, dynamic
   measurements of the cat TM are used in conjunction with a composite
   shell model to bound the material parameters. Values from the
   literature, both measurement and modeling efforts, and from the present
   analysis are brought together to form a coherent picture of the TM's
   material properties. In the human, the data bound the elastic modulus
   between 0.1 and 0.3 GPa. In the cat, the data suggest a range of 0.1-0.4
   GPa. These values are significantly higher than previous estimates. (C)

Abstract = {{The present experiment investigates the involvement of awareness in
   functional dissociations between explicit and implicit tests. In the
   explicit condition, participants attempted to recall lexically or
   semantically studied words using word stems. In the implicit condition,
   they were instructed to complete each stem with the first word which
   came to mind. Subjective awareness was subsequently measured on an
   item-by-item basis. As voluntary retrieval strategies are known to be
   time consuming, the time taken to complete each stein was recorded. In
   the explicit task, semantically studied words were associated with
   higher levels of recall and faster response times than lexically studied
   words. By contrast, in the implicit task, these effects failed to reach
   significance, although deep encoding made the contents of memory more
   accessible to awareness. As expected, performance was slower in the
   explicit than in the implicit task, but in the latter condition, times
   to produce old words with and without awareness were comparable, and
   both of these responses were produced more quickly than control words.
   This finding suggests that although participants may become aware in
   implicit paradigms, they do not adopt voluntary retrieval strategies.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Most mammals experience cardiac arrest during hypothermia. In
   contrast, hibernators remain in sinus rhythm even at body temperatures
   of 0 degrees C.
   OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to quantify electrical activity
   and connexin expression in the heart of hibernating Siberian ground
   squirrel Citellus undulatus.
   METHODS Optical imaging and microelectrode recordings were conducted in
   Langendorff-perfused hearts and isolated papillary muscles of summer
   active (SA, n = 19), winter hibernating (WH, n 2 1), interbout arousal
   (IBA, n = 12), and winter active (WA, n = 3) ground squirrels and
   rabbits (n 14) at temperatures from +37 degrees C to +3 degrees C.
   RESULTS All studied SA and WH hearts maintained spontaneous sinus
   rhythm, safe propagation through the entire conduction system, and
   normal pattern of ventricular excitation at all temperatures. However,
   three of the seven IBA and all rabbit hearts lost excitability at 10
   degrees C +/- 1 degrees C and 12 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C,
   respectively. In WH, SA, and IBA ground squirrels, temperature reduction
   from 37 degrees C to 3 degrees C resulted in a 10-fold slowing of
   ventricular conduction velocity and increased excitation threshold. At
   any temperature, WH ventricles had faster conduction velocity and lower
   excitation threshold compared with SA and IBA. Immunolabeling
   demonstrated that connexin43 (Cx43) was significantly upregulated in WH
   and WA compared with SA myocardium: Cx43 area density was 12.4 +/- 1.3,
   15.0 +/- 3.0 and 8.6 +/- 1.1 mu m(2)/1,000 mu m(2), respectively.
   Moreover, Cx45 was expressed in the WH but not in the SA or WA
   ventricles.
   CONCLUSION Hibernator Citellus undulatus has evolved to maintain safe
   conduction at extreme hypothermia via up-regulation of Cx43 and Cx45 in
   order to protect the heart against arrhythmia associated with
   hypothermia.}},

Abstract = {{The hitherto poorly known type species of Cyrtosymbole, i.e., Dechenella
   escoti, is redescribed on the basis of an abundant new material
   recovered from the early Famennian Lower Griotte Limestone Formation at
   La Touriere, near Cabrieres, southern France. It includes sclerites
   (hypostome, librigenae, thoracic segments and external surface of the
   pygidium) that previously were either unknown, or represented by poorly
   preserved and incomplete specimens, together with a full suite of
   post-protaspid growth stages. The latter has revealed that certain
   characters, in particular the preglabellar region and postocular facial
   sutures, show marked changes between the early and late holaspid stages.
   In the past, some species have been based on immature specimens; for
   example the lectotype of C. escoti is an early holaspis, and the
   characters that it displays have been regarded as diagnostic of the
   genus. For confident specific assignments in cyrtosymboline trilobites
   it is important, therefore, to have to hand sufficient material,
   including late holaspids. A revised diagnosis of Cyrtosymbole is given,
   and only those species that share diagnostic adult characters with C.
   escoti are assigned to it. Insights into early growth development
   exemplified by C. escoti and allies corroborate the attribution of the
   Cyrtosymbolinae to the Proetidae.}},

Abstract = {{At least three different definitions of fuel processor efficiency are in
   widespread use in the fuel cell industry. In some instances the
   different definitions are qualitatively the same and differ only in
   their quantitative values. However, in certain limiting cases, the
   different efficiency definitions exhibit qualitatively different trends
   as system parameters are varied. In one limiting case that will be
   presented, the use of the wrong efficiency definition can lead a process
   engineer to believe that a theoretical maximum in fuel processor
   efficiency exists at a particular operating condition, when in fact no
   such efficiency optimum exists. For these reasons, the objectives of
   this paper are to: (1) quantitatively compare and contrast these
   different definitions, (2) highlight the advantages and disadvantages of
   each definition and (3) recommend the correct definition of fuel
   processor efficiency. (c) 2005 International Association for Hydrogen

Abstract = {{1 PAF injection into the rat paw is accompanied by the concomitant
   activation of NF-kappa B and neutrophil influx, which appears to be
   relevant to the up-regulation of kinin B1 receptors. Herein, we analyse
   the role of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta production for PAF-induced B1
   receptor upregulation in the rat paw. Additionally, we evaluate how
   cytokine production and neutrophil migration fit into the temporal
   sequence of events leading to PAF-induced B1 receptor upregulation.
   2 In our experiments, treatment with PAF resulted in a marked increase
   of B1 receptor-mediated paw oedema and in situ production of TNF-alpha
   at 1 h and IL-1 beta at 3 and 6 h later. B1 receptor-mediated paw oedema
   was significantly inhibited by anti-TNF-alpha antibody and by
   interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( IRA).
   3 TNF-alpha was necessary for the local PAF-induced IL-1 beta
   production. NF-kB blocker PDTC prevented the production of both
   TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, indicating that cytokine production is NF-kappa
   B dependent.
   4 Depletion of neutrophils with an anti-PMN antibody prevented IL-1
   beta, but not TNF-alpha, production. Although both TNF-alpha and IL-1
   beta are relevant to functional B1 receptor upregulation, PAF-induced
   increase in B1 receptor mRNA was markedly suppressed by anti-TNF-alpha
   and, to a lesser extent, by IRA. B1 receptor mRNA expression was also
   prevented by the anti-PMN antibody.
   5 In conclusion, the activation of the TNF-alpha/neutrophil axis by PAF
   seems to be sufficient for B1 receptor mRNA production. However, the
   TNF-alpha/neutrophil axis is also necessary for IL-1 beta production.
   These two processes might lead to the appearance of functional kinin B1
   upregulation receptors in vivo after PAF treatment.}},

   1,2,5-oxadiazole N-oxides and some physicochemical properties
   potentially related with this bioactivity, such as polarity, molecular
   volume, proton acceptor ability, lipophilicity, and reduction potential
   were studied. The semiempirical molecular orbital method AMI was used to
   calculate theoretical descriptors such as dipolar moment, molecular
   volume, Mulliken's charge and the octanol/water partition coefficients
   (log P-o/w). The values of the reduction potentials (E-r) were obtained
   by cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the retention factors (log k'(w)) on
   a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) column
   in pure aqueous mobile phases were measured for several N-oxide
   derivatives. The log k'w values show good correlation with the
   calculated values of log P-o/w, showing that the chromatographic
   parameter can be used as lipophilicity descriptor for these compounds.
   The multiple regression analysis between the descriptors for the N-oxide
   derivatives and the herbicide activity indicate that the variance in the
   biological activity can be explained by changes in the lipophilicity and
   in the reduction potential.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary fatty acids have a considerable effect on plasma LDL cholesterol
   (LDL-C) concentrations and therefore on the risk for coronary heart
   disease. Numerous studies have been conducted in animal models to
   elucidate the mechanisms by which different types of fatty acids
   modulate plasma cholesterol concentrations. In addition, multiple
   clinical trials and epidemiological data have demonstrated the effects
   of fatty acids in determining the concentrations of circulating LDL.
   SFAs and trans fatty acids have a detrimental effect on plasma lipids,
   whereas PUFAs of the (n-6) family and monounsaturated fatty acids
   decrease plasma LDL-C concentrations. Among the SFAs, stearic acid
   (18:0) appears to have a neutral effect on LDLC, while lauric (12:0),
   myristic (14:0), and palmitic (16:0) acids are considered to be
   hypercholesterolemic. SFAs increase plasma LDL-C by increasing the
   formation of LDL in the plasma compartment and by decreasing LDL
   turnover. Although unsaturated fatty acids increase cholesterol
   synthesis, they also increase hepatic LDL receptor number and LDL
   turnover in vivo. Fatty acids are also ligands of important regulatory
   elements, which can play a role in determining plasma cholesterol. This
   article presents a summary of the major effects of various types of
   fatty acids on plasma lipid concentrations and the mechanisms involved.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Dual-chamber rate-modulated pacing provides haemodynamic
   benefits compared with ventricular pacing at rest, but it is unclear
   whether this also holds true during physical exercise in patients with
   heart failure. This study assessed the haemodynamic response to a walk
   test during dual-chamber pacing and ventricular pacing in patients with
   depressed or normal left ventricular (LV) function.
   Methods: Twelve patients with an LV ejection fraction < 50\% and 11
   patients with an LV ejection fraction >= 50\% underwent two randomised
   6-min walk tests under dual-chamber rate-modulated pacing and
   ventricular pacing at a fixed rate of 70 beats/min. All patients had a
   dual-chamber pacemaker implanted for complete heart block. LV function
   was monitored by a radionuclide ambulatory system.
   Results: In patients with depressed LV function, the change from
   dual-chamber pacing to ventricular pacing induced a decrease in
   end-systolic volume at the peak of the walk test (P < 0.05), with no
   difference in end-diastolic volume. As a consequence, higher increases
   in LV ejection fraction (P < 0.0001) and stroke volume (P < 0.01) were
   observed during ventricular pacing. No difference in cardiac output was
   found between the two pacing modes. In patients with normal LV function,
   the change from dual-chamber pacing to ventricular pacing induced a
   significant decrease in cardiac output (P < 0.005 at rest and P < 0.05
   at the peak of the walk test).
   Conclusion: Compared with dual-chamber rate-modulated pacing,
   ventricular pacing improves cardiac function and does not affect cardiac
   output during physical activity in patients with depressed LV function,
   whereas it impairs cardiac output in those with normal function.}},

   (n = 194) underwent DXA scans of the lumbar spine (L2-4, GE Lunar
   Prodigy). Five measures of bone mass were derived, all adjusted for age
   and sex: aBMD, BMAD (BMC/BA(1.5)), BMCh (BMC/ height (3)), BMCa (BMC
   adjusted for BA), BMCt (BMC adjusted for BA and height). SD scores were
   calculated for each parameter for patients using data from healthy
   controls.
   Results: Compared to healthy children, all patient groups had
   significantly reduced BMD SD scores (P < 0.001). Mean BMAD, BMCa and
   BMCt SD scores were significantly lower in only 2/4 patient groups,
   whilst BMCh SD scores were low only in one group. BMCt showed no
   advantage over BMCa. The proportion of patients with SD scores < -2 was
   27\% for aBMD but between 10-13\% for BMAD, BMCh and BMCa.
   Conclusions: All size-corrected parameters of bone mass performed
   similarly and classified significantly fewer patients as abnormal than
   did aBMD. The use of one of these parameters should reduce the number of
   patients diagnosed inappropriately with `low bone mass'. However,
   without validation against an outcome measure or `gold standard' of bone
   density or structure, it is not possible to determine which parameter is
   most correct. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anorexic and bulimic eating disorders today are rather frequent in
   adolescent girls and young women of developed industrial countries. News
   media frequently report such patients, and lay people are interested.
   For scientists, it is not easy to explain the etiology and
   pathophysiology of these eating disorders. Clinically, treatment is a
   challenge. General risk factors for the development of anorexic and
   bulimic eating disorders are (1) female gender, (2) adolescence, and (3)
   living in an industrial country. Special risk factors are (1) obesity or
   mental disorders (eating, depression, substance use), (2) premorbid
   characteristics (early menarche, childhood obesity, anxiety disorder,
   low self-esteem, and perfectionism), and (3) premorbid stresses.
   Biological and sociocultural factors and personally threatening
   experiences all play a role in the etiology. Especially in early phases
   of the illness, affected patients do not appear to suffer, are reluctant
   to admit symptoms, and may avoid necessary treatment. Progress has
   recently been made in the understanding and treatment of anorexic and
   bulimic eating disorders.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the class of gauges that interpolates between Landau- and
   Coulomb-gauge QCD, and show the nonrenormalization of the two
   independent ghost-gluon vertices. This implies the existence of two
   renormalization group (RG)-invariant running couplings, one of which is
   interpreted as an RG-invariant gauge parameter. We also present the
   asymptotic infrared limit of solutions of the Dyson-Schwinger equations
   in interpolating gauges. The infrared critical exponents of these
   solutions as well as the resulting infrared fixed point of one of the
   couplings are independent of the gauge parameter. This coupling also has
   a fixed point in the Coulomb-gauge limit and constitutes a second
   invariant charge besides the well known color-Coulomb potential.}},

Abstract = {{Background Many HIV-infected children die with cardiac abnormalities. We
   sought to understand the course of these HIV-associated abnormalities
   and their impact on all-cause mortality.
   Methods We describe longitudinal changes in left ventricular (LV)
   structure and function and mortality in 185 children vertically infected
   with HIV. Serial cardiac data were obtained from 0.1 to 10 years of age.
   Age- or body surface area-adjusted z scores were calculated for 10
   echocardiographic outcomes.
   Results Median age at first echocardiogram was 2 years (range 0.2-9.4
   years); median follow-up was 3.6 years (range 0-6.3 years). The 5-year
   cumulative incidence of congestive heart failure was 12.3\%. Mean
   fractional shortening z scores declined from -0.65 at 1 year of age to
   -1.47 at 3 years of age without further decline between 3 and 10 years
   of age. Among children with 2 echocardiograms performed in the first
   year of follow-up, mild LV dysfunction (fractional shortening of <-2 SD
   on both echocardiograms) was present in 29 (18\%) of 158 children. For
   these 29 children, the 5-year mortality was 55.4\%. Left ventricular
   mass z scores were elevated at 1 year (mean z score 0.68, P<.001) and
   remained elevated throughout follow-up. In the 8 children with LV mass z
   score of >2 SD on both initial and follow-up echocardiograms, the 5-year
   mortality was 75\%.
   Conclusion In HIV-infected children, LV structure and function
   progressively deteriorated in the first 3 years of life, resulting in
   subsequent persistent mild LV dysfunction and increased LV mass. Chronic
   mild depression of LV function and elevated LV mass were associated with
   higher all-cause mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the number of sources impinging on an array of sensors is a
   well-known and well-investigated problem. A common approach for solving
   this problem is to use an information theoretic criterion, such as
   Minimum Description Length (MDL) or the Akaike Information Criterion
   (AIC). The MDL estimator is known to be a consistent estimator, robust
   against deviations from the Gaussian assumption, and nonrobust against
   deviations from the point source and/or temporally or spatially white
   additive noise assumptions. Over the years, several alternative
   estimation algorithms have been proposed and tested. Usually, these
   algorithms are shown, using computer simulations, to have improved
   performance over the MDL estimator and to be robust against deviations
   from the assumed spatial model. Nevertheless, these robust algorithms
   have high computational complexity, requiring several multidimensional
   searches.
   In this paper, which is motivated by real-life problems, a systematic
   approach toward the problem of robust estimation of the number of
   sources using information theoretic criteria is taken. An MDL-type
   estimator that is robust against deviation from assumption of equal
   noise level across the array is studied. The consistency of this
   estimator, even when deviations from the equal noise level assumption
   occur, is proven. A novel low-complexity implementation method avoiding
   the need for multidimensional searches is presented as well, making this
   estimator a favorable choice for practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{A dairy system simulator, Dairy-sim, was designed to assess the
   interactions between climate and management in spring-calving milk
   production systems based on the grazing of grass pastures. The simulator
   comprises three main components: a grass herbage growth model, an intake
   and grazing behaviour model, and a nutrient demand model. The simulator
   was initially parameterized using the Irish National Dairy Blueprint.
   Sensitivity analysis indicated that the simulator was most sensitive to
   stocking rate, milk output per cow and nitrogen fertilizer inputs, but
   less sensitive to other variables. Field data from four grazing systems
   were used to test the simulator and it was concluded that Dairy-sim was
   suitable for evaluating the interaction of climate and management for
   rotational grazing dairy systems based on perennial ryegrass pastures
   with Friesian cows. The simulator, Dairy-sim, was then used to evaluate
   the effects of the regional climates of Ireland on system management.
   The results indicated that, between regions, herbage production at the
   same input of nitrogen may vary proportionally by 0(.)10 and that the
   length of the grazing season may vary by 0(.)25. It was concluded that
   the simulator could be a useful tool for developing region-specific
   dairy production blueprints.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural deposits at Zhongba, one of the most important archaeological
   sites in the Three Gorges Dam reservoir area in central China, provide a
   comprehensive perspective on diachronic changes from the late Neolithic
   through the end of the Bronze Age, or from ca. 2500 to 200 B.C.
   (calibrated radiocarbon years). Excavations produced large quantities of
   pottery stone tools, small finds, and animal bones, which document the
   changes in the organization of specialized salt production and
   associated activities. The occurrence of large numbers of animal bones
   at a salt production site suggests that the salting of fish and mammal
   meat may have taken place there. This study provides one of the first
   detailed discussions of a faunal assemblage from this region of the
   world, allowing for preliminary tests of the ``preservation
   hypothesis{''} through analyses of prevalence, diversify, and part
   representation of various taxa. Some, but not all, of the expected
   patterns consistent with the h hypothesis of fish and meat salting were
   identified. It is clear that the increase in the importance of fish and
   in the diversity of mammals at Zhongba coincides with the increase in
   the scale of salt production.}},

Abstract = {{Water harvesting techniques (WHT) play an important role in water
   resources conservation in (semi-) and environments. However, the impacts
   of WHT are not clearly understood. This paper presents a method to
   measure increased water availability to olive (Olea europeae) trees
   grown on the terraced area of a traditional WHT site in southern Tunisia
   (jessr) and to translate these measurements into effects on yield.
   Although the WHT were shown to greatly enhance possibilities for olive
   growing, yields remain dependent on water supply (rainfall + run-on) in
   spring. Critical factors in the method described are the maximum
   available soil water capacity (ASW(max)), crop and yield response
   factors (kc, ky(veg) and ky(fruit)) and the yield consistency index
   (YCI). Detailed accounts are presented for the costs and benefits of
   jessr construction and olive production, and the WHT are evaluated using
   cost-benefit analysis. Difficulties and assumptions are discussed and it
   is concluded that on-site effects alone might not justify investing in
   the construction of WHT. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously obtained strong evidence for linkage of mild malaria
   attack to the MHC region, with a peak close to the tumor necrosis factor
   (TNF) gene. We screened, for polymorphisms, the entire TNF gene in the
   same sample of 34 families comprising 197 individuals living in a
   Plasmodium falciparum endemic area and we found 17 polymorphisms. In a
   longitudinal study, we investigated whether the 11 most frequent and
   informative polymorphisms were associated with mild malaria attack and
   maximum parasitemia, which was the highest parasitemia in each
   individual over 2 years. Mild malaria attack and maximum parasitemia
   were positively correlated. Transmission disequilibrium tests showed
   nominal evidence for association between TNF-1031, TNF-308, TNF851 and
   TNF1304 polymorphisms, and mild malaria attack on the one hand, and
   between TNF-238, TNF851 and TNF1304 polymorphisms, and maximum
   parasitemia on the other hand. After accounting for multiple tests, we
   confirmed the association of TNF-238 with maximum parasitemia and the
   association of TNF1304 and TNF851 with maximum parasitemia and mild
   malaria attack. The association tests with mild malaria attack suggest a
   moderate effect of TNF-308 polymorphism. In conclusion, our study
   suggests that several TNF variants may be part of the genetic
   determinants for maximum parasitemia and/or mild malaria attack.}},

Abstract = {{Wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae tubulin does not bind the
   anti-mitotic microtubule stabilizing agent paclitaxel. Previously, we
   introduced mutations into the S. cerevisiae gene for beta-tubulin that
   imparted paclitaxel binding to the protein, but the mutant strain was
   not sensitive to paclitaxel and other microtubule-stabilizing agents,
   due to the multiple ABC transporters in the membranes of budding yeast.
   Here, we introduced the mutated P-tubulin gene into a S. cerevisiae
   strain with diminished transporter activity and developed the first
   paclitaxel-sensitive budding yeast strain. In the presence of
   paclitaxel, cytoplasmic microtubules were stable to cold
   depolymerization. Paclitaxel-treated cells showed evidence of a mitotic
   block, with an increase in large-budded cells and cells with a 2N DNA
   content and DNA fragmentation, identified by FACS analysis and the TUNEL
   assay. In the presence of pactitaxel, the number of dead cells in
   cultures increased three-fold and cells containing reactive oxygen
   species were present. We conclude that paclitaxel blocks mitosis in this
   strain, leading to an apoptotic-like cell death. This strain will also
   be useful in further studies of the effect of microtubule dynamics on
   various cellular processes in S. cerevisiae. Copyright (c) 2005 John

Abstract = {{Objective: Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar non-ketotic (HHNK) syndrome is
   thought to be a rare entity in the pediatric population, associated with
   significant mortality based on case reports in the literature. As
   obesity and type 2 diabetes in childhood grow in prevalence, such
   related complications may also increase. This study will serve to
   provide updated information regarding typical clinical course and
   sequelae of HHNK syndrome in childhood.
   Methods: Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at Children's Hospital
   of Philadelphia (CHOP) over a period of 5 yr were screened
   retrospectively for any laboratory evidence of previous episodes of HHNK
   syndrome. The standard diagnostic criteria of blood glucose > 600 mg/dL
   and serum osmolality > 330 mOsm/L with only mild acidosis (serum
   bicarbonate > 15 mmol/L and small ketonuria 15 mg/dL or less) were
   utilized.
   Results: The records of all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)
   diagnosed over a 5-yr period were reviewed (n = 190). Seven patients
   were found to have one episode of HHNK syndrome by diagnostic criteria
   (five males, mean age at presentation 13.3 yr, age range 10.1-16.9 yr),
   yielding a frequency of 3.7\%. All were African-American. HHNK syndrome
   was the clinical presentation at diagnosis of new onset diabetes for all
   seven children. Three of seven children had a previously diagnosed
   developmental delay. The average Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at
   presentation was 13 (range 9-15). Mean body mass index (BMI) at
   presentation was 32.7 kg/m(2) (n = 6). Mean serum osmolality was 393
   mOsm/L (n = 7), and mean blood glucose was 1604 mg/dL (n = 7). The
   average time until mental status returned to baseline among survivors
   was 3 d (range 1-7 d). The average number of hospital days for survivors
   was 10 (range 5-24 d). Four of seven patients had an uncomplicated
   course. One patient developed multisystem organ failure and died on
   hospital day 4. The case fatality rate was 14.3\% (one of seven).
   Survivors had no appreciable neurodevelopmental sequelae.
   Conclusions: This retrospective chart review provides updated
   information regarding the entity of HHNK syndrome in children. This
   study supports the need for increased awareness of type 2 diabetes in
   children so that morbidity and mortality related to HHNK syndrome can be
   prevented.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the
   nurse with families of critically ill patients as perceived by family
   members and whether meeting family expectations impact family

   METHODS: A descriptive design was conducted with 29 family members from
   a 19-bed intensive care unit. Nonparametric statistics, known for their
   appropriateness for small samples, were used to examine the research
   questions.
   RESULTS: Overall, the expectations that family members held regarding
   nurses' roles with families were not different from their perceptions of
   what nurses actually did (P =.087). Family members were more satisfied
   with care when nurses' performance either met or exceeded their
   expectations (P =.046).
   CONCLUSION: Nurses did well with regard to meeting family members'
   expectations. Variations in expectations among family members reflect
   their diversity and highlight the importance of assessing family needs
   on a case-by-case basis.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering is often useful for analyzing and summarizing information
   within large datasets. Model-based clustering methods have been found to
   be effective for determining the number of clusters, dealing with
   outliers, and selecting the best Clustering method in datasets that are
   small to moderate in size. For large datasets, current model-based
   clustering methods tend to be limited by memory and time requirements
   and the increasing difficulty of maximum likelihood estimation. They may
   fit too many clusters in some portions of the data and/or miss clusters
   containing relatively few observations. We propose an incremental
   approach for data that can be processed as a whole in memory, which is
   relatively efficient computationally and has the ability to find small
   clusters in large datasets. The method starts by drawing a random sample
   of the data, selecting and fitting a clustering model to the sample, and
   extending the model to the full dataset by additional EM iterations. New
   clusters are then added incrementally, initialized with the observations
   that are poorly fit by the current model. We demonstrate the
   effectiveness of this method by applying it to simulated data, and to
   image data where its performance can be assessed visually.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin (OT) is involved in the regulation of luteolysis in pigs.
   However, it is still not clear if OT is responsible for initiation of
   luteal regression in this species. The objectives of the study were: (1)
   to compare OT receptors (OTr) concentrations in endometrium and
   myometrium of cyclic and early pregnant pigs, (2) to examine the effect
   of OT on plasma PGF(2)alpha secretion during the progressive luteal
   regression, (3) to ascertain the effect of OT on inositol phosphates
   (IPs) accumulation in endometrial and myometrial cells of cyclic and
   early pregnant pigs. Concentrations of OTr on the endometrium and
   myometrium of cyclic (n = 33) (days 2-4; 11-13; 14-16; 18-20; day 21)
   and early pregnant (n = 4) (days 14-16) gilts were determined and they
   ranged from 7 +/- 3 (days 11-13) to 377 +/- 113 fmol/mg protein (day 21)
   in the endometrium and from 33 I I (days 2-4) to 167 28 fmol/mg protein
   (days 18-20) in the myometrium. In both tissues, concentrations of OTr
   were low during the luteal phase and increased (P < 0.01) during the
   follicular phase. In contrast to myometrial OTr, endometrial OTr during
   pregnancy were undetectable. In next experiment, mature gilts (n = 12)
   were injected with OT (20 IU; i.v.) for three consecutive days starting
   on days 14 and 15 of the oestrous cycle and plasma PGF(2)alpha
   metabolite-13,14-dihydro-16-keto PGF(2)alpha (PGFM) concentration was
   determined. On days 15-16 and 16-17, OT increased plasma PGFM level.
   This effect was not observed on days 14-15 of the estrous cycle. A
   negative correlation was noticed between plasma concentrations of PGFM
   and progesterone (r = -0.3; P < 0.05). In last experiment, OT (100 nM)
   augmented (P < 0.01) an accumulation of inositol phosphates (IPs) in
   isolated myometrial cells on days 14-16 (n = 4) and 18-20 (n = 3) of the
   estrous cycle and on days 14-16 (n = 4) of pregnancy.
   Oxytocin-stimulated accumulation of IPs was not observed in endometrial
   cells. In summary: (1) concentrations of OTr on both the endometrium and
   myometrium were the highest during perioestrus-period in pigs, (2)
   myometrium of early pregnant sows possessed functional OTr, (3) oxytocin
   increased plasma PGFM concentration after initiation of luteolysis; and
   (4) OT-stimulated accumulation of IPs in myometrial, but not in
   endometrial cells. In conclusion, OT appears to not be involved in the
   initiation of luteal regression in sows and functional OTr are still
   present in the myometrium during early pregnancy (days 14-16). (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Language learners today have a much wider choice of reference materials
   than in the past. In addition to dictionaries, grammar books and
   encyclopaedias, nowadays it is also possible for students to look things
   up on the Internet, in term banks and in corpora. Much of the literature
   on the pedagogical value of these resources focuses on what each of them
   can achieve separately. However, little has been said about how learners
   as researchers actually cope with all of it together. Modelling itself
   on Varantola's (1998) analysis of how translators use dictionaries, the
   aim of this study was to find out more about how a group of advanced
   learners of English were grappling with the use of paper references and
   new technology together. The results indicate that while there was no
   clear competition between paper and digital references, there was a
   marked preference for bilingual over monolingual support, for materials
   mediated by terminologists and lexicographers over ones requiring more
   autonomous user interpretation, and for more prestigious over
   lesser-known resources. The study also made it clear that more resources
   does not necessarily mean better research, and that in addition to
   training learners to use separate resources, it is essential to teach
   them how to integrate their skills at using them together, particularly
   with respect to combining bilingual with monolingual research.}},

Abstract = {{The enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has been shown to
   be altered by environmental contaminants such as metals. However, the
   available literature illustrates a background of contradictory results
   regarding these effects. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was
   to investigate the potential of five metal ions (nickel, copper, zinc,
   cadmium and mercury) to inhibit AChE activity in vitro. First, to
   accomplish this objective, the possible interference of metals as test
   toxicants in the Ellman's assay, which is widely used to assess AChE
   activity, was studied. The potential influence of two different reaction
   buffers ( phosphate and Tris) was also determined. The results suggest
   that the selected metals react with the products of this photometric
   technique. It is impossible to ascertain the artefactual contribution of
   the interaction of the metals with the technique when measuring AChE
   inhibition. This constitutes a major obstacle in obtaining accurate
   data. The presence of phosphate ions also makes enzymatic inhibition
   difficult to analyse. Attending to this evidence, an assay using the
   substrate o-nitrophenyl acetate and Tris buffer was used to investigate
   the effects of metals on AChE activity. O-nitrophenyl acetate is also a
   substrate for esterases other than cholinesterases. It is therefore only
   possible to use it for the measurement of cholinesterase activity with
   purified enzymes or after a previous verification of the absence of
   other esterases in the sample tissue. Under these conditions, the
   results indicate that with the exception of nickel, all tested metals
   significantly inhibit AChE activity.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to study the associations between participation in
   different types of mentally stimulating leisure activities and status as
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) case or normal control. Research suggests that
   participation in leisure activities, especially mentally stimulating
   activities, is associated with a lower risk for AD. However, no study
   has yet evaluated associations between AD and different types of mental
   leisure activities, especially those involving ``novelty seeking.{''}
   The authors used a case-control design to compare participation in
   activities across the life span in persons with AD and normal controls.
   Cases (n = 264) were recruited from clinical settings and from the
   community. Controls were drawn from 2 populations. Control group A
   members (n = 364) were the friends or neighbors of the cases or members
   of the same organizations to which the cases belonged. Control group B
   members (n = 181) were randomly drawn from the community. The 2 control
   groups did not differ in their responses to most activity questions, so
   they were combined. Factor analysis of activity questions identified 3
   activity factors: (1) novelty seeking; (2) exchange of ideas; and (3)
   social. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, adjusting for
   control variables, greater participation in novelty-seeking and
   exchange-of-ideas activities was significantly associated with decreased
   odds of AD. The odds of AD were lower among those who more often
   participated in activities involving exchange of ideas and were lower
   yet for those who more frequently participated in novelty-seeking
   activities. We conclude that participation in a variety of mental
   activities across the life span may lower one's chances of developing
   AD.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examined the frequency and associated distress of
   potentially traumatic or harmful experiences occurring within
   psychiatric settings among persons with severe mental illness who were
   served by a public-sector mental health system. Methods: Participants
   were 142 randomly selected adult psychiatric patients who were recruited
   through a day hospital program. Participants completed a battery of
   self-report measures to assess traumatic and harmful events that
   occurred during the course of their mental health care, lifetime trauma
   exposure, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Results: Data
   revealed high rates of reported lifetime trauma that occurred within
   psychiatric settings, including physical assault (31 percent), sexual
   assault (8 percent), and witnessing traumatic events (63 percent). The
   reported rates of potentially harmful experiences, such as being around
   frightening or violent patients (54 percent), were also high. Finally,
   reported rates of institutional measures of last resort, such as
   seclusion (59 percent), restraint (34 percent), takedowns (29 percent),
   and handcuffed transport (65 percent), were also high. Having
   medications used as a threat or punishment, unwanted sexual advances in
   a psychiatric setting, inadequate privacy, and sexual assault by a staff
   member were associated with a history of exposure to sexual assault as
   an adult. Conclusions: Findings suggest that traumatic and harmful
   experiences within psychiatric settings warrant increased attention.}},

Abstract = {{The Gd5S1.9Ge2.1 and Gd5Si1.72Ge2.28 alloys with different Gd starting
   materials were prepared to investigate the effect of impurites of Gd on

   structure of alloys was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) based on the
   X'Pert Highscore software package and the PDF2-2003 database. It was
   found that the alloys with high purity Gd is single Gd5Si2Ge2 phase.
   Whereas the alloys with low purity Gd is double phases, i.e. the
   Gd5Si2Ge2 phase and the Gd-5(Si,Ge)(3) phase. The magnetic measurements
   showed that the impurities have no visible effect on the interaction of
   the ferromagnetic Gd5Si2Ge2 phase. The main reason for the decrease of
   magnetic entropy changes of the Gd5Si1.9Ge2.1 and Gd5Si1.72Ge2.28 alloys
   (2NGd) was that the low temperature antiferromagnetic Gd-5(Si,Ge)(3)

Abstract = {{Histone acetylation controls the expression of specific genes in
   eukaryotic cells. We investigated the role of historic deacetylases
   (HDACs) in the differentiation of human erythroid cells, using
   pharmacological approaches. When CD36(+) erythroid precursor cells,
   generated from CD34(+) cells with stem cell factor, flt-3 ligand,
   thrombopoietin, interleukin-3, interleukin-6, and erythropoietin, were
   cultured with an HDAC inhibitor FK228 (depsipeptide) at a specified dose
   in the presence of erythropoietin, their differentiation was inhibited,
   as determined by the expression of CD45 and glycophorin A. Addition of
   the same dose of FK228 to cultures did not affect the growth of CD36(+)
   cells. Regardless of the presence or absence of FK228, cultured CD36(+)
   cells displayed similar proliferation kinetics. Analysis of acetylated
   histories revealed that FK228 upregulated the acetylation status of
   histories H3 and H4 in CD36(+) cells. The inhibition of CD36(+) cell
   differentiation was restored by removal of FK228 from the culture,
   indicating that the modification of CD36(+) cell differentiation by
   FK228 is reversible. Furthermore, interference with historic
   deacetylation by FK228 inhibited the generation of CD36(+) erythroid
   cells from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells. Our results indicate
   the possible involvement of HDACs in human erythropoiesis, especially
   the regulation of erythroid cell differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The complement cascade and granulocytes are activated in
   on-pump cardiac surgery. If activation of complement directly regulates
   granulocytes, granulocyte elastase (GEL) should increase significantly
   after protamine administration. We examined the effect of protamine on
   granulocytes by protamine administration and observation of the effect
   on GEL and C3a.
   Methods: Thirty patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
   were randomly assigned to two groups. In 15 patients, protamine was
   administered 5 min after the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass, and
   was administered 35 min after cardiopulmonary bypass in the other 15
   patients. All patients were perfused with heparin-coated circuits and
   received 300 IU/kg heparin and 3 mg/kg protamine. GEL and C3a
   concentrations were measured at 7 time points.
   Results: GEL concentrations increased significantly just before aortic
   declamping and did not increase significantly after protamine
   administration. C3a concentrations, however, did not increase during
   cardiopulmonary bypass and did increase significantly after protamine
   administration.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that GEL does not increase after
   protamine administration and that complement concentration does not
   directly affect GEL release. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are considered to be critically involved
   in tumor invasion and the metastasis of various cancers. MMI-166 is a
   selective inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2, MMP-9, and
   MMP-14). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of
   MMI-166 on both the growth of the implanted tumor and the lymph node
   metastasis of the mediastinum and prolonging the life span, using an
   orthotopic implantation model of the Ma44-3 cancer cell line. We
   examined the anti-invasive effect of MMI-166 in lung cancer cell lines
   using an in vitro invasion assay. Next, we examined the anticancer
   effect of MMI-166 in vivo. MMI-166 (200 mg/kg body weight) or a vehicle
   was administered orally to the orthotopically implanted lung cancer
   model. MMI-166 dose-dependently inhibited the invasion of cancer cell
   lines with expressions of MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 in vitro. In vivo, MMI-166
   significantly inhibited mediastinal lymph node metastasis in this
   orthotopic model (weight of the mediastinum: control, 0.089 +/- 0.009
   versus MMI-166, 0.069 +/- 0.008 mg; P.= 0.005; metastatic area: control,
   93,495 55,747 versus MMI-166, 22,747 +/- 17,478 pixels; P = 0.045).
   MMI-166 prolonged the life span by 6 days in median survival time in the
   orthotopically implanted model (P = 0.039). These results showed that
   MMI-166 could possibly inhibit lymph node metastasis and prolong the
   life span in lung cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{We report the visually directed actions of soccer players. After
   perceiving the location of a target on their left side at the starting
   point and traveling toward the ball without seeing the target, the
   players could kick the ball accurately ( Experiment 2). In contrast, if
   they were verbally asked the direction of the target in a similar
   situation, the perceived direction was systematically distorted (
   Experiment 3). Our major concern in explaining the distorted perception
   was whether the egocentric distance before locomotion was perceived
   accurately or not, and whether the updating of the target location
   during locomotion was accurate or not. Combining these two
   possibilities, there should be four hypotheses, each of which assumes
   either: ( 1) accurate egocentric distance and accurate updating, ( 2)
   inaccurate egocentric distance and accurate updating, ( 3) accurate
   egocentric distance and inaccurate updating, or ( 4) inaccurate
   egocentric distance and inaccurate updating. Based on these hypotheses,
   we conducted four simulations, which revealed that the combination of
   the perception of the accurate egocentric distance and the distorted
   updating that substituted the constant function for the sine function
   produced not only a good r(2), but also three kinds of interactions
   obtained in Experiment 3. Why did the players, based on their distorted
   perception, perform accurately? We would like to suggest that through
   perceptual learning they might acquire a perceptual- motor relation as
   the inverse function of the physical- perceptual relation.}},

Abstract = {{This research, based on our observations of an industrial
   vendor-manufacturer relationship, investigates the impact of information
   sharing and physical flow coordination in a make-to-order supply chain.
   We mathematically model and develop simulation-based rolling schedule
   procedures for analyzing the manufacturer's ordering policies,
   transportation activities, and the vendor's manufacturing and order
   fulfillment processes under five alternative integration strategies. Our
   objective is to measure the value of information sharing and system
   coordination across the strategies, identify whether the source of the
   benefits come from information sharing or coordination, study the
   allocation of system benefits among channel members, and analyze the
   impact of environmental factors on system cost performance. The
   experimental results indicate a 47.58\% cost reduction moving from a
   traditional supply chain to a fully integrated system. While information
   sharing reduces costs, the main economic benefit comes from coordinated
   decision-making. The savings associated with system integration are not
   equally allocated among channel members, and vary by strategy. The
   procedures developed in the research provide economic insight that
   fosters the sharing of technological and strategic efforts. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{Objective. To study the effectiveness and side effects of polyarticular
   corticosteroid injection compared to systemic administration in patients
   with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to examine the differential response
   to injection among joints.
   Methods. Sixty-nine RA patients presenting with 6-12 swollen joints were
   enrolled to participate in a randomized trial consisting of
   polyarticular injection in 6-8 swollen joints of intraarticular (IA)
   triamcinolone hexacetonide (IA group) or intramuscular (IM) mini-pulse
   therapy with triamcinolone acetonide in equivalent doses (IM group).
   Blind examination at baseline (TO), Weeks I (T1), 4 (T4), 12 (T 12), and
   24 (T24) postintervention included American College of Rheumatology
   improvement criteria ACR20\%, 50\% and 70\%, visual analog scale for
   articular pain, pain on movement, joint count, range of motion, morning
   stiffness, quality of life (Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36), use of
   nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and oral corticosteroid, blood
   pressure, adverse effects, calls to the physician, and hospital visits.
   Results. Significantly better results were observed for IA compared to
   IM patients as follows: ACR20\% (61.7\% vs 28.5\% at TI; 73.5\% vs
   42.8\% at T4), ACR50\% (29.4\% vs 5.7\% at T1; 44.1\% vs 20\% at T4),
   ACR70\% (11.7\% vs 0\% at T1), patient's evaluation of disease activity,
   lower tender joint count, lower blood pressure, lower number of adverse
   effects, calls to the physician, and hospital visits (p < 0.05). Less
   significant adrenocorticotropic hormone reduction was observed for IA
   group at T4 and T12 (p < 0.05). Elbows and metacarpophalangeal joints
   had the best response to corticosteroid injection.
   Conclusion. In the short term, polyarticular IA injection was better
   than IM corticosteroid, as shown by ACR improvement criteria and number
   of adverse effects.}},

Abstract = {{Current theories suggest that atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, stroke,
   and restenosis after angioplasty may involve defective apoptotic
   mechanisms in vascular cells. Prior work has demonstrated that cells
   from human atherosclerotic lesions, and cells from the aorta of aged
   rats, exhibit functional resistance to apoptosis induced by TGF-beta and
   glucocorticoids. The present studies dernonstrate that human
   lesion-derived cells (LDC) are also resistant to apoptosis induced by
   fas ligation compared to cells derived from the adjacent media, and that
   in vitro expansion of LDC causes acquired resistance to apoptosis.
   Microarray profiling of fas-resistant versus sensitive cells identified
   a set of genes including STATs, caspase 1, cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, VDAC2, and
   BAD. The STAT proteins have been implicated in resistance to apoptosis,
   potentially via their ability to modulate caspase I (ICE), Bcl-xL, and
   cyclin D I expression. Western blot analysis of sensitive and resistant
   LDC clonal lines confirmed increases in cyclin D1, STAT6, Bcl-xL, and
   BAD, with decreased expression of caspase 1. Thus, transcript profiling
   has identified a potential pathway of apoptotic regulation in subsets of
   lesion cells. The resistant phenotype may contribute to plaque stability
   and excessive vascular repair, while sensitive cells may be involved in
   plaque rupture and infarction. The data suggests both genetic
   interventions and novel small-molecule inhibitors that may be effective
   modulators of apoptosis in atherosclerosis, angina, and in-stent
   restenosis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Well-preserved arthropod trackways are described from the laminated
   limestones of the Crayssac Lagerstatte (south-west France, Lower
   Tithonian). They occur in sediments deposited in the temporary coastal
   mudflats of intertidal to supratidal zones. The trackways are referred
   to Pterichnus isopodicus isp. nov., and are interpreted as the
   locomotion traces of isopods. Different trackway morphotypes are
   recognized and clearly resulted from variations in the original
   consistency of the sediment. Sinuous trackways may correspond to vagrant
   activity on wet mud whereas numerous straight ones indicate a more rapid
   crawling on a soft-to-firm substratum (e.g. tidal flat during emersion).
   The preferred orientation of trackways indicates that isopods were
   crawling in a direction perpendicular to shoreline as a result of
   possible taxis induced by sediment wetness and/or by a migratory
   behaviour controlled by tidal rhythm. Unusually long emergence of the
   sediments may have favoured the preservation of dense networks of
   trackways. An isopod identity is supported by the general morphology of
   the tracks and the association of trackways with isopod body fossils.
   Archaeoniscus, which occurs abundantly in Late Jurassic deposits of
   England and France, was probably the trace-maker.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of CD8 cooperation with the TCR in antigen recognition was
   studied on live T cells. Fluorescence correlation measurements yielded
   evidence of the presence of two TCR and CD8 subpopulations with
   different lateral diffusion rate constants. Independently, evidence for
   two subpopulations was derived from the experimentally observed two
   distinct association phases of cognate peptide bound to class I MHC
   (pMHC) tetramers and the T cells. The fast phase rate constant (( 1.7
   +/- 0.2) x 10(5) M-1 s(-1)) was independent of examined cell type or
   MHC-bound peptides' structure. Its value was much faster than that of
   the association of soluble pMHC and TCR ((7.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(3) M-1
   s(-1)), and close to that of the association of soluble pMHC with CD8
   ((1-2) x 10(5) M-1 s(-1)). The fast binding phase disappeared when
   CD8-pMHC interaction was blocked by a CD8-specific mAb. The latter rate
   constant was slowed down similar to 10-fold after cells treatment with
   methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. These results suggest that the most efficient
   pMHC-cell association route corresponds to a fast tetramer binding to a
   colocalized CD8-TCR subpopulation, which apparently resides within
   membrane rafts: the reaction starts by pMHC association with the CD8.
   This markedly faster step significantly increases the probability of
   pMHC-TCR encounters and thereby promotes pMHC association with
   CD8-proximal TCR. The slow binding phase is assigned to pMHC association
   with a noncolocalized CD8-TCR subpopulation. Taken together with results
   of cytotoxicity assays, our data suggest that the colocalized,
   raft-associated CD8-TCR subpopulation is the one capable of inducing
   T-cell activation.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse theories have predicted a trend towards growing work pressure in
   advanced capitalist societies, while pointing to quite distinct causal
   factors. This paper seeks to assess these arguments using data from two
   surveys of employees in European Union member-states carried out in 1996
   and in 2001. It finds there is no evidence of a trend towards higher
   work pressure over this period. There is, however, support for some of
   the main arguments about the types of factors that affect work pressure:
   for instance, skill, job control, new technology and current job
   security are clearly important. But the trends in job control and job
   security have not been those predicted, while changes in another major
   determinant - the length of working hours - have tended to reduce work
   pressure. There are substantial and relatively stable differences in
   work pressure between countries, but to a considerable extent, these
   reflect compositional differences with respect to the main determinants
   of work pressure.}},

Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on hard and tough biological materials have led to a
   concept called flaw tolerance which is defined as a state of material in
   which pre-existing cracks do not propagate even as the material is
   stretched to failure near its limiting strength. In this process, the
   material around the crack fails not by crack propagation, but by uniform
   rupture at the limiting strength. At the failure point, the classical
   singular stress field is replaced by a uniforrn stress distribution with
   no stress concentration near the crack tip. This concept provides an
   important analogy between the known phenomena and concepts in fracture
   mechanics, such as notch insensitivity, fracture size effects and large
   scale yielding or bridging, and new studies on failure mechanisms in
   nanostructures and biological systems. In this paper, we discuss the
   essential concept for the model problem of an interior center crack and
   two symmetric edge cracks in a thin strip under tension. A simple
   analysis based on the Griffith model and the Dugdale-Barenblatt model is
   used to show that flaw tolerance is achieved when the dimensionless
   number Lambda(ft) = Gamma E/ ((SH)-H-2) is on the order of 1, where
   Gamma is the fracture energy, E is the Young's modulus, S is the
   strength, and H is the characteristic size of the material. The concept
   of flaw tolerance emphasizes the capability of a material to tolerate
   cracklike flaws of all sizes.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{180-185}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: There has been extensive damage to nursing education and
   training in Iraq over the last two decades through three international
   wars, counterinsurgency struggles in the north and south, 13 years of
   economic sanctions, dictatorship and foreign occupation. Fortunately,
   there is wide agreement that nursing is a key area for further
   attention. Many nursing leaders have emigrated and the numbers of nurses
   working in professional roles in Iraq declined sharply after 1990.
   Issues: The number of nurses per population has always been low in Iraq,
   and fell off precipitously after foreign workers left. There is less
   than one nursing staff of any kind for physician today. Few of the
   nursing staff are qualified to what would be minimal standards of
   professional practice in many countries. There is a strong educational
   base for nursing education in three Iraqi universities, but it relates
   little to other schools or hospitals. Military nurses, now being
   integrated into the public system of hospital care, are considered to
   have far more technical skill levels than non-military nurses.
   Actions: Iraq needs a new generation of well trained nurses to develop
   primary care and health education activities. Programmes in nursing
   administration and community health nursing need to be developed. The
   World Health Organization has supported the development of training
   centres and short courses for nursing leaders. The former six levels of
   entry to nursing practice have been streamlined to three. Nursing
   salaries since the 2003 invasion have been greatly increased. These are
   good beginnings, and much more remains to be done to restore nursing in
   Iraq.}},

   Using microbiological techniques, the biocide lethal concentration was
   determined, and a concentration of 200 ppm was used to kill completely
   the consortium population in both, plancktonic and sessile parts. The

Abstract = {{The establishment and maintenance of characteristic cellular
   morphologies is a fundamental property of all cells. Here we describe
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pal1p, a protein important for maintenance of
   cylindrical cellular morphology. Pal1p is a novel membrane-associated
   protein that localizes to the growing tips of interphase cells and to
   the division site in cells undergoing cytokinesis in an F-actin- and
   microtubule-independent manner. Cells deleted for pall display
   morphological defects, characterized by the occurrence of spherical and
   pear-shaped cells with an abnormal cell wall. Pal1p physically interacts
   and displays overlapping localization with the
   Huntingtin-interacting-protein (Hip1)-related protein Sla2p/End4p, which
   is also required for establishment of cylindrical cellular morphology.
   Sla2p is important for efficient localization of Pal1p to the sites of
   polarized growth and appears to function upstream of Pal1p.
   Interestingly, spherical pal1 Delta mutants polarize to establish a
   pearlike morphology before mitosis in a manner dependent on the
   kelch-repeat protein Tea1p and the cell cycle inhibitory kinase Wee1p.
   Thus, overlapping mechanisms involving Pal1p, Tea1p, and Sla2p
   contribute to the establishment of cylindrical cellular morphology,
   which is important for proper spatial regulation of cytokinesis.}},

Title = {{Kinetic description of avalanching systems}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3, 2}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Avalanching systems are treated analytically using the renormalization
   group (in the self-organized-criticality regime) or mean-field
   approximation, respectively. The latter describes the state in terms of
   the mean number of active and passive sites, without addressing the
   inhomogeneity in their distribution. This paper goes one step further by
   proposing a kinetic description of avalanching systems making use of the
   distribution function for clusters of active sites. We illustrate an
   application of the kinetic formalism to a model proposed for the
   description of the avalanching processes in the reconnecting current
   sheet of the Earth's magnetosphere. A description of avalanching systems
   is proposed that makes use of the distribution function for clusters of
   active sites. A general kinetic equation is derived that describes the
   temporal evolution of the distribution function, in terms of growth and
   shrinking probabilities. The distribution of clusters is derived for the
   stationary regime, for a quite general class of avalanching systems or
   arbitrary dimensionality. The approach, including the probability
   calculation, is illustrated by an application of the kinetic description
   to the recently proposed burning model.}},

Abstract = {{During the last two decades, populations of the wild boar Sits scrofa in
   Europe have increased considerably and the species has spread into new
   areas over the entire continent. Because of the animals' impact on
   agriculture, livestock and biodiversity, and the resulting necessity of
   realistic management practices, we were interested in the key
   environmental factors responsible for this remarkable development. The
   study was based on data from the canton Thurgau, a region in
   north-eastern Switzerland. We used data on damage and hunting success to
   calculate a population density index and related it to eight variables
   describing ecological conditions, demography and hunting pressure
   (measured by the number of hunters) over a 25-year period. The analysis
   shows that the population increase correlates with higher than average
   winter and spring temperatures and improved food supply through more
   mast years and an increase in the area of maize cultivation. While
   favourable temperature conditions mainly reduce juvenile mortality,
   enhanced food availability is likely to boost reproductive success
   through younger age at first reproduction, larger litter size and
   earlier onset of oestrus within a season. Given this link between food
   and reproduction, supplemental feeding, a management practice
   recommended and very common all over Europe, should be reconsidered.}},

Abstract = {{Haptic training devices can facilitate tactile skill development by
   providing repeatable exposures to rare stimuli. Extant haptic training
   simulator research primarily emphasizes realistic stimuli
   representation; however, the experiments reported herein suggest that
   providing augmented feedback can improve training effectiveness, even
   when the feedback is not natural. A novel clinical breast examination
   training device uses inflated balloons embedded in silicone to simulate
   breast lumps. Oscillating the balloon water pressure makes the lumps
   pulsate. The pulsating lumps are easier to detect than the static lumps
   used in current simulators, and this manipulation seems to effectively
   introduce trainees to small, deep lumps that are initially difficult to
   perceive. A study of 48 medical students indicates that training with
   the dynamic breast model increased the number of lumps detected, F(1,
   47) = 9.34, p = .004, decreased the number of false positives, F(1, 47)
   = 5.78, p = .020, and improved intersimulator skill transfer, F(1, 47) =
   26.56, p < .001. The results suggest that at least in this case,
   augmented, tactile feedback increases training effectiveness, despite
   the fact that the feedback does not attempt to mimic any physical
   phenomenon present in the natural stimulus. Applications of this
   research include training techniques and tools for improved detection of
   palpable cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Earth scientists increasingly consider the Holsteinian Interglacial and

   two fen peat layers of the Holsteinian reference site at Bossel in
   northern Germany and reevaluate published numerical data from two sites
   with Hoxnian deposits in England. A new method for the calculation of
   methodically controlled minimum Th-230/U ages (MCMA) was developed. The
   synopsis of the Th-230/U dates allows a correlation of both the
   Holsteinian and Hoxnian Interglacials to MIS 9. This correlation is
   supported by supplementary Th-230/U dates of fen peat from several
   pre-Eemian but non-Holsteinian sites in Germany. There is palynological
   evidence for a reliable correlation between precisely investigated and
   numerically dated Holsteinian deposits in Poland, Germany, England,
   SW-Ireland and France. An apparently contradictory palynological
   correlation from the French Central Massif is discussed. (c) 2005

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Using juvenile rat brain slices, we examined the possibility that
   strychnine-sensitive receptors for glycine-like amino acids contributed
   to synaptic inhibition in ventrobasal thalamus, where
   gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) is the prevalent inhibitory transmitter.
   Ventrobasal nuclei showed staining for antibodies against alpha(1) and
   alpha(2) subunits of the glycine receptor. Exogenously applied glycine,
   taurine and beta-alanine increased membrane conductance, effects
   antagonized by strychnine, indicative of functional glycine receptors.
   Using glutamate receptor antagonists, we isolated inhibitory
   postsynaptic potentials and currents (IPSPs and IPSCs) evoked by
   high-threshold stimulation of medial lemniscus. Like the responses to
   glycine agonists, these synaptic responses reversed near E-Cl. In
   comparative tests with GABA(B) receptor antagonists, strychnine
   attenuated inhibition in a majority of neurons, but did not alter slow,
   GABA(B) inhibition. For complete blockade, the majority of fast IPSPs
   required co-application of strychnine with bicuculline or gabazine,
   GABA(A) receptor antagonists. Strychnine acting with an IC50 congruent
   to 33 nM, eliminated residual fast inhibition during selective GABA(A)
   receptor blockade with gabazine. The latency of onset for IPSPs was
   compatible with polysynaptic pathways or prolonged axonal propagation
   time. Strychnine lacked effects on monosynaptic, GABAergic IPSPs from
   zona incerta. The specific actions of strychnine implicated a glycine
   receptor contribution to fast inhibition in somatosensory thalamus. (c)

Abstract = {{Raphanus sativus, commonly known as radish, is a food plant known
   worldwide for its culinary and medicinal properties especially as a
   laxative and abortifacient. This study reports the gastrointestinal and
   uterine tone modulatory activities of the crude extract (Rl.Cr) of
   radish leaves. Rl.Cr, showing the presence of saponins and alkaloids,
   exhibited a spasmogenic effect (0.03-10 mg/mL) in isolated rabbit
   jejunum, rat stomach fundus and uterus which was partially blocked by
   atropine. In contrast, Rl.Cr was found to be devoid of any stimulatory
   effect in rat ileum, instead showed an inhibitory effect (0.1 mg/mL) on
   the ACh dose-response curves. A mild relaxant effect was also observed
   in rabbit jejunum at the lower doses (0.1-0.3 mg/mL) but not against
   K+-induced contractions, ruling out a calcium channel blocking effect.
   In guinea-pig ileum, Rl.Cr exhibited a stimulant effect resistant to
   atropine while sensitive to pyrilamine pretreatment. The aqueous
   fraction, showing a strong presence of saponins, was found to be more
   efficacious than the non-polar fractions in its spasmogenic effect. This
   study shows the presence of species-dependent gastrointestinal effects
   of radish mediated partially through cholinergic receptors in rabbit and
   rat tissues, but through histaminergic activation in the guinea-pig,
   providing a scientific basis for its use in gut and uterine affections
   while also giving a wider picture of the activity profile of radish by
   using different species of animals. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \&

   chemisorption, and includes second-order recombination-desorption
   processes important in the modeling of high-temperature growth. It is
   shown that the formation energy of epitaxial GaN, E-f, depends on the
   growth conditions as the activation energy and surface diffusion energy
   barriers increase or decrease with the change in the impinging fluxes
   and surface density of precursors. For such a particular set of growth
   conditions, the model allows us to determine the formation energy of
   epitaxial GaN as E-f=0.11 eV, similar to 35\% smaller than the apparent
   activation energy obtained directly from the growth data. E-app=0.168
   eV. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution has significant effects on exacerbation of asthma, allergy
   and other respiratory diseases. Like many other magacities in the world
   the ambient air quality of Kolkata is also being deteriorated day by
   day. Automobile exhausts and certain industrial pollutants produce O-3
   by photochemical reactions. The particulate matter, particularly less
   than 10 mu in size, can pass through the natural protective mechanism of
   human respiratory system and plays an important role in genesis and
   augmentation of allergic disorders. Sources of air pollution in the area
   and the unique problem arising out of the emission from the vehicles,
   industries, etc. have been described. Ambient air quality was monitored
   along with micrometeorological data and the results are discussed. The
   status of air pollution in the area has been evaluated and a
   questionnaire survey was conducted to estimate the allergic symptoms and
   exposure to assess the respiratory disorders. The data are analysed to
   evaluate the critical situation arising out of the emission of air
   pollutants and the impact on human health due to respirable diseases
   (RDs) to middle class sub-population (activity-wise) in the area are
   assessed. A strategic air quality management plan has been proposed. For
   the mitigation of air pollution problems in the city, the different
   measures to be adopted to maintain the balance between sustainable
   development and environmental management have been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block (MMN) can
   be mistaken for motor neurone disease or other lower motor neurone
   syndromes, but is treatable with intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg).
   Formal electrophysiological criteria for conduction block (CB) are so
   stringent that substantial numbers of patients may miss out on
   appropriate treatment.
   Methods: Electrophysiological data were collected from 10 healthy
   volunteers and compared to data from 10 patients who satisfied the
   clinical criteria for MMN and who responded to IvIg. This produced a
   definition of CB in MMN patients which was compared with existing
   definitions to assess ``miss rates{''}.
   Results: Mean values for compound muscle action potential area,
   amplitude, and duration were calculated in normal subjects. Results
   beyond 3 SD of their respective means were considered abnormal. Using
   these criteria, CB in the context of MMN was defined as a reduction in
   negative peak area > 23\% along a distal nerve segment or > 29\% across
   a proximal segment; or a reduction in amplitude > 32\% across a distal
   segment or > 33\% across a proximal segment. All IvIg responsive
   patients had at least one nerve segment showing such CB. Employing some
   criteria from the literature would have denied treatment to over 30\% of
   responsive patients.
   Conclusion: In the clinical setting of suspected MMN, less stringent
   criteria for CB can improve the diagnosis of this treatable disorder.
   Exclusions on grounds of temporal dispersion may be over-restrictive.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that the temporal resolution of blood
   oxygenation level dependent functional MRI is limited due to the
   inherent latency and longevity of the haemodynamic response. However, in
   this study we introduce a technique for measurement of timing
   differences from within the same brain region in two (or more) separate
   tasks that allows accurate determination of cortical timing differences
   >= 200ms. Our technique, based on a novel use of linear regression
   analysis, is shown to yield accurate results both in simulated and
   experimental data. We show that cortical timing differences measured
   using fMRI are consistent with published electrophysiological results.
   Measurement of timing differences using this technique could prove a
   useful strategy for identifying neural network components in a wide
   range of cognitive paradigms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Persons who have been infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea
   (CT/GC) are at elevated risk for reinfection. The cost-effectiveness of
   interventions designed to encourage public sexually transmitted disease
   (STD) clinic patients to return for rescreening has not been
   well-evaluated.
   Goal: The goal of this study was to conduct a program- and
   societal-perspective cost-effectiveness analysis of five interventions
   designed to encourage public STD clinic patients infected with CT/GC to
   return for rescreening 3 months after initial treatment.
   Study: Researchers at two STD clinics collected cost data for the five
   interventions. These were combined with study data on return rates and
   CT/GC positivity rates among returning patients to compare the
   cost-effectiveness of the interventions.
   Results: The cost per patient counseled with a brief recommendation to
   return, followed by a telephone reminder after 3 months, was higher than
   two interventions: a brief recommendation to return with no reminder and
   a \$20 incentive, received on return. However, the brief recommendation
   with a telephone reminder yielded the highest return rate (33\%) and was
   the least costly in terms of cost per infection treated (\$622 program,
   \$813 societal). In-depth motivational counseling that helped clients
   identify risk factors and provided reasons for returning was more costly
   than a phone reminder alone and was not more effective.
   Conclusions: Phone reminders are more cost-effective than motivational
   counseling and improve return rates over a brief recommendation given at
   the time of initial treatment.}},

Journal = {{CHEST}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1225-1232}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Unlike studies on leg exercise, reports on the regulation of
   dynamic hyperinflation during arm exercise are scanty. We ascertained
   the following in patients with COPD: (1) whether and to what extent
   upper-limb exercise results in dynamic hyperinflation, and (2) the
   mechanism whereby, an arm-training program (ATP) reduces arm effort and
   dyspnea.
   Patients: Twelve patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were tested
   during incremental, symptom-limited arm exercise after a nonintervention
   control period (pre-ATP) and after ATP.
   Methods: Exercise testing (1-min increments of 5 W) was performed using
   an arm ergometer. Oxygen uptake (Vo(2)), carbon dioxide output, minute
   ventilation (VE), tidal volume, and respiratory rate (RR) were measured
   continuously, during the tests. Inspiratory capacity, (IC), exercise
   dyspnea, and arm effort using a Borg scale were assessed at each step of
   exercise.
   Results: Arm exercise resulted in a significant decrease in IC and
   significant positive relationships of IC with an increase in Vo(2) and
   exercise dyspnea and arm effort. The results of ATP were as follows: (1)
   a significant increase in exercise capacity (p < 0.001); (2) no change
   in the relationships of exercise dyspnea and arm effort with VE and IC,
   and of IC with Vo(2); (3) at a standardized work rate, VE, exercise
   dyspnea, and arm effort significantly decreased, while the decrease in
   IC was significantly, less (p < 0.01) than before the ATP; the decrease
   in VE was accomplished primarily, by, a decrease in RR; and (4) at
   standardized VE, exercise dyspnea and arm effort decreased
   significantly.
   Conclusions: Arm exercise results in the association of dynamic
   hyperinflation, exercise dyspnea, and arm effort in COPD patients. An
   ATP increases arm endurance, modulates dynamic hyperinflation, and
   reduces symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate treatment outcome of acute hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) in HIV-positive individuals.
   Design: Open-label, prospective study conducted in London, January
   1997-December 2003.
   Methods: Patients in whom acute HCV infection had been diagnosed had
   sequential HCV RNA levels measured at 0, 4, 12, 24, 32, and 48 weeks. If
   HCV RNA positive at 12 weeks, patients were offered pegylated interferon
   alpha-2b 1.5 mu g/kg/wk and ribavirin 8001200 mg/d for 24 weeks.
   Patients with increasing HCV RNA titers were offered treatment earlier.
   Results: Fifty male homosexuals with a mean age 37 years were
   identified: 44 from abnormal liver function test results, 4 from sexual
   contact with an HCV positive partner, and 2 at HIV seroconversion.
   Overall, 12 individuals became HCV RNA negative spontaneously. This was
   significantly associated with high baseline median CD4(+) count (P =
   0.029), CD4(+) count > 500 cells/mm(3) (P = 0.017), and lower HCV RNA
   titers (P = 0.017). Only 27 patients accepted treatment, 16 (59\%) of
   whom reached sustained virologic response. This was associated with
   higher peak mean alanine aminotransferase (P < 0.001) and higher
   baseline CD4\% (P = 0.041).
   Conclusions: Sustained virologic response rates in HIV positive patients
   treated for acute HCV infection are lower than in HIV negative subjects.
   Because a high percentage of individuals seroconvert spontaneously,
   treatment should be delayed until after 12 weeks.}},

Abstract = {{Four behavioural states are recognised in the human fetus and are
   comparable to those of the neonate: 1 F (quiet sleep), 2F (active
   state), 3F (quiet awake), and 4F (active awake). State 5, or crying, is
   not considered to have a fetal correlate. In a stud assessing the
   effects of exposure to tobacco and cocaine during pregnancy on fetal
   response and habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation, what appears to
   be the fetal homologue of crying was observed. These behaviours were
   seen on ultrasound, and have been captured on video recordings and
   include: an initial exhalation movement associated with mouth opening
   and tongue depression, followed by a series of three augmented breaths,
   the last breath ending in an inspiratory pause followed by an expiration
   and settling. This is the first report/video documenting these
   behaviours and suggests the possibility of a state 5F.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied by means of density functional theory (DFT) plane-wave
   calculations the adsorption properties of ultrathin MgO films grown on
   Mo(100) as function of the thickness of the oxide film, and compared the
   results with those of unsupported slabs representing a single-crystal
   MgO(100) surface. The presence of a metal substrate at the interface
   with the MgO film results in the charging of adsorbed atoms with high
   electron affinity, like Ag and Au, while Pd is basically unperturbed. As
   a consequence, while the properties of Pd are the same on MgO(100) or
   MgO/Mo(100), for Ag and Au substantial differences are found. On
   MgO/Mo(100) films the Ag(5s) and the Au(6s) levels fall below the Fermi
   level of Mo, leading to negative charging of the metal atom and to a
   different bonding mechanism; the 5s level of Pd, on the contrary, is
   just above the Fermi level of Mo, and no charge transfer occurs. The
   effect tends to decrease for thicker MgO films and is closely related to
   the change in work function of the Mo(100) surface when a thin MgO film
   is deposited on it and to the appearance of metal-induced gap states at
   the metal-insulator interface. The results are of relevance to
   understand the properties of ultrathin oxide films. The charging effect
   is absent on single-crystal or polycrystalline MgO surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Cerceris is a very interesting genus, providing species living in all
   continents, in different climatic conditions, showing behaviors ranging
   from solitary to social. About the nesting habit of this genus, many
   authors described nest characteristics and prey, providing useful
   material for comparison. Yet, the majority of species studied so far
   live in temperate regions and we lack information about the tropical
   ones. The high number of species and their wide distribution suggest a
   phylogenetic adaptability that merit to be studied deeper. I
   investigated nest and prey of a tropical species, Cerceris binodis
   Spinola, on Barro Colorado Nature Monument in Panama. The study was
   performed during three dry seasons, marking and excavating nests,
   observing individual's behavior and collecting prey. The nests, reused
   over the same season and in following years, are especially deep as
   observed only in another neotropical species, Cerceris lutzi Scullen.
   This result could be correlated with tropical soils depth and
   characteristics. In spite of the species being sexually dimorphic, the
   subterranean cells show no bimodality in size or content. Prey,
   identified from specimens carried by provisioning females, belongs to
   Clytrinae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Quantitative data on prey are
   analyzed comparing seasons and sites and differences emerged. Cerceris
   adaptability to ecological trait of the tropics is inferred to explain
   these differences as well as the ones observed in the nest structure.}},

Abstract = {{A quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet with a strong reduction of the
   ordered spin component, BaCu2Si2O7, is studied by the magnetic resonance
   technique in a wide field and frequency range. In addition to a
   conventional spin-flop transition at the magnetic field parallel to the
   easy axis of spin ordering, magnetic resonance spectra indicate
   additional spin-reorientation transitions in all three principal
   orientations of magnetic fields. At these additional transitions the
   spins rotate in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, keeping the
   mutual arrangement of ordered spin components. The observed magnetic
   resonance spectra and spin-reorientation phase transitions are
   quantitatively described by a model that includes the anisotropy of
   transverse susceptibility with respect to the order parameter
   orientation. The anisotropy of the transverse susceptibility and the
   strong reduction of the anisotropy energy due to the quantum spin
   fluctuations are proposed to be the reason for the observed spin
   reorientations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose More and more patients use herbal medical products (HMP) and
   dietary supplements (DS). Due to the possibility of drug interactions
   and side effects, it is important that physicians are aware of the use.
   The aim of the present cross sectional survey was to analyse the
   consumption of HMP and DS among patients recently discharged from two
   hospital departments.
   Methods Patients were visited within 1 week after discharge and
   interviewed about their use of HMP and DS. Stored products were
   inspected and registered. Hospital files and discharge letters were
   examined to establish the frequency of registration.
   Results Totally, 83 surgical and 117 medical patients were included
   (n=200), 139 patients (70\%) were women. 53 patients (27\%) stored no
   HMP or DS, whereas the home inventories of 147 patients (74\%) comprised
   343 products. 116 patients (58\%) used HMP or DS daily and 25 patients
   (13\%) used the products on demand. The most frequently used product was
   multivitamins (82 patients = 41\%). Totally, 61\% of the products were
   used on the patients' own initiative. In 3\% of the used products,
   patients were aware of possible side effects. No patients were aware of
   possible drug interactions. Only 21\% of the 211 FLMP and DS used daily
   prior to admission were recorded in the hospital files.
   Conclusions The use of HMP and DS was frequent among surgical and
   medical patients. The use was often not recorded in the hospital files
   and patients' knowledge of possible side effects and drug-interactions
   was minimal. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The constant capacitance model, a chemical surface complexation model,
   was applied to arsenate, As(V), adsorption on 49 soils selected for
   variation in soil properties. The constant capacitance model was able to
   fit arsenate adsorption on all soils by optimizing either three
   monodentate or two bidentate As(V) surface complexation constants. A
   general regression model was developed for predicting soil As(V) surface
   complexation constants from easily measured soil chemical
   characteristics. These chemical properties were cation exchange capacity
   (CEC), inorganic C (IOC) content, organic C (OC) content, iron oxide
   content, and surface area (SA). The prediction equations were used to
   obtain values for the As(V) surface complexation constants for five
   additional soils, thereby providing a completely independent evaluation
   of the ability of the constant capacitance model to describe As(V)
   adsorption. The model's ability to predict As(V) adsorption was
   quantitative on three soils, semi-quantitative on one soil, and poor on
   another soil. Incorporation of these prediction equations into chemical
   speciation-transport models will allow simulation of soil solution As(V)
   concentrations under diverse agricultural and environmental conditions
   without the requirement of soil specific adsorption data and subsequent
   parameter optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The aim of this study was to define normal ultrasonographic
   growth of the fetal maxillary bone throughout pregnancy as a basis for
   further studies and as normative data for assessing deviations in
   growth. Methods. A prospective cross-sectional study was performed.
   Consecutive routine biometric measurements and fetal organ scans were
   obtained from patients undergoing elective fetal anatomic surveys.
   Special attention was paid to the profile view of the fetal face, and
   the maxillary bone was identified and measured. Results. Three hundred
   twenty-seven fetuses between 13 and 40 weeks' gestation were scanned.
   The maxillary bone is seen as a rodlike structure; it is a part of the
   facial skeleton that allows the opening and closing of the pharynx. A
   linear growth function was observed across gestational age (GA), and
   first-degree correlation was found to exist between GA and the maxillary
   bone (r = .645; P < .0001; y = 7.78 + 0.18 x GA). Significant
   correlation was also found between the maxillary bone and biparietal
   diameter (BPD) (r = 0.652; P > .0001; y = 8.36 + 0.66 x BPD), head
   circumference (HC) (r = .645; P < .0001; y = 8.39 + 0.18 x HC), femoral
   bone length (FBL) (r = .640; P < .0001; y = 9.28 + 0.7 x FBL), and
   abdominal circumference (AC) (r = .640; P < .0001; y = 8.91 + 0.17 x
   AC). Conclusions. Normative data for ultrasonographic measurements of
   the fetal maxillary bone throughout pregnancy are provided. These data
   potentially allow the prenatal diagnosis of abnormal maxillary bone
   length.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{CD44 and L-selectin (CD62L) are major adhesion receptors that mediate
   leucocyte recruitment at inflammatory sites and lymph nodes, by
   supporting cell rolling under blood flow. Both CD44 and CD62L have been
   implicated in inflammatory skin disorders, but their specific
   involvement in an immediate-type allergic reaction remains uncertain. We
   used mice deficient in CD44 or CED62L or both in order to determine
   whether one or both of these molecules were required for leucocyte
   extravasation in an atopic dermatitis-like allergic response. Wild-type
   (WT) mice and mice deficient in CD44, CD62L or both were immunized with
   ovalbumin (OVA). Inflammatory reaction in the ear was elicited once by
   means of intradermal injection of OVA. Effective sensitization of CD62L
   knockout (KO) mice required intraperitoneal antigen injection; however,
   OVA-specific T helper 2 (Th2)-type immune responses and IgE production
   in mice lacking CD44, CD62L or both were comparable to those in WT mice
   following intraperitoneal immunization. We employed intravital
   videomicroscopy to monitor the recruitment of fluorescence-labelled
   leucocytes to the ear tissue following challenge with OVA. The number of
   adherent leucocytes was significantly reduced in CD44 KO and CD44/CD62L
   double KO mice, indicating that CD44 was involved in firm adhesion, the
   committed step of leucocyte extravasation. Histology of the
   OVA-challenged ears showed a diminished leucocyte infiltration in the
   ears of CD44 KO and double KO mice. The results of our study demonstrate
   that CD44, but not CD62L, is required for leucocyte extravasation during
   a Th2-type inflammatory response.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine the timing and mechanisms of the spontaneous
   diploidisation throughout microspore-derived embryogenesis in barley, we
   have estimated the ploidy level of individual nuclei within young
   pro-embryos, from the first androgenetic division up to multinuclear
   structures still surounded by the exine. Our methodological approach was
   based on the measure of the intensity of fluorescence after
   4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining, nuclear size and
   number of nucleoli in the confocal microscope. This method avoids the
   overlapping of the fluorescence signal in multinuclear pro-embryos,
   which cannot be studied using cytophotometer methods based on other
   types of fluorescence microscopes. The identification of haploid and
   diploid nuclei enabled us to determine the timing of diploidisation at
   early stages throughout androgenetic development. We found that
   diploidisation is an ongoing process that can start after the first
   embyogenic division and continues in multinuclear pro-embryos.
   Reconstruction of 3D-images of entire pro-embryos and the observation of
   cross and longitudinal sections across stacks of optical sections,
   together with correlative light and electron microscopy, provided
   evidences of nuclear fusion as the main mechanism of diploidisation.}},

Abstract = {{Monothalamous foraminifera were abundant in sediment samples from fjords
   and offshore areas around western Svalbard (water depth range 26-2472
   m). The > 500 mu m fractions of samples from the inner parts of fjords
   yielded numerous delicate ``allogromiids{''} (organic-walled)
   ``saccamminids{''} and ``psammosphaerids{''} (agglutinated), including
   species assigned to Cylindrogullmia, Gloiogullmia, Nemogullmia and
   Toxisarcon. Larger, more robust, tubular agglutinated species were
   abundant in the outer reaches of Tempelfjord, Isfjord and Van
   Meijenfjord (Hyperammina subnodosa, Hippocrepinella crassa), on the
   current-influenced upper slope off Isfjord (Pelosina variabilis,
   Rhabdammina abyssorum), and the deeper part of the continental slope off
   Isfjord (e.g. Hyperammina crassatina). Oval and sausage-shaped organisms
   resembling gromiids (probably relatives of the foraminifera) were
   sometimes abundant in the fjords. Finer size fractions (63-500 mu m) of
   fjord samples yielded a rich variety of monothalamous species. Among the
   allogromiids, Micrometula sp. was widely distributed, while Tinogullmia
   sp. and an undescribed species were restricted to single stations in
   Kongsfjord and Van Meijenfjord, respectively. Saccamminids common in the
   finer fractions included Conqueria spp., Psammophaga sp., and
   undescribed species with silvery, white and brownish tests. Many of the
   smaller allogromiids and saccamminids in our Svalbard samples resemble
   species found in the Gullmarfjord on the Swedish west coast.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term pair bonds and defense of territories year-round are common
   among tropical passerines. The boundaries of these territories tend to
   be stable, perhaps reflecting the need to defend an area that,
   regardless of conditions, provides sufficient food resources. If,
   however, these stable territories are not, even temporarily,
   sufficiently large, then intra-pair competition for available food may
   result, particularly in species with no sexual size dimorphism. With
   such competition, sex-specific differences in foraging behavior may
   result. Male and female Dusky Antbirds (Cercomacra tyrannina) are not
   size dimorphic, and pairs jointly defend territories throughout the
   year. Our objective was to determine if paired Dusky Antbirds exhibited
   sex-specific differences in foraging behavior. Foraging antbirds were
   observed in central Panama from February-July 2002 to determine if pairs
   partitioned food resources. Males and females exhibited no differences
   in Foraging behavior, with individuals of both sexes foraging at similar
   heights and using the same foraging maneuvers (glean, probe, and sally)
   and substrates (leaves, rolled leaves, and woody surfaces). These
   results suggest that Dusky Antbirds do not partition resources and that
   territory switching, rather than resource partitioning, may be the means

Abstract = {{Modern Terahertz-subTerahertz (THz-subTHz) spectrometers, based on
   continuously frequency-tunable coherent sources of radiation, the
   backward-wave oscillators (BWOs), are described which cover the
   frequencies v = 1 cm(-1) - 50 cm(-1) (0.03 - 1.5 THz) and allow for
   measurements at temperatures 2 - 1000 K, also in magnetic fields. They
   allow for direct determination of spectra of any optical parameter of a
   material at millimeter-submillimeter wavelengths, the domain where
   infrared or microwave spectrometers encounter serious methodological
   difficulties. We report on new technical abilities of the quasioptical
   BWO-spectrometers and discuss their main components. We demonstrate
   abilities of the THz-subTHz BWO-spectroscopy by presenting some latest

Abstract = {{Changes in organic C, total N, C:N ratio, activities of cellulase,

   composting of different organic wastes such as mixture of sugarcane
   trash and cattle dung, press mud, poultry waste and water hyacinth
   biomass. There were losses of N in poultry waste and water hyacinth with
   the effect an initial increase in C:N ratio was observed which decreased
   later on due to decomposition. The activities of cellulase, xylanase and
   protease were maximum between 30 and 60 days of composting in various
   wastes. Similar trend was observed with respect to mesophilic bacterial
   and fungal population. Various quality parameters like C:N ratio, water
   soluble C (WSC), CO2, evolution and level of humic substances were
   compared after 90 day composting. There was statistically significant
   correlation between C:N ratio and CO, evolution, WSC and humic
   substances. Significant correlation between CO, evolved and level of
   humic substances was also observed. The study shows that no single
   parameter can be taken as an index of compost maturity. However, C:N

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the
   severity and course of depressive symptoms on change in quality of life
   (QOL) 6 months after cardiac surgery. Methods: Ninety patients were
   interviewed before heart surgery and 2 and 6 months after surgery.
   Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory,
   and QOL was assessed using physical and psychosocial functioning indices
   derived from the Medical Outcomes Study instrument. Multiple regression
   examined the effects of the severity and course of depressive symptoms
   on QOL adjusting for demographic and biomedical predictors. Results:
   Higher levels of presurgical depressive symptoms predicted poorer
   physical functioning after cardiac surgery. A similar effect on
   psychosocial functioning fell short of significance. An increase in
   depressive symptoms 2 months after surgery was significantly predictive
   of poorer physical and psychosocial functioning at 6 months. The effect
   of increased depressive symptoms on psychosocial functioning was
   significantly stronger in patients with high presurgical Beck Depression
   Inventory scores. Conclusions: Both preoperative depressive symptoms and
   postoperative increases in depressive symptoms seem associated with
   poorer QOL 6 months after cardiac surgery. Further examination of these
   associations and the mechanisms they reflect may provide a basis for
   guiding treatment decisions before and after coronary artery bypass
   graft surgery.}},

   suggesting an advanced epidemiological transition status. Grouped,
   chronic diseases represent the principal cause of death in
   municipalities with high urban concentration. To identify associated
   factors of chronic conditions later in life, school children stratified
   by age, socio-economic level and gender were studied. By random sampling
   of 14 schools 2.807 children were examined to measure: anthropometry,
   work capacity, food intake, sexual maturation, blood pressure, and blood
   levels of glucose and lipids. Weight and height for all ages and gender
   were lower than international reference but higher than in previous
   studies. On the contrary body mass indicators were higher. Work capacity
   adjusted for body weight was higher in low income children. Mean age of
   menarche was 11,9 years. The relative peak of growth was 11 years for
   girls and 14 for boys. Maturity was reached at 12 years in women and 17
   in men. Blood lipids were considered high and borderline high in a large
   proportion of the students, while 19,5\% had systolic blood pressure >=
   120 mm. and 24\% diastolic >= 70. Intake of protein and energy was
   adequate, but diet was high in fat and sugar. There was not deficiency
   in macro nutrients but dietary intake of some minerals was low,
   specially iron and calcium. The findings indicate a population with
   unbalanced diet and disturbing high body mass and lipid concentration
   that could represent in the future an increase in the already high

Pages = {{957-971}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{To help manage the fluctuations inherent in fish populations scientists
   have argued for both an ecosystem approach to management and the greater
   use of marine reserves. Support for reserves includes empirical evidence
   that they can raise the spawning biomass and mean size of exploited
   populations, increase the abundance of species and, relative to
   reference sites, raise population density, biomass, fish size and
   diversity. By contrast, fishers often oppose the establishment and
   expansion of marine reserves and claim that reserves provide few, if
   any, economic payoffs. Using a stochastic optimal control model with two
   forms of ecological uncertainty we demonstrate that reserves create a
   resilience effect that allows for the population to recover faster, and
   can also raise the harvest immediately following a negative shock. The
   tradeoff of a larger reserve is a reduced harvest in the absence of a
   negative shock such that a reserve will never encompass the entire
   population if the goal is to maximize the economic returns from
   harvesting, and fishing is profitable. Under a wide range of parameter
   values with ecological uncertainty, and in the `worst case' scenario for
   a reserve, we show that a marine reserve can increase the economic
   payoff to fishers even when the harvested population is not initially
   overexploited, harvesting is economically optimal and the population is
   persistent. Moreover, we show that the benefits of a reserve cannot be
   achieved by existing effort or output controls. Our results demonstrate
   that, in many cases, there is no tradeoff between the economic payoff of
   fishers and ecological benefits when a reserve is established at equal
   to, or less than, its optimum size. (c) 2004 Society for Mathematical

Abstract = {{In a recent survey article, G. Gratzer and E. T. Schmidt raise the
   problem when is the ideal lattice of a sectionally complemented chopped
   lattice sectionally complemented. The only general result is a 1999
   lemma of theirs, stating that if the finite chopped lattice is the union
   of two ideals that intersect in a two-element ideal U, then the ideal
   lattice of M is sectionally complemented.
   In this paper, we present examples showing that in many ways their
   result is optimal. A typical result is the following: For any finite
   sectionally complemented lattice U with more than two elements, there
   exists a finite sectionally complemented chopped lattice M that is (i)
   the union of two ideals intersecting in the ideal U; (ii) the ideal
   lattice of M is not sectionally complemented.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations are used to investigate the

   mean-field analysis of island growth is extended to include anisotropic

   diffusion mechanism influence the nucleation rate. It is found that
   anisotropy in adatom hopping reduces the density of stable islands. It
   is also found that although the shape of the island size distribution is
   sensitive to island relaxation processes, it is not discernibly affected
   by hopping anisotropy with ratios D-xx/D-yy up to 16.}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Cross-sectional survey research has shown correlations
   between drink-driving behavior and people's beliefs concerning the
   riskiness, social acceptability and morality of driving under the
   influence of alcohol. The current study examines the association between
   such beliefs and subsequent alcohol-impaired driving in a sample of
   offenders who were driving under the influence (DUI). Method: Repeated
   inter-views were conducted with 182 multiple DUI offenders. Baseline
   data included measures of moral and prescriptive beliefs concerning
   alcohol-impaired driving (internal behavioral controls), perceived risks
   of criminal punishment and crashes associated with alcohol-impaired
   driving (external behavioral controls) and perceived peer-group
   attitudes toward alcohol-impaired driving (social control). The
   dependent variable in the study was a measure of self-reported
   alcohol-impaired driving over the preceding 2 years, collected at 2-year
   follow-up from baseline. Results: Results from multiple regression
   modeling showed significant protective effects associated with the
   beliefs that driving after drinking is immoral and that random police
   sobriety checks are a good idea (internal control items). Results also
   showed that a social desirability control measure was predictive of
   increased risk, at follow-up, for driving after drinking. Conclusions:
   These results suggest that internal controls may protect against
   alcohol-impaired driving behavior, even in a high-risk sample of repeat
   DUI offenders. The results also suggest that future policy interventions
   to curtail drink-driving might profitably be designed to promote these
   sorts of behavioral controls.}},

Pages = {{147-153}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Nucleophosmin ( also known as NPM, B23, NO38) is a nucleolar protein
   directly implicated in cancer pathogenesis, as the NPM1 gene is found
   mutated and rearranged in a number of haematological disorders(1-5).
   Furthermore, the region of chromosome 5 to which NPM1 maps is deleted in
   a proportion of de novo human myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)(6-9), and
   loss of chromosome 5 is extremely frequent in therapy-related MDS9,10.
   NPM is a multifunctional protein(11-15), and its role in oncogenesis is
   controversial as NPM has been attributed with both oncogenic and tumour
   suppressive functions(16-19). To study the function of Npm in vivo, we
   generated a hypomorphic Npm1 mutant series (Npm1(+/-) < Npm1(hy/ hy) <
   Npm1(-/-)) in mouse. Here we report that Npm is essential for embryonic
   development and the maintenance of genomic stability. Npm1(-/-) and
   Npm1(hy/hy) mutants have aberrant organogenesis and die between
   embryonic day E11.5 and E16.5 owing to severe anaemia resulting from
   defects in primitive haematopoiesis. We show that Npm1 inactivation
   leads to unrestricted centrosome duplication and genomic instability. We
   demonstrate that Npm is haploinsufficient in the control of genetic
   stability and that Npm1 heterozygosity accelerates oncogenesis both in
   vitro and in vivo. Notably, Npm1(+/-) mice develop a haematological
   syndrome with features of human MDS. Our findings uncover an essential
   developmental role for Npm and implicate its functional loss in
   tumorigenesis and MDS pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Revegetation, or other erosion control treatments of disturbed soil
   slopes in forested areas and along highways of the Lake Tahoe basin are
   directed at reduction of sediment loading to waterways reaching the
   lake. However, following treatment, little vegetation monitoring, or
   hydrologic evaluation has been conducted either to determine if the
   various treatments are successful or to assess the duration of erosion
   control anticipated in the field. Here, we build upon results from use
   of the portable rainfall simulator (RS) described in the first two
   papers of this series to evaluate cover and revegetation treatment
   effects on runoff rates and sediment concentrations and yields from
   disturbed granitic and volcanic soils in the basin. The effects of slope
   on rainfall runoff, infiltration and erosion rates were determined at
   several revegetated road cut and ski run sites. Rainfall simulation
   (similar to 60 mm h(-1), approximating a 100-year, 15-minute storm) had
   a mean drop size of similar to 2.1 mm and approximately 70 per cent of
   `natural' rainfall kinetic energy. Measurements of: time to runoff;
   infiltration; runoff amount; sediment yield; and average sediment
   concentration were obtained. Runoff sediment concentrations and yields
   from sparsely covered volcanic and bare granitic soils can be correlated
   to slope. Sediment concentrations and yields from nearly bare volcanic
   soils exceeded those from granitic soils by an order of magnitude across
   slopes ranging from 30-70 percent. Revegetation, or application of
   pine-needle mulch covers to both soil types dramatically decreased
   sediment concentrations and yields. Incorporation of woodchips or soil
   rehabilitation that includes tillage, use of amendments (biosol,
   compost) and mulch covers together with plant seeding resulted in little
   or no runoff or sediment yield from both soils. Repeated measurements of
   sediment concentrations and yields in the subsequent two years following
   woodchip or soil rehabilitation treatments continued to result in little
   or no runoff. Revegetation treatments involving only use of grasses to
   cover the soils were largely ineffective due to sparse sustainable
   coverage ( < 35 percent) and inadequate infiltration rates. Copyright

Abstract = {{We evaluated whether pericardial injections of the retrograde tracers
   cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) or Fast Blue (FB) reliably labelled
   cardiac vagal pre-ganglionic neurons. Injections of CTb into the
   pericardial space of the rat labelled neurons in both the external and
   compact formations of the nucleus ambiguus. Most labelled neurons were
   found in the compact formation of the nucleus ambiguus, and the majority
   of these, and only these, expressed immunoreactivity for calcitonin
   gene-related peptide. This distribution of labelled neurons and their
   immunohistochemical properties is characteristic of oesophageal
   motoneurons. Examination of the oesophagus following intra-pericardial
   CTb applications revealed strong labelling of motor end plates within
   the skeletal muscle of the thoracic but not the abdominal oesophagus.
   When a second retrograde tracer, FB, was injected into the abdominal
   oesophagus, labelled somata were found adjacent to CTb-labelled neurons
   in the compact formation of the nucleus ambiguus. No co-localisation of
   tracers was found, but identical proportions of calcitonin gene-related
   peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity were observed in both groups of neurons.
   FB injected into the pericardial space labelled intra-cardiac neurons

Abstract = {{Background: There is a need for DNA sequencing methods that are faster,
   more accurate, and less expensive than existing techniques. Here we
   present a new method for DNA analysis by means of indexer walking.
   Methods: For DNA sequencing by indexer walking, we ligated
   double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides (indexers) to DNA fragments
   that were produced by type IIS restriction endonucleases, which generate
   nonidentical 4-nucleotide 5' overhangs. The subsequent amplification (30
   thermal cycles) of indexed DNA provided a template for automated DNA
   sequencing with fluorescent dideoxy terminators. The data gathered in
   the first sequencing reaction permitted further movement into the
   unknown nucleotide sequence by digestion of analyzed DNA with selected
   type IIS restriction endonuclease followed by ligation of the next
   indexer. A library of presynthesized indexers consisting of 256
   oligonucleotides was used for bidirectional analysis of DNA molecules
   and provided universal primers for sequencing.
   Results: The proposed protocol was successfully applied to sequencing of
   cryptic plasmids isolated from pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli.
   The overall error rate for base-calling was 0.5\%, with a mean read
   length of 550 nucleotides. Approximately 1000 nucleotides of
   high-quality sequence could be obtained per day from a single clone.
   Conclusions: Indexer walking can be used as a low-cost procedure for
   nucleotide sequence determination of DNA molecules, such as natural
   plasmids, cDNA clones, and longer DNA fragments. It can also serve as an
   alternative method for gap filling at the final stage of genome
   sequencing projects. (C) 2005 American Association for Clinical

Abstract = {{We present AUDENS, a new platform-independent open source tool for
   automated de novo sequencing of peptides from MS/MS data. We implemented
   a dynamic programming algorithm and combined it with a flexible

   screens through the spectrum and assigns high relevance values to
   putative signal peaks. The algorithm constructs a sequence path through
   the MS/MS spectrum using the peak relevances to score each suggested
   sequence path, i.e., the corresponding amino acid sequence. At present,
   we consider AUDENS a prototype that unfolds its biggest potential if
   used in parallel with other de novo sequencing tools. AUDENS is

Abstract = {{Root growth is critical to the establishment of planted seedlings.
   Seedlings can undergo stress just after planting if root growth is not
   sufficient to couple the seedling to available soil water. Stress occurs
   when a newly planted seedling's root system can not supply enough water
   to transpiring needles to maintain a proper water balance and ensure
   survival. Thus, a newly planted seedling's ability to overcome planting
   stress is affected by its root system size and distribution, root-soil
   contact, and root hydraulic conductivity. This paper describes how
   factors of root growth and water status of newly planted seedlings are
   important in overcoming the phenomenon of planting stress which then
   allows a newly planted seedling to enter the establishment phase of

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), residual tumor cannot
   be differentiated from nonspecific postoperative changes in operated
   patients with brain gliomas. The higher specificity and sensitivity of
   I: (methyl-11C)-labeled methionine positron emissions tomography
   (MET-PET) in gliomas has been demonstrated in previous studies and is
   the rationale for the integration of this investigation in gross tumor
   volume delineation. The goal of this trial was to quantify the affect of
   MET-PET vs. with MRI in gross tumor volume definition for radiotherapy
   planning of high-grade gliomas.
   Methods and Materials: The trial included 39 patients with resected
   malignant gliomas. MRI and MET-PET data were coregistered based on
   mutual information. The residual tumor volume on MET-PET and the volume
   of tissue abnormalities on T-1-weighted MRI (gadolinium {[}Gd]
   enhancement) and T-2-weighted MRI (hyperintensity areas) were compared
   using MET-PET/MRI fusion images.
   Results: The MET-PET vs. Gd-enhanced T-1-weighted MRI analysis was
   performed on 39 patients. In 5 patients (13\%), MET uptake corresponded
   exactly with Gd enhancement, and in 29 (74\%) of 39 patients, the region
   of MET uptake was larger than that of the Gd enhancement. In 27 (69\%)
   of the 39 patients, the Gd enhancement area extended beyond the MET
   enhancement. MET uptake was detected up to 45 mm beyond the Gd
   enhancement. MET-PET vs. T-2-weighted MRI was investigated in 18
   patients. MET uptake did not correspond exactly with the hyperintensity
   areas on T-2-Weighted MRI in any patient. In 9 (50\%) of 18 patients,
   MET uptake extended beyond the hyperintensity area on the T-2-weighted
   MRI, and in 18 (100\%), at least some hyperintensity on the T-2-weighted
   MRI was located outside the MET enhancement area. MET uptake was
   detected up to 40 mm beyond the hyperintensity area on T-2-weighted MRI.
   Conclusion: In operated patients with brain gliomas, the size and
   location of residual MET uptake differs considerably from abnormalities
   found on postoperative MRI. Because postoperative changes cannot be
   differentiated from residual tumor by MRI, MET-PET, with a greater
   specificity for tumor tissue, can help to outline the gross tumor volume
   with greater accuracy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Bank filtration and artificial recharge provide an important drinking
   water source to the city of Berlin. Due to the practice of water
   recycling through a semi-closed urban water cycle, the introduction of
   effluent organic matter (EfOM) and persistent trace organic pollutants
   in the drinking water is of potential concern. In the work reported
   herein, the research objectives are to study the removal of bulk and
   trace organics at bank filtration and artificial recharge sites and to
   assess important factors of influence for the Berlin area. The monthly
   analytical program is comprised of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV
   absorbance (UVA(254)), liquid chromatography with organic carbon
   detection (LC-OCD), differentiated adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) and
   single organic compound analysis of a few model compounds. More than 1
   year of monitoring was conducted on observation wells located along the
   flowpaths of the infiltrating water at two field sites that have
   different characteristics regarding redox conditions, travel time, and
   travel distance. Two transects are highlighted: one associated with a
   bank filtration site dominated by anoxic/anaerobic conditions with a
   travel time of up to 4-5 months, and another with an artificial recharge
   site dominated by aerobic conditions with a travel time of up to 50
   days. It was found that redox conditions and travel time significantly
   influence the DOC degradation kinetics and the efficiency of AOX and
   trace compound removal. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel magnetically levitated (maglev) stage
   developed to meet the ever-increasing precise positioning requirements
   in nanotechnology. This magnetic levitator has 6 independent linear
   actuators necessary and sufficient to generate all 6-degree-of-freedom
   (6-DOF) motions. This minimum-actuator design concept led to a compact,
   200 g lightweight moving part and the power consumption less than of a
   Watt, thereby reducing the thermal-expansion error drastically The
   analysis and sizing of the magnetic linear actuators and the working
   principle of the maglev stage are presented. We designed and implemented
   stabilizing controllers for 6-DOF motion control with the dynamic model
   based on the actuator analysis. Test results showed nanoscale step
   responses in all six axes, with 2 nm rms horizontal position noise. A
   noise propagation model and analysis identified the capacitance sensor
   noise and the floor vibration as the dominant noise sources in the
   vertical and horizontal dynamics, respectively. A comparison of noise
   performances with controllers closed at 25, 65, and 90 Hz crossover
   frequencies illustrated how the selection of the control bandwidth
   should be made for nanopositioning. Experimental results including a 250
   mu m step response, sinusoidal and square-wave trajectories, and
   spherical motion generation demonstrated the three-dimensional (3D)
   nanoscale motion-control capability of this minimum-actuator magnetic
   levitator. Potential applications of this maglev stage include
   manufacture of nanoscale structures, atomic-level manipulation, assembly

Abstract = {{Different genetic and botanical sources of starches are available for

   this study were to evaluate the effects of the type of acetylated starch
   and the presence of polylactic acid (PLA) and ethanol on the functional
   properties of extruded foams, and to compare the specific mechanical
   energy requirements for preparing these foams. Acetylated starches
   prepared from potato and native (25\% amylose) and high amylose (70\%)
   corn starches were extruded with 0, 7.5, or 15\% PLA and 8, 13, or 18\%
   ethanol using a twin-screw extruder with a 160 degrees C barrel
   temperature and 180 rpm screw speed. Response surface methodology was
   employed to study the acetylated starch, PLA, and ethanol effects on
   radial expansion ratio, bulk density and compressibility of the extruded
   foams and the specific mechanical energy required to extrude the
   acetylated starch-PLA blends. The acetylated potato and native and high
   amylose corn starches had degrees of substitution (DS) of 1.09, 2.05,
   and 2.65, respectively. Acetylated 70\% amylose cornstarch agglomerates
   had the highest hardness whereas acetylated potato starch had the
   lowest. Higher DS acetylated starch had higher radial expansion ratio,
   compressibility, specific mechanical energy requirement, and lower bulk
   density than acetylated starch-PLA foam. Ethanol functioned as a blowing
   agent to expand the foams and as a solubilizing agent to depolymerize
   the PLA and starch to form a homogeneous dough. Foam expansion increased
   with addition of PLA. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure of Ca5M5O17, an n = 5 member of the homologous
   series A(n)B(n)O(3n+2\textbackslash{}), at room temperature has been
   determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction using synchrotron
   radiation with a CCD area detector. The structure is monoclinic with
   spacegroup P2(1)/c (b unique) and lattice parameters a = 7.7494(3)
   angstrom, b = 5.4928(1) angstrom, c = 32.241(1) angstrom, and beta =
   96.809(4)degrees. it consists of perovskite-like slabs of corner-sharing
   NbO6 octahedra separated by an interslab region, where the octahedra on
   opposite sides of the gap do not share oxygen atoms resulting in an
   extra layer of oxygen atoms with respect to the ideal perovskite
   structure. The slabs are five octahedra wide. Ca atoms within the slabs
   occupy 12-fold coordinated sites whereas those at the borders show
   irregular coordination environments. The distortion of the octahedra
   increases from the center to the borders of the slabs. The computed
   valences for the Nb ions are very close to 5 at the borders while
   smaller values were obtained for sites in the middle of the slabs which
   suggests that the electrical conduction takes place predominantly in the
   middle of the slabs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Two problems have successively appeared: first of all the eventual role

   of the first project symmetric or in the form of a swastika. Following
   these controversies leads to understanding the limits of an
   architectural history that, in France, has remained too long rationalist
   and ``national{''}. The new interpretations of Chambord are part of
   wider Franco-Italian perspectives, and are, at the same time, the result
   of a more thorough archeological study of the building.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Is the Norwegian welfare state model under pressure? In this article we
   argue that this model will persist to the extent that there is a
   relatively strong consensus among the majority of the national elites to
   support it. The empirical results presented indicate that the majority
   of the Norwegian elites at the time of the study (2000) supported the
   basic institutions and policies in the model and the political
   compromises upon which they are based. They express strong support for
   the system of centralised wage settlements, a main element in the
   industrial relations system. They rally behind continued economic
   transfers to the rural areas. A majority (albeit small) of the elite
   groups prefers to uphold the present state model of production and
   distribution of welfare services. There are, however, differences
   between the various elite groups as to how they view the welfare state
   model. While the members of the private business elite express
   preference for basic changes, the mass media elite, the academic elite
   and the church leaders are clearly in favour of the present model. The
   opinions of the individual leaders are particularly related to the elite
   groups to which they belong. Social and educational background has much
   less effect upon their attitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of
   hepatic copper transport leading to biliary excretion inhibition of
   copper. Overload of the metal mainly in liver and basal ganglia leads to
   hepatic but also to extrapyramidal motor as well as psychiatric clinical
   symptoms. However, involvement of the corticospinal system is barely
   known. Materials: To elucidate corticospinal involvement in Wilson's
   disease motor evoked potentials (MEP) were performed in 37 patients
   undergoing long-term treatment with diagnosed Wilson's disease. F-wave
   method was used to determine the central motor latency of the
   corticospinal pathway using the MEP. Results were determined and
   compared with laboratory reference values of a group of 40 healthy
   persons. Results: In patients with the neurological form of Wilson's
   disease delayed latencies and significant losses of potentials were
   present in more than 50\%. However, latency prolongations were also
   found in patients with the non-neurological form. Discussion: MEP are
   useful in monitoring and differential diagnosis of patients with
   Wilson's disease. They may predict a deterioration of a non-neurological
   into a neurological form of this complex disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To investigate en face optical coherence tomography ( eOCT) and its
   use as an effective objective technique for assessing changes in the
   glaucomatous rat optic nerve head ( ONH) in vivo, and compare it with
   confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy ( cSLO).
   Methods: 18 Dark Agouti ( DA) rats with surgically induced ocular
   hypertension were imaged with eOCT and cSLO at regular intervals.
   Assessment included three dimensional ( 3D) topographic reconstructions,
   intensity z- profile plots, a new method of depth analysis to define a
   `` multilayered'' structure, and scleral canal measurements, in relation
   to the degree of intraocular pressure ( IOP) exposure.
   Results: The increased depth resolution of the eOCT compared to the cSLO
   was apparent in all methods of analysis, with better discrimination of
   tissue planes. This was validated histologically. eOCT demonstrated
   several significant changes in imaged rat ONH which correlated with IOP
   exposure, including the area of ONH ( p < 0.01), separation between
   retinal vessel and scleral layers ( p < 0.05), and anterior scleral
   canal opening expansion ( p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: eOCT appears to be effective in assessing rat ONH, allowing
   detailed structural analysis of the multilayered ONH structure. As far
   as the authors are aware, this is the first report of scleral canal
   expansion in a rat model. They suggest eOCT as a novel method for the
   detection of early changes in the ONH in glaucoma.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare balanced turbo field echo (bTFE) with multiple
   overlapping thin slice acquisition (MOTSA) and contrast-enhanced MR
   angiography (CE-MRA) in depicting carotid artery stenosis.
   Materials and Methods: In this study 86 patients with cerebrovascular
   disease, who had been referred for a carotid examination, were imaged.
   All of the patients underwent MOTSA and one of four bTFE sequences
   followed by CE-MRA. Formatted maximum intensity projections (MIPs) and
   source images were read in a blinded fashion by a radiologist. Inter-and
   intrasequence statistical analyses were performed.
   Results: We first compared image quality (IQ) and fat, background, and
   venous suppression using four distinct bTFE protocols in 118 carotid
   arteries, and found that bTFE4 performed the best. We then compared IQ,
   grades of stenosis, and background and venous suppression among bTFE4,
   MOTSA, and CE-MRA. bTFE produced significantly better IQ and venous
   suppression (P < 0.001), and higher SNR and CNR (P < 0.05) when compared
   to MOTSA.
   Conclusion: The bTFE sequence is robust and provides high-quality images
   in patients with mild to moderate carotid artery stenosis. Even though
   there is a tendency to overestimate stenosis with bTFE compared to
   CE-MRA, the shorter scan time of bTFE coupled with enhanced SNR and CNR
   measurements validates it as a clinically useful adjunct to MOTSA, if
   not a replacement.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. A new risk perception rating scale ({''}magnifier scale{''})
   was recently developed to reduce elevated perceptions of low-probability
   health events, but little is known about its performance. The authors
   tested whether the magnifier scale lowers risk perceptions for
   low-probability (in 0\%-1\% magnifying glass section of scale) but not
   high-probability (> 1\%) events compared to a standard rating scale
   (SRS). Method. In studies 1 (n = 463) and 2 (n = 105), undergraduates
   completed a survey assessing risk perceptions of high- and
   low-probability events in a randomized 2 x 2 design: in study 1 using
   the magnifier scale or SRS, numeric risk information provided or not,
   and in study 2 using the magnifier scale or SRS, high- or
   low-probability event. In study 3, hypertension patients at the
   Philadelphia Veterans Affairs hospital completed a similar survey (n =
   222) assessing risk perceptions of 2 self-relevant high-probability
   events-heart attack and stroke-with the magnifier scale or the SRS.
   Results. In study 1, when no risk information was provided, risk
   perceptions for both high- and low-probability events were significantly
   lower (P < 0.0001) when using the magnifier scale compared to the SRS,
   but risk perceptions were no different by scale when risk information
   was provided (interaction term: P = 0.003). In studies 2 and 3, risk
   perceptions for the high-probability events were significantly lower
   using the magnifier scale than the SRS (P = 0.015 and P = 0.014,
   respectively). Conclusions. The magnifier scale lowered risk perceptions
   but did so for low- and high-probability events, suggesting that the
   magnifier scale should not be used for assessments of risk perceptions
   for high-probability events.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, simulations of the combustion of energetic materials have
   focused on a detailed description of the processes in the gas phase.
   This is due to an implicit assumption that the burning rate control zone
   is located in the gas phase at moderate pressures. However, at the
   present time new arguments in favor of the concept of the condensed
   phase being the locus of the burning rate control zone for typical
   energetic materials in ``rocket{''} pressure range have become
   available. These are based on data of the temperature profiles in the
   combustion wave of modern energetic materials. Analysis shows that, with
   pronounced heat release in the condensed phase, self-sustaining
   combustion can be unstable. This effect may result in the existence of
   combustion regimes with ``cross-surface{''} combustion waves. The
   difficulty of formulating a description of the combustion of energetic
   materials with pronounced condensed phase reactions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Young and shortly aged red wines made from single cultivar grapes grown
   in the warm climate region of La Mancha (Spain), were examined for their
   phenolic composition and effects of copigmentation on wine colour. in
   addition to anthocyanins, flavonol and hydroxycinnamic acid profiles
   allowed the varietal differentiation of these wines. Characteristic
   flavonols found were principally glycosides, the main ones, being:
   myricetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, and quercetin
   3-glucuronide. The fraction of red colour due to copigmented
   anthocyanins ranged from 32\% to 43\% at the end of the alcoholic
   fermentation, and this decreased to 20-34\% after 3 months of ageing,
   when a decrease in both monomeric anthocyanin and flavonol
   concentrations was also observed. Cencibel wines showed the greatest
   loss in flavonols after 3 months, but these were apparently replaced, in
   the copigmentation complexes, by other abundant cofactors, such as
   hydroxycinnamic acids and (-)-epicatechin. Thereafter, Cencibel wines
   showed proportionally the lowest decrease in this copigmentation effect
   at this ageing time. After 9 months, the losses of monomeric
   anthocyanins and cofactors still continued, and only Syrah wines showed
   a little enhancement of the red colour intensity. At this ageing time,
   the amounts of monomeric anthocyanins were sufficient for the formation
   of copigmentation complexes, but the molar ratio of cofactors to
   anthocyanins was possibly too low for detecting significant effects on
   colour, especially in Cabernet Sauvignon and Cencibel wines. A second
   observed effect of copigmentation was the bathochromic shift to bluish
   hues for Cencibel and Syrah wines, and it only was maintained in the
   latter wine during all the ageing times checked. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The determination of macromolecular structures from experimental data is
   an ill-posed inverse problem. Nevertheless, conventional techniques to
   structure determination attempt an inversion of the data by minimization
   of a target function. This approach leads to problems if the data are
   sparse, noisy, heterogeneous, or difficult to describe theoretically. We
   propose here to view biomolecular structure determination as an
   inference rather than an inversion problem. Probability theory then
   offers a consistent formalism to solve any structure determination
   problem: We use Bayes' theorem to derive a probability distribution for
   the atomic coordinates and all additional unknowns. This distribution
   represents the complete information contained in the data and can be
   analyzed numerically by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. We
   apply our method to data obtained from a nuclear magnetic resonance
   experiment and discuss the estimation of theory parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Interleukin-2 receptor antagonists have supplanted
   polyclonal antibody preparations as the most frequently used induction
   agents after lung transplantation, but the relative efficacy of these
   agents has not been firmly established.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of basiliximab
   compared with antithymocyte globulin among 157 adult lung transplant
   recipients at our center.
   Results: At 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation, the median
   cumulative acute rejection A scores for the basiliximab group (2, 2, and
   3, respectively) were significantly higher than those for the
   anti-thymocyte globulin group (1, 1, and 2, respectively; p = 0.003,
   0.004, and 0.033, respectively). In addition, basiliximab recipients
   were more likely to develop acute rejection grade >= A2 than
   anti-thymocyte globulin recipients; in fact, 60\% of basiliximab
   recipients compared with 38\% of anti-thymocyte globulin recipients
   developed their first episode of acute rejection grade >= A2 in the
   first 100 days after transplantation (log-rank p = 0.04). Furthermore,
   basiliximab recipients were more likely to develop bronchiolitis
   obliterans syndrome than anti-thymocyte globulin recipients (log-rank p
   = 0.036). two years after transplantation, 36\% of basifiximab
   recipients and 26\% of anti-thymocyte globulin recipients developed
   bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. However, there were no significant
   differences in the incidences of cytomegalovirus viremia and pneumonitis
   between the 2 groups (p = 0.96 and 0.89, respectively).
   Conclusions: Induction with anti-thymocyte globulin is associated with a
   lower burden of acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
   compared with basiliximab, without a significant difference in the
   incidence of cytomegalovirus infections.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we have developed and demonstrated a coronary
   artery imaging protocol in rats using transthoracic high-frequency CDE
   (colour Doppler echocardiography) to investigate the potential direct
   effects of exercise on CFVR (coronary flow velocity reserve). SHR
   (spontaneously hypertensive rats) performed voluntary exercise for 6
   weeks. Rats were then submitted to ultrasonographic examination and CFVR
   measurements. The LAD (left anterior descending coronary artery) was
   visualized using transthoracic CDE in a modified parasternal long-axis
   view. Doppler measurement was made in mid-LAD during baseline and
   adenosine-induced hyperaemic condition. Gene and protein expression in
   cardiac tissue were studied using real-time PCR and
   immunohistochemistry. Adenosine infusion significantly (P < 0.001, as
   determined by ANOVA) decreased HR, without affecting blood pressure in
   anaesthetized SHR. A significantly greater adenosine dose-dependent
   response was seen in exercised rats compared with controls (P = 0.02, as
   determined by ANOVA). The baseline flow velocity in mid-LAD was 0.33 +/-
   0.06 and 0.41 +/- 0.14 m/s in the exercised and control animals
   respectively (P value was not significant). The maximum
   adenosine-induced response was reached at a dose of 140 mu g (.) kg(-1)
   of body weight (.) min(-1), and CFVR averaged at 2.6 +/- 0.53 and 1.5
   +/- 0.24 in exercised and control animals respectively (P < 0.01). Gene
   expression of CuZnSOD was up-regulated by 21 \% in exercised animals
   compared with controls (1.1 +/- 0.16 compared with 0.89 +/- 0.09; P <
   0.01), whereas eNOS expression was unchanged. In conclusion, CFVR in
   rats can be non-invasively assessed using CDE with high feasibility.
   Physical exercise is associated with improved CFVR and antioxidative
   capacity in SHR.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of
   interdisciplinary review teams that have been the main and central work
   form in making health technology assessments at the Norwegian Centre for
   Health Technology Assessment.
   Methods: Evaluation questionnaires were sent to all 112 participants in
   the 17 review teams for the period of January 1998 to June 2003 after
   completion of the literature assessment. Questions were on the
   theme/mandate of the assessments, composition of the review team,
   organization of the work, the working method, and update of the report.
   Results: The teams ranged from 4 to 14 persons regarded as opinion
   leaders in their field. The project periods lasted from 4 to 33 months.
   In all, fifty-five participants gave fifty-eight responses (51.8
   percent) to the questionnaires. A total of 83 percent thought the theme
   was well argued, and 62 percent thought the mandate for the assessments
   was sufficiently clear. Approximately 80 percent were positive to the
   composition of the review team. In all, 22 percent expressed that the
   work method was too extensive and 43 percent wanted more tuition.
   General comments were that the working method gave competence in
   assessing medical literature, relevant professional training, and
   tuition in a working method that ensured the legitimacy of their work.
   Conclusions: The review team participants were satisfied with most
   aspects of the work. The Norwegian Centre for Health Technology
   Assessment will continue using interdisciplinary review teams in making
   health technology assessments.}},

Abstract = {{The assumption that an ensemble of classical particles is subject to
   nonclassical momentum fluctuations, with the fluctuation uncertainty
   fully determined by the position uncertainty, has been shown to lead
   from the classical equations of motion to the Schrodinger equation. This
   `exact uncertainty' approach may be generalised to ensembles of
   gravitational fields, where nonclassical fluctuations are added to the
   field momentum densities, of a magnitude determined by the uncertainty
   in the metric tensor components. In this way one obtains the
   Wheeler-DeWitt equation of quantum gravity, with the added bonus of a
   uniquely specified operator ordering. No a priori assumptions are
   required concerning the existence of wave functions, Hilbert spaces,
   Planck's constant, linear operators, etc. Thus this approach has greater
   transparency than the usual canonical approach, particularly in regard
   to the connections between quantum and classical ensembles. Conceptual
   foundations and advantages are emphasised.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a common cause
   of symptoms in a subgroup of asthmatic subjects. The pathobiology that
   makes this group of asthmatic subjects susceptible to
   bronchoconstriction after a brief period of exercise remains poorly
   understood.
   Objective: We sought to determine whether there are differences in lower
   airway inflammation and production of cytokines and eicosanoids between
   asthmatic subjects with and without EIB.
   Methods: Two distinct groups of asthmatic subjects based on a priori
   definitions were identified, one with moderate-to-severe EIB and the
   other without significant bronchoconstriction after exercise challenge.
   Both groups met the definition of asthma on the basis of bronchodilator
   response, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, or both. A comparative
   immunopathology study was conducted by using induced sputum to identify
   differences in lower airway inflammation and production of cytokines and
   eicosanoids.
   Results: The groups had similar baseline lung function and
   bronchodilator response and did not have any asthma exacerbations within
   the prior year. The concentration of columnar epithelial cells was
   markedly higher in the group with EIB (1.4 X 10(5) vs 2.9 X 10(4)
   cells/mL, P = .01). The concentration of eosinophils was higher in the
   group with EIB (3.6 X 10(4) vs 4.9 X 10(3) cells/mL P = .04). Cysteinyl
   leukotrienes (CysLTs; 727.7 vs 151.9 pg/mL, P = .01) and the ratio of
   CysLTs to prostaglandin E-2 (1.85 vs 1.04, P = .002) in the airways were
   higher in the group with EIB.
   Conclusion: Injury to the airway epithelium, overexpression of CysLTs,
   relative underproduction of prostaglandin E2, and greater airway
   eosinophilia are distinctive immunopathologic features of asthma with
   EIB.}},

   Results and Conclusions: Staffing was not a significant predictor of
   mortality or failure-to-rescue, nor did clinical specialty predict
   emotional exhaustion or job dissatisfaction. Although these findings
   reinforce adequate staffing ratios at this institution, programs that
   support nurses in their daily practice and positively impact job

Abstract = {{Objective: A subset of women who are at elevated cancer risk due to
   family history exhibit evidence of cancer-specific distress. These
   stress responses may represent symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD). The present study assessed rates of PTSD related to personal or
   family cancer history and BRCA 1/2 testing. Methods: Participants were
   84 women enrolled in a larger project focused on genetic testing
   decisions. Semistructured diagnostic inter-views were used to identify
   instances of threshold and subthreshold PTSD. Results: Results indicated
   that 16.7\% of the women reported current threshold or subthreshold PTSD
   related to personal or family cancer history. An additional 26.2\%
   reported past-only cancer-related threshold or subthreshold PTSD. Of the
   65 women who received BRCA1/2 results and completed the test-related
   PTSD module, only 7.7\% reported threshold or subthreshold PTSD related
   to the genetic testing process. However, when rates were examined based
   on carrier status, 25.0\% of BRCA1/2 carriers reported test-related
   threshold or subthreshold PTSD compared with only 10.0\% of variants and
   2.3\% of noncarriers. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that
   both personal and family cancer diagnoses can be significant stressors
   for a subset of high-risk women. Rates of threshold and subthreshold
   PTSD related to genetic testing appear to be less common, although
   carriers may be at higher risk for significant posttraumatic symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the major studies of terrorism in Southeast Asia emphasize
   international terrorist links and religious ideology, while more
   locally-embedded accounts draw attention to historical and political
   context. Despite this plurality in terrorism studies, flaws and
   omissions across four issues are common: the nature of terrorist links
   and information on them, Islam, the United States and the causes of
   terrorism. A substantial section of studies of terrorism are based on
   compromised information and substitute descriptive detail for analysis.
   They frequently depict Islam and anti-American views as incipiently
   threatening precursors to terrorism and underplay political grievances,
   particularly as they relate. to the United States. Valuable work has
   drawn attention to local political contexts and grievances, and has
   begun to explore the ideas and perceptions of militant groups. However,
   most of the leading experts on terrorism in the region are engaged in
   academically unproductive attempts either to reconstruct the trail of
   terrorist activity on the basis of official information or to explain
   terrorist violence as the product of individual pathology.}},

   depends on her bargaining power and the magnitude of learning by doing.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term survival, disease-free fractions, and the complications of
   hypophysectomy in 150 dogs with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism
   (PDH) were examined in a prospective study. Long-term survival and
   disease-free fractions in relation to pituitary size were analyzed by
   the Kaplan-Meijer estimate procedure. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year
   estimated survival rates were 84\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   76-89\%), 76\% (67-83\%), 72\% (62-79\%), and 68\% (55-77\%),
   respectively. Treatment failures included procedure-related mortalities
   (12 dogs) and incomplete hypophysectomies (9 dogs). The 1, 2, 3, and
   4-year estimated relapse-free fractions were 88\% (CI: 80-93\%), 75\%
   (64-83\%), 66\% (54-76\%), and 58\% (45-70\%), respectively.
   Postoperative reduction of tear production (58 eyes in 47 dogs) was
   often reversible but remained low until death in 11 eyes of 10 dogs.
   Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) occurred more frequently (62\%) in dogs
   with enlarged pituitaries than in dogs with nonenlarged pituitaries
   (44\%). Survival and disease-free fractions after hypophysectomy were
   markedly higher in dogs with nonenlarged pituitaries than in dogs with
   enlarged pituitaries. Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy is an effective
   treatment for PDH in dogs. The survival and disease-free fractions after
   hypophysectomy decrease and the incidence of CDI increases with
   increasing pituitary size. Therefore, early diagnosis of PDH is
   important and transsphenoidal hypophysectomy is expected to have the
   best outcome when used as primary treatment for dogs with nonenlarged or
   moderately enlarged pituitaries.}},

Year = {{2005}},

Abstract = {{First-year litter decomposition was estimated for an upland-oak (Quercus
   spp.) forest ecosystem using enrichment or dilution of the
   C-14-signature of the Oi-horizon. These isotopically based mass-loss
   estimates were contrasted with measured mass-loss rates from past
   litterbag studies. Mass-loss derived from changes in the C-14-signature
   of the Oi-horizon suggested mean mass loss over 9 mo of 45\%, which was
   higher than the corresponding 9-mo rate extrapolated from fitterbag
   studies (similar to 35\%). Greater mass loss was expected from the
   isotopic approach because litterbags are known to limit mass loss
   processes driven by soil macrufauna (e.g., fragmentation and
   comminution). Although the WC-isotope approach offers the advantage of
   being a non-invasive method, it exhibited high variability that
   undermined its utility as an alternative to routine litterbag mass loss
   methods. However, the C-14 approach measures the residence time of C in
   the leaf litter, rather than the time it takes for leaves to disappear;
   hence radiocarbon measures reflect C immobilization and recycling in the
   microbial pool, and do not necessarily replicate results from litterbag
   mass loss. The commonly applied two-compartment isotopic mixing model
   was appropriate for estimating decomposition from isotopic enrichment of
   near-background soils, but it produced divergent results for isotopic
   dilution of a multi-layered system with litter cohorts having
   independent C-14-signatures. This discrepancy suggests that cohort-based
   models are needed to adequately capture the complex processes involved
   in C transport associated with litter mass-loss. Such models will be
   crucial for predicting intra- and interannual differences in organic
   horizon decomposition driven by scenarios of climatic change.}},

Abstract = {{Background Reliable, valid and easily administered screening instruments
   would greatly facilitate large-scale neuropsychiatric research.
   Aims To testa parent telephone interview focused on autism-tics,
   attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other comorbidities
   (A-TAC).
   Method Parents of 84 children in contact with a child neuropsychiatric
   clinic and 27 control children were interviewed. Validity and interrater
   and test-retest reliability were assessed.
   Results Interrater and test-retest reliability were very good. Areas
   under receiver operating characteristics curves between interview scores
   and clinical diagnoses were around 0.90 for ADHD and autistic spectrum
   disorders, and above 0.70 for tics, learning disorders and developmental
   coordination disorder. Using optimal cut-off scores for autistic
   spectrum disorder and ADHD, good to excellent kappa levels for
   interviews and clinical diagnoses were noted.
   Conclusions The A-TAC appears to be a reliable and valid instrument for
   identifying autistic spectrum disorder, ADHD, tics, learning disorders
   and developmental coordination disorder.

Abstract = {{Mutations in Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and
   dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes have been used as means to predict
   treatment failure to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and for
   monitoring/surveillance of resistance to the drug in many areas where
   malaria is endemic. However, patients responses to treatment are
   significantly dependent on factors like host immunity profile of treated
   patients. In order to investigate the relationship between molecular
   markers of SP resistance, host immunity and clinical outcome, the
   association between pre-treatment dhfr and dhps genotypes, age and
   treatment outcomes was evaluated in 109 children treated with SP for
   acute uncomplicated malaria in Ibadan, Nigeria. Seventy-three percent of
   the children were cured with the drug, while 27\% failed treatment after
   28 days of follow-up. All children infected with parasites harboring
   less than two dhfr/dhps mutations were cured with SP. The dhfr triple
   (Asn-108{[}Ile-51/Arg-59) mutants or the dhps double mutants
   (Gly-437/Glu-540) were independently associated with SP treatment
   failure in children aged less than 5 years, but not in older children.
   The dhfr and dhps quintuple mutant (dhfr triple mutant + dhps double
   mutant) was the genotype most strongly associated with SP treatment
   failure (OR = 24.72, 95\%CI = 8.24-74.15) in both younger and older
   children. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have started electromagnetic (EM) monitoring of Taal volcano,
   Philippines. Taal is a basaltic-andesite volcano which has many eruption
   histories and is close to Metro Manila. On Taal, various geophysical and
   geochemical observations have been conducted by the government basis,
   but not the EM monitoring. A cooperative project for EM studies between
   PHIVOLCS and EMSEV/IUGG has been started. Measurements of total magnetic
   field (TMF), self-potential (SP), ground temperature and carbon dioxide
   degassing were made during the first survey in January 2005. Distinct
   anomalies in TMF and SP were found in the geothermal areas in Taal.
   Repeated survey in February detected changes in TMF up to a few tens of
   nT and enhancement of positive SP anomaly during the one and half-months
   period, when the surface geothermal activities were high. We believe
   that the combination of mechanical and electromagnetic measurements is
   uniquely effective in deciphering the volcanic activity.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosomes are divided into topologically independent regions, called
   domains, by the action of uncharacterized barriers. With the goal of
   identifying domain barrier components, we designed a genetic selection
   for mutants with reduced negative supercoiling of the Escherichia coli
   chromosome. We employed a strain that contained two chromosomally
   located reporter genes under the control of a supercoiling-sensitive
   promoter and used transposon mutagenesis to generate a wide range of
   mutants. We subjected the selected mutants to a series of secondary
   screens and identified five proteins as modulators of chromosomal
   supercoiling in vivo. Three of these proteins: H-NS, Fis and DksA, have
   clear ties to chromosome biology. The other two proteins,
   phosphoglucomutase (Pgm) and transketolase (TktA), are enzymes involved
   in carbohydrate metabolism and have not previously been shown to affect
   DNA. Deletion of any of the identified genes specifically affected
   chromosome topology, without affecting plasmid supercoiling. We suggest
   that at least H-NS, Fis and perhaps TktA assist directly in the
   supercoiling of domains by forming topological barriers on the E. coli
   chromosome.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine if (1) aging affects neural representation of a
   dynamic spectral speech cue and (2) spectrally-shaped gain applied to
   the cue reduces any aging effects.
   Methods: Psychometric functions and cortical evoked responses were
   compared in young and older listeners with normal hearing. Stimuli were
   consonant-vowels along a /bdg/ place-of-articulation continuum in an
   unshaped and shaped condition. Shaped stimuli enhanced audibility of the
   F2 formant transition relative to the rest of the stimulus.
   Results: Compared with younger listeners, older listeners had larger /d/
   categories, longer P2 latencies, and larger NI amplitudes to unshaped
   stimuli. To shaped stimuli, older listeners had /d/ categories and P2
   latencies more similar to those measured from younger listeners, while
   NI amplitudes were larger.
   Conclusions: Aging significantly affects the processing of dynamic
   spectral information. For some measures, differences due to aging were
   minimized with spectrally-shaped stimuli.
   Significance: Aging reduces neural responsiveness to dynamic spectral
   cues. If the cue is enhanced, neural responsiveness is increased and
   perceptual measures are more like those from the younger listeners for
   some stimuli. This suggests that aging may decrease responsiveness of
   intact neurons as opposed to destroying neurons and/or distorting
   spectral coding. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical

   transferring Corelli's systematic use of silence to vocal music, Handel
   moved beyond word-painting to expressive text-setting. Some critics
   condemned these silences, which prove strikingly similar to the

Abstract = {{The culture of murine oocytes and preimplantation embryos in vitro has
   been used successfully for many years. However, this practice can result
   in cellular stress and reduced viability. Since this phenomenon is
   partly attributable to differences in nutrient composition between
   culture media and maternal tract fluids, we determined the
   concentrations of glucose, pyruvate, lactate and 19 amino acids in
   murine preovulatory follicles and oestrous oviductal and uterine fluids.
   Follicular fluids were aspirated from hyperstimulated ovaries, whereas
   oviductal fluids (with/without oocyte-cumulus complexes) and uterine
   fluids were collected from naturally cycling animals. Glucose, pyruvate
   and lactate concentrations were analysed using ultramicrofluorometric
   methods, whilst amino acid profiles were determined by reverse-phase
   high performance liquid chromatography. Mean glucose concentrations in
   follicular, oviduct (with/without cumulus cells) and uterine fluids were
   0.46, 1.09/1.65 and 0.61 mmol l(-1), respectively. Pyruvate
   concentrations were 0.38, 0.37/0.17 and 0.25 mmol l(-1), respectively,
   and lactate concentrations were 17.34, 10.92/11.68 and 9.41 mmol l(-1),
   respectively. Oviductal pyruvate concentration was significantly higher,
   and glucose significantly lower, in the presence of cumulus cells.
   Taurine, glycine, alanine, glutamine and glutamate were the major amino
   acids detected. Concentrations of amino acids differed among fluids,
   with highest levels being found in the oviduct. The follicular fluid and
   tract nutrient profiles differed from those of murine maturation,
   fertilisation and embryo culture media. These data extend our
   understanding of cellular metabolism and of nutritional environments of
   the oocyte and early embryo as they progress along the reproductive
   tract in vivo. These results may also contribute to the formulation of
   nutritionally more physiological media for mouse oocyte maturation and
   embryo culture. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need for alternative on-site wastewater systems (OWS) that
   can be used in soils and on sites not suitable for conventional OWS
   (septic tank and gravity dispersal) while minimizing ground and surface
   water degradation. One method to accomplish this is to apply highly
   treated effluent (HTE), using a technology such as a subsurface drip
   irrigation system (SDIS), where effluent is dispersed uniformly to soil
   and the dosing frequency can be controlled. Since there are a large
   number of factors that can affect OWS function, the ability to evaluate
   these factors by using a simulation model would greatly improve our
   ability to design OWS that solve problems while having minimal
   environmental impact. This study was conducted to determine the
   potential to simulate HTE {[}recirculating rnedia filter effluent
   (RMFE)] flow, soil water content and potential, and changes in soil
   water mass balance using HYDRUS-2D (a numerical model), in which RMFE
   was applied at varying rates (518, 1036, and 2071 cm(3) d(-1)) and
   dosing frequencies (6, 12, and 24 doses per day) to soil columns
   designed to simulate a SDIS. Fecal coliform numbers were used to measure
   the effectiveness of these treatments. We hypothesized that fecal
   coliform numbers would decrease when effluent was applied in smaller
   (more frequent) doses. Results showed that HYDRUS-2D could be
   successfully used to predict RMFE flow, soil water potential and
   moisture content, and soil mass balance. Although dosing RMFE more
   frequently had no effect on fecal coliform numbers at the two lowest
   application rates (518 and 1036 cm 3 d(-1)), there was a significant
   decrease in fecal coliforms as 3 dosing frequency increased at the
   highest rate of application (2071 cm(3) d(-1)).}},

Abstract = {{Differences in the expression of cell surface proteins between a normal
   prostate epithelial (1542-NP2TX) and a prostate cancer cell line
   (1542-CP3TX) derived from the same patient were investigated. A
   combination of affinity chromatographic purification of biotin-tagged
   surface proteins with mass spectrometry analysis identified 26 integral
   membrane proteins and 14 peripheral surface proteins. The findings
   confirm earlier reports of altered expression in prostate cancer for
   several cell surface proteins, including ALCAM/CD166, the Ephrin type A
   receptor, EGFR and the prostaglandin F2 receptor regulatory protein. In
   addition, several novel findings of differential expression were made,
   including the voltage-dependent anion selective channel proteins Porin 1
   and 2, ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) and Scavenger receptor B1. Cell
   surface protein expression changed both qualitatively and quantitatively
   when the cells were grown in the presence of either or both interferon
   INF alpha and INF gamma. Costimulation with type I and II interferons
   had additive or synergistic effects on the membrane density of several,
   mainly peripherally attached surface proteins. Concerted upregulation of
   surface exposed antigens may be of benefit in immuno-adjuvant-based
   treatment of interferon-responsive prostate cancer. In conclusion, this
   study demonstrates that differences in the expression of membrane
   proteins between normal and prostate cancer cells are reproducibly
   detectable following vectorial labelling with biotin, and that detailed
   analysis of extracellular-induced surface changes can be achieved by
   combining surface-specific labelling with high-resolution
   two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.}},

Abstract = {{The high glucose consumption of tumour cells has been well known since

   proliferation was addressed. Three kinetically different cell lines of

   Surprisingly, the highest expression of GLUT1 was found in the most
   slows proliferating cell line, CX-2 Moreover, induction of cell cycle
   arrest increased both GLUT1 expression and glucose consumption, as well
   as global protein synthesis. These data suggest that the protein
   synthesis of tumour cells is much more glucose-consuming than
   proliferation and that both processes are inversely related.}},

Abstract = {{The representation of comorbid mental disorders within the German
   Diagnosis Related Groups-System was investigated. First the complication
   and complexity level CCL of diagnoses of mental disorders (ICD-10
   category F) within the G-DRG-calculation handbooks 2004 and 2005 were
   checked. Second the revenue based on a fictitious base rate of EURO3000
   with the G-DRG versions 2004/2005 respectively was calculated with and
   without inclusion of diagnosed comorbid mental disorders of 6610 cases
   of both medical departments of a hospital of tertiary care level (year
   2004). Only F0-diagnoses could lead to a CCL of 3. In 28.2\% of the
   patients at least one comorbid diagnosis of the category F of the
   International Classification of Diseases (mental and substance induced
   disorders) had been coded. Renunciation of the diagnosed mental
   disorders would have been resulted in a fictitious reduction in revenues
   based on the G-DRG version 2004 of EURO93600 and on the G-DRG version
   2005 of 69000EURO. The Patient Clinical Complexity Level PCCL was
   increased 0.15 by the comorbid mental disorders in each year. To achieve
   an adequate representation of comorbid mental disorders in the
   G-DRG-system and to ensure a financial survival of
   psychosomatic/psychiatric CL-services coordinated efforts of
   psychosomatic scientific societies and hospitals taking part in the
   G-DRG-calculation sample are necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on peach fruit shelf life is
   very weak, unlike that on other climacteric fruits. In this study, the
   softening rates of peach fruit after a 12- h exposure to 1 mu L center
   dot L-1 of 1-MCP at 1) atmospheric pressure (1-MCP nor); 2) atmospheric
   pressure with the induction at sub-atmospheric pressure (25-29 kPa)
   (1-MCP-subA); 3) sub-atmospheric pressure (29 kPa)with the induction at
   25-29 kPa (1 - MCP - subB) were compared to that of untreated, control
   fruit. After a 2- day ripening period, those in 1 MCP-subB were firmer
   than those of other treatments; the fruit of 1-MCP-nor and 1-MCP-subA
   also remained firmer than did the control. After a 5-day ripening
   period, the effects were similar among the treatments; the treated fruit
   were significantly firmer than control fruit. Our data show that 1 - MCP
   treatment at sub-atmospheric pressure slightly delayed softening of the
   peach fruit, but the results are deemed to be cost ineffective for
   practical use, compared to other treated climacteric fruits, such as
   apple. The ineffectiveness of 1 - MCP in peach fruit cannot be
   attributed to the lack of its diffusion into the flesh.}},

Abstract = {{The participation of plasminogen activator/plasmin system in the
   expression and function of E-cadherin was examined in oral squamous cell
   carcinoma (SCC) cells. Treatment of SCC cells with plasminogen reduced
   the Ca2+-dependent cell aggregation. SCC cells expressed E-cadherin at
   the cell membrane, and released a small amount of soluble E-cadherin at
   80 kDa in the culture medium. Addition of plasminogen to SCC cells led
   to a decrease in the amount of E-cadherin of the cell membrane and the
   enhancement of the shedding of E-cadherin ectodomain. Plasmin directly
   cleaved E-cadherin of SCC cells and enhanced the motility of SCC cells.
   These results suggested that plasminogen activator/plasmin system might
   directly mediate the proteolytic processing of E-cadherin in oral SCC
   cells and that might facilitate the progression of oral SCC by
   downregulation of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Using two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health, this study examines the impact of recent residential
   mobility on adolescent violence. A unique focus of our analysis is an
   examination of the ability of various mechanisms, including parent-child
   relationships, psychological distress, experiences of victimization, and
   peer networks, to account for the relationship between residential
   mobility and violent behavior. We pay particular attention to the
   ability of adolescent friendship networks, including both their
   structural characteristics (e.g., size, density, and centrality) and
   their behavioral composition (e.g., friends' participation in deviant
   activities) to transmit the detrimental effects of residential mobility.
   We find that residentially-mobile adolescents exhibit higher rates of
   violent behavior compared to non-mobile adolescents. Although most of
   the impact of residential mobility on adolescent violence remains
   unexplained by the potential mediators, friends' involvement in deviance
   is by far the most important of the mechanisms that we consider.}},

Abstract = {{Sociological investigation of informed consent has generated rich and
   complex descriptions of the clinical encounter, often challenging the
   straightforward picture painted by medical ethicists. This paper builds
   on this work, drawing on ideas from the Sociology of Science and
   Technology, to explore informed consent issues surrounding the use of
   the drug Herceptin, widely cited as an example of a novel approach to
   drug development called pharmacogenetics. Drawing on qualitative
   semi-structured interviews with 25 UK-based breast cancer specialists,
   this paper explores Herceptin's disputed epistemological status, as an
   example of pharmacogenctics or as something out of the ordinary in terms
   of clinical practice. It considers how, in turn, this impacts on the way
   in which informed consent is sought and influenced by clinicians' desire
   to protect patients from possibly distressing test results. It
   highlights the flexible, contingent and context dependent nature of
   informed consent in the clinical setting. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

   although Gartzke and Li's formulation is very useful, the authors draw
   some conclusions from their analysis that only hold under very
   restrictive assumptions. ``Trade share{''} does not in general measure a
   state's disconnectedness from the world trading system, and ``trade
   share{''} is not associated with a high risk of interstate dispute if
   ``trade dependence{''} is associated with a low risk. What Gartzke and
   Li attribute to ``trade share{''} is rather an effect of trade
   substition from one partner to another Finally, the trade openness
   variable may be a proxy for country size. The discussion also
   illustrates some problems involved in controlling for variables that are
   related by definition to a key explanatory variable.}},

Abstract = {{We compare different Polyakov-loop actions yielding effective
   descriptions of finite-temperature SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on the

   character expansion obeying center symmetry and include both Ising and
   Ginzburg-Landau type models. To keep things simple we limit ourselves to
   nearest-neighbor interactions. Some truncations involving the most
   relevant characters are studied within a novel mean-field approximation.
   Using inverse Monte Carlo techniques based on exact geometrical
   Schwinger-Dyson equations we determine the effective couplings of the
   Polyakov-loop actions. Monte Carlo simulations of these actions reveal
   that the mean-field analysis is a fairly good guide to the physics
   involved. Our Polyakov-loop actions reproduce standard Yang-Mills
   observables well up to limitations due to the nearest-neighbor

Abstract = {{Neurons sensitive to visual motion change their response properties
   during prolonged motion stimulation. These changes have been interpreted
   as adaptive and were concluded, for instance, to adjust the sensitivity
   of the visual motion pathway to velocity changes or to increase the
   reliability of encoding of motion information. These conclusions are
   based on experiments with experimenter-designed motion stimuli that
   differ substantially with respect to their dynamical properties from the
   optic flow an animal experiences during normal behavior. We analyze for
   the first time motion adaptation under natural stimulus conditions. The
   experiments are done on the H1-cell, an identified neuron in the blowfly
   visual motion pathway that has served in many previous studies as a
   model system for visual motion computation. We reconstructed optic flow
   perceived by a blowfly in free flight and used this behaviorally
   generated optic flow to study motion adaptation. A variety of measures
   (variability in spike count, response latency, jitter of spike timing)
   suggests that the coding quality does not improve with prolonged
   stimulation. However, although the number of spikes decreases
   considerably during stimulation with natural optic flow, the amount of
   information that is conveyed stays nearly constant. Thus the information
   per spike increases, and motion adaptation leads to parsimonious coding
   without sacrificing the reliability with which behaviorally relevant
   information is encoded.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2982-2993}},

Abstract = {{Age-associated thymic involution is accompanied by decreased thymic
   output. This adversely affects general immune competence and T cell
   recovery following cytoreductive treatments such as chemotherapy. A
   causal link between increasing sex steroids and age-related thymic
   atrophy is well established. Although castration has been demonstrated
   to regenerate the atrophied thymus, little is known about how this is
   initiated or the kinetics of thymocyte regeneration. The present study
   shows that although castration impacts globally across thymocyte
   development in middle-aged mice, the regenerative effects are initiated
   in the immature triple-negative compartment and early T lineage
   progenitors (ETP). Specifically, there was a reduction in number of ETP
   with age, which was restored following castration. There was, however,
   no change in ETP reconstitution potential in ETP at this age or
   following castration. Furthermore, in a chemotherapy-induced model of
   thymic involution, we demonstrate castration enhances intrathymic
   proliferation and promotes differentiation through the triple-negative
   program. Clinically, reversible sex steroid ablation is achieved
   hormonally, and thus presents a means of ameliorating immune
   inadequacies, for example, following chemotherapy for bone marrow
   transplantation. By improving our understanding of the kinetics of
   thymic recovery, this study will allow more appropriate timing of
   therapy to achieve maximal reconstitution, especially in the elderly.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the homeodomain leucine zipper (HDZip) family of
   transcription factors are present in a wide range of plants, from mosses
   to higher plants, but not in other eukaryotes. The HDZip genes act in
   developmental processes, including vascular tissue and trichome
   development, and several of them have been suggested to be involved in
   the mediation of external signals to regulate plant growth. The
   Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana) genome contains 47 HDZip genes,
   which, based on sequence criteria, have been grouped into four different
   classes: HDZip I to IV. In this article, we present an overview of the
   class I HDZip genes in Arabidopsis. We describe their expression
   patterns, transcriptional regulation properties, duplication history,
   and phylogeny. The phylogeny of HDZip class I genes is supported by data
   on the duplication history of the genes, as well as the intron/exon
   patterning of the HDZip-encoding motifs. The HDZip class I genes were
   found to be widely expressed and partly to have overlapping expression
   patterns at the organ level. Further, abscisic acid or water deficit
   treatments and different light conditions affected the transcript levels
   of a majority of the HDZip I genes. Within the gene family, our data
   show examples of closely related HDZip genes with similarities in the
   function of the gene product, but a divergence in expression pattern. In
   addition, six HDZip class I proteins tested were found to be activators
   of gene expression. In conclusion, several HDZip I genes appear to
   regulate similar cellular processes, although in different organs or
   tissues and in response to different environmental signals.}},

Abstract = {{We studied experimentally whether horse dams influenced foals'
   relationships with humans. We investigated the influence of the
   establishment of positive human-mare relationships on foals' behaviour
   toward humans. Forty-one foals and their dams were involved in this
   experiment. Half of the mares were softly brushed and fed by hand during
   a short period (total of 1.25 h) during the first 5 days of their foals'
   lives (experimental group, n = 21). The other mares were not handled
   experimentally and their foals received no contact with the experimenter
   (control group, n = 20). The reactions of both experimental and control
   foals were recorded under various conditions, first, for 5 min in the
   presence of a motionless experimenter, when foals were 15 and 30-35 days
   old, then in an approach test when they were 15 days old and in a
   saddle-pad tolerance test when they were 30-35 days old. Finally,
   approach- stroking tests were performed successively by the familiar
   experimenter when foals were 11-13 months old and by an unfamiliar
   person when they were 13-15 months old. Several observations strongly
   suggest that mares can influence their foals' behaviour toward humans:
   (1) during the handling procedure, experimental foals of protective
   mares were further from the handler than foals of calm mares (p <
   0.001); (2) experimental foals remained, at all ages, closer to the
   experimenter (p < 0.05) and initiated more physical contacts (sniffing,
   licking, etc.) with the experimenter (p < 0.05) than control foals; (3)
   avoidance and flight responses of experimental foals were considerably
   reduced during approaches by the experimenter (p < 0.01) and they
   accepted saddle-pads on their backs more easily (P < 0.01) and more
   quickly (p < 0.01) than control foals. Lastly, the consequences of
   handling mares had effects that lasted at least until foals were one
   year old (p < 0.05) and became generalized from experimenter to
   unfamiliar humans, who could approach and stroke experimental foals
   rapidly during a test (p < 0.05). This is the first report of an attempt
   to use observation of mother by foals to facilitate human-foal
   relationships, The procedure is simple, takes little time and can easily
   be applied to any dam-foal pair, as it is not intrusive and presents no
   risks of disrupting mare-foal bonds. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To learn about the correlation between allostery and ligand binding of
   the Tet repressor ( TetR) we analyzed the effect of mutations in the DNA
   reading head - core interface on the effector specific TetR(i2) variant.
   The same mutations in these subdomains can lead to completely different
   activities, e. g. the V99G exchange in the wild-type leads to
   corepression by 4-ddma-atc without altering DNA binding. However, in
   TetR(i2) it leads to 4-ddma-atc dependent repression in combination with
   reduced DNA binding in the absence of effector. The thermodynamic
   analysis of effector binding revealed decreased affinities and positive
   cooperativity. Thus, mutations in this interface can influence DNA
   binding as well as effector binding, albeit both ligand binding sites
   are not in direct contact to these altered residues. This finding
   represents a novel communication mode of TetR. Thus, allostery may not
   only operate by the structural change proposed on the basis of the
   crystal structures.}},

Abstract = {{Using a high-resolution spectrum of the secondary star in the neutron
   star binary Cen X-4, we have derived the stellar parameters and veiling
   caused by the accretion disk in a consistent way. We have used a chi(2)
   minimization procedure to explore a grid of 1,500,000 LTE synthetic
   spectra computed for a plausible range of both stellar and veiling
   parameters. Adopting the best model parameters found, we have determined
   atmospheric abundances of Fe, Ca, Ti, Ni, and Al. These element
   abundances are supersolar ({[}Fe/H] = 0.23 +/- 0.10), but only the
   abundances of Ti and Ni appear to be moderately enhanced (>= 1 sigma) as
   compared with the average values of stars of similar iron content. These
   element abundances can be explained if the secondary star captured a
   significant amount of matter ejected from a spherically symmetric
   supernova (SN) explosion of a 4 M circle dot He core progenitor and if
   we assume solar abundances as primordial abundances in the secondary
   star. The kinematic properties of the system indicate that the neutron
   star received a natal kick velocity through an aspherical SN and/or an
   asymmetric neutrino emission. The former scenario might be ruled out,
   since our model computations cannot produce acceptable fits to the
   observed abundances. We have also examined whether this system could
   have formed in the Galactic halo, and our simulations show that this
   possibility seems unlikely. We also report a new determination of the Li
   abundance, consistent with previous studies, that is unusually high and
   close to the cosmic Li abundance in the Galactic disk.}},

Journal = {{EPIDEMIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Background: Evidence on the association of 5,10 methylentetrahydrofolate
   reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in women with
   gestational hypertension is inconsistent. It is also unknown whether the
   fetal genotype is relevant, or whether folic acid supplementation
   modifies this association.
   Methods: The study population was composed of U.S. and Canadian white
   women with nonmalformed infants participating in the Slone Epidemiology
   Center Birth Defects Study between 1993 and 2000. Women were interviewed
   within 6 months after delivery regarding multivitamin use in pregnancy
   and the occurrence of gestational hypertension, among other factors. DNA
   was extracted from cheek swabs and gene alleles determined by
   restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. We compared the
   prevalence of the 677TT/CT and 1298CC/AC genotypes between cases with
   gestational hypertension (54 mothers and their 51 offspring) and
   controls (100 mothers and their 99 offspring). We also estimated odds
   ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional
   logistic regression to control for geographic region and calendar year.
   Results: The T allele was present in 69\% of women with gestational
   hypertension versus 57\% of control women (compared with 677CC, OR =
   1.9; 95\% Cl = 0.9-4.0). The offspring of case and control women had a
   677TT/CT genotype prevalence of 68\% and 47\%, respectively (2.4; 1.
   1-5.0). Among women supplemented with folic acid during the first 5
   months of pregnancy, the ORs for maternal and fetal 677TT/CT genotypes
   were 0.9 (0.3-2.5) and 2.1 (0.7-6.0), respectively. Neither maternal nor
   fetal 1298CC/AC genotypes were associated with an increased risk of
   gestational hypertension.
   Conclusion: Maternal and fetal MTHFR C677T polymorphism may be
   associated with a moderately increased risk of gestational hypertension,
   and there is a suggestion that this association may be diminished among
   women receiving folate supplementation during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Wasps of the genus Trichogramma parasitise the eggs of Lepidoptera. They
   may deposit one or many eggs in each host. Survival is high at low
   density but reaches a plateau as density increases. To reveal the
   mechanism by which excess larvae die we chose a lepidopteran host that
   has flattened, transparent eggs and used video microscopy to record
   novel feeding behaviours and interactions of larval Trichogramma
   carverae (Oatman and Pinto) at different densities. Single larvae show a
   rapid food ingestion phase, followed by a period of extensive saliva
   release. Ultimately the host egg is completely consumed. The larva then
   extracts excess moisture from the egg, providing a dry environment for
   pupation. When multiple larvae are present, the initial scramble for
   food results in the larvae consuming all of the egg contents early in
   development. All larvae survive if there is sufficient food for all to
   reach a threshold developmental stage. If not, physical proximity
   results in attack and consumption of others, continuing until the
   surviving larvae reach the threshold stage beyond which attacks seem to
   be no longer effective. The number of larvae remaining at the end of
   rapid ingestion dictates how many will survive to emerge as adults.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose - Development of stroke networks is critical to
   bringing guideline- driven stroke care to rural, underserved areas.
   Methods - A Web-based telestroke tool, REACH, was developed to provide a
   foundation for a rural stroke network that delivered acute stroke
   consults 24 hours per day 7 days per week to 8 rural community hospitals
   in Georgia.
   Results - There were 194 acute stroke consults delivered. Thirty
   patients were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The mean
   National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) was 15.4, and the
   median NIHSS was 12.5. The mean onset to treatment time (OTT) was 122
   minutes. The OTT dropped from 143 minutes in the first 10 patients
   treated to 111 minutes in last 20 patients. Of the 30 patients treated
   with tPA, 23\% (7) were treated in <= 90 minutes and 60\% (18) were
   treated within 2 hours. There were no symptomatic intracerebral
   hemorrhages.
   Conclusions - The REACH telestroke system permits the rapid and safe use
   of tPA in rural community hospitals. Over time, the system became more
   efficient and OTT decreased.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of recent and fossil zona-aperturate pollen grains within the
   angiosperms was undertaken. Zona-aperturate pollen (with complete
   ring-like apertures) has been evolved independently in several genera of
   basal angiosperm families (Nymphaeaceae, Eupomatiaceae, Annonaceae,
   Monimiaceae, Atherospermataceae) and monocots (Araceae, Iridaceae,
   Laxmanniaceae, Arecaceae, and Rapateaceae). The special case of the
   eudicot Limnanthes (Limnanthaceae) is discussed. New examples of recent
   and fossil fully zonate pollen are presented; a noteworthy new example
   are Scrophulariaceae, with Pedicularis; our fossil examples show
   affinities either to Nymphaeaceae, or Araceae, or Iridaceae, or cannot
   be related to an extant taxon. The zona-aperturate pollen grains differ
   in ornamentation and stratification mostly in the respect of the
   aperture areas, but sometimes also outside the aperture. The question of
   polarity is settled only for some taxa because of the frequent lack of
   tetrad observations. A ring-like aperture may divide the pollen grains
   in symmetric halves, or if running asymmetrically, divides the pollen
   grain in two more or less unequal halves; the presence of clearly
   unequal halves gives a strong argument to assume an equatorial ring in
   such cases where tetrad configurations were not available. The
   zona-aperturate condition may be a functional benefit in wet
   environments: while in dry pollen the apertural ring is completely
   closed, in wet or very moist realm it expands greatly, and the pollen
   tube can be formed quickly and everywhere in this area.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The increasing demand for natural gas in the United States could
   significantly increase the number and frequency of marine LNG (liquefied
   natural gas) imports. Although many studies have been conducted to
   assess the consequences and risks of potential LNG spills, the
   increasing importance of LNG imports suggests that consistent methods
   and approaches be identified and implemented to help ensure protection
   of public safety and property from a potential LNG spill.
   For that reason, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Fossil
   Energy, requested that Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) develop
   guidance on a risk-based analysis approach to assess and quantify
   potential threats to an LNG ship, the potential hazards and consequences
   of a large spill from an LNG ship, and review prevention and mitigation
   strategies that could be implemented to reduce both the potential and
   the risks of an LNG spill over water.
   Specifically, DOE requested:
   (.) An in-depth literature search of the experimental and technical
   studies associated with evaluating the safety and hazards of an LNG
   spill from an LNG ship
   (.) A detailed review of four recent spill modeling studies related to
   the safety implications of a large-scale LNG spill over water
   (.) Evaluation of the potential for breaching an LNG ship cargo tank,
   both accidentally and intentionally, identification of the potential for
   such breaches and the potential size of an LNG spill for each breach
   scenario, and an assessment of the potential range of hazards involved
   in an LNG spill
   (.) Development of guidance on the use of modern, performance-based,
   risk management approaches to analyze and manage the threats, hazards,
   and consequences of an LNG spill over water to reduce the overall risks
   of an LNG spill to levels that are protective of public safety and
   property.
   This paper provides an overview of the conclusions and recommendations
   from that study. (c) 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{The enzyme telomerase catalyzes the de novo synthesis of telomere
   repeats, thereby maintaining telomere length, which is necessary for
   unlimited cellular proliferation. Telomerase reverse transcriptase
   (TERT), the catalytic domain of telomerase, is the rate-limiting factor
   for telomerase activity and is expressed in virtually all tumors. Thus,
   TERT has been proposed as a marker with diagnostic and prognostic
   potential in breast cancer as well as a basis for breast cancer
   therapeutics. In these contexts, it is important to define the sites and
   extent of TERT expression in normal and cancerous human breast tissues.
   In this study, levels of TERT mRNA were measured within a set of 36
   breast carcinomas and 5 normal breast samples by quantitative real-time
   reverse transcription-PCR, and we subsequently identified and
   characterized the cells expressing TERT mRNA within these tissues using
   in situ hybridization. The results show that (a) detectable TERT mRNA
   expression is specific to the epithelial cells; (b) TERT is expressed in
   both normal and malignant breast tissues; (c) the pattern and level of
   TERT expression are heterogeneous, with similar to 75\% of tumors
   expressing bulk TERT mRNA levels equal to or less than those within
   normal breast tissue; and (d) tumors expressing above-normal levels of
   TERT mRNA are more likely to be histopathologic grade 3 (P = 0.002),
   contain high fraction of cells in S phase (P = 0.004), and have
   increased levels of MYC mRNA (P = 0.034).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{969-989}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The market for registered nurses (RNs) is often offered as an example of
   ``classic{''} monopsony, while a ``new{''} monopsony literature
   emphasizes that firm labor supply is upward sloping independent of
   market structure. Using data from multiple sources, we explore the
   relationship between nursing wages in hospitals and measures of classic
   and new, monopsony. Wage level analysis fails to provide support for
   classic monopsony, the relative wages of RNs in 240 U.S. labor markets
   being largely uncorrelated with hospital system concentration.
   Longitudinal analysis shows nursing wages declining with increases in
   hospital concentration. We interpret these results as providing support
   for classic monopsony effects in the short run, but question whether
   wage effects are sustained in the long run. No relationship is found
   between nursing wages and a new monopsony measure of mobility, but
   support for new monopsony is found for women elsewhere in the labor
   market. RNs display greater inter-employer mobility than do women (or
   men) in general. Two conclusions follow. First, upward sloping labor
   supply need not imply monopsonistic outcomes. Second, absent more
   compelling evidence, nursing should not be held up as a prototypical
   example of monopsony-classic or new. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All tights

Abstract = {{Recent studies demonstrate that vasopressin is useful when treating
   hemorrhagic and septic shock. The effect of vasopressin on systemic
   anaphylaxis has not been investigated except in clinical case reports.
   Vasopressin increases blood pressure because of vasoconstriction through
   the V1 receptor. Thus, we evaluated the effect of vasopressin on
   circulatory depression and bronchoconstriction provoked by systemic
   anaphylaxis and survival rates in rabbits. In the first set of
   experiments, 15 nonsensitized rabbits received normal saline (control)
   and vasopressin at 0.8 or 0.08 U/kg. In the second set 40 sensitized
   rabbits received horse serum to induce anaphylaxis, and then received
   the same drugs as in the first set. In the first set, mean arterial
   pressure (MAP) in vasopressin groups increased by 18\% to 24\% compared
   with the control. Vasopressin at 0.8 U/kg decreased MAP insignificantly
   before the increases of MAP occurred. In the second set, vasopressin at
   0.08 U/kg improved the survival rate. At 45 min after antigen challenge,
   69\% of the rabbits that received vasopressin at 0.08 U/kg were alive,
   whereas 29\% of the control rabbits and 23\% of the rabbits that
   received vasopressin at 0.8 U/kg were alive. Vasopressin increased MAP
   by 36\% to 109\% compared with the control within 5 min, however, at 2
   min, vasopressin at 0.8 U/kg had no effect on MAP. Pulmonary dynamics
   were similar. In conclusion, vasopressin at 0.08 U/kg improved survival
   rates and severe hypotension provoked by systemic anaphylaxis,
   suggesting that this agent may be useful in the treatment of systemic
   anaphylaxis.}},

Title = {{Prevalence and correlates of misconduct among ethnically diverse
   adolescents of native Hawaiian/part-Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian ancestry}},

Abstract = {{Background: Research on the prevalence and correlates of adolescent
   misconduct, arrests, and juvenile delinquency has been greatly neglected
   for the ethnically diverse adolescent groups in Hawai'i (i.e. Asian
   Americans, Pacific Islanders).
   Aims: The aims of the present study are three-fold: (1) to determine
   whether there are differential rates of adolescent misconduct based on
   ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic (SES) factors; (2) on an
   exploratory basis, to ascertain the demographic, social-cultural,
   psychological-psychiatric, and school-related correlates of misconduct,
   with some focus on cultural identification; and (3) to derive a
   parsimonious model of the correlates for an ethnically diverse group of
   adolescents by disentangling cultural identification from other
   variables including ethnicity.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from the Native Hawaiian Mental Health
   Research Development Program, consisting of 2,732 Asian/Pacific Islander
   youths. Misconduct was operationally defined as `was arrested or got in
   serious trouble with the law' within the past six months via adolescent
   self-report. Of added importance were the inclusion of a valid measure
   of Hawaiian cultural identification and actual school data.
   Results: Significantly higher rates were obtained for Native Hawaiians,
   males, and adolescents whose main wage earners' educational attainment
   was at the high school level or less. Absences may be a more important
   marker for females than males in the prediction of arrests and serious
   trouble with the law. The most parsimonious model of self-reported
   arrests/serious trouble with the law consisted of four variables in the
   following order of importance: substance use, actual grade-point
   average, aggressive symptoms, and gender.
   Conclusion: This is one of the first major studies to examine the
   prevalence and risk-protective factors of misconduct for adolescents of
   Asian/Pacific Islander ancestry, and the first to include a valid
   measure of cultural identification and actual school data. The findings
   indicated that gender-specific prevention and intervention programs are
   needed. However, the issues are also complex whereby the use of
   substances, school performance, and aggression must betaken into account
   in deriving successful programs. The lack of sustained association
   between culturally based factors (e.g., ethnicity, Hawaiian cultural
   identification) and misconduct in the final parsimonious model suggested
   that the culturally based variables are not direct causes of misconduct,
   but rather correlates of misconduct that are over-shadowed by more
   substantive factors, such as substance use and academic performance, the
   latter being variables that must be addressed for youths across the
   United States. The present results reaffirmed the common correlates of
   misconduct across different ethnic groups. Further research is needed in
   the causal relationships among these important associations with
   misconduct.}},

   generation have played a more critical role than class in the formation
   of political consciousness in South Korea. Regionalism or regional
   sentiment has emerged as the most significant criterion since the June
   Democratization Movement of 1987 while generation factor has gained more
   influence with globalization and the coming of information society since
   the late 1990s. Recent changes in the ideological terrain of South Korea

Abstract = {{Aim: To determine incidence, aetiology, and clinical features of
   subdural haematoma and effusion (SDH/E) in infancy throughout the
   British Isles.
   Methods: Cases were notified to the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit
   over 12 months by paediatricians, neurosurgeons, and paediatric and
   forensic pathologists.
   Results: A total of 186 infants (121 boys, 65 girls) aged 0-2 years were
   identified. Annual incidence of SDH/E for the UK and Republic of Ireland
   is 12.54/100 000 aged 0-2 (95\% CI 10.3 to 14.62) and 24.1/100 000 aged
   0-1 (95\% CI 20.89 to 28.18). A total of 106 infants suffered
   non-accidental head injury (NAHI), 7 accidental head injury, 26 a
   perinatal cause, 7 a non-traumatic medical condition, 23 meningitis, and
   in 17 the cause was undetermined; 35 infants died. Significant
   differences were found in injury pattern, body weight, and Townsend
   score between NAHI and SDH/E from other cause. There were fewer
   diagnostic investigations in non-NAHI cases. Delay in diagnosis of
   greater than a week occurred in 48/181.
   Conclusion: SDH/E is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in
   infancy. NAHI is the predominant cause of SDH/E. SDH/E can present in a
   non-specific and varied way and must be considered in any infant who is
   unwell. Determining the cause of the SDH/E in some cases continues to
   present a diagnostic challenge.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the United States Parole Commission's development
   and use of an expedited revocation procedure for parole violations not
   involving serious new felony offenses. The majority of parole revocation
   proceedings involve charges of administrative violations (such as
   alcohol abuse, drug use, or failure to report) or misdemeanor offenses,
   and most parolees charged with such violations admit them. When there is
   no dispute as to the charged violation, the sole issue is the
   determination of the appropriate sanction.
   In 1996, the commission began a pilot project designed to expedite the
   processing of parole violations involving administrative, misdemeanor,
   and lesser felony charges. Certain alleged parole violators were given
   the option of waiving the right to a revocation hearing, acknowledging
   responsibility for the charged violation, and accepting a specified
   revocation penalty determined by the commission on the basis of the case
   record. The goal was to conserve commission resources without negatively
   affecting the due process rights of the alleged parole violator or the
   integrity of the guideline system used to sanction parole violations. In
   1998, the commission incorporated the expedited revocation procedure
   developed in the pilot project into its permanent regulations. By FY
   2003, expedited revocation determinations accounted for 40 percent of
   all commission revocation actions. The savings generated by the
   expedited revocation procedure allowed the commission to devote more
   resources to conducting revocation hearings involving more serious
   and/or contested charges. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: The World Wide Web has profoundly changed the way in which
   we access information. Searching the internet is easy and fast, but more
   importantly, the interconnection of related contents makes it intuitive
   and closer to the associative organization of human memory. However, the
   information retrieval tools currently available to researchers in
   biology and medicine lag far behind the possibilities that the layman
   has come to expect from the internet.
   Results: By using genes and proteins as hyperlinks between sentences and
   abstracts, the information in PubMed can be converted into one navigable
   resource. iHOP (Information Hyperlinked over Proteins) is an online
   service that provides this gene-guided network as a natural way of
   accessing millions of PubMed abstracts and brings all the advantages of
   the internet to scientific literature research. Navigating across
   interrelated sentences within this network is closer to human intuition
   than the use of conventional keyword searches and allows for stepwise
   and controlled acquisition of information. Moreover, this literature
   network can be superimposed upon experimental interaction data to
   facilitate the simultaneous analysis of novel and existing knowledge.
   The network presented in iHOP currently contains5 million sentences and
   40 000 genes from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster,
   Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae and Escherichia coli.}},

Abstract = {{Adhesion of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a crucial
   step for the development of metastatic disease and is mediated by
   specific integrin receptor molecules (IRM). The pattern of metastatic
   spread differs substantially amoung the various histotypes of thyroid
   cancer (TC). However, IRM have only occasionally been characterized in
   TC until now. IRM expression was investigated in 10 differentiated
   (FTC133, 236, 238, HTC, HTC TSHr, XTC, PTC4.0/4.2, TPC1, Kat5) and two
   anaplastic TC cell lines (ATC, C643, Hth74), primary cultures of normal
   thyroid tissue (Thy1,3), and thyroid cancer specimens (TCS). Expression
   of 16 IRM beta 1-4, beta 7, alpha-6, alpha V, alpha IIb, alpha L, alpha
   M, alpha X) and of four IRM heterodimers (alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 5 beta
   1, alpha V beta 3, alpha V beta 5), was analyzed by
   fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) and immunohistochemical
   staining. Thyroid tumor cell adhesion to ECM proteins and their IRM
   expression in response to thyrotropin (TSH) was assessed. Follicular TC
   cell lines presented high levels of integrins alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5,
   beta 1, beta 3 and low levels of alpha 1, whereas papillary lines
   expressed a heterogenous pattern of IRM, dominated by alpha 5 and beta
   1. ATC mainly displayed integrins alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, alpha 6,
   beta 1 and low levels of alpha 1, alpha 4 and alpha V. Integrin
   heterodimers correlated with monomer expression. Evaluation of TCS
   largely confirmed these results with few exeptions, namely alpha 4,
   alpha 6, and beta 3. The ability of TC cell lines to adhere to purified
   ECM proteins correlated with IRM expression. TSH induced TC cell
   adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion, despite an unchanged array of IRM
   expression or level of a particular IRM. Thyroid carcinoma cell lines of
   different histogenetic background display profoundly different patterns
   of IRM expression that appear to correlate with tumor aggressiveness. M
   vitro adhesion to ECM proteins and IRM expression concur. Finally,
   TSH-stimulated adhesion of thyroid tumor cell lines to ECM may not be
   associated with altered IRM expression.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of dissolved and particulate trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu,
   Ni, Zn, and Pb) was studied for the first time during the spring high
   flow period of the Lena River (Arctic Siberia). The results show that
   concentrations of dissolved metals in the river Lena during the spring
   high flow in June 1996 (spring freshet) were significantly higher than
   those reported for the rest of the year. For example the measured
   average concentration of dissolved Fe (6349 +/- 2122 nM) during the high
   flow is approximately 7 times higher than previously published
   concentrations measured during the summer months. Dissolved Fe
   concentrations in the freshwater (salinity < 1) are positively
   correlated with the amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) (p <
   0.01), but negatively correlated with the Fe concentrations in SPM (p <
   0.01).
   The data showed that the aluminium-normalized concentrations of
   particulate Fe, Mn, Pb, Ni, and Zn in the freshwater are negatively
   correlated with SPM. This suggests that the mobilization of metals from
   suspended particulate matter is the driving force for the observed high
   concentrations of dissolved Fe, Mn, Zn and Pb in the water of the Lena
   River during the spring freshet.
   During the high flow period in June about 35\% of the total annual flow
   of the river Lena flows into the Laptev Sea. Previously published metal
   budgets for the river Lena that did not incorporate data from the spring
   high flow period, therefore, underestimate the fluxes of dissolved trace
   metals from the Siberian rivers to the Arctic Ocean. For instance, the
   estimated input of dissolved Fe in June 1996 is approximately 4.5 times
   higher than the average annual dissolved Fe input calculated on the
   basis of summer data. The results of this study demonstrate that the
   previous evaluations of the trace metal flux of the Lena river-which are
   based on data obtained from August to October-may underestimate the
   total riverine input of dissolved trace metals to the Arctic Ocean. (c)

Abstract = {{As industrialization has progressed, many factories have used more and
   more reactive and toxic chemicals, liquids, and gasses to increase
   competitively their productivity, which gives a severe worldwide
   environmental crisis. Partly in response to this development, great
   improvements have been made in chemical sensors over the past 30 years,
   especially in the area of electrochemical and surface conductive type
   sensors. For example, the oxygen sensor (EGO or lambda sensor), adopted
   for use in automobiles, has contributed to a dramatic decrease in the
   toxic gases CO, hydrocarbon, and NOx that are exhausted from gasoline
   engines. Surface conductive gas sensors, mainly made of tin oxide, have
   successfully served as an explosive gas detectors and alcohol checkers.
   In this paper, the principles of chemical detection will be presented in
   terms of electron/ionic property of materials and the interface
   characteristics between materials. It includes electrochemical and
   adsorption/desorption properties of materials.}},

Abstract = {{We examined patterns of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total
   dissolved nitrogen (TDN) loading to a small urban stream during baseflow
   and stormflow. We hypothesized that lower DOC and TDN contributions from
   impervious surfaces would dilute natural hydrologic flowpath (i.e.,
   riparian) contributions during storm events in an urban watershed,
   resulting in lower concentrations of DOC and TDN during storms. We
   tested these hypotheses in a small urban watershed in Portland, Oregon,
   over a 3-month period during the spring of 2003. We compared baseflow
   and stormflow chemistry using Mann - Whitney tests ( significant at p<
   0.05). We also applied a mass balance to the stream to compare the
   relative significance of impervious surface contributions versus
   riparian contributions of DOC and TDN. Results showed a significant
   increase in stream DOC concentrations during stormflows (median baseflow
   DOC = 2.00 mg l(-1) vs. median stormflow DOC = 3.46 mg l(-1)). TDN
   streamwater concentrations, however, significantly decreased with
   stormflow ( median baseflow TDN = 0.75 mg l(-1) vs. median stormflow TDN
   = 0.56 mg l(-1)). During storms, remnant riparian areas contributed 70 -
   74\% of DOC export and 38 - 35\% of TDN export to the stream. The
   observed pattern of increased DOC concentrations during stormflows in
   this urban watershed was similar to patterns found in previous studies
   of forested watersheds. Results for TDN indicated that there were
   relatively high baseflow nitrogen concentrations in the lower watershed
   that may have partially masked the remnant riparian signal during
   stormflows. Remnant riparian areas were a major source of DOC and TDN to
   the stream during storms. These results suggest the importance of
   preserving near-stream riparian areas in cities to maintain ambient
   carbon and nitrogen source contributions to urban streams.}},

Abstract = {{Trypsin proteinase inhibitors (TPIs) of Nicotiana attenuata are major
   antiherbivore defenses that increase dramatically in leaves after attack
   or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) elicitation. To understand the elicitation
   process, we characterized the proteolytic fragmentation and release of
   TPIs from a multidomain precursor by proteases in MeJA-elicited and
   unelicited plants. A set of approximately 6-kD TPI peptides was purified
   from leaves, and their posttranslational modifications were
   characterized. In MeJA-elicited plants, the diversity of TPI structures
   was greater than the precursor gene predicted. This elicited structural
   heterogeneity resulted from differential fragmentation of the linker
   peptide ( LP) that separates the seven-domain TPI functional domains.
   Using an in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay and
   synthetic substrates derived from the LP sequence, we characterized
   proteases involved in both the processing of the TPI precursor and its
   vacuolar targeting sequence. Although both a vacuolar processing enzyme
   and a subtilisin-like protease were found to participate in a two-step
   processing of LP, only the activity of the subtilisin-like protease was
   significantly increased by MeJA elicitation. We propose that MeJA
   elicitation increases TPI precursor production and saturates the
   proteolytic machinery, changing the processing pattern of TPIs. To test
   this hypothesis, we elicited a TPI-deficient N. attenuata genotype that
   had been transformed with a functional NaTPI gene under control of a
   constitutive promoter and characterized the resulting TPIs. We found no
   alterations in the processing pattern predicted from the sequence: a
   result consistent with the saturation hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{We have further tested the hypothesis that receptor-mediated modulation
   of KCNQ channels involves depletion of phosphatidylinositol
   4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C
   (PLC). We used four parallel assays to characterize the agonist-induced
   PLC response of cells (tsA or CHO cells) expressing M 1 muscarinic
   receptors: translocation of two fluorescent probes for membrane lipids,
   release of calcium from intracellular stores, and chemical measurement
   of acidic lipids. Occupation of M 1 receptors activates PLC and consumes
   cellular PIP 2 in less than a minute and also partially depletes mono-
   and unphosphorylated phosphoinositides. KCNQ current is simultaneously
   suppressed. Two inhibitors of PLC, U73122 and edelfosine (ET-18-OCH3),
   can block the muscarinic actions completely, including suppression of
   KCNQ current. However, U73122 also had many side effects that were
   attributable to alkylation of various proteins. These were mimicked or
   occluded by prior reaction with the alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide
   and included block of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and effects
   that resembled a weak activation of PLC or an inhibition of lipid
   kinases. By our functional criteria, the putative PLC activator m-3M3FBS
   did stimulate PLC, but with a delay and an irregular time course. It
   also suppressed KCNQ current. The M-1 receptor-mediated activation of
   PLC and suppression of KCNQ current were stopped by lowering
   intracellular calcium well below resting levels and were slowed by not
   allowing intracellular calcium to rise in response to PLC activation.
   Thus calcium release induced by PLC activation feeds back immediately on
   PLC, accelerating it during muscarinic stimulation in strong positive
   feedback. These experiments clarify important properties of
   receptor-coupled PLC responses and their inhibition in the context of
   the living cell. In each test, the suppression of KCNQ current closely
   paralleled the expected fall of PIP2. The results are described by a
   kinetic model.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal behavior of a formamide-intercalated mechanochemically
   activated (dry-ground) kaolinite was investigated by
   thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) and diffuse reflectance
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT). After the removal of
   adsorbed and intercalated formamide, a third type of bonded reagent was
   identified in the temperature range 230-350 degrees C decomposing in
   situ to CO and NH3. The presence of formamide decomposition products, as
   well as CO2 and various carbonates identified by DRIFT spectroscopy,
   indicates the formation of superactive centers as a result of
   mechanochemical activation and heat treatment (thermal deintercalation).
   The structural variance of surface species decreases with the increase
   of grinding time. The unground mineral contains a small amount of weakly
   acidic and basic centers. After 3 h of grinding, the number of acidic
   centers increases significantly, while on further grinding the
   superactive centers show increased basicity. With the increase of
   grinding time and treatment temperature the number of bicarbonate- and
   bidentate-type structures decreases in favor of the carboxylate- and
   monodentate-type ones. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Object. The authors evaluated the clinical and surgical outcomes
   obtained in patients with giant herniated thoracic discs (HTDs), defined
   as occupying more than 40\% of the spinal canal. Surgery-related
   considerations and functional outcomes in patients with small- and
   medium-sized HTDs were compared.
   Methods. The authors reviewed 140 cases of surgically treated HTDs, 20
   (14\%) of which were giant. Before and after surgery, all patients
   underwent computerized tomography myelography, magnetic resonance
   imaging, or both. Functional outcomes were assessed using the Frankel
   grading system preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at
   long-term follow-up examination. The results observed in patients with
   giant HTDs were compared with those with small- and medium-sized HTDs.
   The mean overall follow-up period was 2.6 years.
   Sixty-six patients (47\%) presented with myelopathy, including 19 (95\%)
   with a giant HTD. Of the latter, 16 (80\%) underwent anterior, eight
   thoracoscopic, and eight open thoracotomy approaches. Four patients
   (20\%) with laterally oriented giant HTDs within the spinal canal
   underwent surgery via a posterolateral approach.
   Based on analysis of long-term follow-up data, 53\% of patients with
   giant HTDs improved neurologically by one Frankel grade. Progression of
   myelopathy was arrested in 42\%, and in 5\% the Frankel grade worsened
   by one. In patients with small- and medium-sized HTDs, the Frankel grade
   improved by one in 77\%, stabilized in 23\%, and worsened in 0\%.
   Patients with giant HTDs who underwent thoracoscopic surgery had worse
   short- and long-term functional outcomes than those in whom open
   thoracotomy was performed.
   Conclusions. Patients with giant HTDs presented more frequently with
   myelopathy and experienced worse functional outcomes than those with
   smaller HTDs. Based on their experience, the authors recommend open
   thoracotomy rather than thoracoscopy for the treatment of midline giant
   HTDs.}},

   among the most delayed firms, and earnings drift is monotonically
   increasing in delay. Frictions associated with investor recognition

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated an electroabsorption modulator and semiconductor
   optical amplifier monolithically integrated with novel dual-waveguide
   spot-size converters (SSC) at the input and output ports for low-loss
   coupling to a planar light-guide circuit silica waveguide or cleaved
   single-mode optical fibre. The device was fabricated by means of
   selective-area MOVPE growth, quantum well intermixing and asymmetric
   twin waveguide technologies with only a three-step low-pressure MOVPE
   growth. For the device structure, in the SOA/EAM section, a double ridge
   structure was employed to reduce the EAM capacitances and enable high
   bit-rate operation. In the SSC sections, buried ridge structure (BRS)
   was incorporated. Such a combination of ridge, ATG and BRS structure is
   reported for the first time in which it can take advantage of easy
   processing of the ridge structure and the excellent mode characteristic
   of BRS. At the wavelength range of 1550-1600 nm, lossless operation with
   extinction ratios of 25 dB dc and more than 10 GHz 3 dB bandwidth is
   successfully achieved, The beam divergence angles of the input and
   output ports of the device are as small as 8.0 degrees x 12.6 degrees,
   resulting in 3.0 dB coupling loss with a cleaved single-mode optical
   fibre.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical, epidemiological and mechanistic studies support the role of
   cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) in maintaining urinary tract
   health. Cranberry proanthocyanidins contain A-type linkages and have
   been associated with preventing adhesion of P-fimbriated uropathogenic
   Escherichia coli to uroepithelial cells. It is not known if the presence
   of the A-type linkage is a prerequisite for anti-adhesion activity.
   Other commercial sources of proanthocyanidins with all B-type linkages
   have not previously been screened for this activity. The goals of this
   study were to compare the in vitro anti-adhesion activity of A-linked
   proanthocyanidins from cranberry juice cocktail with the anti-adhesion
   activities of B-linked proanthocyanidins from commercial grape and apple
   juices, green tea and dark chocolate, and determine if anti-adhesion
   activity is detectable in human urine following consumption of single
   servings of each commercial food product. Structural heterogeneity and
   presence of the A-type linkage in cranberry proanthocyanidins was
   confirmed utilizing MALDI-TOF/MS and DI/ESI MS, as was the presence of
   all B-type linkages in the proanthocyanidins from the other commercial
   products. The isolated A-type proanthocyanidins from cranberry juice
   cocktail elicited in vitro anti-adhesion activity at 60 mu g/ml, the
   B-type proanthocyanidins from grape exhibited minor activity at 1200 mu
   g/ml, while other B-type proanthocyanidins were not active.
   Anti-adhesion activity in human urine was detected following cranberry
   juice cocktail consumption, but not after consumption of the
   non-cranberry food products. Results suggest that presence of the A-type
   linkage in cranberry proanthocyanidins may enhance both in vitro and
   urinary bacterial anti-adhesion activities and aid in maintaining
   urinary tract, health. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effectiveness of a passive tuned mass damper
   (TMD) and fuzzy controller in reducing the structural responses subject
   to the external force. In general, TMD is good for linear systems. We
   proposed here an approach of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy controller to
   deal with the nonlinear system. To overcome the effect of modeling error
   between nonlinear multiple time-delay systems and T-S fuzzy models, a
   robustness design of fuzzy control via model-based approach is proposed
   in this paper. A stability criterion in terms of Lyapunov's direct
   method is derived to guarantee the stability of nonlinear multiple
   time-delay interconnected systems. Based on the decentralized control
   scheme and this criterion, a set of model-based fuzzy controllers is
   then synthesized via the technique of parallel distributed compensation
   (PDC) to stabilize the nonlinear multiple time-delay interconnected
   system and the HI control performance is achieved at the same time.
   Finally, the proposed methodology is illustrated by an example of a
   nonlinear TMD system.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of
   vitamin E supplementation on the autoinumme disease course in
   MRI/lymphoproliferative mice.
   Methods: Three-month-old MRL/lymphoproliferative lpr female mice were
   fed an AIN-76 diet containing 50 mg/kg (control), 250 mg/kg (E5), 375
   mg/kg (E7.5), or 500 mg/kg (E10) all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate. Eight
   mice per group were killed for analysis after two months of experimental
   diets, and the rest of the mice were followed up to observe their
   proteinuria levels and life span.
   Results: The data suggest that the life span of the E5 group was longer
   than the E10 group. Though a-tocopherol content in the plasma, liver,
   and kidneys increased in the mice fed the diet supplemented with vitamin
   E, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values in the liver and
   kidneys among these groups were not significantly different. IgM
   anti-ds-DNA and anticardiolipin antibodies were significantly higher in
   the E 10 group than in those of the other groups.
   Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated interleukin (IL)-2 secretion was
   significantly lower, but concanavalinA- stimulated IL-4 and IL-10
   production was significantly higher in the E10 group compared with the
   control group. The in vitro study also showed decreased IL-2 secretion
   and messenger RNA expression in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated
   splenocytes cultured in medium supplemented with high doses of vitamin
   E, but increased IL-2 with low doses of vitamin E.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that low and high dose supplementation of
   vitamin E has the opposite effect on the survival of MRL/lpr mice. The
   inhibitory effect of Th1 from high vitamin E content may not be
   beneficial for those suffering from Th2 prone autoimmune diseases, such
   as systemic lupus erythematosus. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The Alu repetitive elements, which constitute 10\% of human genome, may
   serve as bridges for genomic recombination. However, their roles in
   tumorigenesis remain to be elucidated. Caspase-activated DNase (CAD),
   whose gene (hCAD) is mapped at chromosome 1p36, a region frequently
   displaying hemizygote deletion in many human cancers, is the key enzyme
   for nucleosome fragmentation during apoptosis. Recently, we detected
   many aberrant mRNAs for hCAD in many human hepatoma cells. To elucidate
   the genetic basis leading to the mRNA aberration, we used PCR-based
   chromosome walking to clone the corresponding genomic DNA identifying a
   novel Alu/Alu homologous recombination/ deletion within hCAD in HepG2
   and Hep3B cells. We then detected similar recombination events in 13 out
   of the 20 hepatoma tissues and in eight of the para-cancerous cirrhotic
   livers. The recombination was inclined to occur in males (P = 0.031) and
   had marginal association with high-grade hepatoma (P = 0.070) and tumor
   recurrence (P = 0.070). The recombination caused exon-3 deletion, which
   in turn led to exon-3 skipping or replacement with a partial
   Alu-sequence, and consequential C-truncation of CAD. Our findings of
   high frequency of Alu-mediated hCAD deletion in human hepatoma not only
   underscore the implication of hCAD in hepatocarcinogenesis, but also
   highlight the potential roles of human repetitive sequences in mediating
   genome instability in human cancers.}},

Abstract = {{By using a three-dimensional fully nonlinear numerical model in

   simulation results show that affected by the nonlinearity, the migrating
   diurnal and semidiurnal tides propagating in the middle and upper
   atmosphere exhibit evident short-term variability. The nonlinear
   interactions between the migrating tides and the background atmosphere
   can obviously alter the background wind and temperature fields, which
   suggests that the nonlinear propagations of the migrating diurnal and
   semidiurnal tides impact significantly on the transient dynamical and
   thermal structures of the background middle and upper atmosphere and the
   nonlinear effect is an important cause of the difference between the

   constrained matrix factorization problem and solve the problem based on
   the least-squares optimization technique. The extracted keyframes have
   two uses: they could be used for browsing or they may be blended to
   reconstruct all other frames of an animation. Our approach is general
   and suitable for both rigid-body and soft-body animations. Experiments
   on various types of animation examples show that the proposed method
   produces remarkable results in terms of quality and compression ratio.
   Empirical tests also show that our algorithm consistently offers better
   efficiency than those by principal component analysis (PCA) and

Abstract = {{The defence reactions of sorghum seedlings 7 days after inoculation with
   Fusarium thapsinum and F. proliferatum, and interactions with wounding
   and exposure to light were studied to determine whether responses to

   plants, inoculation with both fungi increased concentrations of
   anthocyanins and soluble phenolics and activities of peroxidase (POX),
   chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase in the roots, and increased
   beta-1,3-glucanase activity in the mesocotyls. There was no effect of
   inoculation on phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity. Wounding by
   itself increased anthocyanin content of mesocotyls. Wounding also had a
   variety of interactions with inoculation. Exposure to light had very
   little effect on any defence response measured. A time course experiment
   showed that induction of chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase occurred in
   less than 24 h after inoculation. POX activity increased 2 days after
   inoculation, followed by a transient increase in PAL activity. The
   content of anthocyanins and soluble phenolics in roots of inoculated
   seedlings increased gradually compared with controls over 6 days. The
   responses of sorghum seedlings to inoculation with F. thapsinum and F.
   proliferatum were similar to those found by other workers following
   challenge by necrotrophic pathogens and were different from those
   induced by wounding and exposure to light.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the designs of two novel tapered dual-plane compact
   electromagnetic bandgap (C-EBG) microstrip filter structures are
   presented. With the dual-plane configuration, the proposed structure
   displays an ultrawide stopband with high attenuation within a small
   circuit area. Chebyshev distribution is adopted to eliminate ripples in
   the passband caused by the periodicity of the EBG structure. This gives
   rise to a compact EBG structure that exhibits excellent transmission and
   rejection characteristics in the passband and the stopband,
   respectively. The proposed structures are implemented and the
   measurement results are found to be in good agreement with the
   simulation results, verifying the excellent stopband and passband
   performance obtained using the proposed configuration. These novel
   structures are easy to fabricate and are promising structures that have
   wide applications for compact and high performance circuit component
   designs in microwave circuits.}},
