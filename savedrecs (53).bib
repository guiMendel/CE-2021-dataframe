Abstract = {{In two experiments, behavioral stereotypies elicited by scheduled

   were exposed to a fixed-time 30-sec (FT 30-sec) schedule of food or
   water deliveries with a brightening keylight stimulus signaling time to
   the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) on each trial. Food and water
   presentations both produced terminal autoshaped keypecking that was
   similarly distributed in the trial but differed in response topography
   and per sistence. Locomotor interim behavior was different in the two
   motivational conditions: With food presentations, it consisted of a
   `'retreat'' to the rear of the chamber after UCS termination, followed
   by `'pacing'' in the midportion of trials. The water schedule produced
   very little locomotor activity with no regular distribution in the
   trial. Experiment 2, using a random-time 30-sec (RT 30-sec) schedule,
   showed that the differences in interim locomotor behavior persisted in
   the absence of temporal predictability of the UCS and the keypecking
   terminal response. The results are taken to support Timberlake's (1983a)

Abstract = {{The risks and causes of persistent crying in early infancy are discussed
   on the basis of a study of 61 infants referred to the Munich

   sample of 51 infants of the same age. Particular attention was paid to
   pre-verbal parent-infant communication, the development of which was
   interpreted in terms of a dynamic interactional system including both
   regulatory and communicative predispositions in infants and intuitive
   competence for supporting infant predispositions in parents. Neither a
   gut problem nor any other single causal factor was identified for
   persistent crying in the majority of cases. In contrast, persistent
   crying was significantly associated with multiple biological and
   psychosocial risk factors for both parents and infants. Neurological
   immaturity, difficult temperament and sleep problems in infants, and
   impaired psychological conditions, limited resources and failures of
   intuitive competences in mothers were found to threaten the
   developmental process in infants and give rise to `vicious circles'
   which were destabilizing the interactional systems. Increased attention
   to intuitive parental competences is recommended as one effective model
   for therapeutic interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudopregnant mice were treated systemically with monoclonal
   anti-progesterone antibody (DB3) (model I), or progesterone receptor
   antagonists RU486 or ZK98,299 (ZK299) (model 2) on day 3 post coitum. On
   day 4, sesame oil was administered intraluminally into one uterine horn
   to induce decidualization. On day 7, the average mass of the
   oil-injected horn was 335.2+/-52.4 mg, eight times greater than that of
   the non-injected horn (40.8 +/- 5.3 mg; P < 0.001). After treatment with
   DB3, RU486 or ZK299, the masses of the injected hems did not differ
   significantly from those of non-injected horns. In the control group,
   concentrations of progesterone receptors (ligand-binding assay)
   increased twofold in the decidualized (52.2+/-7.4 fmol mg(-1)) compared
   with the non-injected horn (26.0 +/- 7.6 fmol mg(-1); P < 0.05), whereas
   oestrogen receptor content (ligand-exchange assay) decreased by 53\%
   (104.9 +/- 18.2 versus 224.3 +/- 18.1 fmol mg(-1); P< 0.001). In model
   I, antibody-treated animals showed a tenfold increase in the
   concentration of progesterone receptors (261.7 +/- 81.1 fmol mg (-1); P
   < 0.001), but there was no differential distribution of progesterone or
   oestrogen receptors in the oil-injected versus non-injected uterine
   horns. In model 2, uterine progesterone and oestrogen receptors again
   showed no differential response between injected and non-injected hems
   regardless of the route of administration (systemic or intraluminal).
   Concentrations of progesterone receptors in RU486-treated (35.8 +/- 9.4
   fmol mg(-1)) and ZK299-treated (32.0 +/- 10.2 fmol mg(-1)) mice were
   comparable to those in non-injected hems (35.3 +/- 6.3 and 34.2 +/- 5.1
   fmol mg(-1) respectively) and were not significantly different from the
   control group (26.0 +/- 7.6 fmol mg(-1)). The results show that
   oil-induced decidualization is accompanied by increased concentrations
   of progesterone receptors and decreased concentrations of oestrogen
   receptors. When decidualization is blocked by anti-progesterone
   treatment (antibody against progesterone or progesterone receptor
   antagonist), there are differing effects on receptor responses with an
   increase in progesterone receptors and decrease in oestrogen receptors
   after passive immunization, and no change in progesterone receptors and
   a reduction in oestrogen receptors after anti-progestins. The
   anti-decidualization effect in the two models was therefore achieved via
   dissimilar uterine receptor responses.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdaloid complex plays an essential role in auditory fear
   conditioning of the Pavlovian type. The available evidence suggests that
   the lateral nucleus is the input station of the amygdala for auditory
   conditioned stimuli, whereas the central medial nucleus is the output
   for conditioned fear responses. However, the intrinsic pathway
   transmitting auditory information about the conditioned stimulus from
   the lateral to the central medial nuclei is unknown as there are no
   direct projections between these nuclei. The present study was
   undertaken to determine if the main intra-amygdaloid targets of the
   lateral nucleus, namely the basomedial and basolateral nuclei, project
   to the central medial nucleus. To this end, iontophoretic injections of
   the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin were performed
   in these nuclei. To rule out the possibility that the anterograde
   labeling reflected passing fibers merging with the major fiber bundles
   that course in and around the central medial nucleus, labeled terminals
   and varicosities were observed in the electron microscope.
   It was determined that the basolateral and basomedial nuclei have
   partially overlapping intraamygdaloid targets. They both project to the
   central medial nucleus, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract and
   peri-amygdaloid cortex, but have limited projections to each other.
   Small Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin injections in both nuclei gave
   rise to prominent intranuclear projections but only the basomedial
   nucleus was found to project to the lateral acid anterior cortical
   nuclei. At the electron microscopic level, all labeled axon terminals
   and varicosities formed asymmetric synapses (n = 245) with dendritic
   spines (83\%) or with dendritic shafts (17\%).
   This is the first unambiguous demonstration that the basolateral and
   basomedial nuclei project to the central medial nucleus. Since these
   nuclei constitute the main intra-amygdaloid targets of the lateral
   nucleus, they represent likely candidates for the transmission
   of:auditory conditioned stimuli to the central medial nucleus in
   auditory fear conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the echinomycin complex with the self-complementary DNA
   decamer d(ACGTTAACGT)(2) has been investigated in solution by proton NMR
   spectroscopy, Echinomycin binds as a bisintercalator at the CpG steps,
   An analysis of the intermolecular NOE patterns defined the position and
   orientation of the bound drug molecule, The terminal A . T base pairs
   are Hoogsteen base-paired, whereas the central four A . T base pairs are
   clearly Watson-Crick base-paired. Thus, the presence of the extra A . T
   base pairs between the binding sites appears to prevent the formation of
   Hoogsteen base pairs immediately adjacent to the binding site, All four
   central A . T base pairs are destabilized relative to those in the free
   DNA, Because there is no evidence for unwinding of the DNA duplex in the
   complex relative to the free DNA, we conclude that the hypersensitivity
   to DNA cleavage reagents distal to echinomycin binding sites might be
   due to the destabilization of DNA structure induced by the drug binding.}},

Abstract = {{Background Endothelium-dependent vasodilation mediated by cGMP is known
   to be attenuated by the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane. The present
   study examines the effect of isoflurane on beta-adrenergic and
   cAMP-mediated vasodilation.
   Methods and Results Fifty-three subepicardial coronary arteries
   (diameter, 103+/-13 mu m) from Wistar rats were studied in vitro in a
   pressurized (40 mm Hg), no-flow state with use of optical density video
   detection system. After preconstriction of vessels with the thromboxane
   A? analogue U46619 10(-6) mol/L, concentration response curves to the
   nonselective beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, the G(s) protein
   activator sodium fluoride, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin,
   the cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP, or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor
   R020-1724 were obtained either in the presence or absence (control) of
   2\% isoflurane. Relaxations to all the agents tested were significantly
   reduced in the presence of isoflurane compared with controls.
   Conclusions Isoflurane attenuates cAMP-mediated vasodilation. The
   impairment appears to be distal to adenylate cyclase and is not due to
   enhancement of cAMP phosphodiesterase.}},

Abstract = {{Black-throated Green Warblers (Dendroica virens) use coniferous
   vegetation as foraging and perching substrates at coastal sites in Maine
   and predominantly deciduous vegetation at inland sites in interior New
   Hampshire, despite the availability of both substrates. I tested the
   hypothesis that these habitat use patterns result from intrinsic
   preferences (fixed behavioral choices independent of environmental
   influence) by quantifying coniferous and deciduous vegetation use by
   individuals from New Hampshire and Maine in `'commongarden'' aviary
   experiments with equal substrate and prey availability. I also
   determined the strength of these preferences by skewing experimental
   prey distributions toward the less preferred vegetation type of birds
   from each region and measuring resulting substrate use. Individuals from
   coastal sites showed significantly greater preferences for coniferous
   vegetation as both perching and foraging substrates than did inland
   birds, which preferred deciduous vegetation. In skewed prey distribution
   experiments, individuals maintained their regional preferences for
   perching substrates, but shifted foraging substrates typically after
   first capturing all prey from the preferred vegetation type. Significant
   morphological variation (larger maxillar width, tibiotarsi,
   tarsometatarsi, humeri, and radii in coastal birds) was found among
   Black-throated Green Warblers from the two regions that corresponded to
   morphology- habitat associations found in other mixed coniferous and

   may be influential as a proximate microhabitat selection mechanism in
   the Black-throated Green Warbler.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the transport pathway used by Zn and Mn to enter
   developing grains may allow measures to increase the Zn and Mn content
   of wheat grain grown on Zn/Mn deficient soils. For this reason,
   transport of Zn and Mn into developing grains of wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L. cv. Aroona) was investigated. Detached ears (18-22 days post
   anthesis) were cultured for 48 h in a solution containing 185 kBq of
   Zn-65 and 185 kBq of Mn-54. Transport of Zn-65 to the grain was
   unaffected by removal of glumes but was slightly reduced after the lemma
   was removed. Heat girdling the peduncle slightly reduced the amount of
   Zn-65 transported to the grain, whilst heat girdling the rachilla
   reduced transport of Zn-65 to the gl ain to a greater degree, suggesting
   phloem transport to the rachilla. The transport inhibitor CCCP (carbonyl
   cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone) blocked Zn-65 transport to grain but
   not to lemma and glumes. Removing glumes and lemma and heat girdling the
   peduncle did nor affect transport of Mn-54, but transport was slightly
   affected by heat girdling the rachilla, indicating xylem transport. CCCP
   blocked transport of Mn-54 into the grain but not to lemma and glumes.
   It was concluded that xylem-to-phloem transfer of Zn occurs in the
   rachis and to a lesser extent in peduncle and lemma. The results suggest
   that the lemma may be an important site for phloem loading when the
   concentration of Zn within the xylem is high. The data also suggest that
   Mn was predominantly translocated to the spikelets in the xylem, but
   that transport to the grain was dependent upon membrane transport before
   entering the grain. Phloem loading of Mn into the grain vascular system
   may have occurred at the site of xylem discontinuity in the floral axis.}},

Abstract = {{Development of myelodysplasia (MDS) with subsequent progression to acute
   myeloid leukemia (AML) is an example of the multistep process of
   malignant transformation in which each step often relates to genetic
   abnormalities that can be directly seen as chromosomal aberrations.
   Therapy-related MDS and AML (t-MDS and t-AML) may serve as an ideal
   model for a study of the genetic evolution of MDS and AML because
   chromosomal abnormalities are observed in most cases and because the
   disease is often diagnosed early due to a close patient follow-up. The
   cytogenetic characteristics at diagnosis were studied in 137 consecutive
   cases of t-MDS and t-AML, including 22 new cases, and correlated with
   the clinical characteristics and the course of the disease. Balanced
   translocations to chromosome bands 11q23 and 21q22 represent primary
   steps in pathways leading directly to overt t-AML, Specific chromosomal
   deletions or losses, on the other hand, represent primary or secondary
   events in alternative pathways leading to t-MDS with potential for
   subsequent transformation to overt t-AML. Loss of a whole chromosome 7
   (-7) or deletion of its long arm (7q-) and deletion of the long arm of a
   chromosome 5 (5q-) were the most frequent primary abnormalities
   significantly related to t-MDS, Loss of a whole chromosome 5 (-5) was
   also a primary event, but surprisingly, was observed equally in t-MDS
   and in t-AML. Deletion of chromosome 13, including bands q13q14, was
   another less common primary aberration of t-MDS. Except for -7 and
   del(13q), these primary aberrations were most often observed together
   with secondary abnormalities. These included balanced aberrations
   involving band 3q26 and various deletions of chromosome 3, a gain of a
   whole chromosome 8, deletions of the short arm or loss of chromosomes 12
   and 17, loss of a whole chromosome 18, and deletions of the short arm of
   chromosome 21. Deletions or loss of chromosomes 5 and 7 were
   significantly associated with previous therapy with alkylating agents (P
   = .002), and balanced translocations to chromosome bands 3q26, 11q23,
   and 21q22 were significantly associated with previous therapy with drugs
   targeting DNA-topoisomerase II (P < .00005). Other characteristic
   aberrations were not related to any specific type of therapy, The
   molecular changes believed to contribute to the development of t-MDS and
   t-AML have been identified for many of these chromosomal abnormalities.

Abstract = {{It is now well established that interactions of CD40 on the B cells,

   proliferation and differentiation. However, the functional significance
   of CD40 expression on cells known for most efficient Ag-presenting
   function, i.e., dendritic cells, is not so clear. In this study, we
   demonstrate that CD40 is expressed on human dendritic Langerhans cells
   (LC) freshly isolated from epidermis. Using CD40-L transfected cells,
   CD40 triggering was found to enhance LC viability when cultured and to
   result in phenotypic alterations. Thus, a 2-day CD40 activation induced
   up-regulation of CD54 and CD86 at the LC surface, while it did not
   significantly affect the levels of HLA-DR, CD1a, CD58, and CD80
   expression. These phenotypic changes correlate with enhanced LC
   allostimulatory property, as shown by the use of paraformaldehyde-fixed
   LC. Furthermore, mAbs against CD40, as well as CD40-L, strongly inhibit
   the primary T cell response to allogeneic LC. Collectively, these data
   support a role for CD40/CD40-L pair in the development of normal T cell

Abstract = {{Populations of agouti and albino meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus)
   were censused weekly within eight 0.1-ha enclosures (four replicates per
   treatment) from 26 June to 4 December 1992. Results supported the
   hypothesis that there was no significant difference in the growth and
   structure of populations of albino meadow voles compared to populations
   of agouti meadow voles within habitats of high nutritional quality and
   heavy vegetative cover. No significant difference in mean-weekly
   densities of populations or rates of recruitment was found between
   coat-color treatments. Few significant differences in measures of
   population quality, such as the percentage of adults in breeding
   condition or differences in mean body mass of adults, occurred between
   treatments. During the removal period (6 December 1992 through 2 January
   1993), 770 voles (478 albino and 292 agouti) were captured. A large
   percentage of albino (87\%) and agouti (76\%) voles removed during this
   period had not been captured previously suggesting that live-trapping
   may be a poor estimator of population density of meadow voles in
   habitats of high quality.}},

Abstract = {{Previous relativistic theories of thermodynamics of fluid mixtures can
   be extended to include more independent variables. Here the particular
   case is considered of a 3-constituent mixture consissting of a
   non-conducting fluid and two charged fluids; extension to the general
   case is straightforward. A set of field equations is found for the
   determination of the fields, following the methods of extended
   thermodynamics. These equations are restricted by the entropy principle
   and by material objectivity, obtaining in this way a closed hyperbolic
   system of held equations.
   As a byproduct of these principles, interesting stringent inequalities
   are obtained for the relaxation times arising from the production terms.}},

   MICRODIALYSIS TECHNIQUE - COMPARISON OF INTRADERMAL INJECTIONS WITH AN

Abstract = {{Background The skin microdialysis technique makes it possible to measure
   histamine release in intact human skin in vivo directly. In this study
   we have used the microdialysis technique to characterize histamine
   release by codeine after intracutaneous injections and following skin
   challenge by a novel atraumatic delivery technique.
   Objective The purpose of the study was to compare histamine release in
   human skin by codeine, delivered by an intraprobe drug delivery system
   (IPD) and intracutaneous injections (ICT), with respect to dose-response
   relations, kinetics of histamine appearance and decay, correlations
   between histamine release and skin responses, and reproducibility.
   Methods Hollow dialysis fibres were inserted intradermally in 12 healthy
   subjects. Twelve fibres were inserted in each subject, six fibres in
   each arm. Each fibre was perfused at a rate of 3 mu L/min, and samples
   were collected in 2 min fractions. By the IPD technique, codeine was
   administrered to the skin by adding codeine to the perfusion medium.
   Sequential IPD challenges were performed in one arm, and ICTs were done
   on the other arm.
   Results Sixfold serial dilutions of codeine (001-3 mg/mL) caused a
   significant dose-related histamine release by ICT and IPD. Peak
   histamine release was found within the first 4 min after skin challenge
   by ICT and IPD, followed by a fast decline with a dialysate histamine
   half life of approximately 2-3 min. Peak histamine release was linearly
   correlated with cumulative release of the 20 min sampling period, and
   histamine release correlated with weal size. The coefficient of
   variation on peak histamine release was 18.9\% and 4.8\% for codeine ICT
   and IPD, respectively.
   Conclusion We have described in detail codeine-induced histamine release
   in intact human skin in vivo by the microdialysis technique. It was
   possible to administer codeine atraumatically to the skin by intraprobe
   delivery. The skin microdialysis technique opens up possibilities for
   measurement of inflammatory mediators release in normal and diseased
   skin, and it will be possible to deliver immunopharmacologically active
   drugs to the skin by intraprobe delivery.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background. The pulsatility index (PI) and the resistive index (RI) are
   used as pulsed-wave Doppler measurement of downstream renal artery
   resistance. Little information is available on their value in chronic
   renal failure and their correlation to parameters of renal function and
   haemodynamics, The aim was to compare PI and RI of renal arteries in
   healthy volunteers and in patients with hypertension and chronic renal
   failure, and furthermore to study the correlation of these indices to
   measurements of renal haemodynamics and function by standard methods in
   patients with renal failure and hypertension.
   Methods. Twenty-five hypertensive patients (10 females, 15 males, mean
   age 52 years (24-74) with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than
   50 ml/min and an arterial blood pressure above 140 mmHg systolic and 95
   mmHg diastolic were included in the study. Ten healthy, normotensive
   volunteers (4 females and 6 males, mean age 43 years (30-62)) served as
   controls in the Doppler examinations. Doppler examinations were
   performed in segmental arteries by an Acuson 128. The PI and the RI was
   calculated from the blood flow velocities.
   Results. Both the PI and the RI were significantly higher in the patient
   group (P) than in the control group (C) (PI, P 1.65 (1.31-1.86), C 1.19
   (0.93-1.25), P = 0.003; RI, P 0.76 (0.69-0.81), C 0.67 (0.64-0.70), P =
   0.003).
   Both PI and RI correlated significantly with effective renal plasma flow
   (PI: r = -0.5, P = 0.02; RI: r = -0.5, P = 0.006), renal vascular
   resistance (PI: r = 0.4, P = 0.05; RI: r = 0.5, P = 0.02), filtration
   fraction (PI: r = 0.6, P = 0.005; RI: r = 0.5, P = 0.01) and clearance
   of creatinine (PI: r = -0.6, P = 0.008; RI: r = -0.6, P = 0.006). Only
   RI correlated significantly to GFR (r = -0.5, P = 0.02). The indices did
   not correlate to serum creatinine, or mean arterial blood pressure.
   Conclusion. PI and RI seems to be closely related to parameters of renal
   haemodynamics and clearance of creatinine in patients with chronic renal
   failure and hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Two-phase cross-flow exists in many shell-and-tube heat exchangers. The
   U-bend region of nuclear steam generators is a prime example. Testing in
   two-phase flow simulated by air-water provides useful results
   inexpensively. However, two-phase flow parameters, in particular surface
   tension and density ratio, are considerably different in air-water than
   in steam-water. A reasonable compromise is testing in liquid-vapor
   Freon, which is much closer to steam-water while much simpler
   experimentally. This paper presents the first results of a series of
   tests on the vibration behavior of tube bundles subjected to two-phase
   Freon cross-flow. A rotated triangular tube bundle of tube-to-diameter
   ratio of 1.5 was tested over a broad range of void fractions and mass
   fluxes. Fluidelastic instability, random turbulence excitation, and
   damping were investigated. Well-defined fluidelastic instabilities were
   observed in continuous two-phase flow regimes. However, intermittent
   two-phase flow regimes had a dramatic effect on fluidelastic
   instability. Generally, random turbulence excitation forces are much
   lower in Freon than in air-water. Damping is very dependent on void
   fraction, as expected.}},

Abstract = {{Spruce Picea spp, trees in Kielder Forest produced a heavy cone crop in
   1990/1991 but not in 1991/1992. Common crossbills Loxia curvirostra and
   siskins Carduelis spinus rely upon conifer seed for food, and
   consequently large numbers were present in the good cone year. The
   abundance of these two finches was one of the main reasons why songbird
   density was four times higher in 1991 than in 1992. The numbers and
   breeding productivity of two raptors that specialise in hunting
   songbirds were also monitored in both years, Sparrowhawks Accipiter
   nisus appeared to respond to this increased food supply. In 1991 they
   fed on crossbills and siskins, and increased their breeding numbers and
   productivity so that seven times more chicks were reared than in 1992.
   These results indicate that sparrowhawk numbers are likely to fluctuate
   far more in large spruce forests than in other habitats in Britain where
   food supply is more stable. To ensure that spectacular `'crossbill
   years'' occur in future it is important to maintain a diversity of
   coniferous species in forests, including appreciable areas of Norway
   spruce Picea abies, Merlins Falco columbarius did not switch to feeding
   on crossbills and siskins, and their breeding numbers and performance
   were similar between years, Moorland birds were their main food,
   although considerable numbers of woodland songbirds were also taken in
   early spring. These results suggest that forests provide merlins with
   some prey at a time of year when moorland birds are scarce. Thus, the
   planting of large conifer forests may not be detrimental to merlin
   populations, provided that extensive areas of moorland remain nearby.}},

Abstract = {{A rhyolitic volcanic flow included in the Holenarsipur greenstone belt,
   South India, has a simple igneous population of zircons which has a
   SHRIMP Pb-207/Pb-206 age of 3298 +/- 7 Ma, interpreted as the
   crystallization age of this flow and considered synchroneous with
   deposition of the coeval sedimentary pile. No evidence of younger
   volcanism is present. Thus the Holenarsipur greenstone belt is now
   documented as the oldest supracrustal accumulation in the Dharwar
   craton. From field and other published geochronological results we
   conclude that a large part of the surrounding gneisses are very close in
   age to this rhyolite; some gneisses are 10-20 m.y. older than the
   rhyolite, whilst another set is significantly younger. From the short
   temporal gap measured between the gneisses and the supracrustal rocks,
   we suggest that the supracrustals could be formed by continuous
   processes attending the accretion of penecontemporaneous gneisses.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of low altitude multitarget raids against surface ships with
   command midcourse/semiactive rf terminal homing defensive missiles are
   investigated in terms of terminal homing miss distance. The scenario
   presently considered is that several defensive missiles are fired with
   each assigned a target to engage. A missile must engage its designated
   target for a successful intercept, and the miss distance is measured
   relative to the designated target. Raid geometry and the approach angle
   of the interceptor relative to the raid scintillation axis were found to
   be important parameters in determining miss distance. The stream raid
   and the closely spaced stacked raid had resolution ranges so short as to
   be practically unresolvable. Reasonable variations in the heading and
   seeker pointing errors had little effect on terminal miss distance for
   these unresolvable scenarios. For larger stacked raid separations, which
   are just resolved at handover, the handover errors can cause a loss of
   resolution and poor homing performance. Thus, a highly accurate handover
   is of use only for a band of separation spacings for the stacked raid
   and has little benefit against the stream raid. A method to counter the
   stream raid is to control the missile handover aspect angle through
   midcourse trajectory shaping so as to approach antiparallel to the raid
   velocity. For stacked raids, minimizing the handover range while using
   the midcourse guidance to bias the handover heading error allows more
   tightly spaced raids to be successfully engaged.}},

Abstract = {{A case of unusual pulmonary manifestation in advanced testicular cancer
   is presented where only pathohistological findings after primary
   pneumonectomy led to urological examination and diagnosis of the
   underlying testicular tumor. This course of events may serve as an
   example for recurrent problems in the systematic diagnosis and treatment
   of advanced testicular cancer, resulting from increasing specialization
   in the medical field. A constant slight elevation of the tumor marker
   AFP could be explained by a disturance of the immunological test system
   due to nonspecific binding of heterophilic antibodies. Other reasons and
   diagnostic tools for the evaluation of persistently elevated
   (''false-positive'') AFP-tumor marker values are discussed. In the last
   two decades, efficient programs for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up
   of germinal testicular cancer have been established and standardized. As
   the present case substantiates, however, especially advanced stages of
   the disease may still represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge
   necessitating early communication between medical departments in order
   to coordinate the diagnostic and therapeutic strategy in each individual
   patient.}},

Abstract = {{Thyroid hormone (T-3) responses are mediated by two receptors, TR alpha
   and TR beta, that have been shown to require heterodimer formation with
   the retinoid-X receptors for effective interaction with most
   T-3-responsive elements (TRE). In addition, it has been shown recently
   that one type of TRE, an inverted palindrome (IP) with a 4-, 5-, or
   g-base pair spacer, can also bind TR homodimers with high affinity. This
   binding, however, is sensitive to T-3, which suggests that TR homodimers
   could have important biological roles as T-3-sensitive repressors. Here
   we have analyzed eight natural TR beta mutants associated with the
   syndrome of generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH). These
   receptor mutants are characterized by a variably decreased affinity for
   T-3. We show here that their homodimer binding characteristics are
   altered. For example, kindred GH binds as a homodimer more weakly to DNA
   than wild-type (WT), whereas mutant PV forms clearly stronger homodimer
   complexes than WT even in the presence of TREs that bind WT receptor
   homodimers poorly. Although other mutants were able to bind IP-6
   elements efficiently as homodimers, these homodimers showed a decreased
   sensitivity to T-3 in accordance with their reduced affinities for the
   ligand. In vivo, six of the eight mutants were able to function as
   strong repressors on IP sites located 3' of the TATA box. Although T-3
   released repression by WT TRP, the hormone did not release repression by
   some of the mutant receptors, and elevated concentrations of T-3 were
   required to release repression by other mutants. Importantly, most of
   the GRTH-associated mutants were able to function as potent dominant
   negative repressors of WT in the homodimer pathway, whereas they showed
   little dominant negative activity in the heterodimer-dependent
   transcriptional activation pathway. Only one of the eight GRTH mutants,
   a deletion of the carboxy-terminus, was found to have a strong dominant
   negative activity on both T-3 response pathways. Our data suggest a
   dominant negative mechanism of action for GRTH mutants that is
   consistent with their homodimer binding characteristics to IP-TREs and
   correlates well with T-3 resistance in patients.}},

Abstract = {{We have recently reported 90\% success in a series of patients
   undergoing microsurgical decompression of the second cervical (C2) nerve
   root and ganglion for cervicogenic headache. Review and analysis of our
   database was carried out in order to cull factors characterizing
   patients amenable to this surgical treatment. Thirty-five sequential C2
   decompressions performed on 31 patients who were pain-free or
   significantly improved in follow-up were evaluated retrospectively.
   Preoperative factors and intraoperative findings were analyzed for
   prognostic significance. The diagnosis of cervicogenic headache was made
   using established criteria and success of CT-guided C2 anesthetic
   blockade in alleviating the headache. Numerous historical factors noted
   preoperatively including age, sex, history of trauma, autonomic
   symptoms, visual changes, and many others were not able to be well
   correlated with outcome in univariate analysis. Likewise, no strong
   correlation could be made for findings on physical examination. Thus. no
   specific prognostic factors could be established, other than the
   accepted diagnostic criteria and successful anesthetic blockade of the
   C2 root and ganglion. These factors should identify the subset of
   patients with cervicogenic headache predominantly due to C2 root or
   ganglion effect and thus may favor a surgical treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of drying paper by direct contact with superheated steam was
   determined with respect to the physical, optical and chemical properties

   effects of superheated steam drying on the properties of paper made from
   bleached and unbleached kraft pulps beaten to different levels were
   smaller and in the opposite direction than those observed for mechanical
   pulp. Relative to air drying, steam drying of kraft paper had the effect
   of increasing sheet bulk by up to 6\%, decreasing strength properties by
   up to 13\% and improving optical properties by up to 10\%. It is
   proposed that, unlike mechanical pulp, kraft pulp fibres already have a
   high bonding potential and derive no benefit from any thermal softening
   of the limited amount of lignin and hemicellulose polymers. In fact, the
   higher sheet temperature during the constant drying rate period of steam
   drying probably results in a thermally induced drying stress relaxation
   leading to decreased strength properties.}},

   definition. The paper suggests that these features be specified early in

   inter-connected with objects in the Domain section will be briefly
   discussed. A more thorough discussion of Port section objects will be

   ribosome that occurs on peptide bond formation. The 3' ends of the tRNAs
   enter, and move through, a catalytic cavity where antibiotics are
   considered to act by at least three primary mechanisms: (i) they
   interfere with the entry of the aminoacyl moiety into the catalytic
   cavity before peptide bond formation; (ii) they inhibit movement of the
   nascent peptide along the peptide channel, a process that may generally
   involve destabilization of the peptidyl tRNA, and (iii) they prevent
   movement of the newly deacylated tRNA between the PIP and hybrid P/E
   sites on peptide bond formation.}},

Abstract = {{All hot stars are observed to have X-ray emission: O stars have
   L(X)/L(bol) similar to 10(-7), whilst B stars' emission drops off with
   spectral subtype. Dynamical instability of OB star radiatively driven
   winds generates shocked regions which may be responsible for the bulk of
   the X-rays observed. The wind-compressed disc model of Bjorkman \&
   Cassinelli (1993) presents another site for X-ray emission. The disc
   formed in the equatorial plane of a fast rotating Be star from
   equatorward drift of wind streamlines is confined on both sides by a
   shock which may also generate X-rays. As the X-ray emission originating
   from the wind shocking is ubiquitous amongst B and Be stars then the
   wind-compressed disc model el naively predicts that Be stars should
   generate more X-rays than B stars of equivalent spectral subtype.
   The X-ray emission from the shocks confining compression discs has been
   calculated and compared to a limited set of observations. The excess
   X-ray emission from the Be star disc shocks is found to be undetectable
   over the inherent wind shocking emission.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The expression of myeloid markers on lymphoblasts has been
   associated with adverse outcome in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The
   purpose of the study was to analyze the experience with adults treated
   at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center with myeloid
   marker- (MY) positive ALL in relation to patient and disease
   characteristics, response to therapy, and prognosis.
   Methods. Since 1988, 64 of 162 adults (40\%) with newly diagnosed ALL
   referred to our service had MY-positive ALL. Their characteristics and
   outcomes were compared with the 98 patients with MY-negative ALL.
   Patients were treated with the vincristine-doxorubicindexamethasone
   (VAD) regimens.
   Results. Patients with MY-positive ALL were significantly older (median
   ages, 47 years vs. 33 years; P = 0.03), had a higher incidence of CD34
   antigen expression (59\% vs. 36\%; P < 0.01), and a lower incidence of
   common acute leukemia antigen expression (50\% vs. 71\%; P < 0.01),
   serum alkaline phosphatase elevation (58\% vs. 83\%; P < 0.01), and
   thrombocytopenia at diagnosis (49\% vs. 69\%; P = 0.02). Myeloid marker
   positivity, as expected, was significantly higher in null cell ALL
   (82\%), and significantly lower in mature B-cell ALL (17\%) (P < 0.01).
   Forty-one of 64 MY-positive patients achieved complete remission (CR)
   after induction therapy compared with 76 of 98 patients MY-negative
   disease (CR rate 64\% vs. 78\%; P = 0.06). With a median follow-up of 45
   months, no statistical differences were observed in remission duration
   or survival between MY-positive and MY-negative patients, overall, and
   within imunophenotypic subsets (T-cell vs, others), or among subgroups
   with single marker (CD13, CD14, CD33, CD34) positivity. The 3-year
   remission duration rates were 32\% for MY-negative and 40\% for
   MY-positive patients (P not significant), and 3-year survival rates were
   26\% and 31\%, respectively (P not significant).
   Conclusions. With VAD therapy, myeloid marker positivity is not
   associated with significant differences in prognosis in adult ALL.}},

Abstract = {{Gallosilicates isostructural with MFI ({[}Ga]MFI) with different
   SiO2/Ga2O3 molar ratios were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and
   subsequent calcination and conversion to the proton form. Microbalance
   weight loss determinations both upon H-2 reduction of the calcined
   {[}Ga]MFIs and upon reduction of the same materials mechanically mixed
   with beta-Ga2O3 can be used as a simple method for the estimation of
   both extraframework and framework gallium. This thermogravimetric method
   is based on the reductive solid-state ion exchange between any
   extraframework Ga2O3, whether present initially or added, and the
   protons associated with framework Ga. Thermal analysis of 1-propanamine
   was also found to be a sensitive test of the state of gallium in
   gallosillicates and also indicates that extraframework Ga in {[}Ga]MFI
   transfers into cationic positions upon H-2 reduction. Transfer of Ga
   into cationic positions results in an increase in the amount of
   1-propanamine adsorbed near 600 K during thermal analysis, compared with
   the proton form of the gallosilicate. Gallium cations also promote the
   formation of a residue at the end of the thermal analysis experiment.
   There are indications that the extraframework Ga in {[}Ga]MFI ion

   life of a man who spent almost forty years in a large mental hospital in
   Northern Ireland. Patient behaviour and staff experience of this
   behaviour are examined within the conceptual framework proposed by
   Erving Goffman. This man's story once again challenges the notion of the
   all-pervading power of the institution, and affirms the ability of some
   individuals to maintain a strong personal identity in spite of being
   officially labelled as deviants and separated from society because of
   this label. It also challenges the assumption that institutional living
   in itself, stigmatises and therefore isolates an individual from normal
   social networks. It is argued that in order to predict the impact of
   voluntary or compulsory institutionalisation, not only must the
   identity-construct of the individual be considered, but also the social

Abstract = {{Impairment of renal function in various types of glomerular disease is
   associated with tubulointerstitial changes. The mechanism of mononuclear

   monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been identified as a
   monocyte-specific chemotactic factor. We analyzed the presence of MCP-1
   in renal biopsies from patients with various forms of glomerular disease
   and demonstrated that MCP-1 expression is increased in renal tubular
   epithelial cells during disease. Further analysis showed that various
   cell lines of human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) produce
   MCP-1 in culture under serum-free conditions and that the production is
   inhibited by cycloheximide. IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha enhanced the
   production by each cell line in a dose- and time-dependent manner as
   measured by radioimmunoassay. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that
   IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha markedly enhanced the expression of MCP-1 mRNA.
   Taken together these observations support the notion that MCP-1 is
   synthesized de novo by PTEC. MCP-1 produced by PTEC is found to be 13 kD
   by gel filtration chromatography. It is chemotactically active for
   monocytes. We conclude that in various types of glomerular disease,
   MCP-1 expression in tubular epithelial cells is associated with
   up-regulation of MCP-1 production by PTEC. These findings raise the
   possibility that macrophages may accumulate in renal interstitium as a
   consequence of MCP-1 production by PTEC.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetospheric mappings of the auroral oval during the course of a
   substorm are presented for an event where conjugate auroral imaging was
   available (CDAW 9 event C on May 3, 1986). The mappings have been
   computed using time-evolving magnetic field models developed for the
   substorm growth and recovery phases. We show that even though the models
   do not contain field-aligned currents, conjugacy between images from the
   two hemispheres is good. Furthermore, the high time resolution Viking
   images show an accurate comparison with the east-west spreading of the
   substorm current wedge observed by four spacecraft in the near-Earth
   tail. We also show that the double oval configuration present during the
   substorm recovery phase maps mostly within the lunar distance. The void
   (weak luminosity) regions between the poleward and equatorward are
   systems are connected to the region 20-30 R(E) down the tail. To
   complement the global view, mappings of individual growth phase auroral
   arcs were undertaken. These mappings did not result in a coherent
   pattern, suggesting that these arcs may be formed by low-altitude
   acceleration region processes rather than plasma sheet instabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The segmental ocelli (eyes) in specimens of a European and a Chinese
   `'Polyophthalmus pictus'' population have been investigated by
   transmission electron microscopy. The ocelli are situated in
   corresponding positions in the same segments and reveal similarities in
   their general structure, They consist of one photoreceptor cell with
   microvilli-bearing processes and a pigment cup, the receptor processes
   project into an extracellular cavity formed by the sensory cell and a
   few supporting cells, the pigment cup is formed by mesodermal cells, and
   basiepidermal glial cells and gland cells lie above the sensory cell.
   However, the ocelli differ in size and number of cells, number and
   dimensions of cellular elements as well as presence or absence of
   certain cell types associated with the ocelli. There is only little
   variation in these characters and there is no overlap, so that they
   distinctly separate the specimens of the two populations. These
   differences are in the same range, or even larger, as those observed
   between the ocelli of other closely related polychaete species.
   Therefore, the specimens from Qingdao, China, are described as a new
   species of the Opheliidae, Polyophthalmus qingdaoensis sp.n., although
   specimens from Qingdao, China, and the Island of Giglio, Italy, are
   almost inseparable by light microscopy except for a few subtle

Abstract = {{Interstitial laser therapy (ILT) is a promising therapeutic technique in
   which laser energy is delivered percutaneously to various depths in
   tissue. In this study, the authors compared high-speed magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) of ILT in tissues during treatment with
   post-treatment histopathologic specimens. The use of 5-second MRI scans
   allowed detection of thermal damage by the 1064-nm
   neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser in ex vivo liver and brain
   tissues. These tissues were treated by ILT with 20 W of laser output for
   5 to 30 seconds via a 600-mu m fiberoptic inserted 1 cm into the
   specimens at a power density of 7 kW/cm(2) at the tip of the bare fiber.
   Sequential MRI measurements of lesion areas made during and after
   treatment were compared to measurements of laser-induced tissue damage
   in histolopathologic sections. Fast MRI scans and tissue histology both
   demonstrated increased lesion size with time of ILT. Serial images
   obtained during ILT detected thermal changes as areas of low signal
   intensity that exceeded the size of the post-treatment lesions as
   measured on either final MRI or histology. The thermal effects
   detectable by these high-speed MRI sequences can be used to monitor
   laser-induced tissue changes during therapy, thereby providing a
   valuable noninvasive method for the intraoperative assessment of heat
   distribution during ILT.}},

Abstract = {{Migration of compounding ingredients such as antioxidants is a problem
   that has been recognized by rubber compounders. The literature is almost
   void of quantitative data in this area. Therefore an investigation of
   the diffusion of some commonly used phenolic antioxidants in three
   different rubber vulcanizates was carried out. The antioxidants were
   chosen so that they included a wide range of molecular weights as well
   as structural differences to enable us to study the effect of size and
   molecular nature on diffusion in the medium of rubber. The effect of
   crosslink density on diffusion was studied by using rubber vulcanizates
   of three different crosslink densities. BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene),
   the smallest antioxidant in the series, shows the highest diffusion
   coefficient. As the molecular weight of the diffusant increases the
   diffusion coefficient decreases. The molecules of polar nature, such as
   Antioxidant 754 (2,6-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxymethyl phenol), show higher
   diffusion coefficient compared to the nonpolar molecule of the same
   size, such as BHT. The crosslink densities of vulcanizates effect the
   diffusion of antioxidants in that there is an optimum value at which the
   diffusion coefficient is highest.}},

Abstract = {{Monolayers of newly synthesized complexes of lanthanoids, such as
   samarium(III), europium(III), and terbium(III), containing two long
   alkyl chains and their mixtures with arachidic acid or octadecane were
   investigated. These complexes can form stable condensed monolayers
   having molecular areas of 104-111 Angstrom(2) at the air-water
   interface. Octadecane molecules in the mixed monolayers assist close
   packing not only of long alkyl chains but also for large head groups.
   The mixed monolayers were deposited on quartz plates by the
   Langmuir-Blodgett method and a horizontal lifting technique. It has been
   found that in the monolayer assemblies of europium(III) complexes, the
   emission probability from the higher excited singlet state D-5(1) and
   the Symmetric forbidden transition D-5(0) --> F-7(0) is enhanced in
   comparison with that in solution, and further the emission of D-5(0) -->
   F-7(0) splits into two peaks. These results are ascribed to the fact
   that the thermal deactivation of the higher excited state is decreased
   and the symmetries of these complexes are slightly distorted in the
   monolayer assemblies. Characteristic emission behavior for the
   samarium(III) and terbium(III) complexes was observed depending on the
   different molecular assembly systems, though these effects were not as
   significant as in the case of the europium(III) complex.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: A prospective evaluation to determine if percutaneous needle
   biopsy yields enough tissue to establish the diagnosis of lymphoma and
   initiate therapy.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lymphoma was diagnosed in 43 patients for the
   first time. Patients underwent either a core needle biopsy (n = 41) or
   an aspiration-type needle biopsy (n = 2) performed with imaging
   guidance. Immunochemical studies were performed on specimens from 39 of
   43 patients (91\%); flow cytometry was performed on specimens from 10
   patients (23\%). Patient progress was followed to see if biopsy results
   were used as a basis for treatment or if additional material was
   obtained with an open surgical procedure.
   RESULTS: On the basis of treatment decisions, needle biopsy results were
   sufficient for a diagnosis to be made in 36 of 43 patients (84\%). In
   seven patients (16\%), needle biopsy specimens were considered
   nondiagnostic, suspicious for lymphoma, or insufficient, None of the 43
   patients responded to therapy in a manner that suggested the diagnosis
   of lymphoma to be incorrect,
   CONCLUSION: Image-guided needle biopsy should be the first procedure
   performed in the diagnosis of lymphoma, except in easily accessible
   superficial neck, inguinal, and axillary nodal sites.}},

Abstract = {{Slime-producing staphylococci frequently colonize catheters, and when
   they are embedded in biofilm, they become resistant to various
   antibiotics, In the study that is described, the comparative efficacies
   of vancomycin, clindamycin, novobiocin, and minocycline, alone or in
   combination with rifampin, were tested in an in vitro model of
   colonization. The model consisted of the modified Robbins device with
   antibiotic-impregnated cement filling the lumen of catheter segments,
   The synergistic combination of minocycline and rifampin was the most
   efficacious in preventing bacterial colonization of slime-producing
   strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphlococcus aureus to
   catheter surfaces, A similar trend was observed when the inhibitory
   activities of polyurethane catheters coated with minocycline and
   rifampin were compared with the inhibitory activities of catheters
   coated with other antimicrobial agents, The inhibitory activities of
   catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin against S. epidermidis,
   S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis strains, for example, were
   significantly better than those of catheters coated with vancomycin (P <
   0.05). The inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline
   and rifampin against gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans were
   comparable to those of catheters coated with ceftazidime and
   amphotericin B, respectively. We found that the combination of
   minocycline and rifampin is unique and highly effective in preventing
   the colonization of catheters with slime-producing staphylococci and
   that it also displays a broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against

Abstract = {{Research has been conducted in the area of voice processing for over six
   decades but it has only been in the past few years that the impact of
   the years of research is starting to be seen in modern
   telecommunications systems. Virtually every area of voice processing,
   including speech coding, speech synthesis, speech recognition, and even,
   to a small extent, speaker verification, has left the research
   laboratory and now appears in a product or service that is in daily use
   out in the marketplace, often by millions of customers per day. This
   revolution in voice processing in telecommunications is fueled by
   algorithmic advances (which improve the quality of the voice processing
   systems), hardware advances (which provide high processing power and
   memory at low cost), and networking advances (which provide high
   bandwidth pipes to the home, office, and throughout the
   telecommunications network). In this paper we illustrate the impact of
   voice processing on modern telecommunications by showing the diverse
   ways in which speech coding, speech synthesis, speech recognition and
   speaker verification have become embodied in new products and services.}},

Abstract = {{Previous freeze-fracture electron microscopy (EM) studies have shown
   that the outer membrane (OM) of Treponema pallidum contains sparse
   transmembrane proteins. One strategy for molecular characterization of
   these rare OM proteins involves isolation of T. pallidum OMs. Here we
   describe a simple and extremely gentle method for OM isolation based
   upon isopycnic sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of
   treponemes following plasmolysis in 20\% sucrose. Evidence that T.
   pallidum OMs were isolated included (i) the extremely low protein/lipid
   ratio of the putative OM fraction, (ii) a paucity of antigenic and/or
   biochemical markers for periplasmic, cytoplasmic membrane, and cytosolic
   compartments, and (iii) freeze-fracture EM demonstrating that the
   putative OMs contained intramembranous particles highly similar in size
   and density to those in native T. pallidum OMs. Sodium dodecyl
   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the
   OMs contained a relatively small number of treponemal proteins,
   including several which did not appear to correspond to previously
   characterized T. pallidum antigens. interestingly, these candidate rare
   OM proteins reacted poorly with syphilitic sera as determined by both
   conventional immunoblotting: and enhanced chemiluminescence. Compared
   with whole cells, T. pallidum OMs were deficient in cardiolipin, the
   major lipoidal antigen reactive with antibodies in syphilitic sera, Also
   noteworthy was that other lipoidal constituents of OMs, including the
   recently discovered glycolipids, did not react with human syphilitic
   sera. These latter observations suggest that the poor antigenicity of
   virulent T. pallidum is a function of both the lipid composition and the
   low protein content of its OM.}},

   in Group A 25 within 15 min (range, 5-30 min). There was no significant
   difference in pain scores or opioid consumption (patient-controlled
   analgesia with piritramid): 24, 28, and 13 mg/24 h among the study
   groups, respectively (not significant). Postoperative respiratory
   function deteriorated in comparison to preoperative values in all study

Abstract = {{Advanced composite materials are recognized as better materials for
   structural components and they are being increasingly used in different
   industries. However, these materials are prone to damage, which may
   occur due to uncertainty in a large number of manufacturing variables
   and operational conditions. Because of their primary utilization in
   structural application and the present trend towards damage tolerant
   philosophy, the non-destructive evaluation of composites exposed to an
   uncertain environment has become increasingly important. The present
   research effort is directed towards incorporating the capability of
   handling uncertainties within the artificial neural network strategy for
   making assessments of damage in composites. Fuzzy representation and its
   associated logic are found to be the most efficient means of treating
   uncertainties. A novel method of integrating the concepts of fuzzy logic
   with ANN has been proposed. For the ANN, capability of a multi-layer
   perceptron with back propagation algorithm is made use of. The present
   network configured can detect, classify and estimate the extent of
   damage from the measured vibration response of the structure. The
   significant feature of the newly proposed fuzzy logic integrated
   approach is that it requires no additional efforts at the training
   level, but it can be used against fuzzy input at the end user level with
   the integration of the vertex method module. Also a modular development
   of the network is proposed which makes the training fast and efficient.
   The potential of the above approach is illustrated with two separate
   case studies to show that neural network approach is a very promising
   tool for the damage assessment task.}},

Abstract = {{Alagille syndrome (AGS) is a clinically defined disorder characterized
   by cholestatic liver disease with bile duct paucity, peculiar facies,
   structural heart defects, vertebral anomalies, and ocular abnormalities.
   Multiple patients with various cytogenetic abnormalities involving 20p12
   have been identified, allowing the assignment of AGS to this region. The
   presence of interstitial deletions of varying size led to the hypothesis
   that AGS is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome. This molecular analysis
   of cytogenetically normal AGS patients was performed in order to test
   this hypothesis and to refine the localization of the known AGS region.
   Investigation of inheritance of simple tandem repeat polymorphism
   alleles in 67 members of 24 cytogenetically normal Alagille families led
   to the identification of a single submicroscopic deletion. The deletion
   included loci DZ0S61, D20S41, D20S186, and D20S188 and presumably
   intervening uninformative loci D20S189 and D20S27. The six deleted loci
   are contained in a single YAC of 1.9 Mb. The additional finding of
   multiple unrelated probands who are heterozygous at each locus
   demonstrates that microdeletions at known loci within the AGS region are
   rare in cytogenetically normal patients with this disorder. This
   suggests that the majority of cases of AGS may be the result of a single
   gene defect rather than a contiguous gene deletion syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{The microbial community structure of twenty-one single-phase and one
   two-phase full-scale anaerobic sewage sludge digesters was evaluated
   using oligonucleotide probes complementary to conserved tracts of the
   16S rRNAs of phylogenetically defined groups of methanogens and
   sulfate-reducing bacteria. These probe results were interpreted in
   combination with results from traditional chemical analyses and
   metabolic activity assays. It was determined that methanogens in
   `'healthy'' mesophilic, single-phase sewage sludge digesters accounted
   for approximately 8-12\% of the total community and that
   Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales constituted the majority of the
   total methanogen population. Methanobacteriales and Methanococcales
   played a relatively minor role in the digesters: Phylogenetic groups of
   mesophilic, Gram-negative sulfate-reducing bacteria were consistently
   present at significant levels: Desulfovibrio and Desulfobulbus spp. were
   the dominant sulfate-reducing populations, Desulfobacter and
   Desulfobacterium spp. were present at lower levels, and Desulfosarcina,
   Desulfococcus, and Desulfobotulus spp. were absent. Sulfate reduction by
   one or more of these populations played a significant role in all
   digesters evaluated in this study. In addition, sulfate-reducing
   bacteria played a role in favoring methanogenesis by providing their
   substrates. The analysis of the two-phase digester indicated that true
   phase separation was not accomplished: significant levels of active
   methanogens were present in the first phase. It was determined that the
   dominant populations in the second phase were different from those in
   the single-phase digesters.}},

Abstract = {{We prepared TiN-based multicomponent hard coatings by combined d.c. and
   r.f. magnetron sputtering with different contents of Ti, Al, Zr and Si
   on high speed steel substrates at 300 degrees C. These coatings, with
   thicknesses ranging from 1 to 3 mu m, were annealed in air at
   temperatures between 500 and 850 degrees C in order to obtain
   information on their oxidation behaviour. The composition-depth profiles
   of heal-treated coatings were then measured by Rutherford backscattering
   spectrometry (RES). The results show that the introduction of aluminium
   improves the oxidation resistance in all cases. During the heat
   treatment of Ti0.62Al0.38N at 600 degrees C, a mixed oxide of Ti and Al
   is formed. At temperatures between 700 and 850 degrees C, a protective
   superficial layer of Al2O3 with traces of Ti is formed, which is
   followed by an aluminium-depleted zone. However. for Ti0.57Al0.38Zr0.05N
   coatings, no protective Al2O3 layer was found on the surface after heat
   treatment. At 600 degrees C? the oxidation resistance of
   Ti0.57Al0.38Zr0.05N is similar to that of(TiAl)N, but is about 30 times
   poorer at 700 degrees C due to the absence of the protective Al2O3
   layer.
   The Ti0.62Al0.26Si0.12N system shows a slightly lower oxidation
   resistance than (TiAl)N (K-p = 9.0 x 10(-12) kg(2) m(-4) s(-1) and K-p =
   6.4 x 10(-12) kg(2) m(-4) s(-1) at 800 degrees C respectively). It also
   forms a two-phase scale as in (TiAl)Nt but the amount of Ti in the
   Al-rich outer layer is about 10 at.\%, instead of 4 at.\% found in the
   (TiAl)N system. In the temperature rang 700-850 degrees C, oxidation is
   thermally activated with activation energies of 187 kJ mol(-1) and 296
   kJ mol(-1) for (TiAl)N and (TiAlSi)N coatings respectively.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the method of diagnosis for a group of women who developed
   recurrent endometrial carcinoma after being rendered clinically
   disease-free by primary therapy. We then used this information to
   develop a follow-up protocol that maximizes the chances for detecting
   recurrence while minimizing surveillance costs. In brief, we evaluated
   all women with clinical stage I endometrial carcinoma who were treated
   with curative intent during a 7-year period. Medical records were
   examined to identify patients who had tumor recurrence diagnosed during
   follow-up in our clinic. Clinical presentation, time to diagnosis,
   method of diagnosis, and subsequent outcome were analyzed. This
   information was used to design a surveillance protocol for further
   clinical testing. Ninety-six percent of 412 women treated between 1985
   and 1992 were clinically disease-free after primary surgery with or
   without adjuvant treatment, Median follow-up is 64 months. Overall, 44
   patients (11\%) developed recurrent cancer after a median interval of
   14.8 months. Complete follow-up data were available for the 39 patients
   who had their recurrence diagnosed in our clinic. The cumulative
   percentages of diagnosed recurrences were 51, 82, and 95\% at 12, 24,
   and 36 months, respectively. Sixteen women (41\%) had symptoms that led
   to the identification of recurrent disease. Recurrences in the 23
   asymptomatic women (59\%) were diagnosed by physical examination in 13,
   chest radiograph in 1, serum CA-125 level in 6, vaginal cytology in 1,
   and computed tomography in 2. Only 1 patient with a grade 1
   adenocarcinoma had treatment failure. At the time of analysis, 30
   patients with recurrent cancer had died of disease, 6 were alive with
   disease, and 3 were free of disease. A surveillance scheme consisting of
   an examination, vaginal cytology, and serum CA-125, combined with
   immediate evaluation of symptomatic women, could be expected to identify
   95\% of recurrences. Such an approach, performed at 6- to 12-month
   intervals for 3 years, could be limited to patients with grade 2-3
   adenocarcinomas or variant cell types. However, given the high failure
   rate of salvage therapy, the prompt detection of recurrence may not
   convey a survival advantage. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The monohalomethanes (methyl iodide, methyl bromide and methyl chloride)

   inhalation exposure of rats to methyl bromide has been shown to result
   in severe olfactory toxicity. This study examined the effects on the rat
   nasal cavity of inhalation of methyl iodide (100 ppm for 0.5-6 h), and
   demonstrated that methyl iodide is a more potent olfactory toxin than
   methyl bromide. Within the nasal cavity the olfactory epithelium was the
   principle target tissue, and it was only at high doses (600 ppm.h) that
   limited damage to transitional epithelium occurred. The squamous and
   respiratory epithelia were consistently unaffected. Within olfactory
   epithelium the sustentacular cells were the primary cellular target and
   damage to sensory cells appeared to be a secondary event. Methyl iodide
   induced olfactory damage was reversible, and 2 weeks after exposure
   almost complete repair had taken place.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the mass media campaigns developed by the Mexican
   Council for AIDS Control and Prevention (CONASIDA)from 1987 to 1994.
   This paper presents the lessons learned, a discussion of obstacles and

   CONASIDA'S mass media communication strategies and their results.
   Knowing the opinion of some clue informants was considered relevant
   -taking into account that evaluations were made by and at CONASIDA- and
   seven indepth interviews were conducted among intellectuals,
   non-governmental organizations (NGO) fenders and public opinion leaders.
   The importance of society's involvement in AIDS prevention is stated,
   and two examples of mass media campaigns developed by civil groups ave
   commented. A section about the importance of research as a requisite to
   produce preventive messages is included, along with some examples.
   Finally, some conclusions are presented, useful to us, as well as
   others, in developing new educational campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{The sexual transfer of genes between taxa possessing different
   structural karyotypes must involve the passage of genes through a
   chromosomal sterility barrier. Yet little is known about the effects of
   structural differences on gene introgression within or adjacent to the
   rearranged chromosomal fragments or about the patterns of introgression
   in collinear regions. Here, we employ 197 mapped molecular markers to
   study the effects of chromosomal structural differences on introgression
   in backcrossed progeny of the domesticated sunflower, Helianthus annuus,
   and its karyotypically divergent wild relative, H. petiolaris. Forty
   percent of the genome from the seven collinear linkages introgressed,
   whereas only 2.4\% of the genome from the 10 rearranged linkages was
   transferred. Thus, chromosomal rearrangements appear to provide an
   effective mechanism for reducing or eliminating introgression in
   rearranged chromosomal segments. On the other hand, observations that
   60\% of the markers from within the collinear portion of the genome did
   not introgress suggests that genic factors also resist introgression in
   Helianthus. That is, selection against H. petiolaris genes in concert
   with linkage may have reduced or eliminated parts of the genome not
   protected by structural changes. Thus, barriers to introgression in
   Helianthus appear to include both chromosomal structural and genic
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Since more than 10 years, the obligation to perform a research
   evaluation about the JRC activities is included in Council decisions on
   research programmes. From 1984 to 1986 eight Peer Panels reviews were
   performed, one for each programme, and they were followed by an overall
   assessment by the JRC Scientific Council. For the research programme
   1988-1991, a mid-term and a final evaluations were entrusted to expert
   Panels for the all JRC. For the last programme, 1992-1994, a new
   approach was introduced by charging Visiting Groups to perform an
   evaluation of each JRC Institute. Internal evaluation through
   questionnaires and bibliometric analyses were also attempted at JRC. The
   merits of the various approaches are highlighted and specific
   considerations are shortly discussed concerning the `'control'' and the
   `'support'' function of the evaluations, quantitative and qualitative
   assessments, distributed or centralised evaluations, single or

Abstract = {{Nonspecific cytotoxic cell (NCC) activity was assessed in the peripheral

   which were derived by the chromosome set manipulation technique of
   androgenesis, In these fish, whose isogenicity was previously confirmed
   by multilocus DNA fingerprint analysis, NCC activity was studied by the
   release of Cr-51 from YAC-1 targets, Two groups of trout (the homozygous
   Arlee 12 line and the heterozygous hybrid of the Arlee 63 and Arlee 12
   lines) had significantly lower levels of NCC activity in peripheral
   blood than either outbred rainbow trout or other lines with Hot Creek.
   or hybrid Arlee x Hot Creek ancestry, The low NCC activity in the Arlee
   line appears to be inherited as a recessive trait, Peripheral blood
   cells of the trout mediated lectin dependent cellular cytotoxicity
   (LDCC) with the addition of phytohemagglutinin to co-cultures of
   effector cells and YAC-1 cells, The low NCC activity in the peripheral

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives. I evaluated how well fast computed tomography
   (CT) scanning could quantify altered myocardial microvascular function
   resulting from transient ischemia and subsequent reperfusion.
   Methods. A major epicardial coronary artery of anesthetized pigs was
   occluded for either 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min. Fast X-ray CT scan
   sequences were performed before and during occlusion and 30, 60, and 30
   min after onset of subsequent reperfusion. Regional myocardial
   perfusion, intramyocardial blood volume, and myocardial microcirculatory
   permeability-surface area product were estimated from the CT scan
   sequences.
   Results. With the increasing duration of ischemia, the
   permeability-surface area product remained unchanged during reperfusion
   (P >.05), but an index of myocardial microvascular permeability
   increased with the progressive duration of ischemia and of reperfusion
   (P <.05).
   Conclusion. These CT-based findings are consistent with published, more
   invasive demonstrations that capillary permeability is increased during
   postischemic reperfusion in proportion to the duration of the preceding
   ischemia.}},

Abstract = {{The hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzmye A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor
   lovastatin is used to treat hyperlipidaemia. This agent prevents the

   cells. In this study the effect of in vivo and in vitro administration
   of lovastatin on histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells was
   examined. Lovastatin (4 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) inhibited histamine
   release induced by concanavalin A (con A) from rat peritoneal mast cells
   of Hooded-Lister rats and both homozygous lean and obese Zucker rats. In
   contrast, release induced by antirat IgE (anti-IgE) was only
   significantly inhibited in cells derived from Hooded-Lister rats and
   that induced by compound 48/ 80 was not altered. Lovastatin (20 mu M, 24
   h, in vitro) caused a significant inhibition of the subsequent histamine
   release to con A, anti-IgE and compound 48/80 but not to the calcium
   ionophore A 23187. It is important to determine whether such inhibitory
   effects are also observed after the chronic, clinical administration of

Abstract = {{Changes in mineral stability and solubility due to temperature or
   pressure variations along fluid flowlines are potential causes of
   metasomatism in monolithologic hydrothermal systems. The conditions
   under which significant changes in rock composition can occur have been
   evaluated by combining steady state models of fluid flow and heat
   transport in a section of porous basaltic crust with reaction path
   calculations. A region of enhanced permeability, which may result from a
   combination of faulting and dyke emplacement, was represented by a
   vertically aligned 100 m wide layer located within the zone of fluid
   upflow. In basaltic systems at temperatures between 200 and 350 degrees
   C and pressures below 1 kb, the reactions most likely to be observed
   involve Ca and Na mass transfer between pore fluids and greenschist
   facies mineral assemblages (e.g., albite, epidote, prehnite, chlorite,
   quartz, actinolite). For models where permeability (k) is homogeneous
   with k = 10(-15) m(2) or less, and for fluids of approximately seawater
   salinity, very little metasomatic reaction is expected over timescales
   less than 10(5) years. Addition of a high permeability layer within the
   upwelling portion of the hydrothermal system results in formation of
   regions of intense metasomatism, characterised by Ca enrichment and
   alkali removal, located near the boundary between the two permeability
   domains. These metasomatic rocks form within timescales from 10(5) to
   10(4) years in systems where the high permeability layer has k = 5 x
   10(-15) to 2 x 10(-13) m(2). These reactions occur in response to
   temperature variations, and pressure effects are expected to be
   negligible. Within the permeable layer, one can expect to see a zone of
   feldspar dissolution and epidote and quartz precipitation advancing
   across a zone of earlier albitisation. Similar mineralogical changes are
   seen in epidosite rocks from ophiolites, which formed under conditions
   similar to those modelled here.}},

Abstract = {{A method has been developed for producing putative adventitious shoots
   from proliferating shoots of a chimeral Rosa multiflora rootstock.
   Proliferating cultures were established from greenhouse-grown axillary
   buds on Skirvin and Chu's (1979) modification of Murashige and Skoog
   (1962) medium supplemented with 6-benzylamino purine (BA, 2 mg l(-1))
   and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA, 0.1. mg l(-1)). The buds typically
   expanded to produce a single shoot that soon yellowed and senesced.
   However, when buds were transferred to the same medium with BA replaced
   by gibbereIlic acid (GA(3), 0.5 to 1.0 mg l(-1)) and silver nitrate (3.4
   mg l(-1)), prior to the onset of senescence, the shoots continued to
   expand and proliferate following subculture at 3-4 week intervals.
   Shoots harvested from this medium were moved to the same medium
   supplemented with various levels of thidiazuron (TDZ). Those subcultured
   on medium with 1 mu M TDZ developed compact nodular callus that later,
   after one or two subcultures onto the same medium, formed putative
   adventitious shoots. About half of these shoots rooted on MS medium
   supplemented with three auxins {[}(NAA, 0.5 mg l(-1)); indoleacetic acid
   (IAA, 1 mg l(-1)), and indolebutyric acid (IBA, 0.5 mg l(-1))], GA(3)
   (0.5 mg l(-1)), silver nitrate (3.4 mg l(-1)), activated charcoal (200
   mg l(-1)) and sucrose (40 g l(-1)). A sample (119) of these plants were
   screened for their thorny or thornless condition: some parental stems
   had a few recurved thorns; petioles had small lignified hairs. All
   regenerants had thornless stems; but they varied in degree of petiole
   prickliness. This suggests that we have separated a pure thornless form
   from the parental clone. In addition, there is enough variation among
   regenerants to suggest that somaclonal variation has appeared.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the assumption that there is greater reciprocity of
   relationships (i.e., mutuality of give and take) in China than there is
   in the United States, the authors predicted cultural differences in the
   incidence of songs in which adult children express a desire to give back
   to parents. More songs expressing giving back to mothers than giving
   back to fathers was also predicted. Popular songs in both cultures were
   rated for themes of positive or negative giving back to parents. Almost
   all of the Chinese songs expressed positive giving back, and the
   majority of U.S. songs expressed negative giving back. More songs about
   mothers than about fathers were found only for the Chinese songs.
   American songs' focus on fathers, about whom there are negative
   feelings, may reflect the U.S. disposition to negative giving back.
   Processes underlying giving back-involving modeling, caregiving
   practices, direct tuition, and reciprocity-are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The structural features of HLA-DQ alleles which are susceptible and
   resistant to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) have been
   examined using a model of their three-dimensional structure obtained by
   energy minimisation, based on the published structure of HLA-DR1. The
   model shows DQ molecules to have an overall shape nearly identical to
   that of DR molecules, but with significant differences in the fine
   structure: 1) the antigen-binding groove of DQ molecules has a
   polymorphic first pocket; this pocket can be either amphiphilic or
   hydrophilic, 2) The beta 49-56 dimerisation domain of DQ is polymorphic:
   hydrophobic, or amphiphilic, or hydrophilic and positively charged,
   leading to spontaneous or T-cell receptor-induced homodimer formation,
   or difficulty of the formation of such dimers, respectively; 3) a
   prominent Arg-Gly-Asp loop is formed by some DQ alleles (beta 167-169)
   and probably functions in cell adhesion. There are also small
   differences in the residues and sequences implicated in CD4 binding
   (mostly in DQ beta 134-148) but the significance of these differences
   cannot be evaluated at present. All seven DQ alleles which confer
   susceptibility to IDDM posses a hydrophilic first pocket in the
   antigen-binding groove, a hydrophobic or amphiphilic beta 49-56
   dimerisation patch that allows for spontaneous or T-cell
   receptor-induced dimerisation, and the Arg-Gly-Asp loop. By contrast, in
   the protective alleles at least one of these three features is absent.
   This segregation of phenotypes according to susceptibility or resistance
   can well explain the model of tighter autoantigen binding by the
   protective alleles compared to the susceptible alleles, previously
   proposed for the pathogenesis of IDDM.}},

Abstract = {{Basal sediments of Lake Torfadalsvatn, northern Iceland, record changes

   displacements of the marine polar front and sea-ice margin. Pollen,
   spores, green algae (Pediastrum), saturation isothermal remanent
   magnetization, and carbon content of the basal sediments provide the
   first detailed biostratigraphic record of the last glacial-interglacial
   transition in Iceland. During the first pioneer phase, beginning at ca.
   11,300 C-14 yr B.P., grasses and fell-field herbs became established,
   and lake productivity was very low. At ca. 10,900 C-14 yr B.P., climatic
   and soil conditions became favorable for shrubs and dwarf shrubs. This
   change, together with increased limnic productivity, clearly indicates
   long seasons without ice-cover in the sea immediately north of Iceland.
   A return to a colder climate (Younger Dryas), probably in connection
   with a southward displacement of the marine polar front, occurred by
   10,600 C-14 yr B.P. Shrub and dwarf-shrub vegetation disappeared, and
   limnic productivity diminished. A second pioneer vegetation phase,
   dominated by Oxyria/Rumex and grasses, was initiated by a change to
   longer seasons without sea ice at ca. 9900 C-14 yr B.P. This warming is
   also evident as a contemporaneous increase in lake productivity. After
   ca. 9400 C-14 yr B.P. the reestablishment of dwarf-shrub heaths and very
   high limnic productivity indicate further warming. (C) 1995 University

   ELASTIC-SCATTERING AT 70.5 MEV}},

Abstract = {{Recently published data for the elastic scattering of 70.5 MeV polarized
   Li-6 by Ni-58 have been compared with the results of coupled-channels
   calculations. The diagonal and off-diagonal potentials used in the
   analysis were generated from phenomenological alpha + Ni-58 and (d) over
   right arrow + Ni-58 optical potentials via the cluster-folding method.
   Examined were the effects of projectile excitation to the three
   low-lying T=0 resonant states and to nonresonant continuum states in the
   energy range 0.63 MeV-10.03 MeV, relative to the (6Li) --> alpha + d
   breakup threshold at 1.47 MeV. In common with earlier analyses,
   calculations limited to the resonant excited states reproduced the data
   only when the interaction and coupling potentials were renormalized.
   However, the inclusion of the nonresonant excited states removed the
   need for this renormalization. Calculations including both the resonant
   and nonresonant states yielded a description of the differential cross
   section data superior to that resulting from calculations limited to the
   resonant states even when the latter were performed with renormalized
   potentials. Calculations of the tensor analyzing powers reproduced the
   data well and favored a near zero value for the spectroscopic amplitude
   of the D-state admixture in the Li-6 ground state cluster wave function.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Enhanced gut permeability has been shown in patients with

   by high-dose interleukin-a immune therapy could further change gut
   barrier function, This study measured the effect of advanced renal cell
   carcinoma and malignant melanoma, and interleukin-2 treatment on gut
   permeability,
   Design: Nonrandomized, controlled study,
   Setting: University hospital,
   Patients: Adults with metastatic, unresectable renal cell carcinoma or
   metastatic, malignant melanoma, and normal volunteers,
   Interventions: Gut permeability was measured in patients with renal cell
   carcinoma or malignant melanoma before and during interleukin-a
   infusions, using polyethylene glycol 3350 and polyethylene glycol 400.
   The polyethylene glycols were administered orally within 48 hrs of
   interleukin-a therapy and the 24-hr urine excretions were measured.
   Measurements and Main Results: Increased permeability was seen in the
   baseline state of these patients (ratio of polyethylene glycol 3350 to
   polyethylene glycol 400 = 1.1 +/- 0.7 x 10(-2)) when compared with
   normal volunteers (ratio = 0.48 +/- 0.2 x 10(-2); p < .05), However,
   after interleukin-a treatment, no further increase in permeability was
   seem (ratio = 1.4 +/- 0.8 x 10(-2)).
   Conclusions: Gut permeability to polyethylene glycol 3350 is enhanced in
   advanced malignancy. High-dose interleukin-2 therapy does not further
   increase permeability of the gut.}},

Abstract = {{We study in great detail a system of three first-order ordinary

   Existence of periodic solutions is proved for certain ranges of

   nonintegrability aspects of the HDD system are studied by investigating
   analytically the singularity structure of the system in the complex
   domain. Coexisting attractors (including period-doubling sequence) and
   coexisting strange attractors appear in some parametric regimes. The
   gluing of strange attractors and the ungluing of a strange attractor are
   also shown to occur. A period of bifurcation leading to chaos, not
   observed for other chaotic systems, is shown to characterize the chaotic
   behavior in some parametric ranges. The limiting case of the Lorenz
   system is also studied and is related to HDD.}},

Abstract = {{For the overwhelming majority of processes in modern chemical and
   petrochemical industry, the presence of an active and selective catalyst
   is crucial. In the USA the total value of products from catalytic
   processes has been estimated to be roughly 9.10(11) \$ per year,
   corresponding to 17\% of the GNP. An arsenal of modern methods enables
   the physical chemist to characterize active sites and chemisorption
   complexes; quantum chemical calculations increasingly lead to concrete
   predictions. The key issue remains, however, to unravel reaction
   mechanism and to use this knowledge for the design of superior
   catalysts.
   In the present paper some challenging problems are addressed:
   (1) How does a `'promoter'' in a Rh/NaY catalyst direct CO hydrogenation
   towards synthesis of ethanol and ethyl acetate?
   (2) How does NOx decompose over Cu/ZSM5 catalysts and how is its
   reduction to N-2 enhanced by O-2?
   (3) How does the isomerization of butane to isobutane avoid primary
   carbenium ions over some acid catalysts, why are other catalysts with
   stronger acid sites less active?}},

   over into the difficult transition period of the last five years; output
   has remained almost stable despite unprecedented declines elsewhere in
   the economy. Still, in recent years, with the overall economic and
   political transformation, the situation has become far more unsettled

   of the orientation of the roller axes with respect to the hub axis,
   along with the hub orientations with respect to the platform, the number
   of wheels etc., playing an important role in the operation of the robot,

Abstract = {{In this paper, it is proved that any algebraic-geometric code can be
   expressed as a cross section of an extended multidimensional cyclic
   code. Both algebraic-geometric codes and multidimensional cyclic codes
   are described by a unified theory of linear block codes defined over
   point sets: algebraic-geometric codes are defined over the points of an
   algebraic curve, and an m-dinensional cyclic code is defined over the
   points in m-dimensional space, The power of the unified theory is in its
   description of decoding techniques using Grobner bases, In order to fit
   an algebraic-geometric code into this theory, a change of coordinates
   must be applied to the curve over which the code is defined so that the
   curve is in special position, For curves in special position, all
   computations can be performed with polynomials, rather than rational
   functions, and this also makes it possible to take advantage of the
   theory of Grobner bases, Next, a transform is defined for
   algebraic-geometric codes which generalizes the discrete Fourier
   transform, The transform is also related to a Grobner basis, and is
   useful in setting up the decoding problem. In the decoding problem, a
   key step is finding a Grobner basis for an error locator ideal, For
   algebraic-geometric codes, multidimensional cyclic codes, and indeed,
   any cross section of an extended multidimensional cyclic code, Sakata's
   algorithm can be used to find linear recursion relations which hold on
   the syndrome array, In this general context, we give a self-contained
   and simplified presentation of Sakata's algorithm, and present a general
   framework for decoding algorithms for this family of codes, in which the
   use of Sakata's algorithm is supplemented by a procedure for extending
   the syndrome array.}},

   Combinations of soluble metal salts, impregnation solvents, and surface
   properties of carbon black are suggested to be very important for the

   20 mg/d; n = 24) and bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg/d; n = 28), systolic and
   diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly (P < 0.01) from
   baseline in both groups at 3, 6, and 12 months. The reduction in
   diastolic blood pressure was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the
   lisinopril group than in the bisoprolol group only at 6 months. Heart
   rates dropped significantly in the bisoprolol group but not in the

Abstract = {{In order to assess a possible synergistic antinociceptive interactions,
   the analgesic effects of aspirin per sigma s (acetyl salicylic acid or
   `'ASA''), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and tramadol
   s.c. (TRA), an atypical opioid analgesic, administered either separately
   or in combination were determined in a model of pain-induced functional
   impairment in the rat, groups of six rats received either vehicle, ASA
   (175.4, 312.1, 555.1, 987.0, 1,755.3, or 3,121.2 mu mol/kg), TRA (21.3,
   38.0, 67.5, 120.0, or 243.5 mu mol/kg), or a combination of ASA and TRA
   (24 different combinations). This allowed us to detect the interaction
   profile of these combinations. The ED(50) for either ASA or TRA were
   1,173.5 +/- 7.4 mu mol/kg and 141.5 +/- 6.8 mu mol/kg, respectively. The
   data obtained confirmed an interaction between ASA and TRA and showed
   antinociception that may be additive or synergistic, depending on the
   drug ratio administered. Furthermore, eight combinations showed various
   degrees of potentiation (P < .01), whereas the others (16) exhibited
   analgesic effects not different from that of ASA alone. The combination
   of ASA (3,121.2 mu mol/kg) and TRA (120.0 mu mol/kg) produced the
   maximum analgesic effect. However, the combination of ASA (987/mu
   mol/kg) with TRA (120.0 mu mo/kg) produced the highest potentiation
   effects. This study clearly showed 1) that there is an interaction
   between ASA and TRA and 2) which combination of these analgesic drugs
   produced either the maximum analgesic effect or the highest degree of
   potentiation in the rat. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{An electrochemical hydrogen sensor has been constructed, based on two
   platinum electrodes that differ in their true-to-geometrical surface
   area ratios and that are in contact with Nafion. The electrodes attain
   different mixed potential values in air containing hydrogen and thus the
   sensor does not require a reference atmosphere (pure air). The potential
   difference between the electrodes can be used for potentiometric or
   amperometric detection of hydrogen. The detection sensitivity strongly
   depends on the relative humidity (RH) of the test air. Within a hydrogen
   concentration range from 40 to 4000 ppm (v/v) and with RH varying
   between 33 and 95\%, the sensitivity of potentiometric detection
   decreases with increasing RH from 149 to 113 mV per concentration
   decade, while that for amperometric detection increases from 0.67 to
   1.25 nA/ppm. On a step change in the hydrogen concentration, a value of
   95\% of stationary response is attained within ca. 140 s for
   potentiometric detection and ca. 50 s for amperometric measurement.}},

   studies of the initial reaction between OV(IV)(acac)(2) and TBHP were
   performed using EPR and UV spectroscopy. The experimental data suggest a
   second-order reaction, first order in OV(IV)(acac)(2) and in TBHP. IR
   spectroscopic studies of the reaction show that the V=O functionality is
   intact after the oxidation has taken place and, furthermore, UV, IR and
   H-1 NMR spectroscopic investigations all indicate that the
   acetylacetonate ligands remain bound to the vanadium atom during the
   oxidation of OV(IV)(acac)(2) to a OV(V)(acac)(2) complex. The oxidation
   of the vanadium(IV)- to the vanadium(V)-complexes is very dependent on
   the organic ligand attached to the metal. Studies of the oxidation of
   thianthrene 5-oxide using different vanadium catalysts and TBHP as the
   terminal oxidant show that the electronic nature of the transferred
   oxygen atom is electrophilic. The initial oxygen-transfer step in the
   epoxidation of(Z)-stilbene is proposed to be a reversible process that
   occurs via a non-concerted pathway. The vanadium-catalysed oxidation of

Abstract = {{The transbilayer pore of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is
   formed by a pentameric bundle of M2 helices. Models of pentameric
   bundles of M2 helices have been generated using simulated annealing via
   restrained molecular dynamics, The influence of: (a) the initial C alpha
   template; and (b) screening of sidechain electrostatic interactions on
   the geometry of the resultant M2 helix bundles is explored. Parallel M2
   helices, in the absence of sidechain electrostatic interactions, pack in
   accordance with simple ridges-in-grooves considerations. This results in
   a helix crossing angle of ca. + 12 degrees, corresponding to a
   left-handed coiled coil structure for the bundle as a whole. Tilting of
   M2 helices away from the central pore axis at their C-termini acid/or
   inclusion of sidechain electrostatic interactions may perturb such
   ridges-in-grooves packing. In the most extreme cases right-handed coiled
   coils are formed. An interplay between inter-helix H-bonding and helix
   bundle geometry is revealed. The effects of changes in electrostatic
   screening on the dimensions of the pore mouth are described and the
   significance of these changes in the context of models for the nAChR
   pore domain is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated antigens (Ags) are hard to
   detect and poorly defined in liver tissue, and are of uncertain
   interpretation. The failure of immunohistochemistry in HCV infection may
   be due to the affinity of specific antisera, the levels of Ags in
   infected tissues, the labile and unstabile expression of antigenic
   determinants, and the use of fixatives that may alter or destroy viral
   epitopes. Strategies to optimize all stages of tissue specimen
   processing have therefore been devised in the liver biopsies of patients
   with acute and chronic hepatitis, and those with hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC).
   Methods. HCV-Ags were detected with a two-stage indirect immunostaining
   procedure on unfixed cryostat liver sections from 7 acute and 23 chronic
   HCV-infected patients, and from 4 patients with HCV-associated HCC. A
   mixture of monoclonal antibodies directed to structural and
   non-structural HCV-related proteins were used as the primary reagents.
   Results. HCV-Ags in 50-70\% of the hepatocytes were found in all seven
   acute hepatitis patients compared with less than or equal to 20\%
   hepatocytes (p < 0.05) in 10 out of 23 patients (43.5\%) with chronic
   hepatitis. Immunoreactive signals appeared as diffuse or coarse granular
   deposits in the cytoplasm only. The nuclei were unstainable. No clear
   membranous pattern was found, although fine granular, submembranous
   accumulation in distinct areas of the cytoplasm was observed In acute
   hepatitis, HCV-Ag positive hepatocytes were distributed in the lobules
   in direct relation to the areas of necrosis and inflammatory cell
   accumulation whereas in chronic hepatitis the immunoreactive cells were
   not clearly related to the necrotic foci. HCV-Ag immunodeposits were
   demonstrated in all patients with HCC. The immunoreactive signal in
   neoplastic cells was primarily located in the cytoplasm and rarely in
   the nuclei. As compared with the non-neoplastic zones, neoplasia
   demonstrated a significantly higher specific signal.
   Conclusions. Immunohistology is a powerful tool for the identification
   of HCV-related proteins in liver tissue. sensitivity was significantly
   enhanced by the use of fresh-frozen tissues, which presumably preserve
   their HCV antigen structure, and by a mixture of monoclonal antibodies
   directed against HCV-related proteins, possibly on account of the
   separate access of each probe to different target proteins. The
   demonstration of HCV infection in hepatocyte cytoplasm indicates that
   this is the primary site of HCV replication, while its presence in
   malignant cells suggests that the virus could be substantially involved
   in the pathogenesis of HCC.}},

Abstract = {{Information about soil hydraulic properties and changes in them brought
   about by agricultural practices is essential in the development and use
   of models of catchment hydrology. The objectives of this study were to
   examine the extent to which different tillage practices affect the
   magnitude and variability of the hydraulic properties of a clay loam and
   to evaluate the effectiveness of a laboratory inverse method employed
   for characterizing the soil from the hydraulic point of view The field
   work was conducted at an experimental farm located in the Agri River
   basin (Italy), selected as a target area for application of recently
   developed distributed models at basin scale. Undisturbed vertical soil
   samples (cores) were collected from the top layer of no-till and
   conventional-till field plots.
   The laboratory inverse method simultaneously determined relationships of
   water retention, theta (h), and hydraulic conductivity, k (theta), from
   an evaporation experiment using a parameter estimation technique. This
   method was developed with the aim of reducing experimental efforts
   without significantly lowering accuracy in parameter estimates. A
   Crank-Nicolson type finite-difference solution of Richards' equation was
   coupled with a nonlinear optimization problem to estimate unknown
   parameters in the closed-form analytical relations employed in this
   study for describing soil hydraulic properties.
   Comparisons with laboratory-measured saturated hydraulic conductivity
   and soil water retention data obtained for a group of soil cores by a
   sand-kaolin box apparatus demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of
   the proposed inverse method. Overall, the results of hydraulic-property
   characterization for the soil at the experimental farm reveal no
   significant differences among tillage treatments. In addition, as a
   general rule, a progressive annulment of tillage effects on structure
   and hydraulic properties of soil if observed with time.}},

Abstract = {{Addition of a second metal or metal oxide often improves the selectivity
   of a supported catalyst for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene
   impurities in commercial n-butene streams. This research has explored
   the effect of adding Pd to cobalt supported on alumina. Catalysts
   containing 5 wt\% Co and varying amounts (0.1 to 1.0 wt\%) of Pd were
   prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, chemisorption of CO and H-2, and temperature-programmed
   reduction after having been subjected to a variety of carefully
   controlled pretreatments. Activities and product selectivities were
   tested for hydrogenation of pure 1,3-butadiene and butadiene in a
   mixture with 1-butene at room temperature. The presence of Pd increased
   the reducibility of the Co, and separate aluminate, Co, and Pd-Co
   bimetallic surface phases were identified following various
   pretreatments. Increasing the Co/Pd ratio decreased the formation of
   n-butane at room temperature relative to the rate of butadiene
   conversion, although the improved selectivity was achieved at the
   expense of increased olefin isomerization and deactivation due to
   accumulation of carbonaceous residues on the surface. It was not
   possible to determine unequivocally whether the observed modifications
   were due to electronic effects or selective poisoning of the separate Co
   sites. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{1. The rat brain type IIA Na+ channel alpha-subunit was stably expressed
   in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Current through the expressed Na+
   channels was studied using the whole-cell configuration of the patch
   clamp technique. The transient Na+ current was sensitive to TTX and
   showed a bell-shaped peak current vs. membrane potential relation.
   2. Na+ current inactivation was better described by the sum of two
   exponentials in the potential range -30 to +40 mV, with. a dominating
   fast component and a small slower component.
   3. The steady-state inactivation, h(infinity), was related to potential
   by a Boltzmann distribution, underlying thr ee states of the
   inactivation gate.
   4. Recovery of the channels from inactivation at different potentials in
   the range -70 to -120 mV were characterized by al? initial delay which
   decreased with hyperpolarization. The time course was well fitted by the
   sum of two exponentials. In this case the slower exponential was the
   major component, and both time constants decreased with
   hyperpolarization.
   5. For a working description of the Na+ channel inactivation in this
   preparation, with a minimal deviation from the Hodgkin-Huxley model, a
   three-state scheme of the form O reversible arrow I-1 reversible arrow
   I-2 was proposed, replacing the original two-state scheme of the
   Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the rate constants are reported.
   6. The instantaneous current-voltage relationship showed marked
   deviation from linearity and was satisfactorily fitted by the
   constant-field equation.
   7. The time course of activation was described by an m(x) model.
   However, the best-fitted value of x varied with the membrane potential
   and had a mean value of 2.
   8. Effective gating charge was determined to be 4.7e from the slope of
   the activation plot, plotted on a logarithmic scale.
   9. The rate constants of activation, alpha(m) and beta(m), were
   determined. Their functional dependence on the membrane potential was
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Phenylacetic acid (PAA) is a deamination product of phenylalanine (PHE)
   applied to soil, which can have a positive physiological effect on plant

   factors limiting deamination of PHE when added to soils, determine the
   major pathway upon detection of metabolic intermediates, and assess the
   growth-promoting effect on maize (Zea mays L.) of an exogenous
   application of PHE to soil. The highest activity of PHE deamination in
   soils occurred at pH 8.5 and on incubation temperature of 40 degrees C.
   The soil assay used to determine these parameters was based on the
   amount of NH4-N cleaved from L-PHE when incubated for 48 h in the
   presence of toluene. A sigmoidal relationship was observed between NH4-N
   and PHE concentration, indicating cooperative kinetics. Both
   phenylpyruvic acid and PAA were detected by high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) following the addition of PHE to soil. A
   glasshouse experiment revealed that an exogenous application of PHE as a
   soil drench to established uniform seedlings of maize had a significant
   effect on vegetative growth parameters (shoot height, shoot fresh
   weight, internodal distance, uppermost leaf collar base distance, and
   leaf width). Since PAA is a well-established plant growth regulator, it
   was concluded that this metabolic product derived from PHE in soil was
   responsible for the stimulatory growth effects in maize.}},

Abstract = {{Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is caused by abnormal expansion of an
   unstable CAG repeat in a novel gene locating on chromosome 14q32.1. We
   analysed this CAG repeat polymorphism with 66 Japanese MJD patients, All
   the patients were selectively associated with abnormal expansion of the
   CAG repeat. Repeat length of the mutant allele did not overlap that of
   normal allele and closely correlated with not only age at onset but also
   with clinical phenotypes. CAG repeat size is apparently related to a
   wide variety of phenotypic presentations in MJD.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To demonstrate normal MR anatomy of the substantia innominata
   and its changes in Alzheimer disease on MR imaging. METHODS: Using a
   1.5-T superconductive MR unit, thickness of the substantia innominata
   was measured on coronal thin-section images obtained in 22 patients with
   Alzheimer disease and 14 age-matched control subjects. Comparison of
   these images with postmortem specimens of human brain was also
   performed. RESULTS: On T2-weighted images through the anterior
   commissure, the substantia innominata was clearly identified between the
   globus pallidus and the anterior perforated substance. In Alzheimer
   disease, thinning of the substantia innominata was more frequently
   observed than in the age-matched controls. CONCLUSION: Thin-section
   T2-weighted coronal MR images can demonstrate shrinkage of the
   substantia innominata, a finding that may aid in the diagnosis of
   Alzheimer disease.}},

   activities with five chromogenic substrates and a tryptic digest of
   casein. Within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free
   extracts of the strains varied. Furthermore, differences were observed
   between the Lactobacillus species and Lc. lactis. Lb. helveticus had by
   far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates,
   indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases. X-prolyl-dipeptidyl
   aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. Lb. delbrueckii subsp.
   bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates
   containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and
   prolyl-p-nitroanilide. On the other hand, Lb. fermentum and Lb. brevis
   could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. A more detailed study
   with highly proteolytic Lactobacillus strains indicated that at least
   three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. Compared
   with Lc. lactis, the Lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic

   cardiac tumor, comprising 30 to 50\% of the total in most studies.(2))

Abstract = {{The light environment within a crop canopy is an important determinant
   of the potential photosynthetic activity of the crop. The photon flux
   environment within the crop is influenced by the total incoming
   radiation and the structure of the plant canopy. In this study, the
   light environment within two economically important species of cotton
   (Gossypium, sps.) that show diverse growth habits was examined at
   different growth stages. G. hirsutum had very regular leaf shapes
   throughout the growing season, and was diaheliotropic. G. barbadense had
   large, fairly flat leaves early in the season that progressively became
   more cupped at increasing mainstem positions, and had no heliotropic
   response. These differences in leaf shapes and solar tracking altered
   the leaf and canopy light environment. Estimated total diurnal light
   intercepted by upper canopy leaves was found to be lower for G.
   barbadense than for G. hirsutum, due in part to the cupping of the leaf
   surface. Alternatively, the cupping of the G. barbadense leaves resulted
   in a more erectophile canopy, increasing PFD to lower canopy leaves in
   the G. barbadense canopy particularly later in the season relative to
   that PFD observed in the G. hirsutum canopy. This redistribution of
   light to lower canopy leaves has been suggested to be beneficial by
   increasing net canopy photosynthesis. The cupping of the G. barbadense
   leaves, in addition to distributing light over a greater
   photosynthetically active area, may be beneficial by reducing
   photoinhibition. Additionally, the extreme cupping of the G. barbadense
   leaves results in illumination of the abaxial surface during portions of
   the day, which may further increase the photosynthetically active area
   and contribute to total canopy carbon uptake.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the relationship between mechanical properties,
   function and design in prehistoric bone tools. The evidence that
   supports this association could lead to the interpretation of bone tool
   collections in the light of evolutionary theory. In order to evaluate
   the interaction among these three factors we have studied the mechanical
   and geometrical properties of bone used by the prehistoric Fuegians for
   manufacturing tools (from 6000 sp till the last century). In this study,
   3-point tests of bone samples were performed; and the possible function,
   in terms of modes of action, for each group of tools, was inferred from
   their morphological traits and the ethnographic record. Results support
   the view that the bones selected for manufacturing each kind of tool
   were those whose geometric and/or mechanical properties most suited the
   design and function of the tool involved. (C) 1995 Academic Press

Abstract = {{Patients who underwent potential curative surgery for colonic
   adenocarcinoma were enrolled in a prospectively randomised, controlled
   clinical trial of combined intraperitoneal (i.p.) plus systemic
   intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and
   leucovorin (LV). We investigated whether this adjuvant treatment
   approach, specifically addressing the risk of peritoneal and hepatic
   recurrence, could improve disease-free and overall survival. Between May
   1988 and December 1990, 121 patients with resected stage III or
   high-risk stage II (T4NOMO) colon cancer were randomly assigned for
   observation (which was considered standard care until the NM consensus
   conference) or adjuvant chemotherapy with LV (200 mg/m(2)) plus 5-FU
   (350 mg/m(2)), both given i.v. (days 1-4) and i.p. (days 1 and 3) every
   4 weeks for a total of six courses. After a median follow-up time of 4.6
   years, a comparative analysis between the two groups of patients
   suggested both an improvement in disease-free survival (75\% versus
   58\%; P = 0.06) and a survival advantage (78\% versus 63\%; P = 0.05) in
   favour of adjuvant chemotherapy. The sites of recurrence were also
   different, i.e. local regional and intrahepatic tumour recurrences were
   observed in only 6/58 (10\%) and 5/58 (9\%) adjuvant treated patients as
   compared to 11/60 (18\%) and 10/60 (17\%) observed patients. The overall
   benefit of adjuvant therapy appeared to be greatest in patients with
   stage III colon cancer. Treatment-associated toxicity was infrequent and
   generally mild with only 5\% experiencing severe (WHO grade 3) adverse
   reactions. Interim results of this adjuvant trial suggest that combined
   i.p. plus systemic i.v. chemotherapy with 5-FU and LV represents a
   potentially effective adjuvant regimen in stage II/III colon cancer.}},

   azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and/or therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE).
   The most important success of CyA was an improvement in the
   symptomatology (vasculitis, arthritis, serositis, cardial- and
   CNS-disorders). It improved poorly the renal function.
   Anti-ds-DNA-antibodies and circulating immuncomplexes increased by 57

Abstract = {{Synovectomy of the knee has settled as a standard procedure in
   rheumatoid patients. The clincal outcome mainly depends on the
   radicality of the removal of synovial tissue. Using modern arthroscopic
   techniques and shaver systems, arthroscopic synovectomy of the knee
   seems to be as radical as the conventional open technique. Do the
   clinical results confirm this hypothesis?
   The clinical findings in 24 knees after conventional open synovectomy
   (group I), in 24 knees following arthroscopic synovectomy (group II) and
   in 24 knees after arthroscopic synovectomy in combination with
   synoviorthesis (group III) were compared.
   The diagnosis was RA in all cases. The average follow-up was five years.
   Patients of all groups reported as well a reduction in complaints and
   swelling as an improvement in walking-ability and in the ability to
   climb up stairs. At follow-up clinical findings showed a slight increase
   of ROM and recurrent swelling in eight knees of group I, in four knees
   of group II and in three knees of group III. The overall results were
   assessed by the Klein-score. An average increase was found in group I
   from 33.9 to 61 points, in group II from 36.6 to 68.5 points and in
   group III from 36.2 to 74 points. Radiographically a slight increase in
   Larsen categories in all groups was observed.
   Five years postoperatively the clinical outcome following careful
   arthroscopical synovectomy is as favourable as after conventional open
   synovectomy. Arthroscopically synovectomized patients seem to profit
   from additional synoviorthesis.}},

   alkali cation concentrations were manipulated by 1) previous loading via
   the ionophore monensin followed by removal of monensin and 2) addition
   of the channel ionophore gramicidin during Ca2+-influx measurements.
   Ca2+ influx was measured as a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ with the
   Ca2+-indicating dye flue 3. An absolute requirement for intracellular
   Na+ was observed with a Na+ dissociation constant of 30-40 mM, whereas
   intracellular K+ was a potent inhibitor of Ca2+ influx, apparently by
   competing with Naf for a common site on the Na+/Ca2+/K+ exchanger.
   Half-maximal Ca2+ influx was observed at an external free Ca2+
   concentration of 0.9 mu M when no external Na+ was present and 3.5 mu M
   when 10 mM external Na+ was present. Our observations are discussed in
   the context of 1) a three-site model for the Na+/Ca2+/K+ exchanger and
   2) earlier experiments on light adaptation in rods, which depended on
   minimizing Ca2+ fluxes across the ROS plasma membrane.}},

   Methods and Results Between 1979 and 1992, 58 patients (38 men and 20
   women; mean age; 49+/-24 years) with HOCM were operated on with the use
   of this different technique. Their intraventricular gradients were
   79+/-33 (+/-SD) mm Hg at rest and increased to 147+/-48 mm Hg with
   provocative maneuvers. Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation was present
   in 60\% of the patients, and severe regurgitation was present in 5\%.
   Ten patients required additional aortocoronary bypass graft surgery.
   Follow-up (mean, 84 months) was complete (100\%). Hemodynamic
   improvement was documented by a significant (P<.01) decrease in left
   ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 19+/-9 to 14+/-6 mm Hg and
   reduction of basal outflow tract gradients to 5+/-7 nlm Hg at rest and
   16+/-24 mm Hg after provocation. Late mortality was 1.4\% per
   patient-year, and no sudden cardiac deaths occurred during follow-up,
   Functional status was excellent for 84\% of the patients; 8 patients
   were in New York Heart Association functional class III, and none were
   in class IV. Echocardiography revealed no outflow tract obstruction.
   Conclusions Extended myectomy and reconstruction of the subvalvular
   mitral apparatus in HOCM result in excellent functional improvement with
   relief of outflow tract obstruction. The technique can be performed
   safely despite its more aggressive surgical nature and allows an
   individualized strategy depending on the patient's extent and
   distribution of left ventricular hypertrophy.}},

Abstract = {{In anticipation of computers that will be able to run weather
   forecasting models on very fine grids fast enough for real-time
   purposes, an algorithm for representing water phase change and
   precipitation processes was developed. The design criteria guiding this
   development are sufficiency (i.e., providing the required services),
   computational efficiency, and compatibility within four-dimensional data
   assimilation systems. The implication of the last criterion is that the
   model's moisture variables need to be consistent with observable or
   inferable cloud properties.
   The algorithm is compared with a well-documented research microphysics
   algorithm in terms of computing efficiency and agreement with
   observations. The weather forecasting model runs much faster using the
   new package instead of the research algorithm. The agreement between the
   new algorithm and the research algorithm is much better than the
   agreement between the observations and the results from either
   algorithm, which suggests that errors in observations or other errors in
   the model runs (initialization, boundary conditions) are larger sources
   of error than the microphysics representation.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray induced photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in combination with depth
   profiling has been used to investigate the structure and the degradation
   mechanism of PTFE bonded gas diffusion electrodes (GDE). The XP-spectra
   of these electrodes show distinctly separated binding states of the Cls
   electrons at E(b) = 292 eV and E(b) = 286 eV. These binding states are
   related to the carbon in the (CF2)(n) configuration (C1s(CF2)) and the
   graphite (C1s(graphite)), respectively. The C1s(CF2), signal decreases
   are induced by both X-ray exposure and ion etching. Simultaneously a
   decrease of the F1s signal has been approved. The intensity ratio of F1s
   to C1sCF(2) has increased during the experiment. These results indicate
   a decomposition of PTFE which creates CF fractions, leading to an excess
   intensity in the energetic range between the C1s binding states of the
   PTFE and the graphite. Although both the Fls and the C1s spectra are
   strongly modified by ionizing radiation, samples are comparable, when
   exposition doses are equal.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptation of the muscularis propria to intestinal resection is not well
   studied. Growing, 150- to 200-g Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a
   resected group (R), which had 75\% of the jejunoileum removed; a
   sham-resected group (SR); and a group of untreated controls (C). Food
   intake and weight gain were documented. Animals were killed on days 0,
   10, 20, 30, or 40 (n = 14 animals for each day in each group).
   Small-intestinal length and jejunal circumference, wet weight/cm,
   thickness of the muscle layers, muscle morphometry, mg protein, and mu g
   DNA per cm of the muscularis propria were measured. R rats had an
   initially greater food intake than SR or C animals, but the rate of
   weight gain was not different between groups. There was no significant
   increase in length of the residual intestine in R animals during the
   postoperative adaptive period, but circumference was significantly
   increased in R compared with SR or C animals. Wet weight/cm, mg protein,
   and mu g DNA per cm of the muscularis propria were significantly greater
   in R compared with SR or C animals, but there was no change in thickness
   of the smooth-muscle layers in R versus SR or C rats. The number of
   cross-sectioned circular smooth-muscle cells/mm(2) and the ratio of mg
   protein/mu g DNA/cm length of muscularis propria were not different in R
   compared with SR or C animals. Intestinal resection resulted in a
   significant increase in circumference but not length of the residual
   intestine. A significant increase in the mass/cm, with no change in the
   number of cross-sectioned circular smooth-muscle cells/mm(2) or in mg
   protein/mu g DNA/cm of the muscularis propria, indicates that the
   adaptive response of muscularis propria is characterized by hyperplasia.
   This response potentially confers benefit to the organ and animal as a
   whole as a mechanism that permits structural and functional adaptation
   of the muscularis propria to resection.}},

Abstract = {{The development of plant cell cultures as an alternative supply of
   phytochemicals has been difficult. Although there has been some very
   suitable targets, the yields of these compounds has remained low despite
   considerable efforts. One of the main constituents of a process is its
   productivity which is the sum of the process run time (growth rate),
   yield, and biomass levels. The effect of changes in all three of these
   components on productivity has been demonstrated.
   Of the three components making up productivity, biomass is perhaps the
   easiest to increase. However, high biomass levels will increase the
   viscosity, which will affect both mixing and oxygen supply. Therefore,
   this will require more vigorous mixing which may increase the shear
   within the bioreactor. All these parameters need further investigation
   at high biomass concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{The single-strand origin (SSO) of the rolling-circle (RC),
   broad-host-range lactococcal plasmid pWVO1 was functionally
   characterized. The activity of this SSO in the conversion of
   single-stranded DNA to double-stranded DNA was tested both in vivo and
   in vitro. In addition, the effect of this SSO on plasmid maintenance was
   determined. The functional pWVO1 SSO comprises a 250 bp region,
   containing two inverted repeats (IRs). The activity of each IR was
   tested, separately and in combination, in a plasmid derivative that was
   otherwise completely devoid of structures that might function as SSO.
   One of the IRs (IR I) showed some homology with other previously
   described SSOs of the SSOA type, as well as with the conversion signal
   of the Escherichia coli phage Phi X174. This IR was shown to have a
   partial, RNA polymerase-independent activity in complementary strand
   synthesis, both in vivo and in vitro. The second IR, which had no
   activity of its own, was required for full SSO activity, both in vivo
   and in vitro. The conversion of single-stranded DNA to the
   double-stranded form by the complete SSO was only partly sensitive to
   inhibition by rifampicin, indicating the existence of an RNA
   polymerase-independent pathway for this event. The results suggest that
   the pWVO1 SSO can be activated by two different routes: an RNA
   polymerase-dependent one (requiring the entire SSO), and an RNA
   polymerase-independent one (requiring only IR I).}},

Abstract = {{In early gestation the internal surface of the lung is structurally
   simple and an ideal target for somatic gene transfer(1-3). The transfer
   of genes into the growing lung would be particularly useful in the
   prenatal correction of cystic fibrosis, which has devastating pulmonary
   complications. In addition, in utero gene therapy has the potential to
   immunotolerize the individual, and thereby to avoid the immune reactions
   now seen with the current generation of adenoviral vectors(4,5). We
   injected a replication-defective adenoviral vector containing the lacZ
   reporter gene (Ad5.CMVlacZ) into the amniotic fluid of rat pups on the
   16th day of gestation(6-9). At 16 days of gestation, rat lungs are
   equivalent in maturity to those of a 22-week human fetus as their
   airways are lined with undifferentiated multipotential stem cells. The
   pups showed high-level reporter gene expression in their airways a week
   following birth (13 days following infection). The expression was
   maintained during a time when the lung volume increased approximately
   20-fold, alveolarization occurred, and the epithelial cells
   differentiated(2,3). These data establish gene targeting of
   undifferentiated fetal cells as an effective means of gene therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Inspection by variables is proposed as an acceptance criterion for use
   in bioanalysis. The criteria currently used are deficient either by
   ignoring the issues of precision (fixed range) and/or accuracy (99\%
   confidence interval), not being able to provide immediate answers
   (quality charts), or even not being scientifically justified (fixed
   range). Inspection (sampling) by a variables procedure was originally
   developed to drive the quality of military supplies (MIL-STD-414) and
   was consequently incorporated in ISO 3951 as a part of industrial
   quality control. It is based on the concept of acceptable quality level
   (AQL), which is the maximum per cent defective (number of results
   outside of specification per 100 results) that can be considered
   satisfactory as a process average. It also correlates sample size with
   batch size. An AQL of 6.50\% is proposed as a standard with
   specification set at +/-20\% or +/-15\%, which should result in
   coefficients of variation of approximately 15\% and 12\%, respectively.
   This concept has been applied post factum to 14 authentic data sets,
   thus proving its utility and validity.}},

Abstract = {{A modified freeze-thaw method in combination with reverse transcriptase
   PCR was developed far monitoring gene expression in activated sludge.
   The sensitivity of the methodology was determined by inoculating non
   sterile activated sludge samples with 3-chlorobenzoate-degrading
   Pseudomonas putida PPO301(pRO103), which contains the catabolic tfdB
   gene, tfdB mRNA was detected in 10 mg of activated sludge inoculated
   with 10(4) CFU of the target organism. This technique was subsequently
   utilized to analyze the in situ expression of the catabolic dmpN gene in
   a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) bioaugmented with phenol-degrading P.
   putida ATCC 11172. Greatest dmpN expression was observed 15 min after
   maximum phenol concentration was reached in the reactor and 15 min after
   the start of aeration. Decreased phenol concentrations in the reactor
   corresponded to reduced levels of dmpN expression, although low levels
   of dmpN mRNA were observed throughout the SBR cycle. These results
   indicate that concentration of phenol in the reactor and the onset of
   aeration stimulated transcriptional activity of the dmpN gene. The
   information obtained from this study can be used to alter SBR
   operational strategies so as to lead to more effective bioaugmentation
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To study the electric activity of the vas deferens (VD), or
   electrovasogram (EVG), in 14 mongrel dogs.
   Methods. The VD was exposed in the spermatic cord and three electrodes
   were applied to it. Synchronous transcutaneous EVG was also recorded by
   another three electrodes, The electric activity and intravasal pressure
   (IVP) were determined at rest, during ejaculation, and after vasal
   myotomy.
   Results. Slow waves or pacesetter potentials (PPs) were recorded
   regularly from all electrodes applied to the VD whether directly or
   transcutaneously. They had identical frequency and regular rhythm from
   all the electrodes and were consistent in the individual dog on all test
   days. Action potentials (APs) followed PPs randomly and were associated
   with an IVP increase, indicating a state of contractile activity, Just
   before ejaculation, the PPs and APs increased significantly (P < 0.05)
   and were associated with IVP rise (P < 0.01). During ejaculation, there
   was rhythmic increase of the PPs, APs, and IVP (P < 0.01 for frequency
   and amplitude, P < 0.05 for velocity of PPs and P < 0.001 for IVP)
   followed by a silent period and return to the resting activity (P >
   0.05), After vasal myotomy, PPs and APs were recorded proximal but not
   distal to the cut, This suggests that the PPs and APs spread caudally
   from the proximal part of the VD that is believed to be the site of a
   pacemaker that triggers the PPs. The PPs seem to pace the vasal
   contractile activity in terms of direction and frequency.
   Conclusions. A normal EVG pattern was characterized for the VD, which
   may be deranged in the various vasal pathologic conditions. EVG may thus
   be proposed to be included as an investigative tool in the diagnosis of
   vasal disorders.}},

Abstract = {{PrfA is a pleiotropic activator of virulence gene expression in the
   pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Several lines of evidence
   have suggested that a hierarchy of virulence gene activation by PrfA
   exists, This hypothesis was investigated by assessing the ability of
   PrfA to activate the expression of virulence gene fusions to lacZ in
   Bacillus subtilis. Expression of PrfA in this heterologous host was
   sufficient for activation of transcription at the hly, plcA, mpl, and
   actA promoters. Activation was most efficient at the divergently
   transcribed hly and plcA promoters. The putative PrfA binding site
   shared by these promoters is perfectly symmetrical and appears to
   represent the optimum sequence for target gene activation by PrfA, The
   activation of actA and mpl expression was considerably weaker and
   occurred more slowly than that observed at the hly and plcA promoters,
   suggesting that greater quantities of PrfA are required for productive
   interaction at these promoters. Interestingly, expression of an
   inlA-lacZ transcriptional fusion was very poorly activated by PrfA in B,
   subtilis, suggesting that other Listeria factors, in addition to PrfA,
   are required for PrfA-mediated activation at this promoter, Further
   support for the involvement of such factors was obtained by constructing
   and analyzing a prfA deletion mutant of L. monocytogenes. We observed
   that, in contrast to that of the other genes of the PrfA regulon,
   expression of inlA is only partially dependent on PrfA.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to determine whether intracellular or extracellular events
   contribute to the decrease in circulating antithrombin (AT) levels that
   is seen in subjects with the Utah mutation (Pro 407 to Leu),
   Site-directed mutagenesis was used to recreate this mutation within a
   previously characterized rabbit AT cDNA, Cell-free expression of the
   mutated cDNA yielded an AT protein that failed to react with thrombin.
   Expression of the rabbit AT-Utah protein in transiently transfected Cos
   cells resulted in a 10-fold decrease in the amount of AT antigen
   detected in the conditioned media, as compared with that seen with the
   wild-type recombinant AT. This effect was not caused by variations in
   transfection efficiency, because AT levels were normalized to the
   product of a cotransfected plasmid, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase.
   Moreover, on Northern blot analysis, AT mRNA levels were comparable in
   cells expressing either the rabbit AT-Utah or wild-type recombinant
   rabbit AT, Immunoblots of conditioned media from the two populations of
   transfected cells showed that the recombinant AT-Utah protein was
   intact. The results obtained with Cos cells were reproduced using
   permanently transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Pulse-chase
   experiments with the CHO lines showed that both initial levels of rabbit
   AT-Utah after the pulse labeling and the rate of subsequent secretion
   during the chase period were reduced compared with that seen with cells
   expressing the wild-type AT. The observed reduction in AT secretion was
   also observed for the AT-Oslo mutation (Ala 404 to Thr) when recreated
   in the rabbit AT background, and expressed in Cos cells, In these
   experiments, the media levels of mutant AT were reduced by 50\%,
   compared with wild-type, These results show that intracellular events,
   as opposed to accelerated clearance or other extracellular causes,
   contribute to the paucity of AT secretion seen in these strand 1C AT
   mutants. (C) 1995 by The American Society of Hematology.}},

Abstract = {{Isoelectronic Sm2+ and EU(3+) ions with their ground configuration 4f(6)
   are used in different ternary MYX compounds to study the reduction of
   the Slater parameters F-kappa and the spin-orbit coupling parameter
   zeta(4f), commonly referred to as the nephelauxetic effect. At first, a
   simulation of the 4f(6) energy levels in the intermediate coupling
   scheme with the two parameters F-2 and zeta(4f) shows that the set of
   basis functions must include all the septets ((7)L(J)) and all the
   quintets ((5)L(J)), as well as some triplets (P-3(J), D-3(J), and
   F-3(J)) Or singlets (S-1(J), P-1(J), and D-1(J)) to reproduce the energy
   level scheme accurately, whereby a strong effect of the triplets and
   singlets on the D-5(J) multiplets is most prominent. With structural
   parameters of different host materials at ambient and elevated
   pressures, different distance dependences of the parameters F-2 and
   zeta(4f) for Sm2+ and EU(3+) are derived from the ambient-pressure and
   high-pressure energy-level schemes, demonstrating a breakdown of the
   nephelauxetic series. Only a combination of at least two microscopic
   covalency mechanisms, central-field covalency (CFC) and
   symmetry-restricted covalency (SRC), allows for a description without
   contradictions. Thereby the CFC contribution is dominant for the small
   EU(3+) ion, whereas the SRC is more dominant for the larger Sm2+ ion.
   Finally, ab initio calculations of Coulomb integrals are used to
   evaluate the Slater parameters F-kappa of Sm2+ within the SRC model and
   close agreement of these results with the experimental data is then
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Acquired neuromyotonia is characterized by hyperexcitability of motor
   nerves leading to muscle twitching, cramps, and weakness. The symptoms
   may improve following plasma exchange, and injection of immunoglobulin G
   (IgG) from 1 neuromyotonia patient into mice increased the resistance of
   neuromuscular transmission to d-tubocurarine. Here we examine nerves and
   muscle in vitro from mice injected with plasma or purified IgG from G
   neuromyotonia patients or pooled control subjects, and cultured dorsal
   root ganglion cells after treatment with IgG. Three of the patients had
   antibodies against human voltage-gated potassium channels labeled with
   I-125-alpha-dendrotoxin. The quantal release of acetylcholine (quantal
   content) at end-plates in diaphragms from mice treated with
   neuromyotonia IgG preparations was increased by 21\% relative to control
   values (P = 0.0053). With one IgG preparation, the duration of the
   superficial peroneal nerve compound action currents was increased by
   93\% The dorsal root ganglion cells treated with this IgG showed a
   marked increase in repetitive firing of action potentials. All effects
   were similar to those obtained with aminopyridines. We conclude that at

   against aminopyridine- or alpha-dendrotoxin-sensitive K+ channels in
   motor and sensory neurons, and they are likely to be implicated in the

Abstract = {{Magnetic anisotropy analysis represents a well-established and
   frequently used method in structural geology. Several attempts were made
   to relate the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) to rock
   fabrics and to discover the sources of the AMS. In gneissic rocks,
   paramagnetic phyllosilicates with lattice-dependent magnetic properties
   are assumed to control the whole rock AMS, i.e. it is dominated by mica
   lattice preferred orientation (texture). In this study, AMS was modelled
   on the basis of the mica texture, the rock composition and compared to
   the experimentally determined AMS. The orientations of the modelled and
   experimental tensors agree quite well, whereas all the other
   characteristic parameters (shape, anisotropy, mean susceptibility)
   display large differences. It has been concluded that accessory high
   susceptible phases, as well as the diamagnetic rock constituents, may
   have significant influence on AMS. Consequently, mica pole figure
   measurements cannot be replaced by AMS measurements without control of
   the sources of AMS. It was also concluded, that the March model to
   evaluate strain from mica-preferred orientations is not valid for highly
   strained rocks. Beside the fact that the obtained strains are too low,
   the deformation is generally inhomogeneous, which leads to an overprint
   of the mica texture. Since the microstructural fabric elements which
   originate in different strain regimes (prolate or oblate) may create
   similar modifications of the mica orientation patterns, it is obvious
   that the relationship between AMS and deformation is rather complex.}},

Abstract = {{Tumors of the adrenal cortex belong to a group of malignancies with a
   poor prognosis. In childhood 6\% of all adrenal tumors have been
   localized in the adrenal cortex. In contrast to the adult, most of these
   childhood tumors have an endocrine function. The main goal of therapy
   should be the radical surgical approach. In cases with metastatic
   disease, mitotane or chemotherapy may lead to partial remission.
   Survival time depends on serum levels of the mitotane. The presented
   paper describes case reports of a 4 and 10-year-old boy with carcinoma
   of the adrenal cortex. Dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone were
   produced by the tumor in the first case. Serum levels of these hormones
   correlated with the stage of therapy. Surgical treatment was the first
   step of treatment in both cases. Secondarily, chemotherapy was
   performed. One boy showed partial remission during mitotane, but there
   was no real benefit in survival time. Both children died after 8 and 12
   months, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A population-based, case-control study of pancreatic cancer based on
   direct interviews with 307 white and 179 black incident cases and 1164
   white and 945 black population controls was conducted in three areas of
   the United States to determine the role alcohol drinking plays as a risk
   factor for pancreatic cancer and to estimate the extent to which it may
   explain the higher incidence of pancreatic cancer in blacks compared to
   whites. Our findings indicate that alcohol drinking at the Levels
   typically consumed by the general population of the United States is
   probably not a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Our data suggest,
   however, that heavy alcohol drinking may be related to pancreatic cancer
   risk. Among men, blacks and whites who drank at least 57 drinks/week had
   odds ratios (ORs) of 2.2 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.9-5.6] and
   1.4 (95\% CI = 0.6-3.2), respectively. Among women, blacks who drank 8
   to <21 drinks/week had an OR of 1.8 (95\% CI = 0.8-4.0), and those who
   drank at least 21 drinks/week had an OR of 2.5 (95\% CI = 1.02-5.9), but
   whites with the same levels of alcohol intake experienced no increased
   risk. Compared to whites, blacks had significantly higher ORs associated
   with heavy alcohol drinking (greater than or equal to 57 drinks/week) in
   men (P = 0.04) and with moderate-to-heavy drinking (greater than or
   equal to 8 drinks/week) in women (P = 0.03). Additional research is
   needed to determine whether heavy alcohol drinking is causally related
   to pancreatic cancer and whether the risk of alcohol-related pancreatic
   cancer is greater in blacks than in whites.}},

   interdependent self-construal (the image of self as connected with

   Americans are more susceptible to embarrassment than are Euro-Americans.
   A total of 503 Euro-American and Asian American university students
   completed the Self-Construal Scale and the Embarrassability Scale.
   Results strongly supported all hypotheses. Further, individual
   differences in self-construal accounted for cultural differences in
   embarrassability. Many prior studies have associated embarrassability
   with social deficiencies; the authors propose that embarrassability be
   viewed in a broader cultural context that considers its functions as an

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that very low doses of gamma-rays have a genotoxic
   effect as measured by DNA single-strand breaks (ssbs). To test our
   hypothesis we used a newly developed alkaline microgel electrophoretic
   technique to quantitate DNA ssbs in freshly isolated human lymphocytes.
   An enhanced sensitivity to detect low levels of DNA damage was made
   possible by this method due to an additional step of DNA precipitation
   by ethanol in agarose microgels. We exposed lymphocytes from three
   subjects for 1 h at 4 degrees C to 740 MBq of technetium 99-m at a
   distance of 20 cm (0.25 mGy), 10 cm (1.02 mGy), and 5 cm (4.08 mGy) from
   the source vial. Doses of 1.02 and 4.08 mGy induced a significant
   dose-dependent increase in DNA ssbs in human lymphocytes from three
   subjects, each examined on three different days.}},

Abstract = {{We have conducted H2O-undersaturated melting experiments on charges
   consisting of a layer of a sillimanite-bearing metapelite and a layer of
   garnet-bearing amphibolite, with the goal of studying how layered
   metamorphic rocks interact during anatexis. Experiments with the layered
   charges were performed at 10 kbar (1 GPa) at 900 degrees C (334 h), 925
   degrees C (341 h), and 950 degrees C (50, 161, 332 h).
   Dehydration-melting of the amphibolite alone and of the pelite alone
   were studied at the same P-T conditions. When run alone at 900 degrees
   C, the pelite and the amphibolite yielded ca. 40 vol.\% and 15 vol.\%
   melt, respectively. Corresponding melt fractions at 950 degrees C were
   ca. 50 vol.\% and 30 vol.\%. When run side by side, melt abundance in
   the pelite is fairly uniform and ca. 20 vol.\% higher than in the solo
   runs at all temperatures studied. In contrast, complex zoning patterns
   parallel to the interface develop in the amphibolite layer. Far from the
   interface the melt fraction is 5-10 vol.\% lower than in the
   amphibolite-solo runs. Closer to the interface the melt fraction in the
   amphibolite layers are comparable to, or somewhat higher than, in the
   amphibolite-solo runs, and both clinopyroxene and plagioclase react-out
   and are replaced by orthopyroxene and quartz. Melt fraction closest to
   the interface reaches 65-70 vol.\%, and the only crystalline phase
   present is garnet with hollow cores. The increase in melt fraction in
   the pelite layers of the layered runs is caused by transfer of Na from
   the amphibolite to the pelite, which forces biotite to be eliminated at
   lower temperature along the biotite-garnet reaction boundary. K is
   transferred from the pelite to the amphibolite, and the lower melt
   fraction in the distal end of the amphibolite layers is caused by faster
   diffusion of Na compared to K, which results in a net depletion of
   alkalies. Ca is transferred from the amphibolite to the pelite, and the
   resulting changes in CaO concentrations affect the stabilities of
   plagioclase, pyroxenes, garnet and quartz and cause the observed zoning
   in the amphibolite layer. Ca entering the pelite layer induces
   crystallization of large plagioclase neoblasts radiating from the
   interface into the pelite layer. These results show that diffusion of
   components between contiguous lithologies undergoing anatexis can cause
   profound changes in phase relations, melt fractions and restite
   compositions.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A geometrical feature that is common to different magnetic confinement
   systems with optimized distribution of the modulus B is found. In these
   systems, the deviation of the drift trajectories of charged particles
   from the magnetic surfaces is minimum, and, correspondingly, the values
   of the secondary currents and neoclassical transport coefficients are
   minimum. Among these systems there are such well-known devices as
   axisymmetric tokamaks, quasi-symmetric stellarators {[}1-4], and
   `'orthogonal'' open magnetic confinement systems {[}5-7]. Their common
   feature is that the lengths of the segments of the force lines
   (belonging to the same magnetic surface) between any two contours of the
   constant magnetic field modulus on the magnetic surface are equal. On
   the basis of this geometrical feature, which is called the `'isometry
   condition,'' they can be correspondingly referred to as `'isometric''
   magnetic confinement systems. In the present paper, we derive equations
   for the plasma equilibrium, which can be used for and adequate
   description of hypothetical Isometric Magnetic Confinement Systems
   (IMCS). Our approach is based on a specific choice of the vectors B and
   {[}del B del psi] (instead of B and {[}B del psi]) as independent
   vectors on the magnetic surface psi = const. Note that this choice
   restricts the group of desired `'appropriate'' systems with an
   omnigenous magnetic-field geometry because the contours B = const should
   no have an `'island'' structure on the magnetic surface. The isometry
   conditions and the corresponding consequences are obtained both in an
   invariant vector form and in terms of the special flux coordinates.}},

Abstract = {{The active metabolite of vitamin D, calcitriol (1 alpha,25-(OH)(2)-D-3),
   suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene transcription. Although 1
   alpha,25-(OH)(2)D-3 is effective in suppressing secondary
   hyperparathyroidism (SH) in uremic patients, the mandatory use of large
   amounts of calcium salts to control serum phosphorus may preclude, in
   some patients, the use of ideal therapeutic doses of 1
   alpha,25-(OH)(2)D-3 because of hypercalcemia. We have studied a new
   analog of calcitriol, 19-nor-1 alpha,25-(OH)(2)D-2, that possesses low
   calcemic and phosphatemic activity. Uremic rats received vehicle, 1
   alpha,25-(OH)(2)D-3(2.0, 4.0, or 8.0 ng/rat) or 19-nor-1,25-(OH)(2)D-2
   (8.0, 25 or 75 ng/rat) intraperitoneally (IF) every other day for a
   period of 8 days. Pretreatment and posttreatment values of intact PTH
   were measured. The normal values for rat intact-PTH were 22 +/- 4.2
   pg/mL and for ionized calcium (ICa) 4.77 +/- .07 mg/dL. The only dose of
   1 alpha,25-(OH)(2)D-3 that achieved a significantly suppressed PTH (P <
   0.01) was the 8.0 ng/rat. PTH decreased from 202 +/- 31 to 90 +/- 20
   pg/mL. However, ICa increased from 4.81 +/- 0.08 to 5.08 mg/dL from
   uremic control (P < 0.02). Conversely, all doses of
   19-nor-1,25-(OH)(2)D-2 were effective in suppressing PTH, and none
   produced an elevation in ICa that was significantly different from that
   of vehicle-treated uremic rats. The maximum effect was achieved with the
   75 ng/rat dose, which decreased PTH from 193 +/- 49 to 53 +/- 16 pg/mL
   (a decrease in 72.5\%). In addition, 1 alpha,25-(OH)(2)D-3, at 8 ng/rat,
   induced an increase in serum phosphorus to 8.64 +/- 1.15 mg/dL compared
   with 5.57 +/- 0.50 mg/dL in the uremic controls, Conversely, the largest
   dose of 19-nor-1,25-(OH)(2)D-2 (75 ng) increased serum phosphorus to
   only 6.17 +/- 0.68 mg/dL. By the technique of reverse transcription
   polymerase chain reaction, it was found that 19-nor-1
   alpha,25-(OH)(2)D-2 caused a significant decrease in the amount of
   pre-pro PTH messenger RNA compared with the uremic control. These
   comparative studies demonstrate the advantage of the analog
   19-nor-1,25-(OH)(2)D-2 over its parent compound, 1 alpha,25-(OH)(2)D-3,
   in the suppression of PTH in the absence of hypercalcemia or
   hyperphosphatemia. From the clinical point of view, the significant
   suppressive effect on PTH secretion of this new analog without
   significant changes in ICa or serum phosphorus makes it an ideal toot
   for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in uremic patients.

Abstract = {{This study examined whether previously reported effects of altered
   prenatal sensory experience on subsequent acceleration of intersensory
   development in precocial birds are mediated by mechanisms sensitive to
   the overall amount of stimulation provided. Results revealed that
   bobwhite quail chicks exposed to substantially augmented amounts of
   prenatal visual stimulation show altered patterns of species-typical
   perceptual development. Specifically, chicks continued to respond to
   maternal auditory cues into later stages of postnatal development and
   failed to demonstrate responsiveness to maternal visual cues. Embryos
   also failed to demonstrate prenatal auditory learning of an individual
   maternal call, a behavior reliably seen in unmanipulated embryos. These
   findings suggest that substantially increased amounts of prenatal
   sensory stimulation can interfere with the emergence of species-typical
   patterns of postnatal intersensory functioning and lend support to the
   notion that sensory stimulation that falls within some optimal range
   maintains or facilitates normal patterns of perceptual development,
   whereas stimulation beyond the range of the species norm can result in
   intersensory interference. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a generalization of polynomial interpolation: given a
   continuous function over a rather general manifold, hyperinterpolation
   is a linear approximation that makes use of values off on a well chosen
   finite set. The approximation is a discrete least-squares approximation
   constructed with the aid of a high-order quadrature rule: the role of
   the quadrature rule is to approximate the Fourier coefficients off with
   respect to an orthonormal basis of the space of polynomials of degree
   less than or equal to n. The principal result is a generalization of the
   result of Erdos and Turan for classical interpolation at the zeros of
   orthogonal polynomials: for a rule of suitably high order (namely 2n or
   greater), the L(2) error of the approximation is shown to be within a
   constant factor of the error of best uniform approximation by
   polynomials of degree less than or equal to n. The L(2) error therefore
   converges to zero as the degree of the approximating polynomial
   approaches co. An example discussed in detail is the approximation of
   continuous functions on the sphere in R(s) by spherical polynomials. In
   this case the number of quadrature points must exceed the number of
   degrees of freedom if n > 2 and s greater than or equal to 3. In such a
   situation the classical interpolation property cannot hold, whereas
   satisfactory hyperinterpolation approximations do exist. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Evidence for a requirement for CO2 in the productive metabolism of
   aliphatic alkenes and epoxides by the propylene-oxidizing bacterium
   Xanthobacter strain Py2 is presented, In the absence of CO2, whole cell
   suspensions of propylene-grown cells catalyzed the isomerization of
   propylene oxide (epoxypropane) to acetone, In the presence of CO2, no
   acetone was produced. Acetone was not metabolized by suspensions of
   propylene-grown cells, in either the absence or presence of CO2. The
   degradation of propylene and propylene oxide by propylene-grown cells
   supported the fixation of (CO2)-C-14 into cell material, and the time
   course of C-14 fixation correlated with the time course of propylene and
   propylene oxide degradation. The degradation of glucose and
   propionaldehyde by propylene-grown or glucose-grown cells did not
   support significant (CO2)-C-14 fixation. With propylene oxide as the
   substrate, the concentration dependence of (CO2)-C-14 fixation exhibited
   saturation kinetics, and at saturation, 0.9 mol of CO2 was fixed per mol
   of propylene oxide consumed. Cultures grown with propylene in a
   nitrogen-deficient medium supplemented with (NaHCO3)-C-13 specifically
   incorporated C-13 label into the C-1 (major labeled position) and C-3
   (minor labeled position) carbon atoms of the endogenous storage compound
   poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate. No specific label incorporation was observed
   when cells were cultured with glucose or n-propanol as a carbon source,
   The depletion of CO2 from cultures grown with propylene, but not glucose
   or n-propanol, inhibited bacterial growth. We propose that propylene
   oxide metabolism in Xanthobacter strain Py2 proceeds by terminal
   carboxylation of an isomerization intermediate, which, in the absence of
   CO2, is released as acetone.}},

Abstract = {{The yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, expresses a gene, Apyrase
   (Apy), that encodes an ATP-diphosphohydrolase The product of this gene
   is a secreted enzyme that facilitates hematophagy by preventing platelet
   aggregation in the host. Apy gene expression is limited to the cells of
   the distal-lateral and medial lobes of the adult female salivary glands.
   Apyrase protein levels, detectable by antibodies, peak in the salivary
   glands about 4 days after adult emergence and remain high after a blood
   meal. Primary sequence analysis of a genomic clone encoding apyrase
   reveals a unique TAAATA sequence and seven introns, as well as other
   conserved features of eukaryotic genes. The temporal, sex- and
   tissue-specific expression of the Apy gene is consistent with its role
   as encoding a platelet anti-aggregation factor that functions to
   facilitate hematophagy and decrease probing time. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{In November of 1895 Wilhelm C. Rontgen observed fluorescence caused by
   invisible rays emanating from a discharge tube. This discovery of x rays
   was not a mere happenstance; Rontgen was a highly skilled
   experimentalist, well prepared to launch a series of clever experiments
   and startle the world with the announcement of `'a new kind of ray.''
   The practice of medicine was transformed, and the era of modem physics
   inaugurated. X rays have proven essential to the probing of atomic,
   molecular, and solid-state structures. X-ray astronomy has revealed some
   of the most exotic and violent phenomena in the universe, including the
   black holes. X-ray microscopy provides information complementary to what
   is; obtainable from optical and electron microscopies. In micro- and
   nanolithography x rays provide high quality aerial images and simple
   processing, in part because of an absence of spurious scattering,
   something that Rontgen himself observed. However, application in
   ultralarge scale integrated (ULSI) manufacturing is still uncertain for
   a variety of reasons, primarily because ultraviolet optical-projection
   lithography continues to satisfy commercial needs. X-ray lithography may
   find application in areas outside the ULSI industry, for example in
   optoelectronics, flat-panel displays, and magnetic data storage. It has
   the intrinsic resolution to reach the practical limits of the
   lithographic process, around 20 nm. However, to approach this limit
   diffraction blurring must be avoided by reducing the mask-sample gap
   below 5 mu m, which may not be acceptable in manufacturing. In this
   event, and in order to retain the lithographic qualities of 1 nm
   wavelength radiation, projection with Fresnel zone plate arrays could be
   employed. (C) 1995 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: To assess the range of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP)
   in patients presenting with community-acquired pneumonia and to compare
   the serial changes of this acute-phase protein with clinical outcome.
   Design: Prospective hospital-based study, including separate
   retrospective case series.
   Patients: Twenty-eight consecutive patients (mean age, 60 years)
   admitted to our hospital with community-acquired pneumonia were studied.
   Serial daily plasma samples were taken and assayed for CRP, tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), Clinical
   parameters, laboratory data, and response to treatment were recorded.
   Four other patients considered to be antibiotic failures (three
   empyemas, one death) were studied separately.
   Results: Two patients died. Of those who survived, mean (+/-SD) CRP
   values for days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were as follows: 136+/-43, 96+/-44,
   53+/-36, 54+/-43, and 44+/-31 mg/L. CRP levels on day 1 in patients who
   had received antibiotics prior to hospital admission were significantly
   lower than those who had not, 107+/-42 and 152+/-44 mg/L (p<0.05). CRP
   levels did not correlate with other laboratory parameters or with
   recognized predictors of mortality, A CRP value that continued to rise
   despite antibiotic treatment was associated with infective complications
   or death, Only 52\% of patients had detectable TNF-alpha and 24\%
   detectable IL-6 at some point during their hospital stay.
   Conclusions: CRP is a sensitive marker of pneumonia, A persistently high
   or rising CRP level suggests antibiotic treatment failure or the
   development of an infective complication, These results suggest that
   CRP, rather than TNF-alpha or IL-6, may have a role as a clinical marker
   in pneumonia.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi of the genus Trichoderma are recognized as `'keystone or
   controller'' organisms in forest soils due to their involvement in
   decomposition and nutrient cycling and their regulation of associated
   mycoflora, Recent evidence has identified additional potential
   importance in the decomposition of xenobiotics, Both T. harzianum and T.
   viride have been shown capable of organochlorine degradation in vitro.
   During the 1990 growing season soil immersion tubes were employed to
   sample Trichoderma species growing in the forest floors of the Hubbard
   Brook Experimental Forest and of near-by Mount Moosilauke in New
   Hampshire, At Hubbard Brook, sample sites included a mature forest (100
   Sears old) and a regenerating forest (5 years old), On Mount Moosilauke,
   sample sites included haplorthod and cryofolist soil types and low,
   medium, and high elevation, T. harzianum was isolated from both sites in
   relatively high amount, T. viride was also present at both sites but in
   relatively low amount, T. polysporum was consistently isolated at all
   elevations but in relatively low amount, The abundance of T. harzianum
   decreased with increasing elevation, while the abundance of T. viride
   increased with increasing elevation, The evidence presented is
   consistent with other studies stressing the high spatial variability of
   members of this genus, Causes of this variability are presumed to be
   numerous and involve abiotic and biotic forces, Persistence of
   organochlorine contaminants in northern forest soils may be influenced
   by the abundance of fungal degraders such as T. harzianum and viride.

Abstract = {{It has been observed that the band texture of thermotropic liquid
   crystalline polymers (LCPs) is formed at the shearing temperature during
   the relaxation of shear. The band spacing increases with increasing
   shearing temperature between T-m and T-i, but is independent of shearing
   rate within the range of our experiments. The angle of zigzag
   orientation of the molecular chain fibrils with respect to the direction
   of shear is independent of the shearing temperature. The relaxation rate
   of the shear-induced band texture depends on the width of the bands
   formed. The wider the band spacing is, the slower the relaxation. When
   specimens with shear-induced bands of different spacings are annealed at
   a certain temperature for 10 min, they are all converted to a new band
   texture of the same spacing of around 1 mu m. These bands with a small
   spacing generated during cooling are termed the solidification-induced
   band texture. When the specimen with shear-induced bands is annealed for
   a short time, so that the bands have not relaxed, and is then quenched,
   solidification-induced bands with a smaller spacing than the original
   bands appear. In this way, both shear-induced and solidification-induced
   bands could be seen in the same polarizing micrograph. The
   solidification-induced bands could be used as a kind of decoration to
   show that the chain orientation field follows the changes during
   relaxation of a shear-induced texture, at a given temperature, into
   walls, loops and sinusoidal wave textures which eventually relax to a
   thread texture.}},

Abstract = {{We report the genetic abnormalities in the protein C genes of a Spanish
   child with neonatal purpura fulminans and disseminated intravascular
   coagulation, associated with undetectable protein C levels. Direct
   sequencing of the nine protein C gene exons and their splice junctions
   indicated that the proband is a compound heterozygote with two mutant
   protein C gene alleles, Y124C and Q132X, that do not express protein C
   in plasma. The Y124C mutation was inherited from the mother and is due
   to a novel A to G transition at nucleotide 3416, which results in the
   substitution of cysteine for tyrosine 124, a highly conserved amino acid
   in EGF-like domains. The paternal inherited. mutation (Q132X) is a C to
   T transition at nucleotide 3439, which replaces glutamine 132 with a
   Stop codon signal. This mutation, if expressed, should result in the
   synthesis of a truncated protein of 131 amino acids. Y124C or Q132X are
   present in the heterozygous state in the asymptomatic parents and
   siblings of the proband, all of which have half the normal plasma levels
   of protein C. Q123X has also been identified in families where type I PC
   deficiency is inherited as a clinically dominant trait. Therefore, the
   presence of the same mutation in a family showing a clinically recessive
   pattern of inheritance indicates that other factors, apart from the type
   of protein C gene mutation, are responsible for the clinical expression
   of protein C deficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A full-length cDNA for a novel isoform of the human receptor tyrosine
   phosphatase gamma gene (PTPRG) was overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells,
   and the gene product, PTP gamma, was purified and characterized. The
   protein was expressed as a M(r) similar to 185,000 protein accompanied
   by a M(r) similar to 120,000 putative cleavage product on SDS-PAGE
   analysis. The protein undergoes N-linked glycosylation and constitutive
   phosphorylation of serine residues. When assayed for tyrosine-specific
   phosphatase activity, PTP gamma dephosphorylated myelin basic protein at
   a pH optimum of 7.5 and a K-m of 12.6 mu M; reduced
   carboxyamidomethylated and maleylated lysozyme (RCM-lysozyme) at a pH
   optimum of 6.0 and a K-m of 12 mu M; and p-nitrophenylphosphate with a
   pH optimum of 5.5 and a K-m of 3.5 mM. Phosphatase activity was
   inhibited by ZnCl2 and sodium orthovanadate; Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ ions
   were ineffective. The partially purified form of the enzyme was
   allosterically activated by triphosphorylated nucleosides, with a
   preference for purines. This activation was prevented by Mg2+ addition
   and did not occur when a purified form of the enzyme was utilized,
   suggesting that its activation depends on specific activating factors or
   conformational constraints. Interestingly, PTP gamma protein was
   specifically bound by an ATP-agarose matrix through its intracellular
   domain, suggesting a link between binding of nucleotides and activation
   of the phosphatase.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: It is not known whether intentional delay to allow fetal
   maturity in patients with Stage I cervical carcinoma diagnosed during
   pregnancy will affect the survival of these patients, The purpose of
   this study is to report our experience with invasive squamous cervical
   carcinoma after planned delay in therapy for fetal indications, to
   assess maternal morbidity due to treatment delay, and to report maternal
   and fetal survival, Methods: Between 1989 and 1994, eight pregnant women
   with Stage I squamous cervical carcinoma, who declined immediate therapy
   in order to improve fetal outcome, were prospectively followed until the
   late third trimester, Serial MRIs were used to follow the lesion in two
   patients. Results: Stage IB cervical cancer was diagnosed in seven
   pregnant women, All lesions were less than 2.5 cm, The mean
   diagnosis-to-treatment interval was 109 days (range, 21-201; median,
   112), One woman conceived in the cycle after diagnosis and had a
   diagnosis-to-treatment interval of 282 days. All were delivered by
   cesarean section-radical hysterectomy late in the third trimester, There
   was no clinical progression of disease detected during any of the
   pregnancies, Serial MRI examination confirmed stable disease in one
   patient and suggested an increase in tumor volume in one patient that
   was not pathologically confirmed, All are alive and disease free after a
   mean follow-up of 37 months (range, 13-68; median, 33), Neonatal
   morbidity was encountered in one infant (spontaneous pneumothorax),
   Conclusions: With a median follow-up of 33 months, patient-requested
   delays in therapy between 3 and 40 weeks (mean, 19) did not affect
   progression. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed analysis of the pulses generated with a multiple quantum well
   (MQW) electroabsorption (EA) modulator used as a soliton source is
   performed, The pulse temporal and spectral shape are simulated and a
   good agreement is obtained with the experimental results, An irregular
   holed spectrum shape is observed under certain operating conditions and
   its existence is attributed to parasitic phase modulation, This type of
   spectrum could be observed even for pulses having a time bandwidth tau
   Delta nu product below 0.4 which makes them usually considered as nearly
   transform limited, However it is not the case. The influence of the
   pulse spectral shape on transmission performances is investigated by
   means of a realistic simulation of soliton pulse propagation at 10 Gb/s,
   It is shown that for 9000 km propagation distance and for pulses
   presenting this irregular spectral shape a signal degradation occurs as
   the timing jitter is above 10 ps and the quality factor Q is below 2,
   which results in an increase of the transmission bit error rate, In
   order to avoid the generation of this kind of pulses when operating a
   MQW modulator as a soliton source, a mapping is realized giving the
   adequate voltages to apply to the diode for acceptable soliton
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of different bands of contralaterally presented noise at low
   and moderate intensities on stimulus frequency otoacoustic emissions
   (SFOAE) from human ears is examined. A SFOAE evoked by a continuous
   stimulus tone and suppressed by a second tone to produce an SFOAE
   residual was chosen as the probe to determine the effect of the efferent
   input. At low levels of contralateral noise, a band centred on the
   ipsilateral stimulus frequency was the most effective suppressor of the
   SFOAE residual. For higher levels of the contralateral stimulus, noise
   bands containing higher frequency components produced most reductions in
   the SFOAE residual. Small changes in the phase of the SFOAE residual
   during the contralateral noise were also recorded. Increases in the
   SFOAE residual onset latency were also found to be small, being around 1
   ms. In some cases increases in the level of the SFOAE residual produced
   by low-frequency suppressors were recorded during the contralateral
   noise presentation. The results are discussed in the context of current
   knowledge of the functioning of the auditory efferent innervation, and
   it is suggested that the method of evoking SFOAEs presents a viable
   method for determining the effect of efferent stimulation on cochlear
   mechanics which also allows possible artifact contamination to be
   readily identified.}},

Abstract = {{Two genes, c-ErbA alpha and c-ErbA beta, generate at least three
   functional T-3 receptor (TR) isoforms in the rat: TR alpha-1, TR beta-1,
   and TR beta-2. The latter is an N-terminal splice variant of TR beta-1
   whose expression is high in the pituitary gland, whereas the other
   isoforms are more widely expressed. It is believed that TR beta-2 might
   play an important role in the pituitary, but no specific biological
   activities have been defined. Using in vitro translated receptors, we
   were unable to detect striking isoform-specific differences in T-3
   binding, DNA binding, and homodimerization and heterodimerization
   activities with retinoid X receptor in the electrophoretic mobility
   assay, or T-3-dependent repression and activation of basal transcription
   in transfection assays. The N-terminus of TR beta is completely
   dispensible for these activities. However, we found that unliganded TR
   alpha-1 and TR beta-1, but not TR beta-2, can repress glucocorticoid
   receptor-mediated transcriptional activation if the reporter gene
   promoter contains binding sites for both receptor species. TR beta-2
   also synergizes most efficiently with the glucocorticoid receptor in the
   presence of T-3. The TR beta-2-specific N-terminus is required for these
   effects. This result indicates that the relative abundance of specific
   TR isoforms may determine the quantitative response of a gene that is
   regulated by T-3 and glucocorticoids. In particular, pituitary TR beta-2
   may be an important mediator of GH gene expression, which is regulated
   by both of these hormones.}},

Abstract = {{With regard to the safety of production and use of textile clothings, in
   addition to occupational and environmental aspects, consumers health
   protection has to be considered. Regularly, only scarce information is
   available about the migration of textile finishes and dyes from fabrics.
   Therefore, the exposition of consumers can only be roughly estimated.
   Since 1992 the working group `'textiles'' oft, the German Federal
   Institute of Consumers Health Protection and Veterinary Medicine (BgVV)
   in Berlin is engaged to improve the toxicological evaluation of textile
   clothings. In this context, some basic principles of consumers health
   protection with regard to textile clothings are discussed. In addition,
   the toxicological literature is compiled, especially regarding
   allergenicity of some textile finishes, auxiliaries and dyes. Specic
   topics are formaldehyde, glyoxal, carrier substances, name retardants as
   well as some possibly harmful azo dyes. Furthermore some analytical
   methods for the determination of the respective substances have been
   collected from the literature.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the relative effectiveness of EMG biofeedback,
   applied relaxation training and a combined procedure in the management
   of chronic, upper extremity cumulative trauma disorder. Forty-eight
   patients with a history of about 5-6 years of upper extremity pain were
   randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment conditions, namely applied
   relaxation training, EMG biofeedback, a combined approach or a wait-list
   control. Treatments were conducted on an individual basis, twice per
   week for 4 weeks. Patients in all 3 treatment conditions showed
   significant short-term reductions in pain and psychopathology in
   comparison to the wait-list group who showed minimal change. Six-month
   follow-up data were obtained for patients in the treatment conditions,
   but not the wait-list group. There was some evidence of relapse on
   measures of depression, anxiety and pain beliefs for treated patients
   during the 6-month follow-up period, although measures remained
   significantly below pre-treatment levels for most outcome indices.
   Self-monitored pain continued to decrease for the treatment groups
   through follow-up. Contrary to predictions, however, the strongest
   short-term treatment benefits were shown by patients receiving applied
   relaxation training on measures of pain, distress, interference in daily
   living, depression and anxiety. By 6-month follow-up, differences
   between treatment groups were no longer evident.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1985, fish pathologists at Cornell University have studied lesions

   necropsies on over 400 brown bullheads and histologic examinations of
   the major organs of over 370 of these fish. In the course of our
   histologic studies, we observed islands of well-differentiated
   hepatocytes in the spleens of neoplasm-free brown bullheads from 2 of
   the 37 diverse lakes, rivers, and ponds that we sampled. The splenic
   hepatocyte islands occurred in 11-100\% of fish from the 2 affected
   sites, with 1-50 hepatocyte clusters per section of spleen. Hepatocyte
   islands measured up to 1 mm in diameter. Unlike the metastases of
   hepatocellular carcinomas, which we have described elsewhere in this
   issue (9), these islands of hepatocytes in the spleens of neoplasm-free
   fish were not evident grossly. These hepatocyte clusters in the spleen
   of certain populations of brown bullheads may lead to confusion in
   studies of neoplasia in brown bullheads. Caution is advised in

Abstract = {{12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences from a suite of mammalian taxa
   (13 placentals, 4 marsupials, 1 monotreme), for which phylogenetic
   relationships are well established based on independent criteria, were
   employed to study the evolution of this gene. Phylogenetic analysis of
   12S sequences produces a phylogeny that agrees with expectations. Base
   composition provides evidence for directional symmetrical substitution
   pressure in loops; in stems, base composition is much more even. Rates
   of nucleotide substitution are lower in stems than loops. Patterns of
   nucleotide substitution show an overall preference for transitions over
   transversions, with this difference more profound in stems than loops.
   Among different transversion pathways, there is a wide range of
   transformation frequencies. An analysis of compensatory substitutions
   shows that there is strong evidence for their occurrence and that a
   weighting factor of 0.61 should be applied in phylogenetic analyses to
   account for the dependence of mutations at stem positions relative to
   positions where changes are independent. Among stem variables (i.e.,
   stem length, interaction distance, substitution rates, G+C content, and
   the percentage of bases that are paired), several significant
   correlations were discovered, but stem length and interaction distance
   are uncorrelated with other variables.}},

   and underwent immediate ilioinguinal node dissection. Of the 27 (75\%)
   patients who presented with negative groin lymph nodes, 10 had a delayed
   lymph node dissection. Four of these patients are alive at 3.7 years.
   Three died within 1 year of surgery and 3 are lost to follow-up.
   Seventeen patients (47\%) did not require lymphadenectomy and 14 (82\%)
   of these patients are alive at 3.8 years, the other 3 being lost to
   follow-up. Conclusions. A careful, closely monitored, follow-up protocol
   can eliminate the need for lymphadenectomy in select patients with

   actual data obtained from a power system for 24-hour ahead prediction
   based on forecast weather information. Very impressive results, with an
   average error of 0.62\% on weekdays, 0.83\% on Saturdays and 1.17\% on

Abstract = {{Samples of cervical spinal cord and four anatomical regions of the

   scrapie-associated fibrils by a centrifugal extraction technique and by
   a touch-grid technique. The touch-grid technique was no better than the
   centrifugal extraction technique for the detection of fibrils.
   Structures which could have been classified as tubulofilaments were
   detected in touch-grid preparations without detergent treatment. With
   the centrifugal extraction technique there was a significant reduction
   of the fibril scores in some of the tissue extracts stored at -20
   degrees C, but not in any of the extracts stored at 4 degrees C. There
   was, however, a reduction in the fibril scores when the final extracted
   pellets were stored at 4 degrees C. The stability of the fibrils on the
   test grids was unaffected by six months storage at room temperature but
   the clarity of their ultrastructure did deteriorate. Poor hydrophilic
   spread of the sample on the test grids did not have a significant effect

Abstract = {{The bandwidth limitations of multimedia systems force trade-offs between
   presentation-data fidelity and real-time performance. For example,
   digital video is commonly encoded with lossy compression to reduce
   bandwidth, and frames may be skipped during playback to maintain
   synchronization. These trade-offs depend on device performance and
   physical data representations that are hidden by a database system. If a
   multimedia database is to support digital video and other continuous
   media data types, we argue that the database should provide a
   quality-of-service (QOS) interface to allow application control of
   presentation timing and information-loss trade-offs. This paper proposes
   a data model for continuous media that preserves device and physical
   data independence. We show how to define formal QOS constraints from a
   specification of ideal presentation outputs. Our definition enables
   meaningful requests for end-to-end service guarantees, while leaving the
   database system free to optimize resource management. We propose one set
   of QOS parameters that constitute a complete model for presentation
   error, and we show how this error model extends the opportunities for
   resource optimization.}},

Title = {{THE INCIDENCE OF NEUROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING AXILLARY
   BRACHIAL-PLEXUS BLOCK USING A TRANSARTERIAL APPROACH - A

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives. The present study was performed at the
   Crystal Clinic Surgery Center, an outpatient free-standing surgicenter
   specializing in orthopedic surgery, to determine the incidence of both
   neurologic and vascular sequelae associated with exclusive use of a
   transarterial approach to axillary brachial plexus block in order to
   assess the technique's safety and efficacy. Methods. The prospective
   consecutive study involved 1,000 adult patients scheduled for surgery
   using axillary brachial plexus block. The transarterial approach was
   performed on all patients using a medium-bevel 24-gauge Jelco 1-5-inch
   needle. Data tabulated included the incidence of neurovascular
   complications and the outcome of successful axillary brachial plexus
   anesthesia. Results. Two patients presented with a sensory paresthesia
   (0.2\%) in the distribution of the ulnar nerve and the musculocutaneous
   nerve that most likely occurred during supplementation of an incomplete
   block. Three patients presented with upper-arm myalgias (0.3\%) related
   to tourniquet injury. After the operation, two patients developed reflex
   sympathetic dystrophy, which responded to stellate ganglion blocks.
   Vascular complications, including transient arterial spasm in 10 of 996
   (1\%), unintentional intravascular injection in 2 of 996 (0.2\%), and
   small (0-2 an) hematoma formation in 2 of 996 (0.2\%), were recognized
   but did not require any intervention other than close observation. The
   study revealed a complete block in 88.8\% of cases, an incomplete block
   requiring supplemental local anesthesia in 10\% of cases, and a complete
   block failure in 1.2\%. Conclusions. This study demonstrated the safety
   and efficacy of the transarterial technique in achieving brachial plexus
   block.}},

Abstract = {{The tyrosine kinase domains of the insulin and insulin-like growth
   factor I (IGF-I) receptors play an essential role in signal
   transduction. After ligand binding, these receptors undergo
   autophosphorylation, with a cluster of three tyrosines (residues 1131,
   1135, and 1136 in the IGF-I receptor) being the first to be
   phosphorylated. Mutation of the ATP-binding site or substitution of this
   triple tyrosine cluster in the catalytic domain blocks essentially all
   of the functions of these receptors. Using stably transfected NIH-3T3
   cell lines, we studied the effect of a mutation of tyrosine 1131 of the
   triple tyrosine cluster of the IGF-I receptor to phenylalanine. This
   mutation significantly reduced IGF-I-induced beta-subunit
   autophosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate
   IRS-1 was unaffected. Despite the reduction in autophosphorylation and
   receptor internalization, IGF-I-induced thymidine incorporation and
   cellular proliferation were unaffected. Thus, the extent of receptor
   autophosphorylation and internalization does not appear to be a limiting
   factor for IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis.}},

Journal = {{NEW ENGLAND ECONOMIC REVIEW}},
Year = {{1995}},
Pages = {{13+}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The personal computer market underwent significant structural changes
   throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. While some manufacturers of
   personal computers managed to remain in the market for a number of
   years, many others left after a short time. Besides the more visible
   movement of firms in and out of the industry, each firm also made
   underlying decisions regarding which models to offer.
   This article analyzes model selection strategies adopted by personal
   computer (PC) companies from 1976 to 1988, focusing on differences
   between established and new firms. While new firms were more likely to
   produce models with similar characteristics, established firms offered a
   larger variety of models. With such model `'dispersion'' strategies,
   they avoided replacing their existing models and occupied new,
   top-of-the-line market segments before entrants. High-priced models,
   controlling for their technical attributes and brand effects, were more
   likely to leave the market. Brand effects were also significant in
   affecting PC models' probability of exit. Models produced by firms with
   more experience, both in years and in the number of models produced in
   the past, were more likely to survive longer.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum mechanical ab initio calculations using relativistic effective
   core potentials for tungsten are reported for isomers of WF4(Si2H2) and
   WF4(CSiH2). The geometries are optimized at the Hartree-Fock level, and
   the metal-ligand bond energies are calculated at MP2 and CCSD(T) using
   valence basis sets of DZP quality. Four energy minimum structures are
   predicted for WF4(Si2H2). The energetically lowest lying isomer is the
   disilaacetylene complex C4. Structure C4 is 10.1 kcal/mol lower in
   energy than Cia, which has the most stable doubly bridged Si2H2 form as
   a side-on bonded ligand. Two other isomeric forms C1b and C2 are clearly
   higher in energy. Three energy minimum structures are predicted for the
   WF4(CSiH2) complex. The global energy minimum is the silavinylidene
   complex C7, which has a very short and strong W-C double bond. The
   silaacetylene complex C9 is 9.9 kcal/mol higher in energy. The third
   isomer is the silylidene complex C8, which is 33.2 kcal/mol less stable
   than C7. The electronic structure of the complexes is analyzed using the
   NBO partitioning scheme and the topological analysis of the electron
   density distribution. The results show that the polarization of the W-Si
   bonds can be quite different among different molecules and that it is
   very different from related complexes with W-C bonds. The W-Si bonds are
   more polarized toward the tungsten atom.}},

Abstract = {{Multichannel seismic reflection data gathered by the petroleum industry,
   offshore of western Newfoundland, constrain the absolute thicknesses of
   the Middle Ordovician and post-Middle Ordovician portions of the
   Anticosti foreland basin immediately adjacent to the Appalachian
   structural front. These seismic lines, which include 1970s-vintage data
   in the public domain, and recently acquired proprietary data, indicate
   that the Middle Ordovician (''Taconian'') portion of the foreland basin
   is more than an order of magnitude thinner than the preserved
   post-Middle Ordovician (''Salinian-Acadian'') portion. The mechanical
   lithospheric coupling of foreland basins and their adjacent overthrust
   belts is a well-understood phenomenon. A thin Taconian foreland
   succession and a thick Salinian-Acadian succession imply that the
   overthrust loads responsible for flexural depression of the Anticosti
   basin were much more distant and/or much smaller during the Middle
   Ordovician Taconian orogeny than they are today. We quantify this
   qualitative conclusion to first-order using a two-dimensional,
   nonuniform, thin elastic plate formulation to model lithospheric
   flexure. Our approach constrains (1) the position of Taconian overthrust
   loads at the end of the Taconian orogeny, and (2) the palinspastic
   location of the Cambro-Ordovician passive margin hinge line. Acceptable
   solutions require development of a significant (similar to 300 m-high)
   peripheral bulge in early Late Ordovician time and suggest that the toe
   of the Taconian overthrust wedge was many tens to perhaps 100 km or more
   from its present position at the end of the Taconian orogeny.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with measurements of the anisotropic part of the
   azimuthal component of the ion velocity distribution function by means
   of a singly gridded ion energy analyser. The experiments are performed
   at a magnetised plasma column in order to investigate the dependency of
   the E x B-rotation velocity of the plasma on the radius. The ion
   velocity distribution function is determined from the numerically
   differentiated current voltage characteristics of an ion energy
   analyser. The anisotropic part of the distribution function is found to
   be proportional to the normalised difference of the derivatives of a
   pair of characteristics, recorded in up- and downstream direction with
   respect to the local rotation velocity. The experimental data indicate
   an ion velocity distribution function, which closely resembles a
   Maxwellian in a frame moving with the plasma rotation velocity. The
   measured anisotropic part of the ion velocity distribution function is
   evaluated applying a procedure that treats the thermal and rotation
   velocities of the ions as free parameters of a (non-linear) model
   function and fits them to the experimental data in the ion retarding
   regime of the characteristics. Furthermore it is shown that in the
   presence of a moving plasma only the difference of the derivatives of a
   pair of characteristics indicates the plasma potential. Thus the local
   radial electric field can be determined and indeed is used to calculate
   the dependency of the E x B-rotation velocity on the plasma radius.
   These calculated E x B-rotation velocities agree with those measured by
   an ion energy analyser within the range of experimental uncertainties,
   indicating minor influence of the ion pressure gradient on the rotation
   of the plasma column studied.}},

   the activation energy for rotational diffusion of 16-SASL was

   indicated a more rigid nature of protein body membrane comparing to

   STUDY DESIGN: Cervical samples from 520 women were assayed for human
   papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic add with both the Hybrid Capture test
   and polymerase chain reaction.
   RESULTS: Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was detected with
   Hybrid Capture in 106 (42\%) of 254 samples from women with no evidence
   of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 211 (79\%) of 266 with
   cervical intraepithelial lesions or cervical cancer. There was a good
   correlation between Hybrid Capture and polymerase chain reaction. Hybrid
   Capture correctly identified 92\% of samples found to contain a human
   papillomavirus type with a high or intermediate oncogenic risk with
   polymerase chain reaction. Although Hybrid Capture can quantify the
   amount of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid present in a
   sample, no correlation was observed between the relative amount of human
   papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid detected with Hybrid Capture and
   the grade of cervical lesion.
   CONCLUSION: The Hybrid Capture test is a sensitive and accurate method
   for identifying human papillomavirus types of high and intermediate
   oncogenic risk in clinical specimens.}},

Abstract = {{By utilizing myosin immunostaining, we were able to identify early rat
   myocardium as a thin epithelial sheet and realized that its cohesive
   movement toward the midline leads to the straight heart tube formation.
   Localization study of fibronectin mRNA and protein was, therefore,
   carried out to investigate its tissue origin and possible roles in
   facilitating mesoderm migration and heart formation, Fibronectin mRNAs
   were first detected throughout the mesoderm during the early primitive
   streak stage, suggesting that the mesoderm is the source of fibronectin.
   By pre-head fold (pre-somite) and head fold (early somite) stages, the
   mesoderm became largely down-regulated for fibronectin mRNAs, while it
   was also at these stages when myosin-positive myocardium formed itself
   into the epithelium and was subsequently folding toward the midline,
   Thus, there appears to be little fibronectin synthesis during and
   directly relevant to early heart tube formation, Later, during the early
   straight heart tube stage (5 somite and older), endocardium became
   highly positive for fibronectin mRNAs, suggesting that the endocardium
   is the major source of fibronectin for the cardiac jelly. Based on the
   results, we present a map for the early mammalian heart in which the
   heart is a single crescentic band lying in front of the prechordal
   plate. We also suggest a process for heart tube formation based on the
   cohesive movement of the myocardial epithelium, During heart tube
   formation, fibronectin protein had been deposited previously by the
   mesoderm and was found uniformly in the ECM and not newly produced by
   any adjacent tissue. The data contradict the endodermal guidance of
   heart migration by fibronectin gradient and suggest, instead, a
   permissive role for the fibronectin substrate. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   respectively, V-th1 is a function of the gate oxide thickness to(x) and
   SOI thickness t(Si) and is about 0.25 V when to(x)/t(Si) = 5, while
   V-th2 is insensitive to to(x) and t(Si) and is about 1 V. We also derive
   models for conduction charge and drain current and verified their
   validity by numerical analysis, Furthermore, we establish a scaling
   theory unique to the de,ice, and show how to design the device
   parameters with decreasing a gate length, We show numerically that we
   can design sub 0.1 mu m gate length devices with an appropriate
   threshold voltage and an ideal subthreshold suing, We also show that our
   theory agrees well with experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{A promising new therapeutic modality for skin cancer, administration of
   the heme precursor 5-aminoleyulinic acid followed by light irradiation,
   is known as photodynamic therapy. Photofrin, the only clinically
   approved sensitizer, has an absorption maximum at 630 nm, the wavelength
   used in most experimental and clinical trials with 5-aminolevulinic
   acid, We investigated photodynamic efficacy of irradiation with coherent
   light at wavelengths ranging from 622 to 649 nm in vitro and in vivo as
   well as the content and distribution of intracellular porphyrin after
   administration of Ei-aminolevulinic acid.
   HaCaT immortalized human keratinocytes were sensitized with 30 mu g/ml
   5-aminolevulinic acid for 24 h in vitro. By cell viability determined
   with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
   assay, the best cell-killing effects were observed after irradiation at
   635 nm, Using an amelanotic melanoma (A-Mel-3) grown subcutaneously in
   Syrian Golden hamsters, we confirmed these results in vivo: tumor growth
   was markedly delayed in animals treated with 100 mg/kg 5-aminolevulinic
   acid intravenously and irradiated with coherent light at 635 nm as
   compared to animals irradiated at 630 nm, This photodynamic effect is
   probably mediated by large amounts of the photosensitizing porphyrin,
   protoporphyrin IX, localized in cell membranes as visualized by confocal
   laser scan microscopy and as determined by high pressure liquid
   chromatography in vitro. The results suggest that irradiation at 635 mm
   with a coherent light source is more effective than irradiation at 630
   nm for photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid.}},

Abstract = {{A complete hydrodynamic furrow irrigation model (TRIDISUL) with
   two-dimensional infiltration is presented and applied to blocked
   furrows.
   Richards' equation in its two-dimensional form is used to quantify the
   infiltrated volume in all sections along the furrow. To this equation an
   implicit method is used and the system of equations is solved with the
   Gauss-Seidel method.
   Saint Venant equations are solved using the Newton-Raphson method and
   the double sweep algorithm.
   This model allows the simulation of the interactions between the height
   of the water above the furrow bed and soil water movement during the
   advance, supply, recession and redistribution phases, It can give
   information on the position of the wetting front in the soil through
   time, allowing the quantification of the water stored in the root zone.
   It is therefore possible to choose the best inflow discharge, spacing
   between furrows and furrow shape to obtain the best irrigation
   efficiency,}},

   microstructure. Similar integration was observed with the fat
   substitute, the particles of which (0.1-3 mu m in diameter) were found
   to be parts of the casein micelle chains or spanned adjacent chains.
   These chains were found to be somewhat shorter (no statistical
   assessment was carried out) in the yogurts made with the fat substitute

Abstract = {{Balloon test occlusion (BTO) of the internal carotid artery (ICA)
   combined with cerebral blood flow (CBF) study has proved to be a
   sensitive test for prediction of the outcome of permanent vessel
   occlusion, In this study, we evaluated the acute changes in regional CBF
   during BTO under hypotension in order to examine the possible risk of
   cerebral ischaemia after surgical treatment. Eleven patients in whom
   surgical carotid sacrifice was planned underwent BTO combined with CBF
   studies using technetium-99m hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime
   single-photon emission tomography under hypotension by decreasing the
   systemic blood pressure by about 50 mm Hg using a ganglion blocking
   agent, All patients showed a mild to severe decrease in CBF in the
   ipsilateral ICA territory relative to the contralateral side. A decrease
   in CBF of greater than 20\% was observed in nine patients (82\%), and
   two of them showed a decrease exceeding 40\%, However, no ischaemic
   symptoms were demonstrated during scanning with hypotensive BTO. Our
   results suggest that in many patients with negative normotensive BTO, a
   considerable reduction in CBF would occur during hypotension, This
   procedure may predict a possible risk of hypotensive accident during
   and/or after surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The water-soluble gold preparation aurothiomalate, which contains gold
   as Au(I), is frequently prescribed for patients with rheumatoid
   arthritis as a disease-modifying agent. We report that aurothiomalate
   negatively modulates glucocorticoid hormone action; it represses the
   ligand- and DNA-binding activities and the transactivation function of
   the glucocorticoid receptor. We suggested the existence of endogenous
   titrating activities of Au(I) because otherwise administration of
   aurothiomalate to a patient with rheumatoid arthritis would be expected
   to result in peripheral insensitivity to glucocorticoids and worsen the
   patient's status. Focusing on metal ions that are present in vivo, we
   found that Zn(II) counteracts the inhibitory effect of Au(I) on
   glucocorticoid receptor function. This complementary effect of Zn(II)
   was observed at physiological concentrations. We suggest that Zn(II)
   preserves glucocorticoid receptor function in target tissues and
   maintains hormone responsiveness, even with chrysotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Larvae from three populations of Chrysopa quadripunctata, a generalist
   predator with diverse habitat and prey associations, were reared under
   common environmental conditions and tested for patterns of variation in
   their feeding and defensive behaviour under two regimens. The results
   revealed two patterns: individual repeatability and geographical
   variation in specific larval activities. First, individual larvae
   expressed consistency in the propensity to camouflage themselves and in
   the priority they gave camouflaging versus feeding; they retained their
   characteristic levels of behaviour after two moults. Such consistency in
   the behaviour of a predatory arthropod has not been previously reported.
   Second, the larvae showed significant geographical variation in
   quantitative aspects of feeding and camouflaging, as well as in their
   responsiveness to camouflaging material (behavioural plasticity). The
   pattern of geographical variation in larval behaviour reflects the
   differential characteristics of the prey that these populations
   encounter in nature. We conclude that disparate prey resources can lead
   to the differentiation of locally adapted larval behaviour and the
   evolution of specialization. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{The principal therapeutic procedures and when they are clinically
   indicated in the management of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC)
   have been the subject of much debate. This paper reviews current
   knowledge and our experience in the treatment of this complex disease.
   It is generally agreed that patients with purpura, the primary symptom
   of EMC, should avoid long periods of sitting or standing in the same
   position. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs can be used for the
   management of arthralgias and/or arthritis. Low dose steroids (0.5 - 0.3
   mg/kg/die) are usually sufficient to control the purpura, arthralgias,
   arthritis and weakness, while larger doses (0.5 - 1.5 mg/kg/die) are
   needed to treat the renal involvement, peripheral neuropathy and
   serositis. Since the discovery of the association between EMC and viral
   infections, the appropriateness of cytotoxic drugs has been re-evaluated
   and they are no longer used.
   With the low antigen content diet, a regimen designed to restore a
   saturated mononuclear phagocytic system, good results have been obtained
   in the treatment of purpura, arthralgias, weakness and peripheral
   neuropathy. Furthermore, this dietary regimen may play a steroid sparing
   role. Plasma exchange is widely used in the management of severe renal
   involvement hyperviscosity syndrome, sensory motor neuropathy and liver
   involvement in EMC.}},

Abstract = {{A laser speckle technique, together with a computer-based image

   technique used a simple optical set-up and did not require surface
   contact with the specimen. A recently-proposed correlation parameter
   called the Integrated Peak Spectral Intensity H-i, was used to correlate
   the speckle images obtained with the state of strain around a crack tip
   and the subsequent mapping of the plastic zone. The experimentally
   obtained plastic zone around a narrow slit obtained by this technique
   showed reasonable agreement with predictions using Inglis' solution. For
   a fatigue crack, the extent of the experimental plastic zone ahead of a
   sharp crack was as expected larger than that predicted by linear elastic
   fracture mechanics, but agreed well with results corrected for load
   shedding at the crack tip. The present results indicate that the extent
   of the elastic-plastic boundary can be measured accurately with the

Abstract = {{High-density sampling of the neo-volcanic zone along the Reykjanes Ridge
   has been used to test the relationship between bathymetric features and
   geochemistry. The axial region has short wavelength features which
   correspond to elongate, en-echelon volcanic ridges. These ridges sit
   atop intermediate wavelength features, termed swells and troughs. A
   broad correspondence is found between the sections containing more
   fractionated samples and the intermediate wavelength swells. Conversely,
   the troughs are dominated by more primitive lavas. This suggests that
   swells represent areas of greater melt dux, resulting in thicker crust
   and hence generally more fractionation. Progressively higher
   concentrations of incompatible elements are found northwards along the
   ridge, with increases occurring as a series of steps that do not
   correlate with short or intermediate wavelength bathymetric features.
   The northward increase in ratios such as Nb/Zr suggests that sections of
   the ridge are fed by similar aggregate melt fractions, and that melt
   fractions become slightly smaller northwards. Changes or consistency in
   ratio, particularly Rb/Nb, cannot be explained by progressively greater
   northward incorporation of a component from the Icelandic plume mantle.}},

Abstract = {{This is a review of the epidemiologic literature on alcohol and risks of
   various cancers. Alcohol has consistently been related to risks of
   squamous cell carcinomas of the mouth, oral pharynx, larynx, and
   esophagus in multiple studies of varying design. The joint effects of
   alcohol and smoking are greater than additive, and are probably
   multiplicative, suggesting biological synergism. All major types of
   alcoholic beverages have been causally implicated in the genesis of
   these diseases. The influence of alcohol on risks of upper aerodigestive
   tract cancers may be greater in persons with marginal nutritional status
   than in better-nourished individuals. Alcohol also has been associated
   with an increased risk of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus,
   gastro-esophageal junction, and gastric cardia, but the relationship is
   rot as strong as for squamous cell esophageal carcinomas. Alcohol and
   tobacco account for over 80\% of the squamous carcinomas of the mouth,
   pharynx, larynx, and esophagus in the United States. Risks of cancers of
   the distal stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum have not been
   consistently related to alcohol, although possible relationships between
   beer drinking and rectal cancer and between heavy use of alcohol and
   pancreatic career warrant further study. Studies of alcohol and liver
   cancer, in which the confounding influence of hepatitis B was
   considered, have yielded inconsistent results and should be replicated.
   An association between heavy alcohol use and breast cancer has been
   observed in most studies, even after controlling for known risk factors
   for breast cancer, and additional investigations of this issue are
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{A social perception framework was used to examine how social cues and
   intergroup relations affect social judgment and behavior in negotiation.
   In Experiment 1, subjects negotiated and then learned that their
   opponent felt happy/disappointed/neutral. Negotiators felt less
   successful when their opponent was happy than when the opponent was
   disappointed. This effect occurred independent of negotiators' actual
   performance on the task. The feeling of success was `'bittersweet,''
   however, in that individuals who felt successful also regarded
   themselves as less honest,less sincere, less generous, and less fair-in
   short, less honorable in the negotiations. Experiment 2 tested the
   prediction that intergroup relationships govern the inverse affect and
   bittersweet effects. Individuals who negotiated with a disappointed
   opponent felt successful when the opponent was an out-group member, but
   not when the opponent was an in-group member. Negotiators allocated
   substantially more resources to in-group members who expressed
   disappointment with a previous outcome than to out-group members who
   expressed disappointment. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{The effects of hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA), an inhibitor of
   poly-ADP-ribosylation, and meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), an inhibitor
   of mono-ADP-ribosylation, on the phenotypic properties and proliferation
   of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells were studied using a
   combination of structural and chemical methods. The results show that
   HMBA and MIBG both slowed down the transition of the cells from a
   contractile to a synthetic phenotype in primary culture. While the
   control cells rapidly lost most of their myofilaments and built up an
   extensive endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, a conspicuous
   fraction of the drug-treated cells retained a characteristic smooth
   muscle morphology for at least 6 days. Moreover, most of the treated
   cells remained positive for smooth muscle a-actin and desmin throughout
   this period. In contrast, the drugs lacked distinct effects on cell
   morphology and cytoskeletal organization in secondary cultures.
   Nevertheless, they strongly inhibited serum-stimulated cell growth both
   in primary and secondary cultures. The ability of serum-starved cells to
   synthesize DNA after exposure to platelet-derived growth factor or serum
   was also restrained. Notably, the drugs could be added several hours
   after the mitogens without loss of effect, suggesting that they did not
   prevent the entrance into but rather the progression through the cell
   cycle. Accordingly, the expression of early response genes like c-fos,
   c-jun and c-myc was not blocked by the drugs. On the other hand, HMBA
   reduced the expression of transcripts for smooth muscle alpha-actin,

Abstract = {{This article critically reviews trends in Latino economic and social
   inequality to clarify why Latinos appear to have benefited less from
   economic recovery than either Whites or Blacks. Existing studies provide
   clues but little conclusive evidence about the mechanisms undergirding
   the erosion of Latinos' relative economic standing because of (a) the
   stagnation of Latino research in a highly static and descriptive mode;
   (b) the inability of researchers to sort structural and individual
   mechanisms driving trends in inequality; and (c) a continued reliance on
   national or regional averages to portray changes in socioeconomic
   well-being of an evermore heterogeneous population. `'First generation''
   studies were valuable in generating hypotheses about whether; how, and
   why the processes of stratification differ among Latinos. Using examples
   about labor market dynamics, the author illustrates opportunities for
   developing a `'second generation'' research agenda geared to refining
   hypotheses and formulating explanations about rising inequality among
   Latinos.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, three technical elements that together implement
   trick-play modes of digital VCR for ATV recording are proposed: a data
   arrangement format, a trick-play tracking algorithm, and a coefficient
   extraction algorithm. First, an efficient tape format is carefully
   designed for fast forward and reverse playbacks at various speeds. It
   can accommodate two pickup head configurations. The success of this
   format relies on a reliable trick-play tracking scheme. This tracking
   scheme is capable of automatically driving the pickup heads to trace the
   correct trajectory in typically less than 350 ms. Lastly, an adaptive
   coefficient extraction algorithm is presented, which produces fairly
   good quality trick-play images under severe bit limitation. A related
   issue is to choose a balanced bit budget that provides a good comprise
   between picture spatial quality and temporal quality. Simulations at a
   video recording bit rate of 25 Mb/s have been conducted to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of our proposed system.}},

   characteristic form of the shallow-water-wave equations without
   artificial viscosity or friction factors to model the propagation and
   runup of one-dimensional long waves, referred to as VTCS-2. We apply our
   method in the calculation of the evolution of breaking and nonbreaking
   waves on sloping beaches. We compare the computational results with
   analytical solutions, other numerical computations and with laboratory
   data for breaking and nonbreaking solitary waves. We find that the model
   describes the evolution and runup of nonbreaking waves very well, even
   when using a very small number of grid points per wavelength. Even
   though our method does not model the detailed surface profile of wave
   breaking well, it adequately predicts the runup of plunging solitary
   waves without ad-hoc assumptions about viscosity and friction. This
   appears to be a further manifestation of the well-documented but
   unexplained ability of the shallow water wave equations to provide
   quantitatively correct runup results even in parameter ranges where the
   underlying assumptions of the governing equations are violated.}},

Abstract = {{Intraoperative measures of functioning brain are an important aspect to
   understanding normal and diseased cortical response, Previous studies,
   in animal models, have used optical reflectance maps to illustrate the
   location and timing of functional activity. We used optical reflectance
   mapping in patients undergoing parietal tumor resection to reveal the
   temporal/spatial evolution of perfusion and other related metabolic
   responses of sensorimotor cortex to peripheral somesthetic stimulation.
   The somatosensory cortex of seven anesthetized patients was mapped in
   response to transcutaneous electrical median and ulnar nerve stimulation
   using optical reflectance imaging. The time course and spatial extent of
   this response were measured and correlated with evoked potential maps
   collected during the same conditions.
   Observable signals first appeared within 1-2 sec, peaked at 3 sec, and
   disappeared by 9 sec, These signals colocalized with the largest evoked
   potentials in both the sensory and motor regions and demonstrated
   topological specificity with median and ulnar nerve stimulation. Maps of
   this temporal/spatial resolution illustrate the integrative and dynamic
   nature of the neuronal, vascular, and metabolic responses of human
   cortex. These data also provide insight to the mechanisms responsible
   for signals obtained using other brain imaging techniques such as PET

   precursor VOHPO4 . 1/2H(2)O to gamma-(VO)(2)P2O7 is reported. The
   vanadyl hydrogen phosphate precursors used in this study were in the
   form of single crystals and powders, each prepared from aqueous media.
   Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction clearly show the
   transformation to be topotactic: single crystals are converted to
   pseudomorphs which are unchanged in size or shape with respect to the
   starting crystals, The pseudomorphs are made up of highly-oriented
   vanadyl pyrophosphate microcrystals. A large contraction of the atomic
   structure in the direction perpendicular to the basal plane induces
   cracks and voids within the crystal. A transformation mechanism
   involving phosphorus-atom inversion, along with supporting MNDO SCF-MO
   calculations, is presented. This mechanism accounts for at least some of
   the interlayer, crystallographic disorder that is often attributed to
   the sterically hindering effects of residual organics. The generation of
   cracks to accommodate unit cell shrinkage along the thin dimension of
   the crystal plates creates additional basal plane surface area that may
   be beneficial in terms of catalytic performance. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{The use of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in Japan has increased
   rapidly in the past decade. It has become a routine procedure for the
   diagnosis and cure of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Several
   different procedures for EMR have been reported and their usefulness is
   well established.(1-6) The `'strip biopsy'' method has become the most
   popular method in Japan.(2-5) However, it requires a double-channel
   endoscope, which is difficult to introduce into the esophagus and is
   hard to manipulate, because of its large diameter. In this method one
   must use grasping forceps to lift up the tumor, but endoscopists often
   fail to lift it because the mucosa can be torn when it is pulled by the
   forceps, especially if the tumor is located parallel to the endoscope.
   So resection itself is very difficult in such cases. We have recently
   developed an original method of EMR, endoscopic aspiration mucosectomy
   (EAM), which can always lift up the lesion by suction regardless of its
   location and does not injure the mucosal surface. In this article we
   describe the use of EAM in early gastric cancer and evaluate its
   clinical usefulness. Our technical terminology follows the general rules
   for gastric cancer study in Japan.(7)}},

Abstract = {{The expression of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) was analysed
   immunohistochemically in a series of 211 breast cancers with special
   reference to standard prognostic factors and patient survival. IGF-II
   was expressed both in the cancer cells and in stromal cells, in 84\% and
   50\% of cases, respectively. IGF-II expression in cancer cells was
   related to a non-metastatic disease at diagnosis (p = 0.03), low tumour
   grade (p = 0.02), DNA diploidy (p = 0.02) and S-phase fraction under 7\%
   (p = 0.001). IGF-II negativity was positively correlated to morphometric
   SD of nuclear area (p = 0.0003), nuclear perimetry (p = 0.002), SD of
   nuclear perimetry (p = 0.02), minimum nuclear diameter (p = 0.005) and
   maximum nuclear diameter (p = 0.093). The expression of IGF-II in
   stromal cells was related to low histological grade (p = 0.02), mitotic
   index under 10/mm(2) (p = 0.01), mild nuclear pleomorphism (p = 0.03),
   DNA diploidy (p = 0.08), SD of nuclear area (p = 0.006), mean nuclear
   perimeter (p = 0.05), minimum nuclear diameter (p = 0.005) and maximum
   nuclear diameter (p = 0.007) in that the nuclear factor values were
   higher in tumours without stromal IGF-II expression. In univariate and
   multivariate survival analysis, in immunohisto-chemically detected
   expression of IGF-II had no independent prognostic value over standard
   prognostic factors. Despite the fact that expression of IGF-II was
   inversely related to several histopathological features of malignancy,
   the clinical behaviour of breast cancer seemed to be independent of
   IGF-II expression.}},

Abstract = {{Task decoupling in robotic manipulators implies that there is a subset
   of joints primarily responsible for the completion of a subset of the
   manipulator task. In this paper, we take a novel and general view of
   task decoupling in which we identify link subsystems primarily
   responsible for completion of a subset of the manipulator task
   components, which is not necessarily position or orientation. Our
   analysis leads to the discovery of other decoupled manipulator
   geometries never identified before, wherein the decoupled system is
   responsible for a subset of degress-of-freedom involving a hybrid
   combination of both position and orientation. Closed-form inverse
   kinematic solutions for these manipulator geometries are therefore
   guaranteed. Task decoupling also implied singularity decoupling wherein
   singularities of decoupled subsystems are equivalent to the manipulator
   singularities. The analysis leads to a novel and efficient method for
   identifying the singularities and solving the inverse kinematics problem
   of six-axes manipulators with decoupled geometries. The practicality of
   the concepts introduced is demonstrated through an industrial robot
   example involving a hybrid position and orientation decoupling.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the pylorus in the control of gastric emptying of liquids

   excision in six pigs. The pylorus was left intact in another six pigs.
   Antro-pyloro-duodenal motility was recorded by a sleeve sensor and side
   holes. Liquid emptying was significantly more rapid in pylorus excised
   than in pylorus intact animals, during intraduodenal infusion of
   isosmolar dextrose (712 mL vs 107 mL), fatty acid (402 mL vs 46 mL),
   amino acids (752 mL vs 112 mL), 25\% dextrose (392 mL vs 51 mL) and 3
   normal saline (705 mL vs 157 mL). In pylorus excised animals, in
   contrast to pylorus intact animals, the manometric pattern of isolated
   pyloric pressure waves at the distal stomach was rarely seen (P < 0.05).
   In a second series of experiments, pylorus excised animals emptied
   significantly more (P < 0.04) meat over 120 min (181 g) than pylorus
   intact animals (80 g), but the proportion of particle sizes emptied was
   unaltered. In the pig, localized pyloric contractions are important for
   retardation of gastric emptying when nutrient or hyperosmolar solutions
   enter the duodenum. By contrast, the pylorus is unimportant in
   determining the size of solid particles emptied from the stomach.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Compliance and formation of distal anstomotic intimal
   hyperplasia (DAIH) were investigated in externally stiffened venous

   Methods: 36 femoropopliteal reconstructions were performed in 18 sheep.
   The autologous venous grafts were inserted into tubes made of Dacron
   mesh to achieve compliance-mismatch and lumen adaptation Compliance tons
   measured by echo-tracked ultrasonography and profiles of DAIH were
   generated from histologic sections harvested after 8.3 months.
   Main results: The external mesh tube significantly lowered the local
   compliance of graft and host artery. DAIH appeared extensively in those
   groups where mesh tube constricted venous grafts met untreated host
   arteries (p = 0.002). No differences in compliance and DAIH formation
   were observed when grafts with large and adapted diameters were
   compared.
   Conclusions: For prevention of DAIH the distal venous graft diameter is
   not important, while the local compliance of an autologous vein is a
   predictive factor for DAIH formation and thus long-term patency.}},

   impulsive modes and infinite nondynamic modes, in which the states of
   impulsive modes cannot be estimated by means of the conventional state

   eliminate all impulsive modes of the fast subsystem and to optimally
   place the eigenvalues of the regular subsystem within a specific region.
   Finally, the obtained state-feedback control law is implemented by the

Abstract = {{Optical third-harmonic generation (THG) is generally a weak process but
   is dipole allowed, therefore it occurs in all materials, including
   dielectric materials with inversion symmetry. We report that when using
   focused high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses, this normally weak THG
   process becomes highly operative at a simple air-dielectric interface
   and is much stronger than the bulk of most dielectric materials. We
   characterized this nonlinear optical response at interfaces as a
   phenomenological surface-enhanced THG in transmission and/or in
   reflection. This surface THG is further cascaded in transmission or
   reflection from layered composite dielectric materials of a high-low
   index of refraction, resulting in a marked increase in photon conversion
   efficiency than that of a single interface. Although the present THG
   efficiency is lower than that of a typical phase-matching harmonic
   crystal, it is important to note that the surface-enhanced optical THG
   is a fundamental physical process occurring at all interfaces and is
   relatively free from the constraint of a phase-matching condition and
   wavelength restriction. Using optical THG at an interface, it becomes
   possible to generate wavelengths at which harmonic crystals are
   unavailable. These findings may lead to a new development of
   surface-enhanced studies and prompt a reexamination of the processes of
   high-harmonic generation at interfaces using a focused beam.}},

Abstract = {{Adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix (CxAd) is one of the most
   distressing malignancies of the female reproductive system because of
   its tendency to spread aggressively and to be resistant to radiation and
   systemic therapies. To clarify the prognostic significance of p53
   alteration in CxAd, we immunohistochemically examined the incidence of
   p53 nuclear accumulation, which is considered to be mostly parallel with
   p53 gene mutation, and its association with clinicopathological
   parameters in 26 patients with CxAd. The overall incidence of p53
   nuclear accumulation was 46\% (12 of 26), being higher in groups with
   clinically advanced disease, higher degrees of cellular atypia, and
   deeper myometrial invasion, but significantly lower in patients with
   integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 or 18 DNA. Nuclear p53
   immunoreactivity as well as lymph node status, depth of invasion and the
   absence of HPV-DNA integration were significant indicators of a poor
   prognosis. Examination of p53 nuclear accumulation could be applied to
   biopsy material, and would be of practical assistance in predicting the
   prognosis of CxAd both preoperatively and postoperatively.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion across the Al2O3 film in the Au/Al2O3/Al film system (the Al
   film with 1 mu m thickness was vapor-deposited on a SiO2/Si substrate
   and exposed to the atmosphere to form a natural oxide layer, then the Au
   film was deposited on it.) at temperatures between 25 degrees and 500
   degrees C has been studied by using Auger Electron Spectroscopy, X-ray
   Photoelectron Spectroscopy and electrical resistivity measurement. The
   temperature where Al is detected on the surface of the Au/Al2O3/Al
   system is 100 degrees C higher than that on the surface of the regular
   Au/Al system without the Al2O3 film. The activation energies for the
   intermetallic layer growth of the Au/Al2O3/Al system and the Au/Al
   system are 110 and 72 kJ/mol, respectively. The Al2O3 film formed by the
   exposure in air (ca. 3.2 nm in thickness) acts as a barrier for
   diffusion in Au/Al. In addition, we observed the SEM image of cross
   section of the Au/Al2O3/Al system. The Au-Al intermetallic layer is
   formed in the Al layer in the initial stage of Au/Al2O3/Al diffusion by
   Bu diffusion through the Al2O3 film into the Al layer.
   On the other hand, we studied the effect of annealing environment on the
   diffusion for the Au/Al2O3/Al system by using O-18 as tracer for SIMS
   analysis. The Au-Al intermetallic layer grows in an island formation for
   the Au/Al2O3/Al system and when annealed in air, the number of islands
   decreases. Because, during heat treatment in air, the Al2O3 film is
   formed continuously by supply of O-2 to the Al2O3 film through Au film.}},

Abstract = {{The difficulty patterns of FIM (Functional Independence Measure) in
   Japan were determined and compared with patterns found in the United
   States to assess whether FIM can be used for worldwide comparisons of
   ADL (the activities of daily living). The FIM was measured for 190
   stroke patients in several hospitals throughout Japan. The scores at
   admission and discharge were converted to an interval scale by Rasch
   analysis. Right and left brain lesion patients were analyzed separately.
   The FIM items were divided into two groups: motor items and cognitive
   items to minimize misfit, A degree of misfit was acceptable, except for
   bowel and bladder management, stairs, bathing, and expression. Motor
   items, eating, and bowel and bladder management were the easiest stairs,
   bathing and tub/shower transfers were the most difficult. The difficulty
   patterns of patients with left and right hemisphere lesions were almost
   identical. Bathing and tub/shower transfer were more difficult for
   Japanese patients than for those studied in the United States.
   Concerning the cognitive items, expression was easiest for patients with
   right hemisphere lesions but most difficult for those with left
   hemisphere lesions. Social interaction was easier for Japanese patients
   with left hemisphere lesions than the other patients. The item
   difficulty patterns in Japan differs slightly from those in the United
   States because of cultural differences. As countries show different
   patterns of difficulty, we must be careful when making international
   comparisons of FlM data converted by Rasch analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The electrophysiological properties of oculomotor neurons were studied
   in neonatal rats aged 1-15 days. Action potentials were recorded from
   brainstem slices (frontal section) using the intracellular recording
   method at 35 degrees C. No significant age-dependent differences were
   detected in the resting potential (around -55 mV) and in the amplitude
   of the action potential (approximately 60 mV). However, the input
   resistance of oculomotor neurons declined with age from a mean of 60.8 M
   Omega for rats 1-3 days old to 17.0 M Omega for rats 14-15 days old. In
   addition, the duration of the action potential measured at the
   half-amplitude gradually decreased from 0.74 ms to 0.34 ms with
   increasing age. Increases were detected in the maximum rate of rise
   (from 117 V/s to 181 V/s) and the maximum rate of fall (from -67 V/s to
   -103 V/s) of the action potential. When long-lasting (500 ms)
   depolarizing current pulses were applied to oculomotor neurons, some
   neurons exhibited continuous repetitive discharge (i.e. tonic firing)
   while others showed transient discharge (phasic firing). The proportion
   of tonic-type neurons increased with age: the value was 9\% for rats 1-5
   days old, 37\% for rats 6-10 days old and 54\% for rats 11-15 days old.
   Concomitantly, the number of neurons showing a time-dependent inward
   rectification increased and the average maximum frequency of the
   discharge rose from 150 to 420 Hz, approximately, with age. Furthermore,
   it was found that the electrophysiological properties of oculomotor
   neurons of rats 14-15 days old were similar to those in adult rats. It
   is concluded that oculomotor neurons in neonatal rats show rapid
   alterations in their electrophysiological properties and that the ratio
   of tonic-type to phasic-type neurons changes during the early stages of
   development.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the effects of food deprivation on nitric oxide
   synthase (NOS) transcript levels in the rat paraventricular (PVN) and
   supraoptic nuclei (SON), using in situ hybridization histochemistry.
   Food deprivation for 48 h significantly and consistently reduced NOS
   transcript prevalence by approximately 50\% in both sites. Since there
   is considerable evidence for an important role of 5-HT in feeding
   behaviour, we then examined the effect of food deprivation on NOS gene
   expression in the PVN following para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA)-induced
   hypothalamic 5-HT depletion. As starvation causes central
   down-regulation of the thyroid axis, changes in thyrotropin-releasing
   hormone (TRH) and pituitary thyrotrophin (TSH) transcript prevalence
   were used as internal controls. PCPA pretreatment (200 mg/kg body weight
   as a single daily dose ip for 2 days) had no significant effect on basal
   levels of NOS, TRH or TSH transcripts, or on the effect of a subsequent
   48 h fast, which significantly reduced all three. These results show for
   the first time, that food deprivation for 48 h significantly reduces NOS
   gene expression in the rat PVN and SON. Secondly, that basal levels and
   the fasting-induced reductions in the prevalence of NOS, TRH and TSH
   transcripts were not affected by PCPA-induced hypothalamic 5-HT
   depletion. Therefore, at least under the experimental conditions used
   here, 5-HT does not appear to be involved in setting baseline levels-or
   in the starvation-induced inhibition of NOS or thyroid axis gene
   expression in the PVN.}},

Abstract = {{This review analyzes 30 yr of data concerning physiological age of
   ixodid ticks. The level and state of nutritional reserves in unfed ticks
   has been proposed as an index of tick physiological age. The dynamics of
   the use of these substances reflect tick aging. Thus, physiological age
   of ixodid ticks is determined by estimating the irreversible changes
   caused by natural vital activity in the body of unfed ticks, which
   inevitably raises the probability of tick death. The 4 age groups used
   in most studies correspond to different periods in the life of unfed
   ticks: the postmolting development, the commencement of active life (=
   questing activity), the midperiod of active life, and the final period
   of active life. The aging of adult ixodid ticks has been studied in
   natural populations and laboratory colonies of different species
   belonging to several genera. The dynamics of age composition through the
   activity season observed in adult Ixodes persulcatus, I. ricinus, and
   Dermacentor reticulatus from field populations correlated well with the
   known data on the life history of these species. Physiological age was
   successfully used as an indicator of the patterns of tick activization
   (= beginning of questing activity). Tick susceptibility to acaricides
   was shown to increase with tick aging. The success of maintenance,
   reproduction, and transmission of pathogens was found to be strongly
   influenced by tick physiological age. The physiological age can provide
   information about the present physiological status of an individual tick
   or a group of ticks and, on this basis, predictions can be made (for
   example, life expectancy, degree of response to certain factors). The
   physiological age does not give reliable information about the past life
   of ticks, in particular their calendar age. In this respect, the meaning
   of the physiological age of ixodid ticks corresponds to the biological
   (physiological, functional) age of animals, as used in gerontology, and
   differs from the physiological age of mosquitoes and other bloodsucking
   dipterans. Balashov's histological method of tick age determination
   successfully used by many authors, remains the most appropriate, until
   now. However, there is ample room for further advancement of
   methodologies of tick age assessment. The future methods should be based
   on the quantitative estimation of a number of characters (test-battery)
   related to different organs or systems.}},

Abstract = {{Some patients cannot receive a transvenous lead system because of high
   defibrillation thresholds (DFTs). We hypothesized that a right
   ventricular (RV) catheter electrode not extending as far as possible
   into the RV apex could cause high DFTs. Recently, a subcutaneous array
   (SQA) electrode has been shown to lower DFTs substantially. We compared
   the influence of a malpositioned RV catheter electrode on defibrillation
   efficacy for endocardial lead systems with and without a SQA. In eight
   anesthetized pigs, defibrillation catheters were placed in the RV apex
   and near the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and right atrium.
   SQA, formed by three elements, each 20 cm in length, was placed in the
   left thorax. DFTs were determined for a biphasic waveform using an up/
   down protocol with the RV catheter at the apex and with it repositioned
   1-cm and 2-cm proximal to the apex. The mean DFT energies for the
   configurations with a SQA were less than those without a SQA for every
   catheter position. The placement of the RV catheter away from the apex
   caused an increase in defibrillation energy for the configurations
   without a SQA (apex: 17.1 +/- 3.8 J {[}mean +/- SD]; 1 cm: 20.1 +/- 4.6
   J; 2 cm: 27.6 +/- 9.5 J; P < 0.05), but not for the configurations with
   a SQA (apex: 12.2 +/- 2.2 J; 1 cm: 12.3 +/- 2.9 J; 2 cm: 12.2 +/- 0.9 J:
   P = NS). These results suggest that a malpositioned RV catheter
   electrode, at the time of implantation or by late dislodgment,
   significantly elevates DFTs for a total endocardial system but not for a
   system that includes a SQA.}},

   a child who experienced normal physical and psychomotor development
   until the age of 3 years, who then developed progressive intention
   tremors, dysarthria, ataxia, and spastic tetraparesis. Episodes of acute
   metabolic distress were never observed. Magnetic resonance imaging
   disclosed abnormal signals within the white matter of the brain and
   cerebellum, suggesting leukodystrophy. Gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry analysis revealed abnormally high levels of glutaric acid,
   dicarboxylic acids, and glycine derivatives in urine. Riboflavin therapy
   was initiated at 4 years of age, when the patient had already lost
   control of trunk and head posture, Consistent improvement rapidly
   occurred after riboflavin supplementation. Glutaric aciduria type II may
   cause brain damage, in spite of the absence of acute metabolic distress,

Abstract = {{Porous silicon formation has been simulated by the finite diffusion
   length (FDL) model. This considers a dynamic isoconcentration profile
   from which the aggregating particles begin their random walks. In this
   paper we report on the isoconcentration profile non-uniformities which
   increase as the finite diffusion length is increased. The implementation
   of the FDL model with zero diffusion length generates non-fractal
   structures with a fractal dimension close to 1. It is found that Eden
   clusters cannot be generated at zero diffusion length, due to the
   problem of `'sinking isoconcentration profile''. We conclude that these
   are limitations that should be considered in the FDL model for improving
   the understanding of physical phenomena such as formation and morphology
   of porous silicon.}},

Abstract = {{X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is frequently associated with
   a nonprogressive, cognitive defect attributed to the absence of
   dystrophin in the brain of DMD patients. The mutant mdx mouse, lacking
   in 427-kDa dystrophin in both muscle and brain tissues, is considered to
   be a valuable model of human DMD. In the present study, we compared mdx
   and C57BL/10 control mice and showed that mdx mice had impaired
   retention in a T-maze, delayed spontaneous alternation task 24 h, but
   not 6 h, after acquisition. mdr mice were not impaired in acquisition of
   a bar-pressing task on 4 consecutive days but showed poor retention 22
   days after the last training session. Mutants and controls showed
   similar behavioral responses in free exploration and light/dark choice
   situations and did not differ in spontaneous locomotor activity or motor
   coordination. Retention impairments at long delays in mdx mice suggest a
   role of dystrophin in long-term consolidation processes.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes efficient algorithms that automatically take two
   or more catalogs of objects with instrumental coordinates and magnitudes
   and matches them. The challenges are that the instrumental coordinates
   may be only partially overlapping, at a different scale, rotated, or
   even inverted (flipped). The object magnitudes may be derived from
   different passbands so that the relative magnitudes of the objects
   differ. Also, the catalog may not contain all the same objects due to
   differences in separating close objects or to partial overlap between
   images. Finally, the catalog positions and magnitudes are subject to
   noise in the images from which they were derived. The algorithms are
   applicable to any automated cataloging system. However, the
   implementation described here is part of the faint-object classification
   and analysis system (FOCAS). FOCAS automatically produces catalogs of
   objects from digital images. The algorithms described here first take a
   subsample of the brightest objects from the catalogs and find a
   coordinate transformation between one catalog, the reference catalog,
   and other catalogs. Then all the objects in the catalogs are matched
   based on the transformed reference coordinates.}},

Abstract = {{We used computer simulation of Lyme disease to test the hypothesis that
   infection rates of ticks and risk to humans could be reduced by
   controlling populations of the vertebrate hosts of vector ticks. The
   model was patterned after the life cycle of the deer tick (Ixodes
   scapularis). Annual survival and fecundity were dependent on the
   availability of hosts. The likelihood of ticks becoming infected
   depended on the reservoir competence of hosts and the previous exposure
   of hosts to infected ticks. Our results demonstrated that the density of
   ticks was more sensitive to the availability of hosts for juveniles than
   hosts for adults, suggesting that control of Lyme disease by reducing
   host densities would prove difficult, since the numerous alternative
   hosts for juvenile ticks are not amenable to control. The infection rate
   of ticks depended critically on the reservoir competence of host species
   parasitized by juveniles. We conclude that measures that alter the
   species composition of small mammals and birds, and hence modify the
   average reservoir competence of hosts for juveniles, could be used to
   manipulate the risk of Lyme disease without actually changing the
   density of ticks.}},

   been described. All three neuropathies are considered to be
   immune-mediated. Their response to therapy is discussed, with special
   emphasis on high-dose intravenous immune globulin. For Guillain-Barre
   syndrome the efficacy of intravenous immune globulin has been proven in
   a randomized clinical trial. In chronic inflammatory demyelinating
   polyneuropathy a response rate of over 60\% in newly diagnosed patients
   is suggested. Clinical prognostic criteria, however, seem to be very
   important to predict the effect of intravenous immune globulin. In
   multifocal motor neuropathy intravenous immune globulin is at present
   the only alternative to cyclophosphamide.}},

   INCREASES EXPANSION OF ISOLATED CD34(+) CELL-POPULATION FROM CORD-BLOOD

Abstract = {{Hematopoietic progenitor cells in human umbilical cord blood have been
   shown to be effective sources for hematopoietic reconstitution following
   myeloablative therapy. Unfortunately, the use of cord blood (CB) is
   limited by the number of progenitor cells necessary to reconstitute the
   older child or adult. We studied the expansion of an isolated population
   of CD34(+) cells from CB and adult bone marrow (ABM) after 1 to 3 weeks
   in culture when stimulated with linea,ae-nonspecific (IL-11 and/or SLF)
   and lineage-specific (G-CSF or GM-CSF) cytokines. IL-11 and SLF alone or
   in combination did not enhance expansion of CB CD34(+) stem cells. With
   combinations of IL-11, SLF, and G-CSF or GM-CSF, however, after 1, 2, or
   3 weeks in culture, WBC expansion was significantly greater in CB vs.
   ABM (p < 0.05). At all time points, expanded CB consistently
   demonstrated a significant increase in cell production and myeloid
   differentiation when compared to ABM. To assess the proliferative
   potential of the expanded cultures, cells were recovered from the
   expansion cultures, plated in methylcellulose, and evaluated for CFU-GM
   and CFU-Meg colony formation. After 2 weeks in culture, a significant
   increase in CFU-GM colony formation in CB vs. ABM was demonstrated with
   SLE (p < 0.001), IL-11 plus SLF (p < 0.0005), and IL-11 plus SLF plus
   G-CSF (p < 0.004). Significantly greater CFU-Meg formation was also seen
   in CB vs. ABM cells plated after expansion with IL-11 plus SLF plus
   G-CSF (weeks 1 and 2) or IL-11 plus SLF plus GM-CSF (week 1) (p < 0.05).
   Finally, immunophenotyping was performed on CB cultures on days 0 and
   14, and although a significant reduction of the percentage of
   progenitors (CD34(+)/38(+)/38(-)/DR(+)) was seen, their absolute numbers
   were maintained. (Data for ABM was not available.) This study suggests
   that IL-11, when combined with SLF and more lineage-specific cytokines,
   can effectively maintain primitive multipotential progenitors and
   stimulate the differentiation of more committed precursors in CB
   compared to ABM.}},

Abstract = {{Advocates of phonics approaches believe that the form aspect of print
   (the sound-letter correspondences) should not only be emphasized in
   teaching beginning reading, but that it should initially be taught in
   isolation of meaningful print. Supporters of whole language approaches
   take the opposite view and suggest that all literacy instruction should
   take place in a context using print that is meaningful and relevant to
   children. An alternative view is presented in this article, namely, that
   meaning and form are both important, but initially they should both be
   taught separately. Support for this position is provided, and a
   two-stage model of preliteracy development grounded in research on
   emergent literacy is offered. The first stage emphasizes the meaning
   foundation and the second stage emphasizes the form foundation for later
   literacy development. However, both form and meaning are focused upon
   separately during both of these stages.}},

Abstract = {{During substrate-limited growth, some strains of Thiosphaera pantotropha
   nitrify heterotrophically and denitrify aerobically. These processes are
   thought to be used as NADH overflow mechanisms, resulting from a
   restricted oxygen respiration capacity. In this study, the behavior of
   T. pantotropha regarding the NADH overflow in the presence of
   substantial concentrations of substrate was examined. Continuously grown
   (dilution rate 0.1 h(-1)), acetate-limited cultures of T. pantotropha
   (30-285 mg dry weight l(-1)) were exposed for short periods (10-90 min)
   to excess acetate in batch. After the transition from acetate limitation
   to acetate excess, the growth rate immediately increased from 0.1 to 0.2
   h(-1). The acetate uptake rate was 1.1-1.2 mu mol min(-1) mg
   protein(-1), which would theoretically allow a growth rate of 0.35
   h(-1). Acetate appeared to be converted mainly to
   poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) (57\% wt/wt(-1)). The initial PHB
   production rate was 27 mu g PHB min(-1) mg protein(-1). Respiration
   measurements showed that only 29\% of the total acetate taken up was
   oxidized. The remainder (14\%) was used for biomass synthesis. After
   acetate (10 mM) was completely taken up, the cellular PHB content was
   42\% of the dry weight. During PHB synthesis no heterotrophic
   nitrification or aerobic dentrification could be detected. The results
   indicate that in acetate-limited cells when exposed to excess acetate,
   PHB formation serves as an NADH overflow metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation was examined within and among North Atlantic, North
   Sea and Baltic populations of the benthic red alga Phycodrys rubens
   using allozymes and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. On
   western and eastern North Atlantic coasts distinct allozyme types were
   found, with the exception of western Newfoundland where East and West
   Atlantic types co-occur. Along the European coasts, two genetic groups
   were distinguished by fixed allelic differences: an outer oceanic group
   and a North Sea/Baltic group. The two genetic types co-occur in the
   Skagerrak and Kattegat region. Reproductive isolation between the two
   types is suggested by the lack of hybrids in the overlap zones, and they
   may therefore represent sibling species. Unexpectedly an analysis of
   RAPD variation was unable to recover the two cryptic species identified
   using allozymes. Within-population RAPD variation was similar to or
   greater than between-population variation. The lack of structure in the
   RAPD data cannot be attributed solely to technical artefacts of the
   method but appears to reflect real biological variability.
   Within-population genomic polymorphisms caused by frequent mutational
   events are discussed, as are high amounts of genetic drift and possible
   disruptive selection brought about by stressed habitats. Finally, Baltic
   and extra-Baltic salinity ecotypes are known to exist in P, rubens.
   However, no correlation between ecotypic variation and allozyme groups
   was detected.}},

   number assessors perceiving chemical odours at the sniffing port was
   increased by light exposure at a(W) 0.1. QDA revealed a significant
   decrease in intensities for the attributes `French bean' and `sweet',

   demonstrate that EBV, when found ht Hodgkin's disease, is detectable in
   all anatomic sites involved The presence of the same 30-base pair
   deletion an the EBV LMP1 gene in all sites of disease in three patients
   suggests that the deletion occurred before dissemination and that all

   The optical properties of the glasses associated with the generation and
   annihilation of excitons in the copper halide crystals are interpreted
   on the basis of spatial quantization effects in the regime of quantized
   motion of the exciton. In this case, the nonlinear effects are
   determined by the interaction in the system of a finite number of
   excitons, localized in one quantum box. A mechanism is proposed for the
   photoburning of stable holes in the absorption spectra, based on the
   effect of a local electric field, which broadens the absorption bands of
   the resonantly excited crystallites. The effect of selective thermal

   involved in the regulation of cerebral cortical blood flow. We
   investigated the possible contribution of basal forebrain cholinergic
   neurons from the substantia innominata (SI) to the innervation of
   cortical microvessels. Basalo-cortical perivascular nerve terminals were
   detected by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry of
   anterogradely transported Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L)
   following its injection in the SI, and were compared to cortical
   perivascular cholinergic (immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase
   (ChAT)) terminals, The basal forebrain origin of cholinergic terminals
   was evaluated after unilateral ibotenic acid lesion of the St, PHA-L
   varicose fibers reached and surrounded microvessels in all cortical
   subdivisions examined, When studied at the ultrastructural level in the
   fronto-parietal and perirhinal cortices, perivascular PHA-L nerve
   terminals were located significantly closer to microvessels in the
   fronto-parietal than in the perirhinal cortex (respective average
   distance of 0.98 +/- 0.09 and 1.34 +/- 0.07 mu m; p < 0.01), PHA-L and
   ChAT terminals in the fronto-parietal cortex compared very well in their
   perivascular distribution but not in the perirhinal cortex, In both
   cortices, perivascular PHA-L terminals were similar in size to, but
   engaged more frequently in synaptic contacts than their ChAT
   counterparts, Following SI lesion, the density of cortical ChAT
   terminals including those reaching microvessels decreased significantly
   (56 and 63\%, respectively, p < 0.005) in the fronto-parietal cortex,
   while the cortical and perivascular denervations were much less
   pronounced (26\%, not significant and 35\%, p < 0.05, respectively) in
   the perirhinal cortex, These results indicate that basal forebrain
   neurons project preferentially to fronto-parietal cortical microvessels
   and further show that a significant proportion of these projections are
   cholinergic, In addition, the difference in distribution and/or synaptic
   incidence between perivascular PHA-L and ChAT terminals suggested that
   noncholinergic SI neurons also contribute to these neurovascular
   associations, and more so in the perirhinal cortex, as further indicated
   by the lesion studies, Such finding corroborates recent physiological
   evidence for a functional innervation of the cortical microvascular bed
   by SI neurons, a role that might be relevant to the overall pathology of
   Alzheimer's dementia.}},

Abstract = {{Only Listeria monocytogenes that produce listeriolysin O (LLO) elicit
   protective immunity, Given the importance of tumor necrosis factor alpha
   (TNF-alpha) in anti-listeria immunity, we have investigated TNF-alpha
   production by macrophages after they ingested live LLO-producing
   compared to LLO-non-producing bacteria, We used two genetically
   engineered strains of Listeria that differed only in their ability (Ly+)
   or inability (Ly-) to produce LLO, Ly+ and Ly- caused the same kinetics
   of increased mRNA abundance for TNF-alpha during the first 90 min after
   phagocytosis, However, only Ly+ caused sustained transcription of
   TNF-alpha mRNA, and this may account for the increased release of
   TNF-alpha. The transcriptional inhibitor
   5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) prevented the
   sustained abundance of cytokine mRNA 20 h after ingestion of Ly+. In
   addition, nuclear run-on assays indicated sustained transcription of
   TNF-alpha genes only after ingestion of Ly+. LLO itself was not
   responsible for the ability of Ly+ to stimulate the sustained
   transcription of the TNF-alpha genes, Instead, LLO may allow Listeria to
   survive within macrophages so that other bacterial products cause
   sustained TNF-alpha gene transcription, Both Ly+ and Ly- produced
   molecules, isolated by 50\% ammonium sulfate, that induced cytokine
   production, In conclusion, we now report that Ly+ causes sustained
   transcription of the TNF-alpha gene and production of TNF-alpha by
   macrophages in vitro, We speculate that the TNF-alpha may activate
   endothelium and thus allow the recruitment of T cells to sites of
   infection, This may contribute to the ability of only LLO-producing
   Listeria to induce protective immunity.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) induces a lymphoproliferative
   disorder and autoimmune glomerulonephritis in Brown Norway (BN) rats.
   This syndrome is the consequence of T cell-dependent polyclonal B cell
   activation and autoantibody production. We have previously shown that
   HgCl2-induced autoimmune perturbations can be prevented in BN rats by
   the administration of cyclosporin A (CsA). The most potent vitamin D-3
   metabolite 1,25(OH)(2) D-3 (Vit D-3) shares certain immunomodulatory
   properties with CsA. We therefore chose to compare the effects of Vit
   D-3 to those of CsA in BN rats treated with HgCl2 in order to establish
   whether Vit D-3 either alone or in combination with CsA can attenuate an
   autoimmune syndrome in vivo.
   Methods. BN rats were treated with HgCl2 according to a standard
   protocol. Subgroups of rats were also given CsA alone, Vit D-3 or
   synthetic analogues of Vit D-3 alone, or combinations of both agents.
   Different doses and routes of administration were compared. The
   following markers of disease activity were evaluated: mortality, peak
   proteinuria, serum IgE concentrations, and renal immunoglobulin
   deposition.
   Results. Disease activity was markedly attenuated in all rats treated
   with CsA alone. Vit D-3 and certain of its synthetic analogues
   administered alone also tempered the autoimmune process, but to a lesser
   extent than did CsA. The effect of CsA alone was so potent, that no
   additive or synergistic effects could be demonstrated when CsA was
   administered in combination with Vit D-3.
   Conclusions, Despite similar described immunomodulatory effects in
   vitro, CsA is clearly more effective than Vit D-3 in preventing HgCl2
   autoimmune disease in BN rats. This suggests that there is a difference
   in the cellular targets of these two agents in vivo, and/or a difference
   in the potency with which HgCl2-triggered immune activation is
   suppressed.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamical model for the collapse of the wave function in a quantum
   measurement process is proposed by considering the interaction of a
   quantum system (spin-1/2) with a macroscopic quantum apparatus
   interacting with an environment in a dissipative manner. The dissipative
   interaction leads to decoherence in the superposition states of the
   apparatus, making its behaviour classical in the sense that the density
   matrix becomes diagonal with time. Since the apparatus is also
   interacting with the system, the probabilities of the diagonal density
   matrix are determined by the state vector of the system. We consider a
   Stern-Gerlach type model, where a spin-1/2 particle is in an
   inhomogeneous magnetic field, the whole set up being in contact with a
   large environment. Here we find that the density matrix of the combined
   system and apparatus becomes diagonal and the momentum of the particle
   becomes correlated with a spin operator, selected by the choice of the
   system-apparatus interaction. This allows for a measurement of spin via
   a momentum measurement on the particle with associated probabilities in
   accordance with quantum principles.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness of air bags as a safety
   device in decreasing fatalities and reducing morbidity in frontal impact
   motor vehicle accidents has been well established. However, case reports
   have surfaced documenting ocular injuries related to air bag inflation.
   The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze ocular injuries
   sustained during air bag inflation.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hospital emergency room records were reviewed
   retrospectively for a period of 4 years for patients who had sustained
   ocular injuries in motor vehicle accidents, Those injuries associated
   with air bag inflation were analyzed as to the nature of the injury,
   type of vehicle, speed, and visual morbidity.
   RESULTS: Fourteen cases of ocular injury related to air bag inflation
   were identified. Hyphema (nine cases) and cornea abrasion (eight cases)
   were the most common. Three cases, all patients who had been wearing
   glasses, sustained serious and permanent ocular damage.
   CONCLUSION: While air bags are an unequivocal safety feature, ocular
   injuries do occur that are related to air bag inflation. Eyeglass wear
   may present an additional risk factor.}},

   dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, dry and ash weights, and calcium
   content. The bones of the animals in the control groups (killed at days
   0, 14, and 42) had their own maturation rate. The body weights of
   suspended animals were lower than those of the control animals.
   Suspension does not appear to impair the long-bone elongation rate.
   However, the tibia of suspended rats exhibited a lower calcium content,
   ash weight, BMC, and BMD. Similar trends were observed in the femur. In
   the humerus, no significant change was observed. In the skull, the
   values of the suspended rats were similar to those of the control rats.
   At the end of the reambulation period, the body weights showed no
   difference between the control and experimental animals. The bone
   alterations were not completely reversible compared with their
   respective controls. In the tibia, BMC and BMD were always decreased. In
   the femur, trends toward low values were still visible. The skull showed
   a decrease in BMC and ash and dry weights. This unexpected finding
   suggested the importance of a rapid decrease in cephalad fluid shift at
   the time of desuspension. Finally, we showed that dual-energy X-ray
   absorptiometry measurement is sufficiently accurate to detect intergroup

Abstract = {{The first part of this paper reviews different approaches to define the
   motion of the fingers and the thumb in order to obtain prehension. The
   last part presents the design of a hand prosthesis based on a new plane
   of action for the thumb and on proposed design specifications and
   functional characteristics. The design methodology consists of two
   steps: the morphology design of the hand prosthesis and the 4-bar
   mechanism design for each finger. A 3-D computer-aided design (CAD)
   interactive program was used as a design tool to obtain the hand
   morphology. This CAD technique was also used to check the geometry, the
   relative motions of the fingers, and the possibility of interference for
   the proposed model with two prehension patterns (tridigital and
   lateral). It is noted that identical flexion angles of the finger joints
   were obtained for these two prehension patterns, the difference being in
   the inclination angle of the thumb's plane of flexion. This finding
   greatly simplified the design of the internal mechanisms of the fingers.
   CAD was a powerful tool in the design process of this hand prosthesis
   and will be more and more useful in the future.}},

   dehydrogenase muscle-type (LDH(M)), to generate interactive microtubule
   networks was investigated, Bundles have previously been defined as the
   parallel alignment of several microtubules and are one form of
   microtubule networks, Utilizing transmission electron microscopy,
   interactive networks of microtubules as well as bundles were readily
   observed in the presence of GAPDH, aldolase, or PK, These networks
   appear morphologically as cross-linked microtubules, oriented in many
   different ways, Light scattering indicated that the muscle forms of
   GAPDH, aldolase, PK, and LDH(m) caused formation of the microtubule
   networks, Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) and lactate dehydrogenase
   heart-type (LDH(H)), glycolytic enzymes which do not interact with
   tubulin or microtubules, did not produce bundles, or interactive
   networks, Sedimentation experiments confirmed that the enzymes that
   cross-link also co-pellet with the microtubules, Such cross-linking of
   microtubules indicate that the enzymes are multivalent with the
   capability of simultaneous binding to more than one microtubule.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: We have previously demonstrated that endotoxemia
   induces an immediate leukocytic response within the hepatic
   microvasculature, with leukostasis in sinusoids and leukocyte adherence
   in postsinusoidal venules. We have now studied the role of intercellular
   adhesion molecule-1 in endotoxin-induced hepatic leukocyte-endothelial
   cell interaction in vivo using fluorescence microscopy.
   Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with either 1 mg/kg (n=5)
   or 2 mg/kg (n=4) of a monoclonal anti-rat anti-intercellular adhesion
   molecule-1 antibody intravenously, followed by exposure to endotoxin (E,
   coli LPS 10 mg/kg iv). Animals pretreated with an isotype-matched IgG(1)
   control antibody (n=5) served as controls, Intravital fluorescence
   microscopy for analysis of the hepatic microcirculation was performed
   prior to and 1 h after lipopolysaccharide exposure.
   Results: At 1 h after lipopolysaccharide-exposure, control animals
   showed a marked reduction of systemic leukocyte count, which was
   associated with a significant (p<0.01) hepatic microvascular
   accumulation of leukocytes with stasis in sinusoids as well as rolling
   and adherence in postsinusoidal venules. Pretreatment with
   anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was not effective in preventing
   either systemic leukopenia or intravascular sequestration of leukocytes
   in endotoxemic livers.
   Conclusions: Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 does not mediate
   endotoxin-induced early leukocytic response within the hepatic
   microcirculation. (C) Journal of Hepatology.}},

Abstract = {{Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), freeze-fracture electron
   microscopy, and differential scanning microcalorimetry are used to
   investigate the temperature dependent microstructure of
   water-oil(isooctane)-surfactant(sodium di-2-ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate)
   mixtures containing variable concentrations of triblock copolymer
   (polyethyleneoxid-polyisoprene-polyethyleneoxid). Micrographs
   demonstrate that close to room temperature the microstructure consists
   of water droplets embedded in an oil matrix. Under increasing copolymer
   concentration a pronounced interaction peak shows up in SAXS spectra.
   This indicates a copolymer-induced transition from random towards
   locally ordered droplet arrangement. Under increasing temperature one
   crosses a phase boundary. This causes the position of the interaction
   peak to shift toward smaller Q values, and up to three further,
   equidistant peaks occur. Equal distances between peak positions implies
   a lamellar microstructure. It is shown by microcalorimetric measurements
   that this transition from a microemulsion into a lamellar phase is
   entropy driven, even when no copolymers are added. At low copolymer
   concentration the lamellar phase expels an excess oil phase. However,
   for sufficiently high copolymer concentration the system remains single
   phase. Elaborating on this point, we demonstrate that addition of a
   lipophilic polymer forms a method of stabilizing lamellar phases.
   Furthermore, the increasing number of peaks in the scattering spectra
   indicates that the order in the lamellar structure increases
   significantly by addition of copolymer.}},

Abstract = {{Functional interactions between B and T lymphocytes are known to depend
   on the expression of co-stimulatory molecules B7.1/CD80, B7.2/CD86 and
   their counter-receptors CD28 and CTLA4, as well as CD40 and its ligand
   CD40L. To study the role of these molecules in situ, an
   immunohistochemical analysis was carried out on normal human lymphoid
   tissue. In the germinal centers (GC), B7.1 and B7.2 were differentially
   expressed. In the dark zone, centroblasts were predominantly B7.1(+),
   while centrocytes in the light zone were B7-2(+), resulting in reversed
   gradients of both markers in GC. Follicle mantle cells were negative for
   B7.1 and B7.2. Macrophages and interdigitating dendritic cells (IDC) in
   T cell zones both expressed B7.1 and B7.2. Moreover, clusters of B7.2(+)
   T cells were demonstrated in interfollicular areas. Intrafollicular
   CD4(+) T cells in GC, predominantly in the apical light zone, expressed
   CD28 and CTLA4, as did the majority of interfollicular T cells. CTLA4
   showed a striking excentric cytoplasmic staining, which was also seen on
   T cells activated in vitro. CD40 was expressed on all B cells and more
   strongly on macrophages and IDC. Moreover, small clusters of T cells in
   a rim outside the GC showed CD40 expression. CD40L was expressed both on
   intrafollicular CD4(+) T cells as well as on T cells in T cell zones.
   The differential distribution of co-stimulatory molecules in different
   compartments of normal human lymphoid tissue in situ indicates that
   these interactions play a distinctive role in different stages of B cell
   differentiation and in the immune response.}},

Abstract = {{We report the existence of partial reproductive isolation between two
   natural populations of the flour beetle, Tribolium confusum, collected
   in Kaduna, Nigeria and Zagreb, Croatia. When a female from either
   population is paired with a single sympatric or allopatric male, she
   produces near normal numbers of semifertile offspring. However, when
   females are multiply mated with allopatric and sympatric males, the
   sympatric males sire the large majority of offspring. When measured in
   offspring numbers, the mean relative fitness of allopatric males is
   0.425 with Nigerian females and 0.085 with Croatian females. Thus, the
   reproductive isolation is reciprocal but asymmetric. Behavioural
   observations indicate that only a fraction of mating attempts by
   allopatric males are successful because females do not become quiescent
   as often when mounted by allopatric males. The premating isolation is
   also reciprocal but asymmetric: Nigerian females are more accepting of
   allopatric males as mates than are Croatian females. The prezygotic
   behavioural isolation between these two populations is different from
   the postmating, prezygotic isolation observed between two other species
   in the genus, ir: castaneum and T. freemani. Furthermore, the I:
   confusum interpopulation hybrids are fertile although they exhibit a

Abstract = {{In order to execute a parallel PDE (partial differential equation)
   solver on a shared-memory multiprocessor, we have to avoid memory
   conflicts in accessing multidimensional data grids, A new multicoloring
   technique is proposed for speeding sparse matrix operations, The new
   technique enables parallel access of grid-structured data elements in
   the shared memory without causing conflicts. The coloring scheme is
   formulated as an algebraic mapping which can be easily implemented with
   low overhead on commercial multiprocessors. The proposed multicoloring
   scheme has been tested on an Alliant FX/80 multiprocessor for solving 2D
   and 3D problems using the CGNR method. Compared to the results reported
   by Saad (1989) on an identical Alliant system, our results show a factor
   of 30 times higher performance in Mflops, Multicoloring transforms
   sparse matrices into ones with a diagonal diagonal block (DDB)
   structure, enabling parallel LU decomposition in solving PDE problems,
   The multicoloring technique can also be extended to solve other
   scientific problems characterized by sparse matrices.}},

Abstract = {{Dairy manure has been linked to elevated phosphorus (P) levels in
   surface waters of Lake Okeechobee basin. Prevalent soils of the basin
   (Aquods) retain little P in sandy, quartz-dominated upper horizons, and
   lateral P transport is favored by high water tables. The stability of
   manure-derived P forms is thus an important factor in the Okeechobee
   basin and other regions where soil and hydrologic factors are
   unfavorable for P retention. The objectives of this study were to
   determine (1) the forms of P in four dairy impacted soils and one
   associated stream sediment, (2) the forms lost most readily following
   disturbance and simulated leaching, and (3) the effect of residence time
   prior to a leaching event on the relative amount of P released. Samples
   included four Ap horizons from holding areas and a stream sediment from
   one of the dairy sites. All samples (500 g) were packed in columns and
   leached with synthetic rainwater at 0.4 ml/min for 6 h weekly.
   Concentrations of P, Ca, Mg, Al, and Fe in the leachate, along with pH
   and electrical conductivity (EC) were determined. The form of solution P
   for selected leachates was also evaluated using P-31 NMR spectroscopy.
   Samples before and after leaching were subjected to P fractionation.
   Results of P-fractionation, solution speciation, and P-31 NMR indicated
   that P lost from surface horizons during leaching was dominantly in
   inorganic forms associated with Ca and Mg. Leachates of soil horizons
   contained much higher levels of P than did those of the sediment,
   despite comparable total-P levels. Recalcitrance of the sediment P
   probably relates to its dominant form, determined in a related study to
   be a poorly-crystalline apatite-like mineral; soil horizons contained no
   detectable crystalline P. However, speciation modelling indicated that
   leachates were supersaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite, and in
   most cases to metastable Ca-P forms. Lack of crystalline Ca-P could be
   related to kinetics, or to a poisoning effect of components such as Mg,
   Si and organic acids in the dairy soil system. Elimination of the
   `'barrier'' to Ca-P crystallization could reduce the leaching of P from
   dairy systems.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of temperature on eggs and yolksac larvae of the Nassau
   grouper (Epinephelus striatus) were examined under controlled, hatchery
   conditions. Artificially-fertilized eggs, obtained by induced spawning
   of captive adults, were stocked (36 eggs per l) into 15 500 l
   cylindroconical indoor tanks at temperatures of 26, 28 and 30 degrees C,
   with five tanks per treatment. A salinity of 37 g l(-1) and a
   photoperiod of 12 L: 12 D were maintained. Incubation time to hatching
   was inversely related to temperature, decreasing from 24.9 h
   post-fertilization (p.f.) at 26 degrees C to 20.4 h p.f. at 30 degrees
   C, but hatching success (avg. = 82.5\%) did not vary with temperature.
   Survival of pre-feeding larvae declined more rapidly at the higher
   temperatures to 91.4, 80.7 and 42.2\% by Day 1 p.h, at 26, 28 and 30
   degrees C, respectively, indicating that early survival was influenced
   by factors unrelated to feeding. Development time to the first-feeding
   stage was inversely related to temperature, decreasing from 86 h p.f.
   (2.54 d p.h.) at 26 degrees C to 71 h p.f. (2.11 d p.h.) at 30 degrees
   C. Lower temperatures delayed starvation, with survival falling to 32.3,
   9.3 and 1.2\% by Day 4 p.h. at 26, 28 and 30 degrees C, respectively. A
   temperature of 26 degrees C is deemed advantageous to higher
   temperatures for incubating eggs and for rearing first-feeding larvae,
   although even lower temperatures may be feasible. Temperatures within an
   ecological range can markedly influence development rates of E. striatus
   eggs and yolksac larvae and hence, dispersal potential, first-feeding
   and survival in the field.}},

Abstract = {{The epithelium-associated tissue distribution of the intracellular IL-1R
   antagonist (icIL-1Ra) suggests that it functions as a novel regulatory
   molecule for IL-1 in somatic tissues. We examined the role of the
   icIL-1Ra in IL-1 beta-induced responses in human ovarian cancer cells
   because ovarian surface epithelium expresses transcripts for the
   icIL-1Ra, and the majority of ovarian cancers arise from these cells.
   Several human ovarian and cervical cancer cell lines spontaneously
   express the icIL-1Ra. icIL-1Ra-expressing cells did not have altered
   growth characteristics or altered short term responses to IL-1 compared
   with icIL-1Ra-nonexpressing cells. While a 90-min exposure to IL-1 beta
   resulted in increased steady state cytokine mRNA levels in all cells,
   icIL-1Ra-positive cells were incapable of maintaining IL-1 beta-induced
   expression of GRO mRNA. This did not result from decreased
   transcriptional activity of the CRO gene; but reflected differences in
   mRNA stability and/or degradation. To determine whether the icIL-1Ra
   altered mRNA stability, we used a retroviral expression vector to
   express the iclL-1Ra in an icIL-1Ra-negative cell line. The resulting
   cells displayed a profile of IL-1 beta-induced genes analogous to that
   found in cells spontaneously expressing icIL-1Ra. These data show for
   the first time an intrinsic biologic activity for the icIL-1Ra. the
   capacity to selectively alter IL-1-induced gene expression suggests that
   this version of the IL-1Ra is a unique intracellular inhibitor that
   attenuates IL-1 responses at a point downstream of the initial IL-1/IL-1
   receptor interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Lessons learned from ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring strongly
   influence the development of new anti-hypertensive drugs. Efficacy
   should be demonstrated not only in the conventional clinical setting,
   but also throughout the full 24 h day, including the important early
   morning hours near the end of dosing intervals. Preservation of the
   circadian pattern, including appropriate day/night BP differences, may
   be a further important goal of therapy. The reproducibility of
   ambulatory monitoring measurements, together with the absence of placebo
   effects with this technique, adds greatly to its power and efficiency.
   Moreover, the use of ambulatory monitoring to accurately diagnose
   hypertension and exclude non-confirmed or white coat hypertensives from
   clinical trials adds further sensitivity to quantifying drug action.
   This technique was recently applied to the evaluation of the new
   angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan. Hypertensive patients
   diagnosed by ambulatory monitoring were divided into four groups:
   placebo, losartan 50 mg once daily, 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice
   daily. Compared with placebo, which had no effect, all three losartan
   regimens decreased SEP and DBP significantly. There was no difference in
   efficacy between the two once daily regimens, although 50 mg twice daily
   was slightly more effective than 50 mg once daily but not statistically
   significantly different from 100 mg once daily. However, all losartan
   groups exhibited sustained BP reductions throughout the 24 h dosing
   interval and preserved the circadian BP patterns. Ambulatory monitoring
   was thus able to accurately quantify the efficacy and the key
   chronobiological aspects of anti-hypertensive therapy with losartan in
   an efficient and cost-effective manner.}},

Abstract = {{Plasminogen activators initiate the fibrinolytic process by converting
   plasminogen to plasmin. Though plasminogen activators are effective in
   the treatment of thrombotic disorders, bleeding complications are
   associated with their use, The development of plasminogen activators
   with greater fibrin specificity was expected to reduce the incidence of
   bleeding complications; however, this has not occurred, In our rabbit
   model (a) bleeding from standardized ear incisions induced by
   tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is attenuated when
   fibrinogenolysis is reduced by the coadministration of
   alpha(2)-antiplasmin and (b) when used in doses that produce equivalent
   thrombolysis, vampire bat plasminogen activator (b-PA), an agent that is
   more fibrin specific than t-PA, causes less bleeding than t-PA, In
   addition, we have found that the (DD)E complex formed as a result of
   degradation of crosslinked fibrin is a potent stimulator of t-PA-induced
   plasminogen activation but has no effect on b-PA, Fragment X, a
   high-molecular-weight clottable fibrinogen degradation product,
   accumulates after treatment with t-PA but not with t-PA given with
   alpha(2)-antiplasmin or with b-PA, These findings suggest that there is
   a link between plasminogen activator-induced fibrinogenolysis and
   bleeding, and that the composition of fibrin within hemostatic plugs may
   influence susceptibility to lysis, Whether these results mean that
   fibrin-specific plasminogen activators like b-PA will have a better
   risk-to-benefit profile in humans requires rigorous testing in
   well-designed clinical trials, However, at the very least, our findings
   suggest that the development of plasminogen activators that are more
   fibrin specific than t-PA is a worthwhile exercise.}},

Abstract = {{A tremendous amount of time and energy has been dedicated to the
   development of conditioning programs, mechanics drills, and
   rehabilitation protocols for the throwing athlete. In comparison, a
   significantly smaller amount has been spent on the needs oi the hitting
   athlete. Before these needs can be addressed, an understanding of
   mechanics and the demands placed on the body during the swing must be
   developed. This study uses three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data
   to define and quantify biomechanics during the baseball swing. The
   results show that a hitter starts the swing with a weight shift toward
   the rear loot and the generation of trunk coil. As the hitter strides
   forward, force applied by the front loot equal to 123\% of body weight
   promotes segment acceleration around the axis oi the trunk. The hip
   segment rotates to a maximum speed of 714 degrees/sec followed by a
   maximum shoulder segment velocity oi 937 degrees/sec. The product of
   this kinetic link is a maximum linear bat velocity of 31 m/sec. By
   quantifying the hitting motion, a more educated approach can be made in
   developing rehabilitation, strength, and conditioning programs for the
   hitting athlete.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose We sought to identify MRI measures that have high
   probability in a short acquisition time to predict, at early time points
   after onset of ischemia, the eventual development of cerebral infarction
   in clinical patients who suffer occlusion of a cerebral artery.
   Methods We developed an MR tissue signature model based on
   experimentally derived relationships of the apparent diffusion
   coefficient of water (ADC(W)) and T-2 to ischemic brain tissue
   histopathology. In eight stroke patients we measured ADC(W) and T-2
   intensity using diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DW-EPI). Tissue
   signature regions were defined, and theme maps of the ischemic focus at
   subacute time paints after stroke onset were generated.
   Results Five MR signatures were identified in human stroke foci: two
   that may predict either cell recovery or progression to necrosis, one
   that may mark the transition to cell necrosis, and two that may be
   markers of established cell necrosis.
   Conclusions An MR tissue signature model of ischemic histopathology
   using ADC(W) and T-2 can now be tested for its potential to predict
   reversible and identify irreversible cellular damage in human ischemic
   brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Focal mechanical injury to the retina has been shown to slow or prevent
   photoreceptor degeneration near the lesion site in two animal models of
   retinal degeneration, inherited retinal dystrophy in the Royal College
   of Surgeons (RCS) and light damage in albino rats. Thus, when injured,
   the rat retina activates a self-protective mechanism to minimize damage,
   To identify injury responsive factors and cells, we examined the mRNAs
   for the following factors and some of their receptors: basic and acidic
   fibroblast growth factors (bFGF, aFGF) and FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1);
   ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFR
   alpha); brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor trkB;
   and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGFR-1 receptor (IGF-1R).
   After a single mechanical lesion to the subretinal space and retina,
   there was a substantial increase in bFGF and CNTF expression that
   persisted for the entire 10 d period of study. The increase in bFGF mRNA
   after injury was prompt and great in amplitude, while the elevation of
   CNTF mRNA was relatively slower. In addition, there was a transient
   increase in FGFR1 mRNA, In situ hybridizations showed that the elevation
   of bFGF and CNTF was localized to the vicinity of the lesion, The
   expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) mRNA also increased
   in response to injury. These findings strongly suggest that increases in
   endogenous bFGF and/or CNTF play key roles in injury-induced
   photoreceptor rescue.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of the multispecific B alpha mating-type locus of Schizophyllum
   commune provided evidence that pheromones and pheromone receptors govern
   recognition of self versus non-self and sexual development in this
   homobasidiomycetous fungus. Four subclones of an 8.2 kb genomic fragment
   carrying B alpha 1 specificity induced B-regulated sexual morphogenesis
   when introduced into a strain with one of the eight compatible B alpha
   specificities that are known to exist in nature. One of these clones,
   which activated all other B alpha specificities, contains a gene termed
   bar1. The predicted protein product of bar1, as well as that of ban, a
   homologous gene isolated from a B alpha 2 strain, has significant
   homology to known fungal pheromone receptor proteins in the
   rhodopsin-like superfamily of G protein-linked receptors. The other
   three active B alpha 1 clones were subcloned further to identify the
   minimal active element in each clone, Every active subclone contains a
   putative pheromone gene ending in a signal for possible isoprenylation.
   A message of similar to 600 bp was observed for one of these genes,
   bap1(1). This paper presents the first evidence for a system of multiple
   pheromones and pheromone receptors as a basis for multispecific mating
   types in a fungus.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the relationships between smoking and the 5-year

   Methods: A total of 442 men (age, greater than or equal to 30 years in
   1985) with paired, gradable lens photographs in at least one eye in both
   1985 and 1990 were studied. Photographs were graded by two readers who
   used the grading scheme of the Wilmer Institute, Baltimore, Md, with
   severity ranging in decimal units between 0.0 and 4.0. Data on the
   smoking history of the subjects were collected by personal interviews
   that were conducted in 1985 and updated in 1990.
   Results: The incidence and progression of opacities increased with age.
   A nonsignificant association was observed between smoking (for both
   current and ex-smokers) and the incidence of a nuclear opacity. The risk
   of progression of nuclear opacities of less than grade 3 at baseline to
   grade 3 or worse was 2.4-fold higher among current smokers in 1985,
   compared with that among ex-smokers and nonsmokers (95\% confidence
   limits: 1.0, 6.0) after adjustment for age, baseline opacity status, and
   alcohol use. An 18\% increased risk of progression was significantly
   associated with each pack-year that a subject smoked between 1985 and
   1990.
   Conclusion: These data confirm previous findings that smoking is
   associated with a nuclear opacity, particularly with progression to
   severe opacities.}},

   it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise

   subacute prurigo. Both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic
   excoriated papules for several months before presentation. Blisters had
   never developed and did not occur during follow up. Histology showed
   changes of chronic dermatitis. In the serum of both patients, indirect
   immunofluorescence on NaCl-separated human skin revealed the presence of
   circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters.
   Perilesional skin biopsies showed linear IgG or C3 deposits in the
   basement membran zone. Immunoblotting of epidermal and dermal extracts
   demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230-kD
   protein, which is the known major bullous pemphigold antigen. These

   PROTOCOLS BASED ON PATIENT RECALL AFTER THE PROCEDURE}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Informed consent is now required for the majority of
   radiologic procedures, but few studies have evaluated the efficacy of
   informed consent protocols. We compared our standard consent protocol of
   obtaining consent prior to percutaneous lung biopsy with a modified
   protocol by using patients' recall of procedure risks after the biopsy
   as an indicator of patients' comprehension.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. The study sample consisted of 50 patients who
   underwent percutaneous lung biopsy between December 1992 and June 1994.
   Twenty-seven patients received our standard informed consent procedure
   in which four important procedure risks were described briefly using our
   standard method. Twenty-three patients underwent a consent procedure
   that had the following modification. After the four procedure risks were
   described, the patient was tested verbally until all risks could be
   recited to the physician. This change required 5 additional min at most.
   In both protocols, efficacy of the procedure was evaluated by testing
   patient recall 4 hr after consent was obtained. We also assessed any
   effect that might have been introduced by differences between the
   groups, age, sex, time between consent and recall, and complications
   during the procedure.
   RESULTS. Patients' recall was significantly better in the modified
   consent group than in the standard group (p=.005). This result could not
   be attributed to differences in age, sex, or time between consent and
   recall. There was a trend for improved recall in patients with
   complications. This trend did not appear to influence our principal
   finding.
   CONCLUSION. The standard consent procedure for lung biopsy appears
   inadequate when patients' recall of procedure risks later is used as a
   measure of the patients' comprehension. Based on this study, the
   informed consent process may be improved substantially by teaching
   patients to recite the procedure risks to the physician as part of the
   informed consent protocol.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acute ischemia
   and reperfusion on blood-retinal barrier (BRB) function in the rabbit
   eye. Hydrostatic pressure (140 mmHg) was used to create total retinal
   ischemia for intervals of 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 min in the rabbit eye.
   The location, size and permeability-surface-area product normalized to
   the area of retinal leakage (PS') of ischemia-induced BRB lesions were
   then measured using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   after various intervals of reperfusion. Diffuse outer BRB leakage
   occurred in most eyes subjected to 80 or 100 min of ischemia. A
   posterior region of outer BRB sparing was found in eyes that underwent
   lesser durations of ischemia. On day 1 after retinal ischemia, a linear
   relationship was found between mean PS' and duration of ischemia for
   periods of ischemia between 20 and 100 min {[}slope: 5.65 x 10(-6) to
   5.96 x 10(-6) cm min(-1) (min ischemia)(-1); r(2) greater than or equal
   to 0.69]. Lesion size also increased between 20 and 100 min of ischemia.
   In a longitudinal study, eyes exposed to 60 min of ischemia showed a
   decrease in PS' and a lesion size over an 8-week period of observation.
   However, leakage was still present on post-ischemia day 57 in two of
   three eyes examined. Data obtained in these experiments are expected to
   prove useful in future studies aimed at understanding how BRB damage
   relates to neuroretinal damage after ischemia-reperfusion injury. (C)

Abstract = {{Although previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) for visualizing intraspinal transplants in vivo
   the degree to which MRI can differentiate viable fetal neural tissue
   from evolving spinal cord pathology has not been investigated. Thus, the
   present study assessed whether MRI performed at earlier postgrafting
   intervals (0-20 weeks) could document the survival of fetal neural
   transplants in the injured cat spinal cord. Twelve adult female cats
   received a hemisection injury at the L(1) level, followed immediately by
   implantation of either embryonic cat spinal cord or neocortex into the
   cavity. The spinal cords of three control animals were hemisected but
   received no transplant. Each animal was subsequently imaged at 4 and 8
   weeks postoperative. Selected animals from each group were also studied
   at additional time points ranging hom immediately postoperative to 20
   weeks. Multislice T-2-weighted and intermediate T-1-weighted spin-echo
   images of the lesion or graft site were obtained. Correlative postmortem
   histological analyses revealed viable donor tissue in 6 of 12 transplant
   recipients. Spinal cords from the remaining hosts and the control
   animals all contained cysts at the surgical site that were devoid of
   donor neural tissue. The graft sites with viable tissue tended to
   exhibit a slightly hyperintense signal on both intermediate T-1-weighted
   (T1WI) and T-2-weighted images (T2WI) throughout the entire experiment.
   Control cats and cats with failed transplants also were slightly bright
   on T1WI, but were very hyperintense on T2WI. Comparison of the
   normalized mean pixel intensity on T1WI at the lesion or transplant
   epicenter showed no significant differences between viable grafts,
   failed grafts, and controls at any time point studied. In contrast,
   viable grafts had significantly less signal than both failed grafts and
   control lesions on T2WI at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperative. We conclude
   that transplant survival may be observed as early as 2 to 4 weeks
   postgrafting by the presence of medium signal intensity on T-2-weighted
   images. In addition, T1WI were not useful for predicting graft survival,
   but aided in defining the graft or lesion boundaries. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{According to Aschoff's rule the period of free-running circadian rhythms

   the endogenous circadian temperature rhythm using a recently developed
   mathematical model. Rats were exposed to various ambient light
   conditions while their free-running sleep-wake and temperature rhythms
   were recorded continuously. The results show that both frequency and
   endogenous amplitude were suppressed by light, indicating that circadian
   rhythmicity may disappear as a result of a suppression of the endogenous
   rhythm at long circadian cycle lengths. Furthermore, different light
   conditions producing significantly different free-running periods were
   accompanied by virtually identical activity levels. Therefore, it is
   concluded that the effect of light on the free-running period is the
   result of a direct modulation of the circadian system, rather than of
   indirect action by altering levels of locomotor activity.}},

   studies have been conducted for Cassini to identify trades and

Abstract = {{Through an experimental study of the stability properties of the human
   neuromuscular system while it performs simple point-to-point arm
   movements, this paper evaluates the concepts of equilibrium and virtual
   trajectories as a means of executing movement of the arm. Human subjects
   grasped the instrumented handle of a two-link robot manipulandum and
   performed specified point-to-point planar arm trajectories.
   Computer-controlled brakes were used to subtly change the movements by
   constraining the trajectory along an are of radius equal to the length
   of one link of the manipulandum. Tar-get points were arranged to lie
   along the are so that the subject could complete the movement even when
   constrained. Three situations were tested: (1) unconstrained throughout
   the movement, (2) constrained through the entire movement, and (3)
   initially constrained and then released during movement. Experimental
   results showed that the constraint evoked significant forces strongly
   oriented so as to restore the hand to the unconstrained hand path. In
   addition, when released from the constraint, these forces caused a
   strong tendency to return the hand to the unconstrained path before the
   end of the movement was reached. Such strong positional stability
   properties of the arm reinforce the notion that a moving attractor point
   dominates the dynamics of the arm during movement. Additionally, bounds
   on the shape of the virtual trajectory were found which indicate that
   the equilibrium point remains close to the actual movement produced.
   These results, showing that a controlled equilibrium point may be used
   for planning and coordinating multijoint movements, are consistent with
   an equilibrium point hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Many aspects of reproductive neuroendocrine function and sexual behavior
   are responsive to both androgens and estrogens, suggesting that
   receptors for these steroid hormones may reside within single cells in
   brain regions that control reproductive function. We determined the
   distribution of estrogen receptor-containing neurons in 40-mu m coronal
   brain sections in gonadectomized, DHT-treated male Syrian hamsters using
   immunocytochemistry with the H222 antibody (10 mu g/ml; Abbott
   Laboratories). Subsequently, we colocalized estrogen receptors with
   androgen receptors using the PG-21 antibody (0.5 mu g/ml; G.S. Prins).
   In males, the distribution of estrogen receptor-containing neurons was
   similar to that reported previously for the female hamster.
   Colocalization of androgen and estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was
   observed in brain regions that contain numerous androgen and estrogen
   receptor-positive neurons, including subdivisions of the medial preoptic
   area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, ventromedial nucleus of the
   hypothalamus, and the amygdalohippocampal area. Single-labelled estrogen
   receptor-containing neurons were most numerous in the
   amygdalohippocampal area and the rostral medial preoptic nucleus;
   androgen receptor-immunoreactive cells were most abundant in the ventral
   premammillary nucleus and the lateral septum. These data suggest the
   potential of androgens and estrogens to influence neuronal function
   within individual steroid receptor-containing neurons of the hamster
   limbic system.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous, quantitative, narrow-line laser absorption measurements of
   CN time-histories at 388.444 nn and OH time-histories at 306.687 nm have
   been made in incident and reflected shock wave experiments using dilute
   mixtures of nitric acid (HNO3) and HCN in argon. The thermal
   decomposition of HNO3 serves as a rapid source of OH upon shock-heating,
   and the OH subsequently reacts predominantly with the KCN in the test
   gas mixture. The rate coefficient for the reaction
   (1a) HCN + OH --> CN + H2O
   was determined in the temperature range 1120-1960 K via detailed
   kinetics modeling of the simultaneously acquired CN and OK measurements.
   These data are in good agreement with lower temperature measurements of
   the rate of the reverse reaction (-1a) when recent values of the heats
   of formation of CN and HCN are used. The expression
   k(1a) = 3.90 x 10(6)T(1.83) exp(-5179/T) cm(3)mol(-1)s(-1),
   valid for temperatures 500 to 2000 K, effectively represents the
   experimental measurements. The estimated uncertainty of the expression
   for k(1a) is +/- 30\%, based on the experimental uncertainties of the
   individual rate coefficient studies. Analysis of the decay region of the
   experimental OH time-histories yielded the total rate coefficient k(1)
   (all product channels) for the reaction of HCN with OH for temperatures
   ranging from 1490 to 1950 K. These measurements are consistent with a
   previous theoretical analysis of the three primary
   addition-isomerization-dissociation processes for the HCN + OH reaction
   at combustion temperatures when the contribution to k(1) from reaction
   (1a) is included. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons; Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. To examine patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with
   MR.
   Material and Methods. 495 consecutive patients with SNHL and 120
   age-matched healthy controls were examined. Spin-echo (SE) and fast
   spin-echo (FSE) images were used with 1.5 T equipment.
   Results. An intracranial abnormality was found in 211 (42.6\%) of the
   patients with 95 (19.2\%) along the acoustic pathway. Eleven of the 95
   patients had sensory hearing loss while 84 had neural hearing loss with
   the retrocochlear auditory pathway affected by lesions. In 62 of the 84
   patients, the internal acoustic canal and cerebellopontine angle were
   involved. Twenty-two patients had intra-axial lesions. The controls had
   no pathologic changes along the auditory pathway.
   Conclusion: MR imaging in a patient with SNHL must cover the entire
   acoustic pathway from the cochlea to the superior temporal gyrus, and
   all the components of the auditory pathway should be scrutinized. The
   FSE-technique can be used to detect the lesions causing SNHL.

   The carcinogenic potency of 10 natural samples has been previously
   investigated using intrapleural inoculation in rats, It was therefore
   possible to establish correlations between in vitro and in vivo data
   obtained with the same set of samples, The various samples of chrysotile
   produced different in vitro effects, in agreement with the dispersion of
   response also observed in vivo, Cytotoxicity appears to be dependent on
   both fibre length and fibre diameter, as the longest or thickest fibres
   were the most toxic, The production of abnormal anaphases/telophases
   appears to depend on the presence of fibres of selected size, such as
   those previously defined by Stanton et al, (L > 8 mu m; D less than or
   equal to 0.25 mu m); a threshold value was determined below which no
   abnormal anaphases/telophases were detected, This non-observable effect
   level was estimated to be 2.5 x 10(5) `Stanton' fibres per cm(2), There
   was no correlation between cytotoxicity and mesothelioma induction; in
   contrast, a correlation was found between the ability of a sample to
   produce chromosome missegregation in vitro and mesothelioma in vivo.}},

   Lowering the anisotropy field of the thin NiFe films not only increases

   experimental results show that the sensitivity is inversely proportional
   to the anisotropy field H-K, while the noise is inversely proportional
   to the (H-K)(2). The increased sensitivity of the MR sensor is
   attributed to the increased susceptibility of the sample films
   associated with lowering the anisotropy field. The noise level of the
   sensor is found to be increased with decreased anisotropy field, which
   can be explained by the induced instability of the magnetic domain
   structure of the NiFe films due to the anisotropy field decreased.}},

   problems remain within Western society, efficient accounts have become

Abstract = {{1 Endothelin (ET) has been implicated in cerebrovasospasm for example,
   following subarachnoid haemorrhage, and blocking the interaction of ET
   with its receptors on cerebral vessels, may be of therapeutic benefit.
   The aim of our study was to characterize endothelin receptor sub-types
   on medial smooth muscle cells of human cerebral vessels. Cultures of
   vascular smooth muscle cells were explanted from human cerebral
   resistance vessels and characterized as human brain smooth muscle cells
   (HBSMCs).
   2 Over a 48 h incubation period, HBSMC cultures secreted comparable
   levels of immunoreactive (IR) big endothelin-l (big ET-1) and IR
   endothelin (ET): 12.7 +/- 10.3 and 8.3 +/- 5.6 pmol/10(6) cells,
   respectively (mean +/- s.e.mean from three different individuals), into
   the culture medium.
   3 Total RNA was extracted from cultures of human brain smooth muscle
   cells. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays
   and subsequent product separation by agarose gel electrophoresis
   revealed single bands corresponding to the expected product sizes
   encoding cDNA for ET(A) (299 base pairs) and ET(B) (428 base pairs) (n =
   3 different cultures).
   4 Autoradiography demonstrated the presence of specific binding sites
   for {[}I-125]-ET-1 which labels all ET receptors, and
   {[}I-125]-PD151242, an ET(A) subtype-selective antagonist which
   exclusively labels ET(A) receptors, but no specific binding was detected
   using ET(B) subtype-selective {[}I-125]-BQ3020 (n = 3 different
   cultures, in duplicate).
   5 In saturation binding assays, {[}I-125]-ET-1 bound with high affinity:
   K-D = 0.8 +/- 0.1 nM and B-max = 690 +/- 108 fmol mg(-1). A one-site fit
   was preferred and Hill slopes were close to unity over the concentration
   range (10(-12) to 10(-8) M). {[}I-125]-PD151242 also bound with similar
   affinity: K-D = 0.4 +/- 0.1 nM and B-max = 388 +/- 68 fmol mg(-1) (mean
   +/- s.e.mean, n = 3 different cultures). Again, a one-site fit was
   preferred and Hill slopes were close to unity over the concentration
   range. Unlabelled PD151242 competed for the binding of {[}I-125]-ET-1
   monophasically and analysis of the competition curves indicated that a
   one-site fit was preferred over a two-site model, implying that the
   cultures express mainly ET(A) receptors.
   6 Although messenger RNA encoding both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors was
   detected, autoradiographical analysis, as well as binding studies
   indicate that human cultured brain smooth muscle cells express only
   ET(A) receptor protein. Antagonism of this sub-type may be necessary to
   block the actions of ET-1 in the human cerebral resistance vessels in
   the vasospasm observed subsequent to subarachnoid haemorrhage.}},

Abstract = {{1-{[}C-11]-3-R,S-methylheptadecanoic acid (BMHA) is a branched chain
   fatty acid analog that is transported into the myocardium. Due to
   incomplete metabolism, however, radiolabeled products are trapped within
   myocytes. Recently, we demonstrated that this compound is an excellent
   tracer to monitor fatty acid metabolism. Method: To evaluate the effect
   of mono-unsaturation on myocardial substrate utilization, we prepared
   1-{[}C-11]-3-R,S-methyl-trans-heptadec-7-enoic acid (t-7-BMHA) and
   measured its biodistribution in rats. In addition, preliminary PET
   studies were performed on dogs. Results: Biodistribution studies
   demonstrated that myocardial-to-lung and myocardial-to-blood ratios for
   t-7-BMHA are higher than those for BMHA. Fifteen minutes after
   injection, heart-to-lung ratios were 5.23 compared to 2.92 and
   heart-to-liver ratios were 3.07 compared to 1.41 for t-7-BMHA and BMHA.
   By 30 min postinjection heart-to-lung ratios were 7.03 compared to 5.88
   and heart-to-liver ratios were 4.43 compared to 1.09. The heart-to-blood
   ratio of t-7-BMHA was greater than 11:1. PET imaging with
   1-{[}C-11]-t-7-BMHA demonstrated high myocardial extraction, prolonged
   retention of radioactivity and excellent image quality. Accumulation of
   radioactivity in the myocardium reached a plateau within 10 min
   postinjection, with heart-to-blood ratios exceeding 20:1 and
   heart-to-lung ratios exceeding 10:1. Blood clearance of radioactivity
   was biphasic with half-times of 1.46 and 14.7 min, respectively.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that introduction of a trans-double bond
   in BMHA improves myocardial selectivity and results in a potentially
   superior imaging agent.}},

   as well as the residual bodies were not stained with anti-B23
   antibodies. Upon cell exposure to nocodazole (0.1 mu g/ml, 2 h)
   destroying the mitotic spindle, B23 was uniformly distributed over the

   cases of aneurysm, 34 cases of arteriovenous malformation, and 53 other
   cases who underwent neurosurgery for drainage of sub-dural haematoma,
   relief of cerebral oedema and other indications. A total of 6 (1.75\%)
   cases of postoperative infection was observed, of which 4 were found in
   the malignant tumour group, and 2 in the arteriovenous malformation
   group. All six patients were suffering from meningitis. During the 12
   month period immediately prior to the present study, when postoperative
   penicillin and gentamicin was administered twice daily for 5-7 days as
   regular prophylaxis against infection, the incidence of postoperative
   infection was 7.2\% in the same department managed by the same staff

Abstract = {{The effect of hormonal therapy on enhancing recovery from neonatal
   malnutrition was assessed in rats. Malnutrition was induced by maternal
   food restriction (60\% control intake) during lactation. On d 16
   postpartum, restricted pups were refed by cross-fostering to control
   dams and were subcutaneously administered growth hormone (GH),
   insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), GH + IGF-I or saline. At d 21,
   pups were weaned and continued hormonal treatments until d 39 postpartum
   By d 39, body weight of GH (96\% control) and GH + IGF-I- (98\%) treated
   animals were normal, whereas IGF-I (88\%) and saline- (85\%) treated
   animals were still stunted. Hormone effectiveness was age dependent,
   with growth rates of GH + IGF-I-, IGF-I- and GH-treated pups being
   greatest between d 16 and 30, d 16 and 21 and after d 30, respectively.
   Protein accretion by d 39 was higher (P < 0.01) in GH and GH + IGF-I
   groups than saline- or ICE-I-treated groups. On d 39, serum IGF-I
   concentrations were as follows: GH + IGF-I > IGF-I > GH = saline
   (placebo), indicating that an elevated serum IGF-I was not required for
   GH-stimulated growth. Of the three hormonal treatments, GH + IGF-I
   therapy was most efficacious at promoting rapid and complete body weight
   recovery and supporting lean body mass accretion.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin may be important
   regulators of intestinal growth. To investigate small intestinal IGF-I
   receptors (IGF-IR) and insulin receptors (IR) during intestinal cell
   atrophy and regeneration, we compared indexes of IGF-IR and IR
   expression in rat jejunum after 72 h of fasting and 24-72 h-of enteral
   refeeding. Fasting induced intestinal atrophy, reduced plasma insulin
   and IGF-I concentrations, and markedly decreased jejunal IGF-I messenger
   RNA (mRNA) levels; these changes were reversed by refeeding. Fasting
   significantly increased jejunal specific insulin binding, IR content (to
   230\% of the fed control value), and the 9.6- and 7.4-kilobase IR mRNA
   transcript levels (to 202\% and 218\% of control values, respectively).
   These IR indexes rapidly decreased to control levels with refeeding.
   Levels of IGF-IR (by Scatchard analysis) and IGF-I-R mRNA were not
   significantly altered with fasting. The 11-kilobase IGF-IR mRNA
   transcript increased significantly during the first 24 h of refeeding
   (to 166\% of the control value), and IGF-IR number rose 3-fold. We
   conclude that rat jejunal IR and IGF-IR are differentially regulated by
   nutrient availability. Up-regulation of jejunal IGF-I and IGF-IR
   expression during refeeding suggests a role for the IGF action pathway
   in gut trophic responses to enteral nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{Cells exposed to temperature a few degrees higher than their growth
   temperature synthesize heat shock proteins (hsp) which may then compose
   even 20\% of total protein content. This paper examined the in vitro
   protective effect of heat shock protein DnaK (70 kDa) from Escherichia
   coli against the heat inactivation of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme
   LDH-A(4). The LDH-A(4) isoenzyme was purified from fish skeletal muscle
   using the affinity chromatography on Oxamate-agarose. The enzyme was
   then heated in the absence and the presence of DnaK protein in a water
   bath at either 51 or 55 degrees C. The LDH activity was determined by
   measuring the change in absorbency at 340 mn min(-1) at 30 degrees C.
   The addition of DnaK protein to the LDH-A(4) isoenzyme before heat
   treatment can protect enzyme activity against mild thermal inactivation.
   Incubation of the LDH-A(4) isoenzyme at 51 degrees C in the presence of
   DnaK protein stimulates its activity by about 30\%. The presence of 2mM
   ATP can raise LDH activity by another 10\%. No significant recovery was
   observed when DnaK protein was added to LDH at 25 degrees C following
   earlier inactivation. The maximal activities (V-max) in the presence of
   DnaK protein are almost twice those without DnaK protein in the case of
   heat-treated LDH-A(4) isoenzyme at 51 degrees C. The observed protection
   of LDH-A(4) activity increased with the increasing DnaK protein
   concentration in the incubation medium. Results suggested that the
   presence of DnaK protein can protect LDH-A(4) from heat inactivation.
   This action may be important as a part of cellular chaperone machinery
   capable of repairing heat-induced protein damage. It may have a
   fundamental role in the acquisition of the thermotolerance to stress
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus has been proven to be the major cause of NANB
   hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Based on
   the genome similarities between HCV and flavivirus or pestivirus, this
   agent has been included within the family Flaviviridae as a separate
   genus. Among the analogies between HCV and the other members of the same
   family there is the possibility of infecting blood cells. In particular,
   significant evidence obtained through studies performed in vivo and in
   vitro support the concept that HCV is not only a hepatotropic but also a
   lymphotropic virus. This suggests that, in addition to playing a role in
   inducing hepatic diseases (both of a non-tumoral and a neoplastic
   nature), HCV infection may also play a role in extrahepatic pathologies.
   The striking association observed between HCV infection and some
   autoimmune-lymphoproliferative disorders of either benign or neoplastic
   nature is consistent with this hypothesis. However, in analogy with what
   has been observed in the case of liver disease, the mechanisms involved
   in the pathogenesis of HCV-related extra-hepatic manifestations have to
   be more deeply analysed and clarified.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined analytically the effects of different NMR magnetization
   exchange network editing (MENE) procedures, starting from equilibrium or
   nonequilibrium conditions, on generalized systems that undergo
   magnetization exchange (cross-relaxation and/or chemical exchange).
   Larger errors in derived exchange rate constants are found in
   experiments that start from nonequilibrium states than in those that
   start from equilibrium. On the other hand, editing experiments that
   decompose the dynamic matrix into two or more block diagonal submatrices
   generally yield more accurate exchange rate constants. Theoretical
   arguments, backed up by experimental results, demonstrate that MENE
   experiments lead to increased rates of relaxation for the edited cross
   and diagonal peaks. We describe a new class of heteronuclear editing
   experiment in which the system starts from a nonequilibrium state and is
   edited during the mixing period. In an experimental application of this
   approach to the spectral analysis of a small protein, recombinant human
   ubiquitin (M(r) 8565) labeled uniformly with N-15 and C-13, We
   demonstrate how the cross-relaxation network of the protein can be
   decomposed simultaneously into subnetworks of N-15-bound protons,
   aliphatic C-13-bound protons, aromatic C-13-bound protons, and
   (C-12/N-14/O)-bound protons, Such a decomposition permits the
   measurement of slower magnetization exchange rates, including those that
   are masked in conventional cross-relaxation experiments.}},

   microprojectile bombardment of highly regenerative stem segments. A
   two-step regeneration procedure based on the use of two different
   cytokinins-6-benzylaminopurine and thidiazuron-was employed for the
   production of adventitious shoots from stem segments. The size of the
   original stem was found to affect the regeneration efficiency of stem
   segments: the highest efficiency of adventitious shoot regeneration was
   obtained with segments originating from stems with two mature leaves, as
   compared to those with four, six or eight mature leaves. The tissue
   culture procedure was shown to be suitable for a number of standard and
   spray cultivars. Bombardment of cultivar `'White Sim'' stem segments was
   performed with a plasmid containing uidA and bar genes encoding
   beta-glucuronidase and phosphinothricin-acetyltransferase, respectively.
   Transformation frequency was determined, based on the transient
   expression of uidA in stem segments. Following selection in the presence
   of the herbicide bialaphos, about 70 plantlets per 100 stem segments
   were recovered. Upon analysis, about 3\% of these recovered plantlets
   exhibited strong stable uidA expression throughout the plant. Presence
   of the bar gene in plants stably expressing uidA was confirmed by
   Southern blot analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In previous work (Zurdo J, Fernandez-Cabrera C and Ramirez JM (1993)
   Biochem J 290: 531-537), it had been shown that selective extraction of
   the carotenoid from the light-harvesting protein 2 (LH2) of Rhodobacter
   capsulatus induced the dissociation of 800-nm absorbing
   bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl), a 10-nm red shift of 854-nm Bchl, and a
   decrease of the stability of the protein in detergent solution. In the
   present study, the Fourier transform Raman and near-infrared circular
   dichroism spectra of native and carotenoid-depleted LH2 membrane
   preparations were compared. It was found that while the coupled
   carbonyls of 854-nm Bchl remained specifically H-bonded to the peptides
   after carotenoid extraction, the optical activity of the near-infrared
   electronic transition was significantly altered. Given the excitonic
   origin of such optical activity, our data suggest that carotenoid
   extraction elicits a rearrengement of the chromophore cluster and of the
   associated polypeptide subunits. This implies a significant role of the
   carotenoid in maintaining the native quaternary structure of the
   protein, which would be consistent with the observed dissociation of
   800-nm Bchl and the loss of solubilized LH2 stability that result from
   carotenoid removal. There is no evidence for a similar role of the
   carotenoid in the LH1 protein.}},

Title = {{INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO BILATERAL-NEPHRECTOMY IN RAT CAUSED BY

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{In this study the possibility that the kidneys play a role in the
   removal of endotoxin from the blood was examined. This was carried out
   by an IP injection of endotoxin (at a dosage of 1 mg/100 gr) to rats
   that had undergone bilateral nephrectomy, and examining the times of
   death following various treatments. Furthermore, the rats underwent
   treat ment for endotoxin tolerance or received treatment with the
   antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and natural antioxidant (NAG) or
   were injected with an inhibitor of the enzyme NOS (N(G)methyl 1-arginine
   1-NMA). The endotoxin concentration in the plasma was also measured. The
   results of this study indicate the rats were more sensitive to bilateral
   nephrectomy in the presence of endotoxin. This increased sensitivity in
   the binephrectomized rat decreases following treatment inducing
   tolerance to endotoxin, or following treatment with an antioxidant or
   with the inhibitor of NOS. A possible explanation for the increased
   sensitivity following endotoxin injection is that it apparently results
   from an increased concentration of endotoxin in the blood due to the
   impossibility of removing the endotoxin via the kidneys. Therefore,
   endotoxin tolerance or abolishing the potential injuries that may be
   caused by endotoxin negate the sensitivity in the binephrectomized rats
   injected with endotoxin.}},

Abstract = {{The response was good-one of the best the SAIMM has had to its various
   questionnaires. 231 replies were received from 2768 members representing
   a response of 8,35\%. For fellows and Members together, the response was
   13,7\%. The spread of responses based on respondents' work situation
   appeared to be well balanced with some bias from those in consulting
   organizations.
   Members' perceptions of their employers' positions with respect to
   environmental management looked somewhat optimistic, but it is
   encouraging to note that they reported that more than half were
   developing environmental management systems. Training of varying degree
   was taking place at all levels in their organizations.
   Members saw their Institute as an important agent in lifting
   environmental awareness, literacy and responsibility not only through
   the journal and symposia, but also by liaison with government
   departments and educational institutions.
   Most respondents saw environmental legislation both from local and
   overseas sources as affecting their organizations, their products and
   services with the emphasis on corporate image, core business and sales.}},

Abstract = {{The solid state redox chemistry of microcrystalline salts of the Dawson
   anion {[}S2Mo18O62](4-) precipitated with large organic Voltammograms
   are obtained by mechanically attaching water insoluble
   heteropolymolybdate salts to a basal-plane pyrolytic graphite electrode
   which is then placed in aqueous electrolyte media. A considerable number
   of pH-dependent reduction processes are observed which fall into two
   categories.
   (i) Relatively weak responses that correspond to reversible two
   electron-two proton reduction steps. Despite differences in the mass
   transport mechanism these five processes are otherwise related to the
   solution phase voltammetric behaviour of{[}S2Mo18O62](4-) in acidified
   organic solvent media and are summarized by the equation
   {[}HnS2Mo18O62](x-) + 2e(-) + 2H(+) reversible arrow
   {[}Hn+2S2Mo18O62](x-)
   The observed 60 mV pH(-1) shift of voltammetric potentials is consistent
   with this mechanism.
   (ii) At negative potentials and in the presence of an appropriate
   electrolyte, processes with considerably larger peak currents are shown
   by electron microprobe analysis of the solid to be accompanied by cation
   (Cs+, Ba2+) uptake. Voltammetric data confirm that at the potentials
   where Cs+ and Ba2+ insertion occurs, that the solids are highly reduced.
   The pH dependence suggests that competition occurs between cation and
   proton uptake in the highly reduced solid. Therefore the major processes
   in the presence of a metal ion such as Cs+ are described by the equation
   (NR(4))(4){[}S2Mo18O62] + xCs(+) + yH(+) + (x + y) e(-) reversible arrow
   (NR(4))(4)CsxHy{[}S2Mo18O62]
   The initial voltammetric responses are interpreted in terms of electron
   transfer and charge neutralization processes that are confined to a
   region near to the surface of the solid heteropolymolybdate salt,
   whereas the major processes at more negative potentials that are
   facilitated by insertion of Cs+ or Ba2+ are associated with changes in
   the structure of the solid.}},

   is important for understanding not only their bonding and molecular
   properties but also the photochemical and photophysical processes
   involved. In this work, the potential energy distribution procedure,
   Badger's rule and Hershbach and Laurie's equation were modified and
   represented in the symmetry coordinates instead of internal ones as
   proposed by other workers. These three methods were applied to determine
   the structural parameters of triatomic molecules in different electronic
   states. The results obtained are compared with those from experimental
   work, ab initio calculations and Franck-Condon analyses. The major
   advantage of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other theoretical
   methods is that it is simple and fast in structure determination, with
   only vibrational frequencies and reference geometries required.}},

   various electrolyte solutions. It is found that a freshly prepared

   photocurrent and the PL intensity increase substantially with time when
   the electrode is illuminated during cyclic potential scans in 0.05 M
   H2SO4. This is accompanied by the formation of a large number of
   micropores at the electrode surface. No such activation is observed in
   0.1 M HClO4 and 0.5 M Na2SO4, but an n-TiO2 electrode activated by
   illumination in H2SO4 shows an efficient photocurrent and strong PL in

   transcription in vitro by 640\%, 233\%, and 218\% respectively during 15
   min of incubation at 37 degrees C, Kinetic anaysis of effects of U3 RNA
   at a concentration of 4 mu M showed marked increase in Fate (200\%) and
   net transcription (400\%) of nucleolar RNA in isolated nucleoli of rat
   liver, These results indicate that U3 RNA may function in the initiation
   as well as in the elongation reaction of nucleolar RNA transcription.
   However, kinetic analysis of effects of m(3)(2,2,7)G nucleoside
   increased the initial transcription rate (150\%) but not the net
   transcrption of nucleolar RNA. Also, m(3)(2,2,7)G prevented RNA
   polymerase inactivation in preincubation period. In agreement with
   theses results, 5' terminal labeling with {[}gamma-P-32]ATP or
   {[}gamma-P-32]GTP did not change in the presence of m(3)(2,2,7)G
   nucleoside, These results show that m(3)(2,2,7)G does not increase new
   initiation of RNA transcription but stabilizes the existing
   transcription complex and increases the rate of transcription as well as
   preventing loss of complex during preincubation. These results suggest
   that trimethylguanosine capped U3 RNA appears to be essential for

Abstract = {{A flow injection method for the determination of L-arginine and

   developed. The open-closed system used permits turbidimetric
   multidetection of the signal in the crystallization of L-histidine in
   the presence of an organic solvent (2-propanol). The proposed method
   permits the selective determination of L-arginine (0.3-12 mg l(-1)) and
   L-ornithine (0.5-20 mg l(-1)) in the presence of their D-enantiomers and
   other L-amino acids without the need for a prior separation. The
   relative standard deviation was ca. 2.3\% (n = 11). Both amino acids
   were determined satisfactorily in pharmaceutical preparations, and their
   recovery after addition to samples was 100 +/- 3\%. The sampling
   frequency was 7 +/- 1 h(-1).}},

Abstract = {{We report evidence for quasicontinuous optical gain in CdS quantum dots
   fabricated by the sol-gel process and embedded in glass. The gain
   spectra are obtained using the pump and probe technique and nanosecond
   (quasiresonant) excitation at 11 K. The dots are in the intermediate
   quantum confinement regime and the concentration of CdS is relatively
   high. The gain, which is spectrally broad, develops on the low energy
   side of the absorption band edge. The reason why the gain region is
   broad is not only the size distribution of the dots, but also the nature
   of the gain, which originates from the recombination of several excited
   levels between two and one electron-hole pairs states (i.e., biexciton
   to exciton), The maximum measured gain reaches 200 cm(-1) at 11 K and 17
   cm(-1) at 170 K. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the diagnostic value of ions as markers for
   differentiating antemortem from postmortem wounds was investigated. To
   accomplish this, skin and muscle samples were taken from antemortem and
   postmortem wounded cadavers and the contents of ions (Fe, Zn, Mg, Cu, K
   and Na) were determined with atomic absorption spectrophotometery. Our
   results show that the concentrations of Fe in antemortem wounded skin
   and muscle were significantly higher as compared with the control skin
   and muscle and the K/Na ratio in antemortem wounded muscle was reduced
   significantly compared to control muscle. However, the concentrations of
   Zn, Mg, Cu in antemortem wounded skin and muscle, and the K/Na ratio in
   antemortem wounded skin, were not significantly different from their
   controls. The concentrations of all these ions in postmortem wounded
   skin and muscles were not significantly different from their controls.
   It is indicated that the concentrations of Fe in skin and muscle and
   K/Na ratio in muscle are useful markers for differentiating antemortem
   from postmortem wounds. However, their routine use in forensic practice
   needs further investigation, since there are some overlaps of the ionic
   concentrations between normal and wounded skin and muscle.}},

Abstract = {{By analogy with the elastic theory of solid shells(1) and fluid
   membranes,(2) it has been suggested that fullerenes, at least large
   ones, might somehow resemble the classic elastic continuum, as indicated
   by Schnur.(3) Some related works dealt with nanotubes do show positive
   evidence for this suggestion.(4) Here we propose an elastic continuum
   model appropriate to graphite-like networks. Applying it to various
   shapes of fullerenes, such as spheres, tubes, tori, and minimal
   surfaces, we found good agreement between this model and previous
   numerical results given by approaches of ab initio or empirical
   potential. Furthermore, this model enables one to understand the
   puzzling phenomena such as why Schwarzite P216 and Schwarzite D216 have
   nearly identical bending energies while their geometric forms are very
   different (see Pig. 1). The prospect of this model is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{37 patients aged 80 or over underwent cardiac surgery during an 11-year
   period. Operative indications included angina, dyspnea and syncope. The
   majority of patients (n = 32) had a left ventricular ejection fraction
   greater than 0.5. There were 28 aortic valve procedures, of which seven
   were combined with coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), and 2 with
   mitral valve repair; in addition, 7 isolated CABG procedures and one
   isolated mitral valve repair were performed. 36-day mortality was 5.4\%
   (2 patients); 9 patients died at a later date (2.5 to 118 months after
   surgery). The most frequent postoperative complications were atrial
   fibrillation, pulmonary infection or atelectasis, transient delirium and
   atrioventricular conduction disturbances. Mean hospital stay was 14.5
   days. 1- and 5-year actuarial survival rates were 83\% and 57\%. In a
   control group of patients aged 60-69 matched for preoperative
   characteristics, there were no in-hospital fatalities and 1- and 5-year
   survival were, respectively 100\% and 52\%. Among complications, only
   conduction disturbances and transient delirium were significantly more
   frequent in the octogenarian group. At follow-up, the proportion of
   severely symptomatic octogenarians had diminished to 24\% from 84\%. In
   conclusion, cardiac surgery can be performed on octogenarians with
   adequate myocardial reserve, exposing them to a perioperative mortality
   that is in the range of younger age groups while offering an equivalent
   prospect for functional improvement.}},

Title = {{MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY 9EG7 DEFINES A NOVEL BETA(1) INTEGRIN EPITOPE
   INDUCED BY SOLUBLE LIGAND AND MANGANESE, BUT INHIBITED BY CALCIUM}},

Abstract = {{The monoclonal antibody 9EG7 has been previously found to recognize an
   epitope induced by manganese on the integrin beta(1) chain (Lenter, M.,
   Uhlig, H., Hamann, A., Jeno, P., Imhof, B., and Vestweber, D. (1993)
   Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 9051-9055). Here we show that
   treatment of beta(1) integrins with manganese or soluble integrin
   ligands (e.g. fibronectin and RGD peptide) induced the 9EG7 epitope.
   This epitope was also induced upon EGTA treatment to remove calcium, and
   the addition of calcium inhibited 9EG7 epitope induction by manganese or
   by Ligand. Further emphasizing the importance of the 9EG7 epitope, the
   9EG7 antibody itself stimulated adhesion mediated by multiple beta(1)
   integrins, and conversely, ligands for alpha(2) beta(1), alpha(3)
   beta(1), alpha(4) beta(1), and alpha(5) beta(1) all stimulated 9EG7
   expression. Together these results support a model whereby (i) calcium
   inhibits beta(1) integrin function because it prevents the appearance of
   a conformation favorable to ligand binding and (ii) manganese enhances
   beta(1) integrin function because it induces the same favorable
   conformation that is induced by adding Ligand, or removing calcium.
   Notably, other beta(1)-stimulating agents (magnesium and mAb TS2/16) did
   not induce 9EG7 expression unless ligand was also present. Thus,
   although 9EG7 may reliably detect the ligand-bound conformation of
   beta(1) integrins, its expression does not always correlate with
   integrin `'activation.'' Finally, mouse/chicken beta(1) chimeric
   molecules were used to map the 9EG7 epitope to beta(1) residues 495-602
   within the cysteine-rich region, and antibody cross-blocking studies
   showed that the 9EG7 epitope is distinct from all previously defined
   human beta(1) epitopes.}},

Abstract = {{Human platelets pretreated with indomethacin release arachidonic acid
   predominantly through the activity of cytosolic phospholipase A(2)
   (cPLA(2)), an 85-kDa protein. This enzyme is regulated by an increase in
   intracellular Ca2+, a necessary condition for arachidonic acid
   liberation, and by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of cPLA(2) enhanced
   the Ca2+-induced arachidonic acid release in platelets stimulated by the
   ionophore A23187 and phorbol ester (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu)). In
   thrombin-stimulated platelets, however, phosphorylation appeared not to
   be necessary for arachidonic acid release since the latter response was
   not impaired in the presence of staurosporine, which inhibited
   phosphorylation. Collagen, thrombin, and PDBu induced phosphorylation of
   platelet cPLA(2) as well as activation of mitogen-activated protein
   kinase (MAPH; p42(maph) and p44(mapk)). cPLA(2) activation was not
   dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) in thrombin- and collagen-stimulated
   platelets, as preincubation with the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 neither
   interfered with cPLA(2) phosphorylation nor reduced arachidonic acid
   release, However, collagen- and thrombin-induced activation of MAPK was
   inhibited by Ro 31-8220, indicating that PKC is necessary for MAPK
   stimulation in platelets. Although MAPH may underlie phosphorylation of
   cPLA(2) in PDBu-activated human platelets, our results provide evidence
   for PKC- and MAPK-independent phosphorylation of cPLA(2) in platelets
   stimulated by the physiological activators collagen and thrombin.}},

Abstract = {{Two aminoalkyl bonded phases, aminopropylsilica and
   dimenthylaminopropylsilica, operated in the normal-phase mode were
   investigated regarding the retention mechanisms of polycyclic aromatic
   nitrogen heterocyclics (PANHs). By blocking active interaction sites
   with methyl substituents, the retention mechanisms could be ascertained.
   The bonded functional groups of the aminoalkyl stationary phases were
   found to be the primary adsorption sites. Hydrogen bonding was found to
   be the dominant retention mechanism for carbazole-type PANHs on both
   stationary phases and for acridine-type PANHs on the aminopropyl phase.
   For acridine-type PANHs on dimethylaminopropylsilica, retention was
   found to be mainly due to electron donor-acceptor interaction. Residual
   silanols on the stationary phase support material on these
   non-end-capped bonded phases were found to contribute only slightly to
   the retention of both acridine- and carbazole-type PANHs. A strong
   dependence of retention on steric hindrance of the n-electrons on the
   nitrogen of acridine-type solutes was shown. Further, the necessity to
   consider not only the polarity and solvent strength but also the
   selectivity of the mobile phase is demonstrated.}},

   highly potent and selective 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitors. These
   compounds are structurally simpler than previous compounds of similar
   potency in that they contain a single chiral center. From the data
   presented,
   2-{[}{[}1-(3-chlorobenzyl)-4-methyl-6-{[}(5-phenylpyridin-2-yl)methoxy]-
   4,5-dihydro-1H-thiopyrano {[}2,3,4-c,d]indol-2-yl]methoxy]phenylacetic
   acid, 14b, was shown to inhibit 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid
   (5-HPETE) production by human 5-LO (IC50 of 18 nM). The acid 14b is
   highly selective as an inhibitor of 5-LO activity when compared to the
   inhibition of ram seminal vesicle cyclooxygenase (IC50 > 5 mu M) or
   human leukocyte leukotriene A(4) (LTA(4)) hydrolase (IC50 > 20 mu M). In
   addition, 14b was inactive in a 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP)
   binding assay at 10 mu M. In vivo studies showed that 14b is
   bioavailable in rat and functionally active in the hyperreactive rat
   model of antigen-induced dyspnea (74\% inhibition at 0.5 mg/kg po; 2 h
   pretreatment). In the conscious squirrel monkey model of asthma, 14b
   showed excellent functional activity at 0.1 mg/kg against
   antigen-induced bronchoconstriction (94\% inhibition of the increase in
   R(L) and 100\% inhibition in the decrease in C-dyn; n = 4) Resolution of
   this compound gave (-)-14b, the most potent enantiomer (IC50 = 10 nM in
   the human 5-LO assay), which was shown to possess the S configuration at
   the chiral center by X-ray crystallographic analysis of an intermediate.
   Subsequent studies on the aryl thiopyrano{[}2,3,4-c,d]indole series of
   inhibitors led to the discovery of potent dual inhibitors of both FLAP
   and 5-LO, the most potent of which is
   2-{[}{[}1-(4-chlorobenzyl)-4-methyl-6-(quinolin-2-ylmethoxy)
   -4,5-dihydro-1H-thiopyrano{[}2,3,4-c,d]indol-2-yl]methoxy]phenylacetic
   acid, 19. Acid 19 has an IC50 of 100 nM for the inhibition of 5-HPETE
   production by human 5-LO and is active in a FLAP binding assay with an
   IC50 of 32 nM. Furthermore, thiopyrano{[}2,3,4-c,d]indoles such as 1 and
   14b are capable of inhibiting the LTC(4) synthase reaction in a dose
   dependent manner (IC(50)s of 11 and 16 mu M, respectively, compared to
   that of LTC(2) at 1.2 mu M) in contrast to other, structurally distinct
   5-LO inhibitors. It has also been observed that the
   thiopyrano{[}2,3,4-c,d]indole class of compounds strongly promotes the
   translocation of 5-LO from the cytosol to a membrane fraction in the
   presence or absence of the ionophore A23187. The membrane-bound 5-LO
   retains its activity, and this association with the membrane is not
   reversed with the FLAP inhibitor MK-886. These observations, in part,
   support the hypothesis that these compounds act by binding at the
   arachidonic acid-binding site on FLAP, 5-LO, and LTC(4) synthase and
   that the thiopyrano{[}2,3,4-c,d]indole is capable of mimicking an active
   conformation of arachidonic acid.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36-residue polypeptide produced abundantly in
   both nervous and peripheral tissues, appears to play a significant role
   in the regulation of diverse biological processes, including feeding
   behavior and cardiovascular and psychotropic functions. The actions of
   NPY are mediated through effective binding to specific receptors of
   which two, designated Y-1 and Y-2, have been well characterized. A
   shortened cyclic analogue of NPY, dex-AA(10-17)-cyclo-7/21
   {[}Cys(7,21)]NPY,(1) was shown to retain high affinity for both human
   neuroblastoma SK-N-MC and SK-N-BE2 cell types (expressing Y-1 and Y-2
   receptors, respectively). Increasing the size of the ring
   (des-AA(10-17)-cyclo-2/27{[}Cys(2,27)]NPY) in the present study produced
   a high-affinity analogue (K-i = 3.0 vs 0.3 nM for NPY) that bound
   exclusively to Y-2 receptors. Using the feedback from structure-activity
   relationships, we also describe the optimization of specific
   substitutions and bridging arrangements leading to the production of
   other truncated, high-affinity Y-1 selective analogues which bind, as
   does NPY itself, in the low-nanomolar range. Of greatest significance,
   des-AA(10-17)-cyclo-7/21{[}Cys(7,21),Pro(34)]NPY (11) was found to
   possess agonistic properties with an affinity comparable to that of the
   native NPY molecule when tested for its ability to inhibit
   norepinephrine-stimulated cAMP release in SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma
   cells. Compound 11 also caused an increase in blood pressure in
   anesthetized rats. However, in two central nervous system models of Y-1
   receptor function, stimulation of feeding and anxiolytic activity, this
   analogue was inactive, which suggests the presence of a new subclass of
   receptors. In summary, the present results demonstrate that residues
   10-17 of NPY are not directly involved in either Y-1 or Y-2 receptor
   recognition or activation. This suggests that the selectivity of NPY
   receptors is highly dependent on subtle conformational changes such as

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediates induction
   of transcription factor NF kappa B and activation of the cytomegalovirus
   (CMV) promoter-enhancer in the SW480 cell Line. These cells do not
   express a functional membrane CD14. The LPS response in SW480 cells was
   weaker and markedly slower than the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
   response. Pretreatment with TNF for 72 h inhibited both TNF, tumor
   necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) p55, TNFR p75, and LPS-mediated
   activation of nuclear factor -kappa B (NF kappa B), whereas pretreatment
   with LPS only inhibited the LPS response. TNFR p55 antibody pretreatment
   resulted in marked inhibition of the LPS response, while pretreatment
   with TNFR p75 antiserum only had a weak inhibitory effect.
   Flowcytometric analysis showed that LPS binding as well as expression of
   TNFR p55 and TNFR p75 were not affected by LPS or TNF pretreatment,
   indicating that the observed inhibition is not due to reduction of
   specific binding sites at the cell surface. The results suggest that LPS
   signaling in SW480 cells involves intracellular components which may be
   depleted or inactivated via TNFR p55, indicating that the LPS and TNFR
   p55 pathways overlap. We propose that TNFR p55 can mediate activation of
   NF kappa B and cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer in SW480 cells via two
   distinct mechanisms, one which is activated only via TNFR p55 and leads
   to rapid activation of NF kappa B, and another which is overlapping with
   the LPS pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein belonging to the intermediate filament
   protein family, exhibits a complex pattern of expression. In the case of
   the chicken vimentin gene, several regulatory elements within the 5'
   region of the gene have been characterized, including an enhancer
   activity between -160 and -320, which may contribute to the
   down-regulation of vimentin expression during myogenesis. In this study,
   sequences within this region were examined via transient transfections
   of various deletion constructs, and two distinct enhancer elements were
   found, one on either side of a previously described silencer element.
   These two enhancer elements also enhanced transcription when fused
   separately to the basal promoter region of the chicken vimentin gene.
   Gel mobility shift assays, UV cross-linking experiments, and DNase I
   protection studies indicate that these two enhancer elements and the
   silencer element all contain a common binding site for the previously
   described 95-kDa silencer element binding protein, suggesting that this
   regulatory protein can act as both an activator and a repressor.}},

Abstract = {{The factors affecting the immunogenicity of a humanized gamma 1 CD3
   monoclonal antibody (mAb) were investigated in transgenic mice that
   express the human CD3 antigen epsilon polypeptide (the mAb target
   antigen). Two derivatives of the mAb were employed, one with a normal,
   glycosylated Fc region (gamma 1 CD3 mAb), and the other with an
   aglycosylated Fc region (aglycosyl gamma 1 CD3 mAb). Comparisons of the
   antiglobulin responses elicited by the two derivatives in transgenic and
   nontransgenic mice demonstrated that Fab-mediated cell binding activity,
   dependent on target antigen expression, was a major positive determinant
   of CD3 mAb immunogenicity. A second positive factor was mAb Fc region
   glycosylation. At low dose levels the gamma 1 CD3 mAb consistently
   produced a higher antiglobulin response than the aglycosyl gamma 1 CD3
   mAb. This was probably a result of the nonspecific, in vivo T cell
   activating property of the gamma 1 CD3 mAb, a consequence of its ability
   to cross-link T cells to Bey receptor-bearing cells. (The aglycosyl
   gamma 1 CD3 mAb has a reduced Fe binding affinity for Fc gamma receptors
   and so does not activate T cells in vivo.) In support of this
   hypothesis, the gamma 1 CD3 mAb was able to nonspecifically enhance
   humoral immunity to an unrelated, coadministered antigen, whereas the
   aglycosyl gamma 1 CD3 mAb was not. The lower immunogenicity of the
   aglycosyl gamma 1 CD3 mAb correlated with a longer in vivo half-life and
   an improved capacity to block the target CD3 antigen. These results
   suggest that, as well as reducing the cytokine-induced side effects
   normally associated with CD3 mAb therapy, the nonactivating aglycosyl
   gamma 1 CD3 mAb will be less likely than the activating gamma 1 CD3 mAb
   to stimulate a neutralizing antiglobulin response.}},

   An energy scaling by D-VS, instead of the spectroscopic D-e, allows the

   energy curve (VS-PEG). The second and higher derivatives at the
   equilibrium distance, R(e), are simple functions of a valence state
   parameter z = k(e)R(e)(2)/D-VS. The analysis of the VS-PECs of 25 single

Abstract = {{We studied the influence of the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus
   (Mackin, Owen \& Collier) on reproduction in the eastern oyster
   Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin) from 2 sub-estuaries of central
   Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, in 1990 and 1991. One hypothesis was that
   increased levels of infection by P. marinus would result in smaller egg
   size and diminished lipid reserves within individual eggs. Our results
   did not reveal any consistent deleterious effects of P. marinus on these
   gametogenic characteristics, although some of our sample sizes were
   small and the average disease intensities were low, Our second
   hypothesis, that there would be a decline in reproductive output as a
   result of high levels of P. marinus infection, was supported for one
   estuary when those oysters were near their peak of reproductive
   condition (July). We found no evidence to support our third hypothesis
   that there would be a negative influence of infections during the 1990
   reproductive season on subsequent reproductive output (summer 1991).
   Based on published evidence that P. marinus can inhibit oyster growth,
   we speculate that oysters infected at low intensities by P. marinus can
   divert energy from growth to reproduction. This differential energy
   partitioning allows infected oysters to produce fewer eggs than
   uninfected oysters but with no change in the amount of lipid reserves
   stored in each egg.}},

Abstract = {{The cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene and other
   xenobiotics has been investigated in liver microsomes prepared from a
   local marine safi fish, Siganus canaliculatus. The safi fish was found
   to have a well-developed microsomal monooxygenase system consisting of
   cytochrome P450, cytochrome b(5) and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. The
   fish microsomal enzyme system was able to metabolize benzo(a)pyrene,
   7-ethoxycoumarin and 7-ethoxyresorufin. Male fish were found to exhibit
   a higher monooxygenase activity than female fish. Treatment of fish with
   beta-naphthoflavone was found to induce (2- to 4-fold) the activities of
   aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase and
   ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase. HPLC analysis of the metabolites produced
   by incubation of benzo(a)pyrene with the liver microsomal preparation
   showed a predominant formation of 3-OH and 9-OH benzo(a)pyrene. There
   was an increased formation of benzo(a)pyrene 7,8-diol and benzo(a)pyrene
   7,8,9,10-tetrol in liver microsomes prepared from
   B-naphthoflavone-treated fish. Western immunoblot analysis of liver
   microsomes from beta-naphthoflavone-treated fish using an antibody to
   rat liver cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) suggested the presence of an
   inducible cytochrome P450 enzyme that was comparable with that of rat
   liver enzyme. Our results suggest that liver microsomes from the safi
   fish have multiple forms of cytochrome P450 with a specific
   beta-naphthoflavone-inducible CYP1A1 homologous protein that can
   metabolize a variety of substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of immature 21-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats with 17
   beta-estradiol (E2) (0.5 mu g/rat) caused a significant increase in
   uterine wet weight, DNA synthesis, progesterone receptor (PR) binding,
   and peroxidase activity. At doses as high as 40 mg/rat, the bioflavonoid
   naringenin did not cause a significant increase in any of these
   E2-induced responses. However, in rats cotreated with E2 (0.5 mu g/rat)
   plus naringenin (30 mg/rat), there was a significant decrease in
   E2-induced uterine wet weight, DNA synthesis, PR binding, and peroxidase
   activity, indicating that naringenin exhibits antiestrogenic activity in
   the immature rodent uterus. The binding of uterine nuclear extracts to a
   P-32-labeled estrogen responsive element (ERE) or progesterone
   responsive element (PRE) was determined using gel electrophoretic band
   shift assays. Incubation of {[}P-32]ERE with uterine nuclear extracts
   from rats treated with naringenin or E2 resulted in the formation of
   estrogen receptor (ER):ERE complexes; a higher mobility complex was
   prominent in the extracts from E2-treated rats, whereas a lower mobility
   complex was observed using nuclear extracts from naringenin-treated
   animals. There was a significant decrease in the intensity of the
   E2-induced complex using nuclear extracts from rats treated with E2 plus
   naringenin. In contrast, transformed cytosol from control rats gave an
   intense ER:ERE complex, whereas the intensity of the band was decreased
   markedly using transformed uterine cytosol from treated rats. Formation
   of a PR:PRE complex was also determined using transformed uterine
   cytosol. Cytosol from E2-treated rats gave an intense retarded band,
   whereas only weak bands were observed using cytosols from DMSO-
   (solvent), naringenin-, or naringenin plus E2-treated cells. The results
   of in vitro studies showed that 1 nM E2 increased (3- to 4-fold) the
   growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, whereas 1-1000 nM naringenin
   had no effect on cell proliferation. In cells cotreated with 1 nM E2
   plus 1000 nM naringenin, there was a significant decrease in E2-induced
   cell growth. In MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with a pS2
   promoter-regulated luciferase reporter gene, naringenin exhibited weak
   estrogenic activity. In cells cotreated with 0.1 or 1.0 mu M naringenin
   plus 1 nM E2, naringenin inhibited E2-induced luciferase activity. The
   results of these studies confirmed that naringenin is a weak estrogen
   that also exhibits partial antiestrogenic activity in the female rat
   uterus and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.}},

   b(1) Sigma(g)(+) --> X(3) Sigma(g)(-) emissions of O-2 have been
   determined for the first time in solution. In dry CCl4, where the
   lifetime of O-2(b(1) Sigma(g)(+)) amounts to tau(Sigma) = 130 +/- 10 ns,
   we obtained Q(b-a) = (4.5 +/- 1.6) x 10(-4) and Q(b-X) = (5.2 +/- 1.8) x
   10(-8), corresponding to rate constants of the respective radiative
   processes of k(b-a) = (3.4 +/- 1.1) x 10(3) s(-1) and k(b-X) = 0.40 +/-
   0.13 s(-1). The rate constant of the phosphorescence b --> X is only
   weakly enhanced by collisions with solvent molecules, in contrast to the
   b --> a fluorescence rate constant, which is by about 6 orders of
   magnitude larger in liquid CCl4 compared with the isolated O-2 molecule.
   For the a(1) Delta(g) --> X(3) Sigma(g)(-) phosphorescence we determined
   in CCl4 k(a-X) = 1.1 +/- 0.4 s(-1). These measurements proved to be key
   experiments for the understanding of the mechanism of the
   collision-induced radiative transitions b --> a and a --> X. Our results
   confirm predictions of a theoretical perturbation model developed by
   Minaev, according to which the ratio k(a-X)(c)/k(b-a)(c) of the
   bimolecular rate constants of the respective collision-induced radiative
   transitions should be constant. The comparative analysis of k(b-a)(c)
   obtained in liquid CCl4 with literature data of k(b-a)(c) determined in
   the gas phase reveals an almost quadratic dependence of k(b-a)(c) on the
   molar refraction R of the collider. This relation demonstrates that the
   electric dipole moment induced into the b --> a transition is
   practically directly proportional to the molecular polarizability of the
   collider. Because of intensity borrowing of the a --> X transition from
   the collision-induced b --> a transition, k(a-X)(c) depends in the same
   way on R as k(b-a)(c). This result also explains the up to now
   quantitatively not understood solvent effect on k(a-X)(c).}},

Abstract = {{Haplosporidium nelsoni is a protistan pathogen of the eastern oyster
   Crassostrea virginica, and has contributed to the decline of the oyster

   of the 16S-like rDNA of H. nelsoni with those of Minchinia teredinis and
   other related organisms, 2 oligonucleotides which were specific to H.
   nelsoni and suitable for use as PCR primers were identified. These
   primers amplified a 564 base pair fragment of the small subunit (SSU)
   rRNA gene of H. nelsoni, but did not amplify genomic oyster DNA or the
   SSU rRNA genes of the haplosporidians Haplosporidium costale,
   Haplosporidium louisiana, or M. teredinis. The PCR primers were able to
   detect the H. nelsoni SSU rDNA from 50 ng of infected oyster genomic DNA
   or from 10 fg of cloned H. nelsoni SSU rDNA. The ability of the PCR
   primers to diagnose H. nelsoni-infected oysters was compared to the
   established techniques of hemolymph settlement analysis in Farley
   chambers and histological examination from a sample of 20 oysters.
   Hemolymph settlement analysis detected infection in 10 oysters and
   histology revealed infections in 11 oysters. PCR amplification of DNA
   from hemolymph initially detected infections in 15 oysters and
   reamplification of the PCR products detected an additional 4 infections.
   PCR amplification is a more sensitive diagnostic assay for H. nelsoni
   than traditional techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The photoassisted catalytic degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in
   the gas phase was studied using a packed bed reactor with TiO2 pellets
   prepared by sol-gel techniques. A primary product of the reaction was
   monochloroacetic acid at 23 degrees C while TCE was completely
   mineralized to CO2 and HCl at 64 degrees C. Ab initio molecular orbital
   calculations served to elucidate the mechanism of the TCE degradation.
   According to the frontier molecular orbitals of TCE, on the catalyst
   surface the OH radical attacks preferentially at the CCl2 side of TCE,
   path A. The formation of the radical intermediate CHClCCl2(OH) was
   estimated to be exothermic by -41.0 kcal mol(-1). The large
   stabilization energy is in agreement with the experimental results that
   TCE is degraded very rapidly and the reaction was not dependent on the
   temperature of the reaction. A Cl radical elimination from the
   intermediate produces 1,2-dichloroethenol, which changes its form to
   monochloroacetyl chloride. This is the so-called keto-enol tautomerism
   with the large activation energy of 53.3 kcal mol(-1) The water assists
   by lowering the activation barrier of the tautomerism by 21.5 kcal
   mol(-1). Hydrolysis of monochloroacetyl chloride or its reaction with a
   OH radical produces monochloroacetic acid, the primary product pf our
   catalytic system. The addition of OH radical to the CHCl side favorably
   occurs in the gas phase, path B, and forms a radical intermediate
   CHCl(OH)CCl2. Then, it releases a Cl radical to form 2,2-dichloroethenol
   followed by the tautomerism to produce dichloroacetaldehyde. The
   activation energy of the reaction turned out to be as large as 64.2 kcal
   mol(-1). Such a high activation barrier is responsible for the previous
   observation that only 2,2-dichloroethenol was detected in the
   homogeneous gas phase degradation of TCE.}},

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that the resonance and delocalization energies
   defined in the theory of aromaticity can be computed using a VB
   Hamiltonian obtained from a CASSCF wave function. The resonance and
   delocalization energies of benzene and cyclobutadiene computed in this
   way are in good agreement with the accepted empirical estimates. An
   application of this procedure to the transition structure of the {[}2
   pi(s) + 2 pi(s)] ethylene dimerization (as a prototype of a forbidden
   cycloaddition) and to the transition structure for the {[}2 pi(s) + 4
   pi(s)] addition of ethylene and butadiene (as a prototype of an allowed
   cycloaddition) shows that the concepts of aromaticity and
   antiaromaticity can be used to rationalize the stability of transition
   states of pericyclic reactions. The delocalization energy, which
   accounts for the large stability of benzene, also rationalizes the low
   reaction barrier for the {[}2 pi(s) + 4 pi(s)] transition structure as
   well as the instability of square cyclobutadiene and the large reaction
   barrier for the {[}2 pi(s) + 2 pi(s)] transition structure. The
   magnitude of the delocalization energy itself has been rationalized in
   terms of exchange integrals K-ij and the related exchange density matrix
   elements P-ij. The 1,2 interactions give broadly similar stabilizing
   contributions in four- and six-electron systems. The small
   delocalization energy in four-electron systems (square cyclobutadiene
   and the {[}2 pi(s) + 2 pi(s)] transition structure) arises from the

Abstract = {{One of the major surprises from the spacecraft missions to Mars of the
   1970s was the finding of anomalously low brightness temperatures in the
   winter polar regions, far below the expected CO2 frost point, Since
   then, many explanations have been advanced for this puzzling behavior,
   including the low emissivities of carbon dioxide frost and the presence
   of carbon dioxide clouds, but no conclusion has been reached, We have
   carefully analyzed the measurements obtained by the Mariner 9 infrared
   interferometer spectrometer (IRIS) and the Viking infrared thermal
   mapper (IRTM). Besides their low brightness temperatures, the anomalous
   areas are characterized by their high variability and their complex
   spectral signature, Also, there is evidence suggesting that their
   occurrence is related to the condensation of CO2 in the atmosphere, We
   have used a combination of data analysis and modeling to compare these
   observations with simulated spectra obtained with radiative models of
   CO2 ice clouds and CO2 ice deposits, We show that precipitating CO2
   cloud with particle radius larger than 10 mu m and CO2 snow deposits
   with millimeter-sized grains are able to produce the observed features,
   In both cases matching the IRIS spectra requires the CO2 ice particles
   to be mixed with small amounts of water or dust, as expected for the
   northern winter cap observed by the Mariner 9 mission, Nonprecipitating
   CO2 clouds, if they exist, should be transparent in the infrared, On the
   other hand, CO2 ice deposits composed of large grains or monolithic ice
   which have directly condensed on the ground could have an emissivity
   close to unity and in any case much higher than that of small CO2 ice
   particles originating from atmospheric condensation. We conclude that
   the low brightness temperatures are likely to be created by CO2 snow
   falls and that both falling snow particles and fresh snow deposits could
   contribute to create the observed features.}},

Abstract = {{The replicative DNA helicase encoded by the dnaB gene is essential for
   chromosomal DNA replication in Escherichia coli. The DnaB protein is a
   component of the phi X-type primosome which is regarded as a model
   system for lagging strand synthesis of the chromosome. Using
   translational lacZ fusions at the plasmid and chromosomal levels, we
   studied the influence of DNA-damaging agents on dnaB gene expression. We
   found that DNA damage caused by mitomycin C, methyl methanesulphonate,
   4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, and UV irradiation led to a moderate, but
   significant induction of dnaB gene expression. Comparative S1 analysis
   of transcripts in untreated and induced cells demonstrated that the
   induction is due to increased transcription from the dnaB promoter. In
   contrast to other DNA damage-inducible replication genes, such as dnaA,
   dnaN, dnaQ, and polA, expression of which is not inducible in recA and
   lexA mutants, the induction of dnaB was also observed in a recA1 mutant.
   These results show that the induction of dnaB gene expression by
   replication-blocking DNA damage is due to a mechanism other than the
   indirectly SOS-dependent induction of the other DNA replication genes.
   Moreover, the data suggest that replication proteins are involved in
   recovery from replication-blocking DNA damage in two different ways - on
   the one hand at the level of initiation and on the other hand at the
   level of elongation.}},

   inactivates uridine phosphorylase (UPase) from E. coli under mildly
   alkaline conditions. Modification of one of the four tyrosine residues
   decreases enzyme activity to 10\%, while modification of all tyrosines
   decreases it to 8\%. The second-order rate constant for the inactivation
   is 1250 +/- 50 M(-1) min(-1) at ph 8.0. Phosphate (0.1 m) does not
   affect the inactivation rate, while 5 mM uridine, or uridine plus
   phosphate nearly completely protect the enzyme against inactivation.
   Free sulfhydryl groups of UPase are not oxidized by TNM. A single
   modified peptide was isolated from tryptic digest by reverse-phase HPLC.
   The mass to charge ratio and the sequence determined are consisted with
   modification of Tyr-169, which corresponds to tryptic peptide
   (169)Tyr-Asp-Thr-Tyr-Ser-Gly-Arg(175). Tyrosine nitration leads to a
   significant decrease in the pK(a) of the phenolic hydroxy group without
   significantly affecting enzyme structure. Comparison of the pH
   dependence of activity and inactivation by diethylpyrocarbonate for the
   native and modified UPase reveals interaction between the modified

Abstract = {{Induction of HSP70 heat shock genes by light has been demonstrated in
   Chlamydomonas. Our aim was to establish whether this induction by light
   is mediated by the heat stress sensing pathway or by an independent
   signal chain. Inhibitors of cytoplasmic protein synthesis revealed an
   initial difference. Cycloheximide and other inhibitors of protein
   synthesis prevented HSP70A induction upon illumination but not during
   heat stress. Analysis of HSP70A induction in cells that had
   differentiated into gametes revealed a second difference. While heat
   shock resulted in elevated HSP70A mRNA levels, light was no longer able
   to serve as an inducer in gametes. To identify the regulatory sequences
   that mediate the response of the HSP70A gene to either heat stress or
   light we introduced a series of progressive 5' truncations into its
   promoter sequence. Analyses of the levels of mRNA transcribed from these
   deletion constructs showed that in most of them the responses to heat
   shock and light were similar, suggesting that light induction is
   mediated by a light-activated heat shock factor. However, we show that
   the HSP70A promoter also contains cis-acting sequences involved in light
   induction that do not participate in induction by heat stress. Together,
   these results provide evidence for a regulation of HSP70A gene
   expression by light through a heat shock-independent signal pathway.}},

   and A --> T transversions by DNA misreplication with more frequent
   insertion of deoxyadenosine opposite the apurinic site. Papillomas were
   induced in mouse skin by several aromatic hydrocarbons, and mutations in
   the c-H-ras gene were determined to elucidate the relationship among DNA
   adducts, apurinic sites, and ras oncogene mutations.
   Dibenzo-{[}a,l]pyrene (DB{[}a,l]P), DB {[}a,l]P-11,12-dihydrodiol,

   54\% of tumors and a CAA --> CTA mutation in codon 61 in 15\%. The
   pattern of mutations induced by each hydrocarbon correlated with its
   profile of DNA adducts. For example, both DB{[}a,l]P and DMBA primarily
   form DNA adducts at the N-3 and/or N-7 of deoxyadenosine that are lost
   from the DNA by depurination, generating apurinic sites. Thus, these
   results support the hypothesis that misreplication of unrepaired
   apurinic sites generated by loss of hydrocarbon-DNA adducts is
   responsible for transforming mutations leading to papillomas in mouse

Abstract = {{Benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase (BA2H) catalyzes the biosynthesis of
   salicylic acid from benzoic acid. The enzyme has been partially purified
   and characterized as a soluble protein of 160 kDa. High-efficiency in
   vivo labeling of salicylic acid with O-18(2) suggested that BA2H is an
   oxygenase that specifically hydroxylates the ortho position of benzoic
   acid. The enzyme was strongly induced by either tobacco mosaic virus
   inoculation or benzoic acid infiltration of tobacco leaves and it was
   inhibited by CO and other inhibitors of cytochrome P450 hydroxylases.
   The BA2H activity was immunodepleted by antibodies raised against SU2, a
   soluble cytochrome P450 from Streptomyces griseolus. The anti-SU2
   antibodies immunoprecipitated a radiolabeled polypeptide of around 160
   kDa from the soluble protein extracts of L-{[}S-35]-methionine-fed

Abstract = {{Molecular mimicry, normally defined by the level of primary-sequence
   similarities between self and foreign antigens, has been considered a
   key element in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Here we describe an
   example of molecular mimicry between two overlapping peptides within a
   single self-antigen, both of which are recognized by the same human
   self-reactive T-cell clone. Two intervening peptides did not stimulate
   the T-cell clone, even though they share nine amino acids with the
   stimulatory peptides. Molecular modeling of major histocompatibility
   complex class II-peptide complexes suggests that both of the recognized
   peptides generate similar antigenic surfaces, although these are
   composed of different sets of amino acids. The molecular modeling of a
   peptide shifted one residue from the stimulatory peptide, which was
   recognized in the context of the same HLA molecule by another T-cell
   clone, generated a completely different antigenic surface. Functional
   studies using truncated peptides confirmed that the anchor residues of
   the two `'mimicking'' epitopes in the HLA groove differ. Our results
   show, for two natural epitopes, how molecular mimicry can occur and
   suggest that studies of potential antigenic surfaces, rather than
   sequence similarity, are necessary for analyzing suspected peptide
   mimicry.}},

   known for a long time and has been interpreted with various theoretical
   models in terms of the constituents' spin. Recently, the analyzing power
   in inclusive Lambda(0) hyperon production has also been measured using
   the 200 GeV/c Fermilab polarized proton beam. The covered kinematic
   range is 0.2 less than or equal to x(F) less than or equal to 1.0 and
   0.1 less than or equal to p(T) less than or equal to 1.5 GeV/c. The data
   indicate a negative asymmetry at large x(F) and moderate p(T). These
   results can further test the current ideas on the underlying mechanisms
   for hyperon polarization.}},

   patients have a deletion of one peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22)

   Japanese and Asiatic Indian CMT1A patients have a PMP22 gene duplication
   that results in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type LA (CMT1A; HMSNIA) in
   patients of European and Middle Eastern ancestry, About 70\% of Japanese
   CMT1 patients have a PMP22-duplication as do Caucasians, while Japanese
   CMT1B, CMT2 and Dejerine-Sottas patients do not have PMP22 gene region
   aneuploidy, Although HNPP and CMT1A genotypes are generated
   simultaneously by unequal recombination that results in PMP22 gene
   aneuploidy in each daughter cell, only 3 Japanese HNPP probands with
   PMP22 deletion from a large patient population were referred to a single
   center compared to 18 referred CMT1A probands with PMP22 duplication,
   This lower HNPP frequency more likely reflects lower HNPP reproductive
   fitness than patient ascertainment bias because disease severity and
   variation in severity is about the same in CMT1A and HNPP patients and
   because all patients of both types were referred regardless of disease
   severity. These results, along with an apparently high de novo CMT1A
   mutation rate, suggest that common ancestors of Japanese, Asian Indians,

   unequal crossing over. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We used fura-2 microfluorometry to examine the mechanism underlying the
   muscarinic receptor agonist-induced increase in the cytosolic Ca2+
   concentration ({[}Ca](in)) in acutely isolated chick ciliary ganglion
   neurons. The order of potencies of muscarinic agonists in increasing
   {[}Ca](in) was: oxotremorine M > muscarine > methacholine > oxotremorine
   > bethanechol. The muscarine-induced increase in {[}Ca](in) persisted
   after treatment with thapsigargin, which blocked caffeine- and
   muscarinic agonist-induced Ca2+ release. The muscarinesensitive
   {[}Ca](in) increase was inhibited by both L- and N-type Ca2+ channel
   blockers but potentiated by an L-type Ca2+ channel agonist. Muscarine
   was effective in increasing {[}Ca](in) in the presence of a
   desensitizing concentration of nicotine, and simultaneous addition of
   maximal doses of muscarine and nicotine caused an additive increase in
   {[}Ca](in). On the other hand, nicotine-, ATP-, and high K+-induced
   increase in {[}Ca](in) was markedly potentiated during continuous
   stimulation with muscarine. These results suggest that muscarinic
   receptor stimulation increases Ca2+ influx passing through
   voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. However, the muscarine-induced Mn2+
   influx was observed in only some muscarine-sensitive cells, suggesting
   that muscarine-induced depolarization is too weak to overcome the
   inhibitory effect of Mn2+ on Ca2+ channels.}},

Abstract = {{ALTHOUGH most neurones in the PMLS of the cat are selective for
   direction of motion, whether the preferred directions are organized into
   cortical columns, as they are in the MT area of the monkey, is not
   certain. We have quantitatively investigated the organization of
   direction selectivity of PMLS neurones. The results showed that adjacent
   neurones have similar direction selectivity. The preferred direction of
   neurones sampled successively in a tangential penetration changed
   continually, occasionally with an approximately 180 degrees reversal,
   and neurones with bidirectional selectivity tended to be located in the
   reversal region. It is spectulated that direction selectivity in the
   PMLS is organized on the basis of preferred axis of motion in such a way
   that one column with bidirectional preference lies between two columns
   with opposite unidirectional preferences, a unidirectional column is
   always adjacent to a bidirectional column and these adjacent columns
   share a common preferred axis-of-motion.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of Ostwald ripening is examined theoretically for
   precipitates in solution, crystallites on a substrate, and islands of
   insoluble surfactant molecules at the liquid-air interface. The
   classical theory of Ostwald ripening, developed by Lifshitz and Slyozhov
   and independently by Wagner, employs a continuum approach in which the
   size distribution is a continuous function of particle size and the
   conservation equation is formulated as in hydrodynamics with the
   particle growth rate serving as a velocity in size space. It was derived
   for the case in which the diffusion fields of the individual particles
   do not overlap and provides asymptotic expressions at large times for
   the two extreme cases of diffusion controlled and kinetic controlled
   growth. In this paper, the validity of this continuum (hydrodynamic)
   approach is examined using a more rigorous stochastic microscopic
   approach (MCE). A detailed comparison is made between the numerical and
   asymptotic results obtained using the Lifshitz, Slyozhov, Wagner theory
   and the stochastic microscopic continuity equation (MCE). It is shown
   that with the MCE, the limiting case of `'diffusion controlled Ostwald
   ripening'' ceases to have significance, since the kinetics at the
   interface play a role even when the transport of molecules from the bulk
   to the particle is diffusion controlled. For the case of interface
   kinetic controlled growth in precipitates, the asymptotic trends, which
   are independent of the initial conditions in both cases, are seen much
   earlier with the MCE. Besides, for this case (precipitates), the MCE
   predicts a mean radius which is about 25\% larger at any given time.
   While the scaled (with respect to the maximum) asymptotic distributions
   obtained from the two approaches are similar, the absolute (not scaled)
   particle size distributions obtained using the MCE are much broader and
   the maxima are almost a third of those obtained using the Lifshitz,
   Slyozhov, Wagner approach. Similar differences in the results are
   obtained for the two dimensional Ostwald ripening of crystallites on a
   substrate and islands of insoluble surfactant. (C) 1995 American

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The onset of alcohol consumption begins very early in the
   Spanish society; generally, at the school age. The target of this study
   is to identify the factors that are linked to alcohol use and abuse, at
   this age.
   METHODS: A survey was designed and carried out among 1,816 students of 6
   schools of Barcelona and Lleida, Spain (97.5\% response rate) between 13
   and 18 years old included, through a questionnaire filled-in in the
   classroom.
   RESULTS: 85.5\% had ever consumed alcoholic drinks, 7.3\% reported to
   drink alcohol every day and 39.6\% said that they had drunk four or more
   glasses of an alcoholic beverage at least once. The multivariate
   analysis showed that smoking habitually, with an odds ratio (OR) of 9.7;
   having a larger amount of own money to buy alcohol (OR = 1.5); and the
   expectations that alcohol helps to enjoy and get along with friends (OR
   = 2.4) were the most important factors identified as associated with
   problematic alcohol consumption.
   CONCLUSIONS: The study points to several factors related to the habit of
   smoking, the influence of the environment of schoolchildren and the
   expectations associated to alcohol consumption are related with the
   consumption of alcoholic drinks, especially from the beginning in the
   high school.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of a polished molybdenum metal surface upon exposure to
   both aerated and deaerated water and 1.0 mol dm(-3) sodium chloride
   solution, in a previously described anaerobic cell, has been studied by
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). No oxidation was found on metal
   samples exposed to deaerated solutions. Exposure to aerated sodium
   chloride solution also produced no oxide formation. However, exposing
   the polished metal surface to aerated water produced significant
   oxidation, in agreement with previous results. The valence band studies
   complement the core-level data, as well as providing information not
   available in the core spectra. We find that metal surfaces cleaned by
   argon-ion etching rather than by mechanical polishing of the molybdenum
   are inert to oxidation by aerated water. These etched surfaces show
   differences in the valence-band region that are consistent with the
   generation of a defect molybdenum structure, possibly containing oxygen.
   This defect structure, generated by argon-ion etching, appears to
   passivate the metal. The valence-band data were interpreted by
   calculated spectra generated by multiple-scattered-wave X-alpha cluster
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The locust alpha-like nicotinic receptor subunit alpha L1 was expressed
   in Xenopus oocytes. Small but reproducible currents were elicited by
   application of high concentrations of nicotine, demonstrating that alpha
   L1 is capable of forming homo-oligomeric channels. Nicotine-evoked
   currents were blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin and methyllycaconitine.
   Comparison with chick alpha 7 receptors showed that the two receptors
   differ with respect to nicotine sensitivity and timecourse of evoked
   currents. Nicotine dose-response curves gave EC(50) values of 24 and 830
   mu M for alpha 7 and alpha L1 respectively. Whereas alpha 7 responses
   showed characteristic fast onset and rapid desensitization within 3 s,
   alpha L1 currents displayed a slow onset and showed no tendency to
   desensitize during 45 s of agonist application. Thus alpha L1 is a novel
   nicotinic subunit for the further exploration of structure-function
   relationships of ligand-gated ion channels. The question of the subunit
   composition of native insect receptors remains open.}},

   meV and 3.3 meV for YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C, respectively. A simple

   the vibrational predissociation of triatomic van der Waals molecules in
   the previous paper {[}Bull. Korean Chem. Sec, 12, 228 (1991)].
   Implementation was limited to the calculation of the scattering matrix.
   It is now extended to the calculation of the predissociation spectra and
   the final rotational distribution of the photofragment. The comparison
   of the results with those obtained by other methods, such as Golden-rule
   type calculation, infinite order sudden approximation (IOS), and
   close-coupling method, shows that the implementation is successful
   despite the fact that transition dipole moments show more energy
   dependence than other quantum defect parameters. Examination of the
   short-range channel basis functions shows that they resemble angle-like
   functions and provide the validity of the IOS approximation. Besides the
   validity of the latter, only a few angles are found to play the major
   role in photodissociation. In addition to the implementation of MQDT,
   more progress in MQDT itself is made and reported here.}},

Abstract = {{As an initially convergent Gaussian beam enters the vicinity of the
   geometric focus, weak fluctuation theory predicts a drop in the
   longitudinal component of the log-irradiance variance and an increase in
   the radial component off the beam center. The phenomenon intensifies as
   the beam nears the geometric focus, also with decreasing magnitude of
   the focusing parameter. Precisely at the geometric focus, first-order
   weak fluctuation theory further predicts that as the initial beam size
   continues to increase, the longitudinal component of the log-irradiance
   variance decreases toward zero, while the radial component increases
   without bound. This eventually entails a rapid change in scintillation
   across the beam surface that has yet to be verified experimentally, to
   our knowledge. We demonstrate that when diffraction like effects
   produced by optical turbulence are introduced, predicted log-irradiance
   variance exhibits such extremes in behavior only in the case of weak
   turbulence. Also, at the exact geometric focus, scintillation does not
   vanish with increasing initial beam size but achieves a value determined
   by and growing with turbulence strength and nearly independent of
   initial beam size. The radial component of log-irradiance quickly loses
   significance as turbulence strength increases. In fact, general extremal
   behavior of the log-irradiance variance in the vicinity of the geometric
   focus is drastically curtailed. Differences across the diffractive beam
   surface become small and exhibit only a modest dependence on the initial
   beam size. (C) 1995 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We are developing an empirical spectrum synthesis technique that yields
   independent measurements of starspot filling factor, f(S), and starspot
   temperature, T-S, by fitting TiO bands of differing temperature
   sensitivity. The absolute depth of the TiO bands constrains f(S), while
   the ratio of their depths is a function only of T-S. One strength of
   this technique is its ability to determine the spot parameters in
   traditionally difficult cases: slowly rotating stars, uniformly spotted
   stars, and stars that always have spots. For this initial study, we have
   used a simpler procedure of measuring the band depths in the most
   spotted star in our survey (the single-lined RS CVn binary system II
   Pegasi) and for a full grid of comparison stars (inactive G, K, and M
   dwarfs and giants). This yields T-S and f(S) for a given assumed
   temperature of the nonspotted photosphere, T-Q. The latter was further
   constrained by the use of simultaneous photometry. We have analyzed a
   series of spectra of II Peg obtained throughout a single 6.7 day
   rotational cycle in 1989 October. We find that starspots on II Peg are
   better modeled by comparison spectra of giants than by dwarfs. Combining
   TiO analysis with contemporaneous photometry, we find that cool
   starspots (T-S approximate to 3500 K) are always visible, with a
   fractional projected coverage of the visible hemisphere varying from
   54\% to 64\% as the star rotates. The nonspotted photosphere has a
   temperature T-Q approximate to 4800 K. Our results imply that even at
   the historical light maximum of V = 7.2, at least 34\% of II Peg was
   covered by starspots.}},

Abstract = {{The two type II topoisomerases in Escherichia coli, DNA gyrase and
   topoisomerase (Topo) TV, share considerable amino acid sequence
   similarity, yet they have distinctive topoisomerization activities. Only
   DNA gyrase can supercoli relaxed DNA, whereas during oriC DNA
   replication in vitro, only Topo IV can support the final stages of
   replication, processing of the late inter mediate and decatenation of
   the daughter molecules. In order to develop an understanding for the
   basis of the differential activities of these two enzymes, we have
   initiated a characterization of Topo TV binding to DNA. We find that
   unlike gyrase, Topo IV neither constrains DNA in a positive supercoli
   when it binds nor protects a 150-base pair region of DNA from digestion
   with micrococcal nuclease. Consistent with this, DNase I footprinting
   experiments showed that Topo IV protected a 34-base pair region roughly
   centered about the topoisomerase induced cleavage site. In addition,
   Topo IV preferentially bound supercolied rather than relaxed DNA. Thus,
   the DNA binding characteristics of Topo IV are more akin to those of the
   type II eukaryotic enzymes rather than those of its prokaryotic partner.}},

Abstract = {{The 10Sa RNA, encoded by the E. coli ssrA gene, appears to modulate
   action of some DNA-binding proteins. When ssrA is inactivated, lacZ
   expression from the lac operon, as well as galK from a gal operon fused
   to a phage lambda promoter, is reduced from that observed in bacteria
   wild-type for ssrA. These differences are not observed if the relevant
   repressor is inactive, suggesting that in the absence of 10Sa RNA
   binding of Lad and lambda cl repressors is enhanced. Gel mobility shifts
   show that 10Sa RNA binds these repressors and that an excess of 10Sa RNA
   competes for binding of lambda cl with a DNA fragment containing the
   O(R)2 repressor-binding sequence. Similar observations were made in
   studies of the E. coli LexA repressor and phage P22 C1 transcription
   activator proteins. These results suggest that direct interaction with
   10Sa RNA may explain this modulation of protein-DNA interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction of vestibule-ocular reflex (VOR) and optokinetic reflex

   (1.25 degrees/s, 10.0 degrees/s) the eyes were rather well stabilized on
   the optokinetic pattern, independently of whether the head, the pattern,
   or both were rotated. At higher velocities (40.0 degrees/s), the OKR
   gain was attenuated and, when combining vestibular and optokinetic
   stimuli, the eyes became increasingly stabilized in space. The data
   could be simulated by a computer model previously designed to describe
   VOR-OKR interaction during sinusoidal rotations. In this model eye
   stabilization primarily relies on the OKR, while the role of the VOR is
   to compensate for the limited bandwidth of the OKR.}},

Abstract = {{We have identified a novel membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase

   gelatinase A in vitro. In this study, we further examined the
   possibility that MT-MMP is the activator of pro-gelatinase A in tumors
   as well as in vitro. Expression of MT-MMP mRNA was analyzed by Northern
   blotting in 58 cases of human lung carcinomas. MT-MMP mRNA expression
   was increased in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues.
   The ratio of MT-MMP mRNA levels in tumor/normal tissues (T/N ratio) was
   3.19 +/- 1.62 in 29 cases of adenocarcinoma, 3.09 +/- 1.44 in 24 cases
   of squamous cell carcinoma, 4.40 +/- 0.47 in 3 cases of large cell
   carcinoma and 3.63 +/- 2.11 in 2 cases of small cell carcinoma,
   respectively. Activated gelatinase A, as detected by gelatin zymography,
   was also predominant in tumors compared with normal tissue counterparts,
   though the difference in mRNA levels was not significant. The activation
   ratio of gelatinase A in tumor vs. normal tissues correlated well with
   that of MT-MMP mRNA expression and with lymph node metastases. Our
   findings suggest that MT-MMP is indeed the tumor-specific activator of
   pro-gelatinase A in lung carcinomas and is important to initiate
   invasion of basement membranes. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{THE Ets-1 proto-oncogene is a member of a transcription factor family
   characterized by homology to the v-ets oncogene(1-4). In adult mice,
   Ets-1 is expressed predominantly in lymphoid cells where it has been
   implicated in regulating transcription of lymphocyte-specific
   genes(5-7). Following T-cell activation, the specific DNA binding
   activity of Ets-1 is inactivated by transient phosphorylation,
   suggesting a function in the transition from the resting to activated
   state(8,9). Ets-1 has also been suggested to cooperate with the AP-1
   transcription factor complex to mediate cellular growth factor
   responses(4). Here we show, by using RAG-2-deficient blastocyst
   complementation(10), that Ets-1 deficiency has dramatic, but different,
   effects on development and function of T- and B-lineage cells,
   Ets-1-deficient T cells were present in reduced numbers and were highly
   susceptible to cell death in vitro. In contrast, Ets-1-deficient B cells
   were present in normal numbers but a large proportion were IgM plasma
   cells, Our data demonstrate that Ets-1 is essential for maintenance of

Abstract = {{The SH2/SH3 adaptor protein Crkl is abnormally phosphorylated on
   tyrosine by the Bcr/Abl protein in leukemic cells from patients with
   Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph)positive leukemia. However, the state of
   tyrosine-phosphorylation of crkl in normal tissues is unknown. In the
   current study, we identified mouse crkl by cDNA cloning and examined
   expression levels and tyrosine-phosphorylation of the mouse crkl protein
   during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. Tyrosine-phosphorylation of
   crkl was prominent during early development, but decreased at later
   embryonic stages and in newborn mice. Expression of both crkl and the
   related crk was ubiquitous in the adult. However, crkl differed
   considerably from crk in relative tissue distribution, and was more
   abundant in hematopoietic tissues. With exception of the lung, crkl was
   mostly present in a non-tyrosine phosphorylated form. Consistent with
   our previous findings in human patients, murine crkl was phosphorylated
   on tyrosine in leukemic tissues of BCR/ABL transgenic animals, but was
   non-tyrosine phosphorylated in normal mouse bone marrow. We conclude
   that this crkl tyrosine-phosphorylation by Bcr/Abl in hematopoietic
   cells is clearly aberrant and is consistently linked to the development
   of leukemia. Identification of proteins interacting with
   tyrosine-phosphorylated crkl in the leukemic cells of BCR/ABL transgenic
   mice should reveal members of signal transduction pathways activated in
   Ph-positive leukemia.}},

Abstract = {{The vibration-rotation energy level pattern of protonated acetylene,
   C2H3+, in the nu(6)(C-H antisymmetric stretching) vibrational state is
   anomalous and irregular because of the coupling between the rotational
   motion and the tunneling of the three protons among their equilibrium
   positions. The resultant spectral anomaly and the coexistence of C-H
   bands of other carbocations such as CH3+, C2H2+, CH2+, etc., in our
   positive column discharge using He-dominated gas mixtures had made the
   analysis of the C2H3+ spectrum difficult. In the present paper we use a
   hollow cathode discharge to simplify plasma chemistry and to make a more
   definitive and extensive analysis of the spectrum. A 3 m hollow cathode
   discharge cell has been constructed with a multiple reflection optical
   system giving an effective path length of 30 m. A gas mixture of C2H2
   and H-2 with pressures of 0.03 and 1.1 Torr, respectively, has produced
   spectral lines of C2H3+ from 3192 to 3083 cm(-1) which are almost
   completely free of those from other carbocations. The purity of the
   spectrum, together cm with the accurate ground state rotational
   constants recently reported by the Lille millimeter wave group, has
   allowed us to assign spectral lines up to J = 25 and K-a = 4 and to
   determine extensive sets of the A-E splittings due to the proton
   tunneling in the excited state. An attempt has been made to analyze the
   plasma chemistry in the hollow cathode on the basis of earlier plasma
   diagnostic studies of the negative glow region. A model was used in
   which the primary molecular ions H-2(+) and C2H2+ are generated due to
   ionization by `'hot'' primary and secondary electrons. In the plasma
   these ions undergo ion-neutral reactions to produce H-3(+) and C2H3+,
   which are dissociated by reactions with C2H2 and recombination with
   `'ultimate'' electrons. By assuming proper number densities of primary,
   secondary, and ultimate electrons, semiquantitative agreement with the
   experimentally estimated ion densities has been obtained.}},

Abstract = {{We have constructed yeast vectors in which derivatives of the adenovirus
   E1A gene are expressed from the GAL1 promoter. Cells expressing E1A(289)
   grow poorly and accumulate cells with a 1C DNA content. Using a series
   of E1A deletion mutants, we have identified three regions within the E1A
   protein that are necessary for the G(1) growth phenotype; each deletion
   partially relieves the growth defect. These deletions span residues
   4-25, 38-60 and 140-186, which fall within the N-terminal, CR1 and CR3
   domains of E1A respectively. Expression of the first 82 residues of E1A,
   spanning just the N-terminal and CR1 domains, strongly inhibits yeast
   cell growth in G(1) showing that these domains can function
   independently of other domains of E1A. Using this strong growth
   inhibition, we isolated a yeast mutant in the net1 gene that conferred
   resistance to the expression of E1A(1-82). The mutant was insensitive to
   expression of both E1A(1-82) and full length E1A, but remained sensitive
   to the toxicity caused by over-expression of a Ga14p-VP16 fusion.
   Finally, we found that the function of E1A in yeast depends on the
   cyclic AMP signaling pathway, providing a striking parallel with the
   action of E1A at the c-fos promoter in mammalian cells. These results
   suggest that a genetic analysis of the yeast model system will provide
   relevant new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation by E1A
   proteins.}},

   in support of a major development program of the SIFT and FA as chemical
   ionization devices for the analysis of trace gases in air and especially
   of human breath and the vapors emitted by fruits and food products. The
   H3O+ and OH- ions mostly react with the molecules, MH, via proton
   transfer, producing respectively MH(2)(+) and M(-) ions, which is ideal
   for gas analysis. The hydrated hydronium ions and the hydrated hydroxide
   ions are largely unreactive with the hydrocarbons included in this
   study, but they are very reactive with the oxygen-containing organic
   molecules undergoing ligand switching reactions producing mostly
   MH(2)(+) and M(-) hydrates. The details of the reactions (e.g. the
   number of H2O molecules either ejected from the intermediate complexes
   or remaining associated with the MH(2)(+) and MH(-) `'core ions'') are
   controlled largely by the reaction energy as far as this can be
   determined. The utility of the reactions of these hydrated ions as
   chemical ionization agents in atmospheric trace gas analysis is alluded

Abstract = {{The first generation strategies toward the total synthesis of brevetoxin
   B (1) are presented and the syntheses of the key intermediates 3, 4, 5,
   67, 83, and 94-98 required for the projected construction are described.
   The earliest and most convergent strategy required the application of
   the hydroxy epoxide cyclization and the intramolecular conjugate
   addition as key reactions for the construction of the fused
   tetrahydropyran ring systems (4) {[}ABC], (7) {[}FG], and (8) {[}IJK].
   The oxocene ring (H) was formed via a Wittig reaction followed by a
   hydroxy dithioketal cyclization to produce the hexacyclic fragment
   {[}FGHIJK] (6 --> 5). The 12-membered dithionolactone 18 was envisioned
   as the precursor of the dioxepane system of the molecule via a projected
   bridging reaction, to construct simultaneously both oxepane rings.
   However, the dithionation of dilactone 17 proved unsuccessful. In a
   subsequently evolved strategy, a new photolytic approach toward the
   dioxepane region was developed, starting from the acyclic dithiono
   progenitor 20 (20 --> 23). Application of this reaction to the
   brevetoxin B skeleton afforded the desired oxepene (96 --> 97), which
   after deprotection produced oxepanone 98. A specifically designed
   reductive hydroxy ketone cyclization (98 --> 99) was then employed in an
   attempt to close the remaining ring {[}E], but, again, without success.
   The novel rearrangement of hydroxy ketone 87 to the pentacyclic system
   89 was observed in a less elaborate skeleton. The scope and generality
   of these silicon-induced reductive cyclizations are also described.}},

Abstract = {{Caffeine was administered to male Wistar albino rats for two weeks at
   three concentrations, namely 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3\%, and hepatic cytochrome
   P450-dependent mixed-function oxidases determined. Caffeine
   administration gave rise to a marked, dose-dependent increase in the
   O-deethylation of ethoxyresorufin and, to a lesser extent, in the
   O-depentylation of pentoxyresorufin. Erythromycin N-demethylase,
   p-nitrophenol hydroxylase and lauric acid hydroxylase activities, as
   well as total cytochrome P450 content were unaffected by this treatment.
   Immunoblot analysis revealed that caffeine gave rise to a dose-dependent
   increase in the hepatic CYP1A2, and at the highest dose only, CYP2B
   apoprotein levels. Apoprotein levels of CYP3A and CYP2E1 were not
   modulated by the treatment with caffeine at all dose levels studied.
   Caffeine could not displace {[}H-3]TCDD from the rat hepatic cytosolic
   Ah receptor. Computer analysis showed that caffeine is essentially a
   planar molecule with an area/depth(2) ratio 4.8, characteristic of CYP1A
   substrates/inducers. Molecular modelling revealed that the caffeine
   molecule could orientate itself within the putative CYP1A2 active site
   so as to facilitate demethylation of the N-1, N-3 and N-7 positions.
   However, at physiological pH, the N-9 nitrogen atom is likely to be
   partially protonated, allowing it to participate in an electrostatic
   interaction with the negatively-charged glutamate 318-residue, favouring
   N-3 demethylation, the major pathway of metabolism in both humans and
   animals. In conclusion caffeine, being essentially planar, is an inducer
   of CYP1A2 in rat liver.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide synthases (NOS) require NADPH and tetrahydrobiopterin
   (H(4)biopterin) to convert L-arginine to L-citrulline. The additional
   requirement and effects of thiols during purification and activity
   assays of NOS are unclear; for example, glutathione (GSH) has been
   reported to stimulate or, in the presence of catalase, to inhibit enzyme
   activity. We therefore studied the effects of different thiols, thiol
   reagents, antioxidants, and H(4)biopterin-regenerating systems on
   purified porcine cerebellum NOS. GSH in the presence of catalase did not
   inhibit NOS. In contrast, GSH and. to a lesser degree, several other
   thiols consistently, stimulated total L-arginine turnover up to 4-fold.
   In the presence of GSH, V-max of NOS was increased, the usually observed
   loss of activity during the 15 min assay was less dramatic, and the
   apparent S-0.5 Value for H(4)biopterin decreased. Stabilization of NOS
   activity by GSH was augmented by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI),
   indicating that, at least in part, GSH acted by reductive protection of
   NOS protein thiols. Consistent with this, four different protein thiol
   reagents abolished NOS activity. In other experiments, specific
   allosteric binding was excluded as a potential mechanism of GSH
   regulation of NOS. In addition, GSH may affect NOS kinetics by recycling
   or preventing the autoxidation of H-4-biopterin. biopterin. In support
   of this, the non-thiol reductant ascorbate and dihydropteridine
   reductase mimicked the effects of GSH on NOS kinetics, but not on NOS
   stability. Thus, NOS activity depends on both H(4)biopterin and the
   reduced state of essential protein thiols.}},

Abstract = {{In the compacted multilayered myelin sheath of the central nervous
   system, myelin basic protein (MBP) is thought to be responsible for
   adhesion of the intracellular surfaces by electrostatic interactions
   with acidic lipids. Noncompacted regions of myelin containing cytosol
   exist and can take up potassium released into the extracellular fluid
   after the axonal action potential. Therefore, the effect of K+
   concentration on the ability of MBP to aggregate large unilamellar
   vesicles (LUVs) containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 10-20\% acidic
   lipid was investigated. At MBP to lipid ratios where there was an excess
   of acidic lipid, physiological increases in K+ concentration up to about
   100 mM greatly increased MBP-mediated aggregation of the LUVs by
   shielding the negative charge on the vesicle surface. Thus, changes in
   K+ concentration during the axonal action potential could regulate
   MBP-mediated adhesion of the intracellular myelin surfaces of
   noncompacted regions of myelin such as the paranodal loops. It could
   thus regulate the volume of these cytosolic regions, allowing MBP to
   have a dynamic function in myelin. Concentrations of K+ above 150 mM
   caused dissociation of MBP from LUVs containing PC and a single acidic
   lipid. LUVs containing the lipid composition estimated to be
   characteristic of the cytoplasmic leaflet of myelin (Cyt.-LUVs) were
   found to interact uniquely with MBP, resulting in greater aggregation,
   greater sensitivity to K+ concentration, and resistance to dissociation
   at high K+ concentrations. The latter suggested that electrostatic
   interactions were not the only force involved in binding of MBP to the
   Cyt.-LUVs, Hydrogen bonding of the protein to the lipid head groups and
   hydrophobic interactions due to penetration of hydrophobic amino acid
   side chains into the bilayer could also occur. The greater involvement
   of hydrophobic interactions of MBP with Cyt.-LUVs compared to PC/acidic
   lipid LUVs was confirmed from greater labeling of MBP bound to Cyt.-LUVs
   by the hydrophobic photolabeled TID. Cholesterol and
   phosphatidylethanolamine together were found to be responsible for the
   greater MBP-mediated aggregation of Cyt.-LUVs and the greater TID
   labeling of MBP bound to Cyt.-LUVs compared to PC/acidic lipid LUVs.
   Thus, the lipid composition of the intracellular surface of myelin is
   well suited to allow MBP to mediate adhesion of apposing intracellular
   membranes and to respond in a dynamic way in some regions of myelin,
   such as the paranodal loops, to changes in K+ concentration resulting
   from nerve conduction.}},

Abstract = {{Hammond behavior, in which two neighboring states move closer to each
   other along the reaction coordinate as the energy difference between
   them becomes smaller, has previously been observed for the transition
   state of unfolding of barnase. Here, we report Hammond behavior for the
   small protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), which folds and unfolds
   via a single rate-determining transition state and simple two-state
   kinetics. Mutants have been generated along the entire sequence of the
   protein and the kinetics of folding and unfolding measured as a function
   of concentration of denaturant. The transition state was found to move
   progressively closer to the folded state on destabilization of the
   protein by mutation. Different regions of CI2 all show a similar
   sensitivity to changes in the energy of the transition state. This is in
   contrast to the behavior of barnase on mutation for which the position
   of the transition state for its unfolding is sensitive to mutation in
   some regions, especially in its major alpha-helix, but not in others.
   The transition state for the folding and unfolding of CI2 resembles an
   expanded version of the folded state and is formed in a concerted
   manner, in contrast to that for barnase, in which some regions of
   structure are fully formed and others fully unfolded. The reason for the
   general sensitivity of the position of the transition state of CI2 to
   mutation is presumably the relatively uniform degree of structure
   formation in the transition state and the concerted nature of its
   formation. Hammond behavior was also observed for both CI2 and barnase
   when the temperature and denaturation conditions of the unfolding
   reaction are altered. For both proteins, the position of the transition
   state of protein folding is more sensitive to changes in energy than is
   observed for the changes of covalent bonds in organic chemistry and
   enzyme catalysis. The finding of Hammond behavior for two proteins
   suggests that it is a general phenomenon in protein folding. The
   movement of the transition state on changing the conditions does have
   implications in the interpretation of computer simulations of protein
   folding done under extreme conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase (KNTase) is a plasmid-coded enzyme
   responsible for some types of bacterial resistance to amino,olycosides.
   The enzyme deactivates various antibiotics by transferring a nucleoside
   monophosphate group from ATP to the 4'-hydroxyl group of the drug.
   Detailed knowledge of the interactions between the protein and the
   substrates may lead to the design of aminoglycosides less susceptible to
   bacterial deactivation. Here we describe the structure of KNTase
   complexed with both the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog AMPCPP and
   kanamycin. Crystals employed in the investigation were grown from
   poly(ethylene glycol) solutions and belonged to the space group
   P2(1)2(1)2(1) With unit cell dimensions of a = 57.3 Angstrom, b = 102.2
   Angstrom, c = 101.8 Angstrom, and one dimer in the asymmetric unit.
   Least-squares refinement of the model at 2.5 Angstrom resolution reduced
   the crystallographic R factor to 16.8\%. The binding pockets for both
   the nucleotide and the antibiotic are extensively exposed to the solvent
   and are composed of amino acid residues contributed by both subunits in
   the dimer. There are few specific interactions between the protein and
   the adenine ring of the nucleotide; rather the, AMPCPP molecule is
   locked into position by extensive hydrogen bonding between the alpha-,
   beta-, and gamma-phosphates and protein side chains. This, in part, may
   explain the observation that the enzyme can utilize other nucleotides
   such as GTP and UTP. The 4'-hydroxyl group of the antibiotic is
   approximately 5 Angstrom from the alpha-phosphorus of the nucleotide and
   is in the proper orientation for a single in-line displacement attack at
   the phosphorus. Glu 145, which lies within hydrogen-bonding distance of
   the 4'-hydroxyl group, is proposed to be the active site base.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of a stabilized structure during oxidative protein folding
   can severely retard disulfide formation if the structure must be
   disrupted to gain access to buried cysteines. These kinetic traps can
   slow protein folding and disulfide bond formation to the extent that
   unassisted folding is too slow to be kinetically competent in the cell.
   Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) facilitates the oxidation of a
   kinetically trapped state of RTEM-1 beta-lactamase in which two
   cysteines that form the single disulfide bond in the native protein are
   buried and approximately 500-fold less reactive than exposed cysteines.
   Under second-order conditions, PDI-dependent oxidation of reduced,
   folded beta-lactamase is 500-fold faster than GSSG-dependent oxidation.
   The rate difference observed between PDI and GSSG can be accounted for
   by the 520-fold higher kinetic reactivity of PDI as an oxidant.
   Noncovalent interactions between PDI (35 mu M) and beta-lactamase
   increase the reactivity or unfolding of beta-lactamase in the
   steady-state by less than 3-fold. At high concentrations of PDI or
   alkylating agents, the reaction of beta-lactamase cysteines approaches a
   constant rate, limited by the spontaneous unfolding of the protein
   (k(unfold) = 0.024 +/- 0.005 min(-1)). PDI does not substantially
   increase the rate of beta-lactamase unfolding; however, once
   beta-lactamase spontaneously unfolds. PDI at concentrations greater than
   44 +/- 4 mu M, oxidizes the unfolded substrate before it can refold
   (k(fold) = 1.5 +/- 0.2 min(-1)). PDI also facilitates the glutathione
   disulfide-dependent oxidation of beta-lactamase by approximately
   1.7-3-fold, even at saturating GSSG concentrations; however, oxidation
   rates never exceed the rate of spontaneous beta-lactamase unfolding. The
   high kinetic reactivity of PDI as an oxidant and the almost millimolar
   concentrations of PDI found in the endoplasmic reticulum provide one
   mechanism to avoid kinetic traps by making oxidation kinetically
   competitive with the formation of kinetic traps. In addition, PDI's high
   reactivity and its noncovalent interactions with unfolded proteins may
   minimize the significance of even relatively stable kinetic traps, as
   long as unfolding of the kinetic trap does not become rate-limiting.
   Chaperones, including the hsp70 chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum,
   BiP, and the Escherichia coli chaperonin, GroEL, do not appear to
   increase the rate of beta-lactamase unfolding. This suggests that the
   unfolding rate may help define those structures that the endoplasmic
   reticulum quality control system recognizes as native.}},

Abstract = {{Escherichia coli individual sigma factors direct RNA polymerase (RNAP)
   to specific promoters. Upon heat shock induction there is a transient
   increase in the rate of transcription of similar to 20 heat shock genes,
   whose promoters are recognized by the RNAP-sigma(32) rather than the
   RNAP-sigma(70) holoenzyme. At least three heat shock proteins, DnaK,
   DnaJ and GrpE, are involved in negative modulation of the
   sigma(32)-dependent heat shock response. Here we show, using purified
   enzymes, that upon heat treatment of RNAP holoenzyme the sigma(70)
   factor is preferentially inactivated, whereas the resulting heat-treated
   RNAP core is still able to initiate transcription once supplemented with
   sigma(32) (or fresh sigma(70)). Heat-aggregated sigma(70) becomes a
   target for the joint action of DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE proteins, which
   reactivate it in an ATP-dependent reaction. The RNAP-sigma(32)
   holoenzyme is relatively stable at temperatures at which the
   RNAP-sigma(70) holoenzyme is inactivated. Furthermore, we show that
   formation of the RNAP-sigma(32) holoenzyme is favored over that of
   RNAP-sigma(70) at elevated temperatures. We propose a model of negative
   autoregulation of the heat shock response in which cooperative action of
   DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE heat shock proteins switches transcription back to
   constitutively expressed genes through the simultaneous reactivation of
   heat-aggregated sigma(70), as well as sequestration of sigma(32) away
   from RNAP.}},

Abstract = {{The 3-D structure of Bacillus cereus (569/H/9) beta-lactamase (EC
   3.5.2.6), which catalyses the hydrolysis of nearly all beta-lactams, has
   been solved at 2.5 Angstrom resolution by the multiple isomorphous
   replacement method, with density modification and phase combination,
   from crystals of the native protein and of a specially designed mutant
   (T97C). The current model includes 212 of the 227 amino acid residues,
   the zinc ion and 10 water molecules. The protein is folded into a beta
   beta sandwich with helices on each external face. To our knowledge, this
   fold has never been observed. An approximate internal molecular symmetry
   is found, with a 2-fold axis passing roughly through the zinc ion and
   suggesting a possible gene duplication. The active site is located at
   one edge of the beta beta sandwich and near the N-terminal end of a
   helix. The zinc ion is coordinated by three histidine residues (86, 88
   and 149) and a water molecule. A sequence comparison of the relevant
   metallo-beta-lactamases, based on this protein structure, highlights a
   few well-conserved amino acid residues. The structure shows that most of
   these residues are in the active site. Among these, aspartic acid 90 and
   histidine 210 participate in a proposed catalytic mechanism for
   beta-lactam hydrolysis.}},

Abstract = {{In insects, head movements are mediated by neck muscles supplied by
   nerves originating in the brain and prothoracic ganglion. Extracellular
   recordings of the nerves demonstrate units that respond to visual
   stimulation of the compound eyes and to mechanosensory stimulation of
   the halteres. The number of neck muscles required for optokinetic eye
   movements in flies is not known, although in other taxa, eye movements
   can involve as few as three pairs of muscles. This study investigates
   which neck motor neurons are likely to be involved in head movements by
   examining the relationships between neck muscle motor neurons and the
   terminals visiting them from approximately 50 pairs of descending
   neurons. Many of these descending neurons have dendrites in neuropils
   that are associated with modalities other than vision, and recordings
   show that visual stimuli activate only a few neck motor neurons, such as
   the sclerite depressor neurons, which respond to local or wide-field,
   directionally specific motion, as do a subset of descending neurons
   coupled to them. The results suggest that, like in the vertebrate eye or
   the retinas of jumping spiders, optokinetic head movements of flies
   require only a few muscles. In addition to the importance of visual
   inputs, a major supply to neck muscle centers by nonvisual descending
   neurons suggests a role for tactile, gustatory, and olfactory signals in
   controlling head position. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Quasielastic light scattering (QLS) in the glassy polymer
   poly(methylmethacrylate) is investigated in the temperature range 12-470
   K. Raman spectra were measured in the frequency interval 3-600 cm(-1).
   The detailed temperature dependence of the Raman intensity at some fixed
   frequencies, omega = 5, 8, 20 cm(-1) is obtained. The influence of the
   quenching on the QLS is investigated. It is shown that there are two
   characteristic temperature regions with different dependences of the QLS
   intensity on temperature. The first one is for T < 50-80 K, where the
   reduced Raman intensity increases with a characteristic activation
   energy of the order of 30 K. The second region is the high-temperature
   one: T > 80-100 K. Here the relaxation time is nearly constant while the
   reduced Raman intensity increases with an activation energy of the order
   of 700 K up to the glass transition temperature T-g. The spectral
   dependence of the relaxation contribution, found by a subtraction of the
   lowest-temperature (12 K) spectrum from the current one,
   I(T,omega)/(n(omega)+1), demonstrates a relaxational beta peak which
   weakly depends on temperature. Its characteristic frequency is of the
   order of its width and is equal to 8-10 cm(-1). The peak can be well
   fitted by a Lorentzian. The data obtained are considered within the
   frames of the existing models of QLS.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular endothelial cell (EC) injury or activation by LPS plays a
   critical role in the pathogenesis of Gram-negative meningitis and
   endotoxic shock. EC do not express membrane CD14, but respond to LPS in
   a soluble CD14-dependent manner. The signal transduction mechanisms
   involved in LPS-induced EC responses are largely unknown. We used bovine
   and human brain microvessel EC (BBMEC, and HBMEC) to study LPS-induced
   protein tyrosine phosphorylation. LPS rapidly induced the tyrosine
   phosphorylation of several proteins in BBMEC and HBMEC, which was
   detectable by 5 to 15 min, reached a maximum by 30 min, and declined by
   60 to 90 min. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was apparent
   following stimulation with LPS at 0.1 ng/ml and was dose dependent up to
   100 ng/ml. Similar changes in tyrosine phosphorylation were induced by
   smooth and rough LPS as well as lipid A, but not by the inactive lipid A
   analogue, Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides diphosphoryl lipid A.
   Pretreatment of EC with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A,
   inhibited LPS-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and
   LPS-mediated lactic dehydrogenase release from BBMEC and IL-6 release
   from HBMEC in a dose-dependent manner. Three proteins with apparent m.w.
   of 44, 42, and 41 kDa were predominant among the LPS-induced tyrosine
   phosphoproteins, and they were identified as mitogen-activated protein
   kinase isoforms ERK1, ERK2, and p38, respectively. LPS-induced protein
   tyrosine phosphorylation in HBMEC and BBMEC was soluble CD14 dependent,
   since pretreatment of these cells with anti-hCD14 mAb inhibited the
   LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p44, p42, and p41. Additionally,
   LPS induced a mobility shift in p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein
   kinase isozymes, which was inhibited by herbimycin A pretreatment of the
   EC. These findings demonstrate for the first time that increased protein
   tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein
   kinases occur rapidly after LPS stimulation of EC in the presence of
   soluble CD14. Our data also suggest that a herbimycin-sensitive step,
   presumably a tyrosine kinase, is involved in mediating LPS-induced human
   EC activation and IL-6 secretion.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously reported that serum amyloid A (SAA) induces adhesion
   and chemotaxis of human monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils, in
   vitro as well as in vivo. Since the mechanism of SAA signaling is
   unknown, we have investigated the possibility that SAA, like other
   chemoattractants such as the chemotactic peptide FMLP and chemokines,
   might induce migration of monocytes by G protein activation. We report
   here that preincubation of monocytes with pertussis toxin (PTx)
   inhibited SAA chemotaxis, while incubation with cholera toxin (CTx) did
   not, Staurosporine and H-7, both inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC),
   significantly decreased rSAA-induced chemotaxis of monocytes, suggesting
   that PKC may be involved in the rSAA signaling pathway. Moreover, rSAA,
   at concentrations that were effective in chemoattracting monocytes,
   resulted in transient elevation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration
   ({[}Ca2+](i)), and incubation of cells with PTx markedly inhibited the
   mobilization of Ca2+ in response to rSAA. This suggests that both
   chemotaxis and the rise in {[}Ca2+](i), are mediated by G proteins of
   the Gi class. The increase in {[}Ca2+](i), induced in monocytes by rSAA,
   was comparable to that elicited by FMLP, and was severalfold greater
   than that induced by optimal concentrations of chemokine beta-family
   members such as RANTES, MCAF/MCP-1, and MIP-1 alpha. The
   chemoattractants FMLP, RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MCAF/MCP-1, all failed
   to desensitize rSAA-induced Ca2+ influx and chemotaxis in monocytes.
   This suggests that SAA uses a distinct receptor that is coupled to
   PTx-sensitive G proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Tensile specimens of an Al-24 wt \% Cu alloy of grain sizes in the range
   7.6-20.6 mu m were deformed at 400-540 degrees C using constant initial
   strain rates ranging from 5 x 10(-6) to 2 x 10(-2) s(-1). Initially the
   stress-strain (sigma-epsilon) curves show work hardening which is
   followed by strain softening at higher strain rates and lower
   temperatures. At lower strain rates and higher temperatures, on the
   other hand, sigma continues to increase with strain or tends to be
   independent of strain. Grain growth and cavitation occur to varying
   extents depending on strain rate and test temperature. While the grain
   growth can account for the work hardening at higher temperatures as well
   as at lower strain rates, it fails to do so at higher strain rates. The
   strain softening is associated with cavitation. The presence of

Abstract = {{The detailed structure of a 3-ML Fe film grown epitaxially at 100 K and
   annealed to room temperature on a Cu(001) substrate was determined by
   high-resolution medium-energy ion scattering. Each layer of the Fe film
   has large glide distortions along fee {[}110] directions which are
   precursors to the martensitic shear transformation of the fee Fe to bcc
   Fe. The glide causes vertical expansions of each Fe layer and
   significant local atomic disorder of the Fe atoms in the film and the Cu
   substrate atoms near the interface. Unlike previous studies it is found
   that the Fe in-plane nearest-neighbor distance is about 1.5\% smaller
   than the Cu(001) substrate. These structural features demonstrate the
   strong energetics that drive the Fe towards a bcc structure. The
   structural model derived from the ion scattering data is compared to the
   model obtained from a recent low-energy electron-diffraction study. The
   structural results have a strong correlation with the measured magnitude
   of the magneto-optic Kerr effect hysteresis loops at magnetic
   saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Background Human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells synthesize
   prostanoids. Several of these have been implicated in the physiological
   and pathophysiological regulation of vascular tone; however, there is no
   direct evidence that human blood vessels synthesize sufficient
   prostanoid to alter vessel tone.
   Methods and Results We explored the effects of local infusions of
   arachidonic acid on the lone of preconstricted superficial hand veins in
   healthy volunteers. Aspirin was used to assess the contribution of
   prostanoids to the responses seen. Local infusion of arachidonic acid
   produced a dose-dependent dilatation of preconstricted veins. This was
   abolished by local infusion of aspirin. Oral aspirin was also effective:
   a high (antiinflammatory) dose of aspirin (1 g) taken 2 hours before the
   experiment blocked the arachidonic acid-induced venodilatation; however,
   a low (cardioprotective) dose of aspirin (75 mg) did not. Unlike the
   responses to arachidonic acid, responses to glyceryltrinitrate and
   bradykinin were unaltered by aspirin (1 g). Ex vivo platelet aggregation
   was inhibited by aspirin in both high and low doses. Aspirin (1 g)
   inhibited arachidonic acid-induced venodilatation for up to 5 days. The
   time course was similar for vascular and platelet effects.
   Conclusions The present findings demonstrate that local generation of
   prostanoids in a human vessel in vivo alters vascular tone. The
   predominant prostanoid synthesized is a dilator and its synthesis can be
   blocked by an anti-inflammatory but not a cardioprotective dose of
   aspirin. The results suggest that selective inhibition of platelet
   aggregation by oral aspirin might be a function of dose rather than the
   interval between doses.}},

   preserved in proteoliposome preparations. BA transport into 20- and
   14-day-gestation rat mTPM vesicles was also stimulated by the presence
   of ATP as noted in human mTPM and in the rat liver canalicular membrane.
   Besides this functional similarity, these ATP-dependent carriers may
   share structural characteristics, as demonstrated by studies using an

Abstract = {{Resumption of ovarian follicle activity and uterine involution was
   studied in the post partum llama. Thirty-nine adult multiparous llamas
   were monitored by ultrasonography and analysis of urinary estrone
   sulfate for 30 d post partum at the La Raya Research Station in Peru.
   Uterine involution was measured in terms of reduction of length and
   diameter of both uterine horns. Correlation analysis was used to relate
   follicle size and concentration of estrone sulfate. Analysis of variance
   was used to determine rate of uterine involution relative to days post
   partum. The left ovary was palpated and scanned by Day 3 post partum in
   contrast to Day 1 post partum for the right ovary. Ovulatory size
   follicles, 7 mm, were present by Day 7.4 post partum (range 4 to 14 d).
   Follicle growth was detected as early as Day 4 post partum with follicle
   size being less during the first follicle wave (7.4 mm) compared to the
   second and third waves (9 to 10 mm). Concentrations of urinary estrone
   sulfate were positively related (P<0.05) to follicular size, but to a
   lesser degree during the first follicle wave (19.4 ng/mg Cr), than to
   the second wave (25.4 ng/mg Cr). Uterine involution, as measured by
   diameter, was different between the left (gravid) and right (nongravid)
   uterine horn (P<0.05) for the 17 d post partum, and was also different
   from that of control females for the 21 d post partum. Uterine

Abstract = {{A number of studies have suggested that abdominal positioning
   interneurons (APIs) in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii can influence
   activity in multiple motor centers. Previous work on this population of
   neurons has demonstrated that they control the activity of tonic
   abdominal motor neurons (MNs) which generate postural movements of the
   abdomen and, to some extent, the activity of swimmeret MNs. This
   investigation demonstrates that many identified APIs also affect the
   activity of two populations of MNs which open and close the uropods and,
   in some cases, that of the swimmeret MNs as well. The majority (64\%) of
   APIs examined in this study have an excitatory effect on both
   populations of uropod MNs. A smaller number (23\%) increase the level of
   activity in one population of uropod MNs, and suppress, or have no
   effect on, the activity of the other population of uropod MNs.
   Approximately 25\% of the APIs which were examined influence the output
   of swimmeret MNs, in addition to affecting the activity of uropod MNs.
   There are also indications that previous estimates of the number of APIs
   may have been too low This is based on the observation that many APIs
   possess what appear to be similar morphologies but generate different
   patterns of motor output. Taken together, these findings support the
   idea that APIs influence the output of multiple motor centers which play
   a role in the control of general body posture and balance in crayfish.

Abstract = {{Survival differences have been noted between black women and white women
   with breast cancer. It is hypothesized that a prolonged interval between
   initial medical consultation and establishment of a diagnosis (system
   delay), resulting in a more advanced stage of disease at diagnosis,
   might explain part of this survival difference. This study was performed
   to determine whether system delay differs between black and white breast
   cancer patients, and to examine predictors of delay in blacks and
   whites. The study population consisted of 996 female breast cancer
   patients from the National Cancer Institute's Black/White Cancer
   Survival Study, a cohort study carried out in 1985-1986 in the
   metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Georgia, New Orleans, Louisiana, and San
   Francisco/Oakland, California. The median system delay was slightly
   longer for blacks than for whites-2.7 weeks versus 2.1 weeks-but this
   difference was not statistically significant. Having a palpable lump at
   diagnosis was associated with reduced system delay in both races, while
   use of a public clinic increased system delay for blacks. Older women
   were less likely to be subject to longer system delay than younger
   women, and this effect was somewhat more pronounced in whites. Survival
   differences between blacks and whites are probably not due to
   differences in system delay. However, many women had delays of at least
   3 months. Given that younger age and the absence of a palpable lump were
   the factors most predictive of significant system delay, interventions
   should be targeted specifically toward reducing system delay in younger
   women who present without the classical painless lump.}},

   (mvRuO-RuCN) modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode is described. The
   oxoruthenium centers cross-linked with ruthenium cyanide are believed to
   be the electroactive surface species in acidic media. The capability of
   mvRuO-RuCN films to catalyze the slow electrode reaction of aldehydic
   compounds is illustrated in cyclic voltammetry and flowing streams
   amperometric detection. A sensitive quantitation of aliphatic and
   furanic aldehydes without the need of derivatization steps was achieved
   by coupling ion exclusion chromatography (IEC) with electrochemical
   detection, using the mvRuO-RuCN film electrode. The presence of low
   RuCl3 and K4Ru(CN)(6) levels in the mobile phase considerably improves
   the response stability. Of practical importance is that this modified
   electrode can be used without detrimental effects at a column
   temperature of 60 degrees C. At room temperature, the detection limits
   of aliphatic aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and
   butyraldehyde in IEC with amperometric detection (E(appl) = +1.08 V vs

Abstract = {{Although peak oxygen consumption is reduced in patients with symptomatic
   heart failure, the degree of limitation during routine activity often
   appears greater or lesser than expected from peak capacity. This study
   was undertaken to determine whether abnormalities could be detected
   during the initiation of steady-state low-level exercise, approximating
   routine activity, which were distinct from limitation in peak capacity,
   We sought to determine whether a delay in the integrated response to the
   increased metabolic demand caused by exercise, assessed by the oxygen
   deficit incurred between exercise initiation and the achievement of
   steady-state oxygen uptake, was present in heart failure, Low-level and
   symptom-limited maximal exercise tests in 33 ambulatory patients with
   heart failure were analyzed and compared with 9 tests in control
   subjects, Oxygen deficit was determined during the 8-minute low-level
   exercise at 20 W. During maximal exercise, as expected, patients with
   heart failure had lower peak oxygen uptake (16 +/- 4 vs 31 +/- 6
   ml/kg/min) and anaerobic threshold (870 +/- 270 vs 1,180 +/- 370 ml/min)
   than controls. After 8 minutes of low-level exercise, the oxygen deficit
   was higher in patients than in controls (550 +/- 230 vs 270 +/- 100 ml,
   respectively, p <0.01). Among patients with heart failure, the oxygen
   deficit did not correlate with peak oxygen uptake or anaerobic
   threshold. Although the time to steady-state heart rate was later in
   patients with heart failure, this delay did not correlate with oxygen
   deficit. The oxygen deficit represents a distinct abnormality of
   exercise response that may reflect impaired central and peripheral
   responses to the initiation of exercise.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a combined experimental and computational study of
   the steady flow through an internal combustion engine inlet port. The
   port was of generic design with a straight centreline. The
   three-dimensional velocity and turbulence fields in the port and
   cylinder were simulated using a computational fluid dynamics programme.
   Laser sheet flow visualization and laser Doppler anemometry were also
   employed to investigate the flows and assess the predictions. The
   results show that a large-scale flow structure is created in the
   cylinder by the inlet jet and its interaction with the valve and
   cylinder walls. Both predictions and measurements show that the flow is
   strongly dependent on the valve lift but is not affected by the flow
   rate. Comparisons of the numerical predictions with the experimental
   data indicated that the mean flow features are accurately predicted in
   many parts of the flow field; some discrepancies are evident and stem
   primarily from the failure of the simulation to predict a small
   recirculation region in the port which affects the trajectory of the
   annular jet entering the cylinder. Calculations were also made without
   modelling the port shape by using simplified inlet conditions upstream
   of the valve seat. It was found that this approximation can provide a
   reasonable, albeit less accurate, description of the flow but modelling
   of the port shape is necessary for accurate flow predictions.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of
   extended, continuous infusion of urokinase plus stent deployment to
   treat older saphenous vein bypass grafts obstructed by both thrombus and
   atheromatous material. Thirty patients with angiographic evidence of
   thrombus and atheromatous material obstructing older vein grafts (mean
   age 8.3 years) underwent the combined interventions of urokinase
   infusion and stent deployment. The continuous infusion of urokinase was
   administered directly into each obstructed vein graft over a mean of
   20.5 +/- 8.1 hours (median dose 2.2 +/- 0.7 million units). Stents were
   deployed at the sites of atheromatous obstruction either before (5
   patients) or after (25 patients) infusion of urokinase. Twenty-eight of
   the 30 patients were successfully treated with the combined
   interventions (success rate 93.3\%). In these 28 patients, percent
   diameter stenosis at the site of obstruction decreased from 86.0\% to
   -0.2\% and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial flow increased
   from 1.0 to 2.5. Two patients (6.7\%) developed stent thrombosis
   followed by myocardial infarction (1 with Q-wave infarction, 3.3\%) and
   congestive heart failure. Minor complications included non-Q-wave
   myocardial infarction (5 patients, 16.7\%) and access-site hemorrhage (5
   patients, 16.7\%). At 2-week follow-up, anginal symptoms were decreased
   in all 28 successfully treated patients. At 7.2 +/- 3.7-month follow-up,
   5 of the 28 successfully treated patients (17.9\%) had reacceleration of
   angina and angiographically documented restenosis at the site of stent
   deployment. Thus, the combined interventions are highly efficacious in
   treating older vein grafts obstructed by both thrombus and atheromatous
   material, but are also associated with significant procedural
   complications including stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and
   access-site hemorrhage.}},

Abstract = {{Influence functions (IFs) of a linear barotropic vorticity equation
   model are computed in order to determine the regions in which anomalous
   divergence at upper levels, related to tropical heating anomalies, has
   the largest impact on certain prominent low-frequency anomalies. The
   present computation differs from that of Branstator in two aspects: (a)
   the model includes the effects of the basic-flow divergence and the
   advection by anomalous divergent wind and (b) the influence functions
   directly assess the influence of upper-level divergence anomalies rather
   than sources of vorticity. The IFs are applied to the study of
   low-frequency tropical-extratropical interactions at the interannual
   (ENSO) and intraseasonal (30-60-day oscillation) timescales. The origin
   of well-known teleconnection patterns is explored through the
   identification of common influence regions in the Tropics and subtropics
   for their main action centers. The subtropical west and central-east
   Pacific, north of the equator, is an important source region for the
   Pacific North America (PNA) pattern, and the South Atlantic convergence
   zone (SACZ) for the Eurasian and North Atlantic patterns. The IFs and
   the barotropic model results, as well as the evolution of the anomalous
   OLR fields associated with the 30-60-day oscillation, indicate the
   existence of a chain of connections. This chain constitutes a link
   between the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and the SACZ, as well
   as the control of the SACZ over the Atlantic and Eurasian pattern, which
   possibly connects back to the western Pacific. This connection can also
   occur at interannual timescales during ENSO events. An explanation of
   the relative insensitivity of the PNA pattern to the longitudinal
   position of the Pacific equatorial convection anomaly, reported by
   Geisler et al., is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Nonopsonized Bordetella pertussis bind to human monocytes by means of
   the virulence factors filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin, and
   the minor fimbrial subunit FimD. Receptors on monocytes that mediate
   binding of B. pertussis to these cells include complement receptor type
   3 (CR3), which binds to FHA of B. pertussis, and very late antigen-5
   (VLA-5), which binds to an, as yet, unknown ligand on these bacteria. In
   the present study, the possibility that FimD acts as a ligand for VLA-5
   was investigated. Soluble fibronectin, which is the natural ligand for
   VLA-5, or mAbs against VLA-5 inhibited binding to monocytes of B.
   pertussis strains that express FimD but not of mutant strains that lack
   FimD. Beads that were coated with the fusion protein maltose-binding
   protein-FimD bound to adherent monocytes, and this binding was inhibited
   by soluble fibronectin or mAb against the alpha- or beta-chain of VLA-5,
   while soluble collagen or mAb against VLA-4 VLA-6, CR3, or HLA class II
   had no effect. Down-modulation of VLA-5 on the apical surface of
   monocytes by plating the cells onto surfaces precoated with anti-VLA-5
   mAb also inhibited binding of beads coated with maltose-binding
   protein-FimD to monocytes, while precoating of the surfaces with mAb
   against VLA-6 or CR3 had no effect. These results indicate that VLA-5 on
   monocytes serves as a receptor for FimD on B. pertussis. Binding of
   C3bi-coated erythrocytes to monocytes, which is a measure of the binding
   activity of CR3, was enhanced when monocytes were adhered onto plates
   precoated with purified fimbriae of B. pertussis, while precoating with
   fimbriae lacking FimD had no effect. Precoating of the plates with
   FimD-containing fimbriae also enhanced binding of B. pertussis, which
   express FHA, but not of strains that lack FHA, to monocytes. The
   enhanced binding of C3bi-coated erythrocytes and B. pertussis to
   monocytes could be markedly inhibited by tyrphostin-47, a protein
   tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These results demonstrate that interaction of
   FimD of B. pertussis with VLA-5 on monocytes activates CR3, which
   requires protein tyrosine kinases and results in enhanced binding of B.

Abstract = {{Patterns of cytokine expression were analyzed in polyclonal and
   antigenic responses in children with perinatal HIV infection. Responses
   of PBL to PMA and A23187 calcium ionophore studied in patients in
   different stages of HIV infection revealed reduced levels of IL-2 in
   HIV-infected children beginning before 6 mo of age, and age-dependent
   increases in expression of IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma. The levels of
   IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma expression did not differ significantly
   between HIV-infected and age-matched uninfected children of
   HIV-seropositive mothers, except for a small reduction in HIV-infected
   children in late stages of infection. Responses to PHA, HLA
   alloantigens, HIV envelope peptides T1 and P18, and tetanus toxoid were
   studied in PBMC derived from asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic
   HIV-infected children. IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-5 expression was
   detected in PHA-stimulated PBMC from all analyzed patients. HIV-infected
   children who failed to respond to HLA alloantigens, tetanus toxoid, or
   the envelope peptides had lower numbers of CD4(+) cells and expressed,
   on PHA stimulation, higher levels of IL-4 and IL-5 and lower levels of
   IL-2 and IFN-gamma than patients who responded to the antigenic
   stimulation. Results of these analyses suggest that cytokine expression
   in HIV-infected children depends on the character of the stimuli as well
   as the phenotype of PBMC, and indicate possible prevalence of Th2
   Ag-specific responses during the progression of HIV-induced
   immunodeficiency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an approach to shape optimal design of elastic

   treated as to be assembled from several frame design elements, which in
   turn may consist of several appropriately joined beam finite elements.
   The shape of each frame design element is defined-by convenient
   functions involving Bezier blending polynomials. The original
   formulation of the beam finite element, proposed by Saje, is modified in
   order to fit nicely into the context of the frame design element
   technique. The formulation, of the shape optimal design problem in a
   form of a problem of non-linear mathematical programming and its
   solution by employing gradient-based methods of mathematical programming
   are discussed briefly. The theory is illustrated with two numerical

Abstract = {{It has been shown that an iron foil based on the Fe-B-Si system is a
   suitable material for use as a high-temperature interlayer for transient
   liquid-phase (TLP) bonding of ferritic oxide dispersion strengthened
   alloys. TLP bonding produced ferritic joints, free from intermetallic
   precipitates and identical in composition to that of the parent metal.
   In contrast, however, TLP bonding using the nickel-base foil, BNi1a,
   resulted in an austenitic bond region stabilized by the high nickel
   concentration. Furthermore, the retention of the melting point
   depressants, particularly silicon, at the centre of the joints resulted
   in the bond solidifying with the formation of silicide-boride
   precipitates both at the bond centre and at the braze/parent metal
   interface. High-temperature heat treatments failed to remove the
   gamma-Fe phase and the precipitates, and their presence detrimentally
   affected the mechanical properties of the joint. The formation of
   intermetallic precipitates at the braze centre has been attributed to
   the initial high concentration of chromium present in the BNi1a brazing
   foil. Preliminary mechanical tests showed that bond strengths of joints
   made using the iron-base foil were superior to those obtained using the
   commercial nickel braze. When the iron-base foil was used, bond
   strengths both at room temperature and at the service temperature (700
   degrees C) were near parent metal strengths. However, at room
   temperature, failure was observed to occur away from the bond interface,
   whilst at elevated temperatures, joints failed along the bond interface;
   this was attributed to the effects of melt-back phenomenon
   characteristic in TLP bonding.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The inflammatory process is Likely involved in normal tissue
   damage after radiation exposure, yet few studies have directly evaluated
   the factors that might be involved in the regulation of inflammation
   after irradiation in vivo. We tested the hypothesis that
   platelet-activating factor, a neutrophil agonist synthesized by
   endothelial cells, is involved in the upregulation of radiation-induced
   leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions by using an inhibitor of its
   receptor, BN52021.
   Methods and Materials: Fischer-344 rats with dorsal skin-fold window
   chambers were randomized to three experimental groups: control (sham
   irradiation); 6 Gy radiation; and 6 Gy + BN52021. BN52021 (0.5 mg/kg)
   was administered 5 min prior to 6 Gy radiation. Leukocytes were stained
   in vivo with i.v. acridine orange for visualization with fluorescent
   microscopy. Venous vessel diameters were measured and numbers of rolling
   leukocytes were counted per 30-s period, The number of adhering
   leukocytes per unit surface area was also determined. Differences among
   the three experimental groups for rolling and adhering leukocytes were
   analyzed using a mixed-effects linear model with vessel shear rate used
   as a covariate.
   Results are reported as means +/- standard errors. Results: Irradiation
   caused upregulation of leukocyte rolling, as compared with sham-treated
   controls (p = 0.04): the BN compound in addition to radiation did not
   downregulate this effect. Irradiation also upregulated leukocyte
   adhesion (p < 0.001), but the addition of BN52021 prior to irradiation
   blocked this effect. The drug did not affect heart rate or blood
   pressure.
   Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that radiation-induced
   upregulation of leukocyte adhesion is mediated by platelet-activating
   factor. These results are consistent with prior reports that
   platelet-activating factor is not involved in leukocyte rolling, which
   involves separate families of adhesion molecules from those that
   regulate adhesion. BN52021, a ginkolide, or other related drugs might
   provide a useful pharmacological means to prevent or ameliorate
   inflammatory pathways that are invoked after radiation exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Muscle action potentials elicited by paired transcranial
   magnetic stimulation were recorded during spine surgery in 34 patients.
   Anesthesia was based on ketamine and fentanyl.
   Objectives. To evaluate the optimal anesthetic regimen to be used for
   transcranial magnetic stimulation, and to determine the clinical import
   of magnetic-evoked compound muscle action potentials.
   Summary of Background Data. Muscle;action potential by transcranial
   magnetic stimulation has been difficult to record under general
   anesthesia. Ketamine is known to not suppress the muscle responses,
   although no conclusive clinical study has been reported.
   Methods. Paired transcranial magnetic stimulation was delivered as
   muscle action potentials were recorded from the limb musculature.
   Results. Neuromonitoring was reliable in 56\% of total cases and in 82\%
   of the recent cases after reducing fentanyl dosage. Paired magnetic
   stimulation was an excellent facilitation technique for reliable
   monitoring. At higher dosages, fentanyl and ketamine decreased the
   reproducibility of the responses.
   Conclusions. Magnetic-evoked compound muscle action potential
   neuromonitoring is a a sensitive and selective motor pathway monitoring
   method that covers the-entire motor pathway, including the white and
   gray matter of the spinal cord. Ketamine-based anesthesia is a good
   choice for this purpose.}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically study the conductance of a quantum dot on which there
   is an on-site Coulomb interaction of energy U as well as a

   model is used to describe the boson held. The conductance is calculated
   via a Landauer-type formula by the equations-of-motion method of the
   retarded Green's function. An analytic and compact formula for the
   retarded Green's function is obtained with two effective self-energies
   which are renormalized by both electron-electron and boson-electron
   interactions. Our numerical results show that the presence of a boson
   held typically leads to sideband peaks and decreases the main peak
   related to the Coulomb interaction. The sideband peak height is
   sensitive to boson-electron interaction coupling constant g. We also
   present the temperature dependence of the conductance in the presence of
   a boson held.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Approximately 140,000 new cases of colorectal carcinoma will
   be diagnosed in 1995 in the United States, and more than one-third of
   these patients will die from progressive disease. Despite the modest
   improvement in response rate with chemotherapy, little improvement in
   patient survival has been noted. Consequently, the evaluation of new
   agents, modalities, and combinations is needed.
   Methods. Two cell lines, HCT 116 and COLO 320 HSR, were treated with
   various concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), folinic acid (FA), and
   hydroxyurea (HU). Subsequently, 41 patients with advanced, measurable
   metastatic colorectal carcinoma were enrolled in the study. Patients
   were treated with oral doses of HU (500 mg) every 8 hours on Days 1 and
   2,5-FU (400-500 mg/m(2)) intravenously Day 2 and FA (100 mg/m(2))
   intravenously on Day 2 of every week for 6 consecutive weeks, followed
   by a 2-week rest period. All patients were evaluable for toxicity, and
   40 were evaluable for response.
   Results. In both cell lines, the combination of 5-FU/FA/HU consistently
   produced the best cytotoxic effect. Clinically, the maximum tolerated
   dose of 5-FU was established at a level of 500 mg/m(2) (450 mg/m(2) for
   patients older than 70 years of age). Ten patients experienced Grade 3
   or 4 toxicity, consisting mainly of diarrhea. Eleven of 40 evaluable
   patients responded (three complete responses, eight partial responses).
   with a median survival of 12+ months and time to progression of 8.5+
   months.
   Conclusion. The biochemical modulation of 5-FU with FA and HU were
   significantly effective in treating patients with metastatic colorectal
   carcinoma. Overall, this regimen was well tolerated with only moderate
   toxicity. Further studies incorporating intravenous HU as well as a
   randomized Phase III study of J-FU/FA/HU versus 5-FU/FA are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic properties of thermally grown ZrO2 thin films before and
   after Ar+ bombardment have been studied with resonant photoemission
   spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation. For stoichiometric ZrO2 thin
   films the experimental valence-band spectra are in good agreement with
   the calculated density of states for bulk ZrO2. For both stoichiometric
   and Ar+-bombarded ZrO2 thin films, resonant photoemission from the
   valence band was observed when the photon energy was swept through the
   Zr 4p-->4d transition energy. The resonant profile was found to exhibit
   a maximum at hv=39 eV, followed by a second well-resolved broad maximum
   around 50 eV. The feature at 39 eV is consistent with resonant
   enhancement of the Zr 4d states and has been used to identify those
   regions of the valence band with an important Zr 4d admixture. The
   results are in good agreement with the calculated Zr 4d partial density
   of states. The intensity increase observed at hv similar to 45-50 eV is
   found to be associated with the nonbonding region of the valence band,
   although a proper interpretation is needed. In addition, it was found
   that Ar+ bombardment induces electronic states in the band-gap region
   and changes in the O 2p valence band. Three distinct emission bands were
   identified in the band gap as a function of the Ar+ dose. They are
   associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies and mixed oxidation
   states due to preferential sputtering of the oxygen atoms. Resonant
   photoemission of these Ar+-bombarded films demonstrates both the
   cationic character of the band-gap states and the increase of the
   cationic contribution to the O 2p valence band.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the implementation aspects and our experiences
   towards a data parallel explicit self-starting finite element transient
   methodology with emphasis on the Connection Machine (CM-5) for linear
   and non-linear computational structural dynamic applications involving
   structured and unstructured grids. The parallel implementation criteria
   that influence the efficiency of an algorithm include the amount of
   communication, communication routing, and load balancing. To provide
   simplicity, high level of accuracy, and to retain the generality of the
   finite element implementation for both linear and non-linear transient
   explicit problems on a data parallel computer which permit optimum
   amount of communications, we implemented the present self-starting
   dynamic formulations (in comparison to the traditional approaches) based
   on nodal displacements, nodal velocities, and elemental stresses on the
   CM-5. Data parallel language CMFortran is employed with virtual
   processor constructs and with:SERIAL and:PARALLEL layout directives for
   arrays. The communications via the present approach involve only one
   gather operation (extraction of element nodal displacements or
   velocities from global displacement vector) and one scatter operation
   (dispersion of element forces onto global force vector) for each time
   step. These gather and scatter operations are implemented using the
   Connection Machine Scientific Software Library communication primitives
   for both structured and unstructured finite element meshes. The
   implementation aspects of the present self-starting formulations for
   linear and elastoplastic applications oil serial and data parallel
   machines are discussed. Numerical test models for linear and non-linear
   one-dimensional applications and a two-dimensional unstructured finite
   element mesh are then illustrated and their performance studies are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The size dependence of various aspects of quantum-confinement effects in
   In0.53Ga0.47As/InP quantum wires was quantitatively examined through
   photoluminescence experiments with and without magnetic field, along
   with theoretical calculation. The wires were fabricated by combining
   electron-beam lithography and reverse-mesa wet etching, thus enabling us
   to easily control the lateral size independently of the vertical size.
   Photoluminescence experiments showed distinct peak shifts with changes
   in the lateral size and showed a shoulder structure that is attributed
   to laterally quantized second subbands. The energy shift of both levels
   is explained by a detailed theoretical calculation that incorporates
   conduction-band nonparabolicity, valence-band coupling, and excitonic
   correction. The lateral quantum confinement is also demonstrated by the
   magnetic-field effect on the luminescence spectrum, in which we can
   distinguish the lateral quantum effects from other factors. As
   magnetic-field strength increases, a transition from quantum-confined
   subbands to Landau subbands was clearly observed for first and second
   subbands. At high excitation levels, the quenching of higher Landau
   levels was observed. Inplane and perpendicular-to-plane anisotropy of
   polarization in luminescence was also investigated and the size
   dependence of this anisotropy in both directions is largely explained by
   the calculated lateral confinement effect of the optical-transition
   matrix elements. The phenomenon observed for narrower wires, however,
   cannot be explained by our theory and is thought to be due to
   wave-function localization.}},

Abstract = {{Amperometry at a carbon fiber microelectrode was used to monitor
   secretion of peptide hormone from single melanotrophs of the
   intermediate lobe of the rat pituitary. The method is based on
   electrochemical oxidation of tryptophan and tyrosine residues of small
   proopiocortin-derived peptides secreted from these cells. For
   single-cell measurements, the electrode, which had a sensing diameter of
   similar to 9 mu m and a total tip diameter of 30 mu m, was positioned
   similar to 1 mu m away from single melanotrophs. When cells were
   stimulated by application of 64 mM K+, a series of randomly occurring
   current spikes with an average area of 34 +/- 6 fC was observed. The
   current spikes were strongly dependent on the presence of Ca2+. Current
   spikes of nearly identical area and shape were also elicited by
   mechanical stimulation. Cyclic voltammograms obtained from cell
   releasates confirmed that the substance detected was a tryptophan- or
   tyrosine-containing peptide. On the basis of amperometric tests of the
   most abundant peptides in melanotrophs, it is concluded that the current
   spikes are due to detection of primarily alpha-melanocyte stimulating
   hormone. The spike area corresponds to 0.32 amol of alpha-melanocyte
   stimulating hormone. It is concluded that the current spikes represent
   detection of concentration pulses that are expected following exocytosis
   events.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the methylation status of the X-linked gene
   phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK(1)) and the DXS 255 locus detected by probe
   M27 beta to study clonality in acquired aplastic anemia (AA). A total of
   30 females were suitable for clonal analysis of peripheral blood
   polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and mononuclear cells using a polymerase
   chain reaction-based procedure in 24 patients and Southern blotting in
   9. Overall, 10 of 30 patients exhibited an imbalanced X-inactivation
   pattern. However, in 4 patients, analysis of constitutional DNA
   suggested a skewed methylation pattern and 2 further cases had to be
   excluded because of the lack of an appropriate control. A truly clonal
   pattern was thus established in 4 of 30 (13\%) patients, In 7 patients
   who later developed clonal disorders of hematopoiesis, X-inactivation
   analysis did not predict this event in any case. In patients with a
   paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria phenotype, there was no correlation
   between the proportion of phosphatidylinositol glycan anchored protein
   (PIG-AP)-deficient blood cells and the corresponding X-inactivation
   pattern. X-inactivation analysis detected clonal hematopoiesis in only 3
   of 10 patients with a deficiency in PIG-AP in the cell population under
   study, but sorting of nucleated cells on the basis of PIG-AP expression
   showed the clonal nature of PIG-AP-deficient cells. We conclude that the
   majority of patients with AA show polyclonal hematopoiesis using
   X-linked clonal analysis, but that minor clonal populations, such as
   PIG-AP-deficient cells, may not be detected unless sorted cell
   populations are separately analyzed. (C) 1995 by The American Society of

   effects in a much improved manner. The dependence of the bond-stretching
   and bond-bending force constants on the crystal volume was determined by
   means of ab initio density-functional calculations, revealing simple
   universal scaling laws. The resulting anharmonic model was used to
   investigate optical phonons in disordered alloys of Si, Ge, and C. The
   calculated Raman spectra agree well with experimental results and are
   analyzed in terms of microscopic and macroscopic strain as well as
   confinement effects due to mass disorder.}},

   Many of the CSSs are believed to occur in dense, inhomogeneous and

Abstract = {{Conductivity of porous silicon layers (p-type) has been investigated for
   organic vapor sensing. A many orders of magnitude increase in
   conductivity in response to a vapor pressure change from 0 to 100\% has
   been measured for some compounds. The conductivity (at a constant
   pressure) varies exponentially with the compound's dipole moment. The
   temporal response of the porous silicon layers is in the seconds range,
   and the recovery is much slower (minutes). However, due to the
   tremendous conductivity changes and the low background noise, a complete
   recovery is not needed for sensing purposes. The mechanism of
   conductivity enhancement has been studied using several methods. It is
   attributed to an increase in the density of charge carriers. An
   additional mechanism based on increased diffusivity may take place in
   microporous silicon. The observed characteristics suggest the
   application of porous silicon to future chemical sensors. The sensors
   have the potential to be integrated monolithically with other silicon
   devices using current technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Demonstration of autoimmune antiphospholipid antibodies (aPA) to
   negatively charged phospholipids (PL) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay (ELISA) requires the presence of certain phospholipid-binding
   plasma proteins, eg, beta(2)-glycoprotein I. We found a requirement for
   plasma proteins to detect certain autoantibodies in ELISA directed
   against the electrically neutral or zwitterionic phospholipid,
   phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Two of these PE-binding plasma proteins
   were identified as high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and low
   molecular weight kininogen (LMWK). We studied anti-PE antibody (aPE)
   seropositive plasma from 13 patients with SLE and/or recurrent
   spontaneous abortions by using partially purified kininogens and
   kininogen binding proteins from adult bovine serum isolated by
   carboxymethyl (CM)-papain affinity chromatography. Eleven of 13 sera
   recognized a kininogen-PE complex and/ or a kininogen-binding
   protein-kininogen-PE complex. Some aPE-positive patient sera were shown
   to recognize highly purified HMWK and LMWK by ELISA only when the
   kininogens were presented on a PE substrate. These aPE sera did not
   recognize PE, HMWK, or LMWK when they were presented independently as
   the sole antigens on the ELISA plates. Other aPE-positive sera that did
   not react with PE-bound HMWK or LMWK reacted with the CM-papain column
   eluate when it was bound to PE, which suggests that these aPE recognize
   factor XI or prekallikrein, which normally bind to HMWK. The aPE ELISA
   reactivity of two patient sera were inhibited by preincubation of the
   CM-papain column eluate in the ELISA plate. These data show that most
   aPE are not specific for PE but require the presence of certain
   PL-binding plasma proteins that are kininogens or proteins in complex
   with kininogens. Our studies indicate that aPE bind to different plasma
   proteins than those implicated in anionic FL, aPA ELISA reactivity. (C)

   (similar to 200 km horizontal wavelength) was encountered similar to 900
   km NW of Maui. The OH volume weighted Na column density measured by the
   lidar increased 4-fold at the same location. OH imagery showed the wave
   phase front was aligned NE-SW, similar to the tropospheric airmass
   boundary which was located similar to 2000 km NW of Maui. This `wall'
   wave had an apparent phase velocity (v(phi)) of 75 ms(-1) toward the SE
   and was observed overhead Haleakala, Maui similar to 3 1/4 hours later.
   The `wall'' appeared to represent the southern boundary for an extensive
   short horizontal wavelength structure, with a similar phase front
   alignment. This structure had weak amplitudes initially but was fully
   developed similar to 1 hour after encountering the wall. The details of
   OH imagery, intensity, and Na structure associated with this event are

Abstract = {{Simultaneous observations of gravity waves using an Na wind/temperature
   lidar and a multi-wavelength all-sky nightglow imager were obtained, for
   the first time, during the ALOHA-93 campaign. A novel investigation of
   intrinsic wave parameters has been made by combining measurements of the
   horizontal wave components imaged in four nightglow emissions (height
   range similar to 80-100 km) with Na lidar soundings of the horizontal
   wind field and temperature profiles over the same height interval. On
   October 19 both instruments registered marked monochromatic wave
   motions. The intrinsic periods of several of these waves have been
   determined and were found to vary considerably with altitude, often
   resulting in a significant increase over their observed wave periods. It
   is shown that these two instrumental techniques generally sampled
   different regions of the gravity wave spectrum: the lidar exhibiting
   most sensitivity to short vertical wavelength waves (less than about 10
   km) while the imager was most responsive to larger vertical wave-length
   waves. This study illustrates the significant advantages of combining
   wind/temperature lidar and multi-wavelength image observations for

Abstract = {{Snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVP) catalyzes the alcoholysis of ATP by
   primary R-CH2OH alcohols with uncharged R residues, yielding
   AMP-O-CH(2)R esterification products. The alcohols compete with water
   for an SVP-bound adenylyl intermediate. In this study, it has been shown
   that SVP also catalyzes the reactions of glycerol 2-phosphate and
   sn-glycerol 3-phosphate with ATP to yield AMP-O-glycerophosphoryl
   esters. The products were identified by HPLC, the dependency of the
   reactions on glycerol phosphates, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and
   conversion to AMP by phosphodiesterase, or to AMP-O-glyceryl esters by
   alkaline phosphatase. The results demonstrated that R-CH2OH alcohols
   with negatively charged R residues, as well as secondary alcohols, act
   as adenylyl accepters in SVP reactions: thus extending the usefulness of
   SVP as a tool to produce 5'-nucleotide derivatives. The efficiencies
   (E(A)) of glycerol phosphates as adenylyl accepters were very high at
   low, millimolar concentrations, but decreased abruptly when the acceptor
   concentration was increased and, for glycerol 2-phosphate, when P-i or
   NaCl was present. In contrast, glycerol E(A) was independent of its own
   concentration, P-i, and NaCl. The responses of glycerol phosphates
   indicate that they act as adenylyl accepters via a mechanism different
   from uncharged R-CH2OH alcohols. The occurrence of an acceptor-binding
   enzyme site, specific for negatively charged R residues, and its
   potential relevance to the in vivo role of 5'-nucleotide
   phosphodiesterases as 5'-nucleotidyl transferases are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of an x-ray scattering study of the structure and
   morphology of a stepped Au(111) surface between 480 and 1225 K. At the
   highest temperatures studied, the surface phase separates to form three
   distinct orientational phases, each of which is reconstructed. These
   consist of (111) facets and two stepped phases, the latter differing in
   the polar and azimuthal orientations of their surface normal directions.
   The temperature-dependent reconstructions of the (111) facets are
   similar to those observed on the Au(111) surface. Specifically, the
   (111) facets exhibit a discommensuration-fluid phase above 700 K and a
   chevron phase, consisting of ordered discommensurations and kinks,
   below. The transformation from the discommensuration fluid phase to the
   chevron phase is remarkably slow, requiring on the order of tens of
   hours to complete. At the highest temperatures, the terraces of both
   stepped domains are uniaxially compressed, resulting in a series of
   well-ordered linear discommensurations. In one of the stepped phases the
   discommensurations intersect the step edges at 60 degrees, while in the
   other, they lie orthogonally to the step edges. On cooling, the latter
   stepped phase becomes unreconstructed below 985 K and vanishes below 775
   K, resulting in a surface comprised of (111) facets in coexistence with
   a single reconstructed stepped phase.}},

Abstract = {{Daily averaged salinity measurements made in the middle reach of the
   Delaware estuary over the past three decades indicate the presence of
   significant subtidal variability. The salinity signals are dominated by
   variabilities at seasonal to interannual timescales. For any given month
   of the year the interannual variability accounted for more than 80\% of
   the total deviations from the climatological mean monthly distributions.
   Variability at timescales shorter than a month is relatively
   insignificant. The long-term variations in salinity are closely
   correlated with the Delaware River discharge, with higher discharge
   corresponding to lower salinity and vice versa. Contrary to expectation,
   the long-term variations in the axial salinity gradient appear to have a
   negative correlation with the river discharge, with an increase in
   discharge corresponding to a reduction in the axial salinity gradient
   and vice versa. A number of factors, including the downstream movement
   of the salt intrusion limit beyond the observational station, the
   variation in the vertical salinity structure, and the possible existence
   of significant lateral variability may contribute to the observed
   response of the axial salinity gradient to different river discharge
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Common methods in spectral analyses of satellite data are the discrete
   Fourier transform (DFT) type of approaches, which generally require
   regular sampling and uniform spacing. These conditions sometimes cannot
   be met in the satellite applications, for example, such as one made by
   the High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) on board the Upper Atmosphere
   Research Satellite (UARS). To be able to handle irregular sampling
   cases, a least squares fitting method is established here for a
   space-time Fourier analysis and has been applied to the HRDI sampling as
   well as other regular sampling cases. This method can resolve space-time
   spectra as robustly and accurately as DFT-type methods for the regular
   cases. In the same fashion, given an appropriate sampling pattern, it
   can also handle the irregular cases in which there exist large data
   gaps, frequent mode changes, and varying weight samples. Various
   sampling schemes and the associated aliasing spectra are examined. A
   better sampling plan than those currently used by the UARS instruments
   to reduce spectral aliasing is proposed, which leads to the question of
   how to optimize satellite sampling in the future.}},

Abstract = {{1. We investigated the control of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)
   secretion during pregnancy.
   2. Plasma ANF levels were measured in conscious virgin female rats under
   basal conditions, and after atrial distension with an indwelling balloon
   catheter. The rats were then mated, and the measurements repeated at 7,
   14 and 21 days of pregnancy, and at 1 week postpartum. Plasma ANF levels
   were also measured in ovariectomized rats injected with progesterone,
   oestradiol, or oestradiol plus progesterone.
   3. Basal plasma ANF levels were elevated at 7 and 14 days of pregnancy
   but returned to pre-pregnant levels by 21 days. At 1 week postpartum,
   they were again elevated.
   4. In response to atrial stretch, plasma ANF increased significantly in
   virgin rats (from 100 +/- 10 to 148 +/- 13 pg ml(-1), P < 0.001, n =
   20). In contrast, there was no such secretory response observed in the
   pregnant and postpartum animals i.e. stretch-induced secretion of ANP
   was markedly attenuated.
   5. Treatment with exogenous oestradiol caused a significant increase in
   plasma ANP levels in acyclic rats. However, neither progesterone nor a
   combination of oestradiol plus progesterone had any effect.
   6. It is concluded that basal and stretch-induced ANF secretion are
   differentially influenced by pregnancy; oestradiol is identified as a
   potential stimulatory factor.}},

Abstract = {{The current article reports on the further development of a new
   technique for the computer simulation of the quasi-static mechanics and
   scalar transport properties of sphere assemblages. In an extension of a
   previous 2D simulation to 3D, we have developed an improved computation
   based on several innovations: a shuffling algorithm to rapidly generate
   random loose-packed configurations of particles; a microcell-adjacency
   method to accelerate particle-contact search; a relaxation method to
   overcome singularities in the static transport equations; and a
   simulated mechanical compression to generate dense random initial
   states. The improved algorithm allows for 3D simulations on a
   workstation platform. As major results, the dilatancy (volume expansion)
   computed for random dense-packed assemblages is found to depend on
   interparticle friction, contrary to the classical Reynolds hypothesis.
   Also, the use of linear-elastic contacts is found to be valid near the
   rigid-particle limit of interest here. Experimental data from
   (''triaxial'' compression) tests agree well with the simulations of both
   the shear strength and the electrical conductivity of sphere
   assemblages, when proper account is taken of the actual electrical
   contact resistance between steel balls as a function of load. One major
   conclusion is that scalar transport can serve as a useful macroscopic
   probe of particle-contact topology in granular media. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{Pentamidine effects on the interferon-gamma- or interferon-gamma plus
   bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induction of nitric oxide synthase in the
   macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, determined by measuring nitrite release
   into culture supernatants, were investigated. At concentrations above 10
   mu M, pentamidine caused visible toxic effects including cell lysis
   which also was assessed by measuring lactic dehydrogenase release. A
   progressive inhibitory effect of pentamidine could not be clearly
   dissociated from these toxic and lyric effects which were extensive at
   100 mu M. At 1 mu M pentamidine, the dose response dependence of nitrite
   formation on interferon-gamma was not affected. Tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha caused some enhancement of interferon-gamma-induced nitrite
   release only at high doses of 100 and 10,000 unit/ml. Pentamidine had no
   effect on isolated inducible nitric oxide synthase from RAW 264.7 cells
   but inhibited the constitutive enzyme from pork cerebellum
   non-competitively. The lack of any stimulatory effect of pentamidine on
   nitrite production in RAW 264.7 cells suggests that NOS induction and NO
   production by macrophages is not the mechanism of the antimicrobial
   effects of this drug.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. To examine blood lead levels in children, aged 12 to 23 months,
   living in old housing areas of Wellington and Lower Hutt, and to
   investigate risk factors for high lead levels.
   Method. Children were selected from Plunket Society rolls. Venous blood
   samples were collected, and care givers were interviewed with a
   questionnaire. Soil samples were taken from around the children's homes.
   Both soil and blood samples were analysed for lead content.
   Results. Blood samples and completed questionnaires were obtained for
   143 children. The geometric mean blood lead level for all the children
   was 0.25 mu mol/l (5.1 mu g/dL) (95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI]:
   0.22-0.28 mu mol/L). Three children had blood lead levels that exceeded
   the level for notification in New Zealand 1.45 mu mol/L and a further 13
   had blood lead levels exceeding 0.48 mu mol/L.
   Children with elevated lead levels were likely to live in a house
   greater than 50 years old where paint removal had taken place in the
   last 2 years (risk ratio {[}RR] = 14.4, 95\% CI: 2-107). Eating dirt,
   particularly for children who usually played outside within 2 metres of
   the house, was also a risk factor for elevated blood lead levels. Soil
   lead levels generally increased with the age of the house and were
   weakly correlated with blood lead levels (r = 0.32).
   Conclusion. Paint removal in old houses is a major risk factor for
   elevated blood lead levels. However, the number of study children living
   in houses less than 50 years old was limited. Because of this and
   possible participant selection bias, the results of this study require
   confirmation in a separate population-based study. Information about the
   specific paint removal procedures that cause high lead levels is also
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{Complement factor D is a serine protease regulated by a novel mechanism
   that depends on conformational changes rather than cleavage of a zymogen
   for expression of proteolytic activity. The conformational changes are
   presumed to be induced by the single natural substrate, C3bB, and by
   result in reversible reorientation of the catalytic center and of the
   substrate binding site of factor D, both of which have atypical
   conformations. Here we report that replacement of Ser(94), Thr(214), and
   Ser(215) of factor D (chymotrypsinogen numbering has been used for
   comparison purposes) with the corresponding residues of trypsin, Tyr,
   Ser, and Trp, is sufficient to induce substantially higher catalytic
   activity associated with a typical serine protease alignment of the
   catalytic triad residues His(57), Asp(102), and Ser(195). These results
   provide a partial structural explanation for the low reactivity of
   `'resting-state'' factor D toward synthetic substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Amiodarone is effective in the treatment of supraventricular and
   ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, however a high incidence of toxic side
   effects has been observed in various organs and tissues during chronic
   treatment. Ultrastructural observation of affected tissues reveals
   myelinoid inclusion bodies. The exact pathogenetic mechanism of these
   changes is still unknown. In this study we investigated the biochemical
   effects of this drug on lysosomal hydrolases and the alterations induced
   in subcellular organelles of fibroblasts cultured for 24 h with
   different concentrations of amiodarone in the medium, Of the enzyme
   activities assayed, we only observed a significant reduction in
   sphingomyelinase. Ultrastructural observation of fibroblasts showed
   swollen lysosomes and a few onionoid inclusion bodies at lower
   concentrations of the drug; at higher concentrations the lysosomal
   system was severely impaired. Cytochemical staining of unesterified
   cholesterol with filipin showed accumulation of cholesterol. We conclude
   that chronic amiodarone treatment in experimental conditions induces
   inhibition in sphingomyelinase activity through interaction with
   membrane lipids and modification of bilayer structure. Higher
   concentrations of the drug impair cholesterol transport and induce lipid
   accumulation. These results may be useful for understanding the
   pathogenesis of induced lipidosis in patients in chronic treatment with
   amiodarone.}},

Abstract = {{Mossbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies were
   used to characterize the diheme cytochrome c peroxidase from Paracoccus
   denitrificans (L.M.D. 52.44). The spectra of the oxidized enzyme show
   two distinct spectral components characteristic of low spin ferric hemes
   (S = 1/2), revealing different heme environments for the two heme
   groups, The Paracoccus peroxidase can be non-physiologically reduced by
   ascorbate, Mossbauer investigation of the ascorbate-reduced peroxidase
   shows that only one heme (the high potential heme) is reduced and that
   the reduced heme is diamagnetic (S = 0), The other heme (the low
   potential heme) remains oxidized, indicating that the enzyme is in a
   mixed valence, half-reduced state, The EPR spectrum of the half-reduced
   peroxidase, however, shows two low spin ferric species with g(max) =
   2.89 (species I) and g(max) = 2.78 (species II). This EPR observation,
   together with the Mossbauer result, suggests that both species are
   arising from the low potential heme, More interestingly, the
   spectroscopic properties of these two species are distinct from that of
   the low potential heme in the oxidized enzyme, providing evidence for
   heme-heme interaction induced by the reduction of the high potential
   heme, Addition of calcium ions to the half-reduced enzyme converts
   species II to species I. Since calcium has been found to promote
   peroxidase activity, species I may represent the active form of the
   peroxidatic heme.}},

   group bearing alcohol, amide, imide, or hydantoin functionalities were
   prepared and evaluated in the conditioned avoidance response (CAR) test

   receptor-binding assays. Certain of the compounds display high affinity
   for the D-2, 5-HT1A, and al-adrenergic receptors. Structures bearing
   acyclic amide, lactam, and imide fuctionalities display good biological
   activity, with a preference for the 1,3-disubstituted phenyl ring
   relative to the 1,4- and 1,2-congeners (7 vs 10 and 12). Every possible
   position of hydantoin attachment was investigated (e.g., substitution at
   N-1, N-3, and C-5). Th, hydantoin involving attachment to N-1 (24) was
   found to have good biological activity, whereas those hydantoins with
   attachment to N-3 Or C-5 (22, 23, and 25) were inactive. Several of the,
   smaller acetylated derivatives (30 and 33) have fair in vivo activity,
   which was lost in the case of the larger benzoyl analog 31. Uracil
   congener 34 had modest affinity for the Da receptor (65 nM) as well as
   excellent in vivo activity. Benzylamino compounds display (viz. 27 and
   35-38) moderate CAR activity but have surprising receptor affinity,
   often greater than those of comparable structures bearing a carbonyl (36
   vs 7). Benzyl and benzhydryl alcohol compounds 40-48 are more active
   than amino structures 27 and 35-38 and also exhibit excellent in vivo
   activity in the CAR test with modest D-2 and 5-HT1A receptor binding.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the effect of blockade of mitochondrial respiration on
   the binding of human I-125-TNF alpha to L929 cell receptors. Specific
   TNF alpha binding was decreased to about 20-40\% of controls by blocking
   mitochondrial respiration. This effect was dose- and time-related and
   was observed independently of the level at which the respiration was
   blocked (respiratory chain, proton backflow, ATPase, anaerobiosis). This
   blockade had no effect on the half-life of the specific TNF alpha
   binding, the internalization or degradation of TNF alpha-receptor
   complexes, or the number of TNF alpha-binding sites. Scatchard analysis
   of TNF alpha binding data indicated a 2-4-fold decrease in the affinity
   of these binding sites. These effects did not appear to be related to
   the protein kinase C activity or to reactive oxygen radicals, since they
   were not antagonized by pretreatment of cells with oxygen radical
   scavengers, deferoxamine, or inhibitors of protein kinase C. Decrease in
   TNF alpha binding capacity correlated significantly with cellular ATP
   content (r = 0.94; p < 0.01) and with the cytocidal activity of TNF
   alpha against L929 cells. These findings suggest that blockade of
   mitochondrial respiration down-regulates the binding of TNF alpha to
   cells, most likely by changing the affinity of receptors for this
   cytokine. This down-regulation may increase the resistance of cells to
   TNF alpha cytotoxicity.}},

   cell line without `ladder'. Transfection of a Pim-1 expression vector to
   a `ladder'-non-producing myeloma line yielded similar internucleosomal
   DNA fragmentation. The results hence suggested that Pim-1 activates
   endonucleases responsible for DNA fragmentation during apoptosis and/or
   repress DNA repair systems to restore fragmented DNA. (C) 1995 Academic

   acid level, a very high extent of homology with the human ras genes is
   observed (80\% to 86\%) and a perfect homolgy is observed at the amino
   acid level. The high conservation of the 5' region of the ras gene

Abstract = {{Various forms of cross-talk between the Ca2+ and cAMP signal
   transduction systems can occur in animal cells depending upon the types
   of adenylyl cyclases present. Here, we report that Ca2+ oscillations can
   be generated by hormone stimulation of type III adenylyl cyclase
   expressed in HEK-293 cells. These Ca2+ oscillations are apparently due
   to the unique regulatory features of type III adenylyl cyclase, which is
   stimulated by hormones and inhibited by elevated Ca2+ in vivo. Ca2+
   oscillations were generated by glucagon, isoproterenol, or forskolin
   stimulation of type III adenylyl cyclase and were dependent upon the
   activity of cAMP- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Ca2+
   oscillations were not solely dependent upon cAMP increases since
   dibutyryl cAMP or (S-p)-cAMP did not stimulate Ca2+ oscillations. We
   hypothesize that stimulation of type III adenylyl cyclase leads to
   increased cAMP, activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors,
   and elevation of intracellular Ca2+. As free Ca2+ increases, type III
   adenylyl cyclase activity is attenuated by CaM kinase(s) and
   intracellular cAMP levels decrease. When cAMP levels drop below a
   threshold level, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor is
   dephosphorylated and Ca2+ is resequestered. This cycle is repeated if
   type III adenylyl cyclase is chronically exposed to an activator. This
   unique mechanism for generation of Ca2+ oscillations in cells is
   distinct from others documented in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The aggregation numbers of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles and the
   fluorescence quenching constants, k(q), of pyrene by CU2+ have been
   measured as a function of SDS concentration from 25 to 200 mM. The
   results confirm an empirical observation made by small angle neutron
   scattering (Bezzobotnov, et al. J. Phys. Chem, 1988, 92, 5738) that SDS
   micelles grow linearly as the one-fourth power of the total detergent
   concentration. The aggregation numbers, computed under the assumption
   that the CU2+ ions are distributed randomly among the micelles show a
   positive slope with increasing CU2+ concentration, contrary to
   theoretical expectations; however, invoking, a small electrostatic
   repulsion between CU2+ ions residing upon the same micelle brings the
   experimental observations into agreement with theory. This electrostatic
   repulsion decreases from epsilon(2) = 0.11 to 0.04kT (T = absolute
   temperature, k = Boltzmann constant) as the micelle size increases from
   50 to 85 molecules. These electrostatic repulsion energies are
   comparable to those necessary to bring electron paramagnetic resonance
   results into agreement with theory as presented in the following paper.
   The quenching constant decreases with the size of the micelle according
   to k(q) = gamma D/R(2) with a coefficient of correlation r = 0.994,
   consistent with a model of diffusion encounters between reactants moving
   on or near a sphere of radius R. D is the relative diffusion coefficient
   of the reactants and gamma is a constant. Taking R to be the radius of
   the micelle and reasonable estimates of gamma shows that the diffusion
   coefficient of CU2+ is Of the same order of magnitude as it is in water.
   This leads to the conclusion that the quenching rate constant is nearly
   diffusion controlled and that pyrene is readily available at the micelle
   surface to participate in molecular collisions with CU2+. Further, the
   residence time of the CU2+ upon any given head group must be rather
   short. Even though the data are better fit under a hypothesis of
   electrostatic repulsion, the conclusions that the micelles grow as the
   one-fourth power of the detergent concentration and that the quenching
   is consistent with a surface diffusion mechanism are unaffected if a
   random distribution is utilized. Under this latter interpretation, the
   micelles grow from 57 to 89 molecules as the SDS concentration increases
   from 25 to 200 mM. The observed micelle growth together with an absence
   of substantial polydispersity is inconsistent with thermodynamic
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{The interpretation of the OZI-rule violation in the reaction <(p)over
   bar p> --> phi pi(0) encounters difficulties since one cannot exclude
   the possibility that the violation is a consequence of the rescattering
   in the final state. For this reason it is important to seek reactions in
   which the OZI-rule violation cannot be explained by conventional
   mechanisms. We compute the rescattering contribution in the reaction
   <(p)over bar p> --> f'(2) pi(0) and show that this contribution is
   negligible. Therefore any substantial OZI-rule violation in the process
   <(p)over bar p> --> f'(2) pi(0) would undoubtedly mean that some unusual
   physics plays an important role in this process.}},

Abstract = {{Deuterium, proton, and carbon-13 NMR spectra of
   1,3,5,7-tetraoxacyclooctane (tetroxocane) were recorded in liquid
   crystalline and isotropic solutions. as well as in the solid state. In
   solution, tetroxocane exists as a mixture of the boat-chair (BC) and
   crown (Cr) conformers. Pseudorotation and inversion is extremely fast in
   the BC form, while inversion in the crown conformer is relatively slow
   (on the NMR time scale). Analysis of the NMR line shape and 2D exchange
   experiments shows that the ring inversion in the Cr form occurs via the
   BC form. Interconversion rate constants and equilibrium constants
   between the two forms over a wide temperature range were determined in
   several normal and liquid crystalline solvents. In the solid state
   tetroxocane crystallizes in a (slightly distorted) crown form. Deuterium
   NMR in a powder sample of solid tetroxocane-d(g) exhibits dynamic
   spectra consistent with molecular 4-fold jumps about their pseudo-C-4
   axes. Quantitative analysis of the dynamic line shape is consistent with
   a small Ct deformation of the molecule, as found previously by X-ray
   analysis, and yields the following kinetic equation for the jump rate,
   k(J) (s(-1)) = 5.9 x 10(16) exp (-15.9/RT), where R is in kcal mol(-1)

Abstract = {{Information on the geometric and electronic structures of beta-carbonyl
   sulfones, XC(O)CH(2)SO(2)R (1-10, X = Et(2)N, EtS, EtO, alkyl, and aryl,
   and R' = alkyl, and aryl), are obtained for different pairs of the X and
   R substituents. The results of the X-ray diffraction and of the PE
   spectral analyses fully agree with the results of optimized ab initio
   3-21G{*} calculations. The electron charge distribution at various atoms
   and/or groups is discussed in connection with the other observables. In
   the compounds studied the CH2-S bond is gauche to the carbonyl group
   irrespective of the X and R substituents and of the gas or solid phase.
   This conformation is dictated by the interplay of the electronic
   interactions between the XC(O) and SO(2)R groups with two strong
   nonbonded interactions between pairs of oppositely charged atoms. The
   negatively charged carbonyl oxygen and one of the sulfonyl oxygen atoms
   Lie at distances shorter than the sum of the corresponding van der Waals
   radii from the positively charged sulfur and carbonyl carbon atoms,
   respectively. The interaction of the sulfonyl oxygen with the carbonyl
   carbon atom is the stronger of the two and partially offsets the strong
   inductive effect of the sulfonyl group. The presence of both
   through-bond and through-space interactions between the carbonyl and the
   sulfonyl groups in the ground and ionized states is confirmed by
   eigenvector analysis and by the shifts in the MO energies with respect
   to those of reference compounds. The conformation of compound 5, in the
   solid phase, is in part determined by crystal packing forces.}},

Abstract = {{A vibro-acoustic model of a finite cylindrical shell partially covered
   with a compliant material layer is presented. The finite shell is
   terminated by a cylindrical rigid baffle and is covered by strips of
   compliant material lying parallel to the shell axis. The support shell
   motion is obtained by using Flugge's operator and the layer is taken to
   be a locally reacting material having dissipative properties but without
   thickness. The whole system is excited by mean of a harmonic driving
   force applied to the supporting shell. In the infinite exterior medium,
   the acoustic pressure satisfies the Helmholtz equation. The acoustic
   pressure and the shell displacement are expanded in the eigenfunctions
   of the finite, non-covered, in vacuo, cylindrical shell. This leads to
   the construction of linear systems whose unknowns are the modal
   amplitudes of the pressure and of the shell displacement. If the
   cross-section of the partially covered shell has a plane of symmetry,
   the linear system splits into two independent, symmetric and
   antisymmetric parts. Nevertheless, each system displays coupling of
   circumferential order, meaning that the problem is no longer
   axisymmetric, as the totally covered problem was. Numerical results
   concerning acoustic radiation in water (radiated power) and shell
   vibration (radial quadratic velocity of the shell) are presented. They
   exhibit a surprising influence of the partial covering of a shell by a
   compliant layer: namely, that partially covering a shell in water can
   considerably increase the radiation compared to that from the bare
   cylinder, in a frequency range located well below the coincidence
   frequency. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

   Modification of the catalyst was studied with various metal oxides. When
   the catalyst was modified with vanadium oxide, the phenol formation
   activity was significantly improved. The best vanadium oxide loading was
   1 wt.-\%, and laser Raman spectra suggested that vanadium oxide existed
   as a monomeric species. Oxygen activated on the vanadium species
   transferred to a Pt site, and as a result the phenol formation activity
   was promoted. Improved dispersion of precious metals by modification
   with vanadium oxide seemed to be related to the increase in the rate of
   phenol formation. Hydroxylation with oxygen and hydrogen was applicable
   to other aromatic compounds as well.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons was found to be
   greatly enhanced by micromolar concentrations of the excitatory
   neurotransmitter glutamate. Blockade of kainate/AMPA
   (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) glutamate
   receptors increased the rate of neuron death, suggesting that endogenous
   glutamate in the cultures promotes survival, Addition of glutamate
   (0.5-1 mu M) further increased neuron survival, whereas glutamate in
   excess of 20 mu M resulted in increased death, Thus, the survival vs,
   glutamate dose-response relation is bell-shaped with an optimal
   glutamate concentration near 1 mu M. We found that hippocampal neurons
   from mice with the genetic defect trisomy 16 (Ts16) died 2-3 times
   faster than normal (euploid) neurons, Moreover, glutamate, at all
   concentrations tested, failed to increase survival of Ts16 neurons, In
   contrast, the neurotrophic polypeptide basic fibroblast growth factor
   did increase the survival of Ts16 and euploid neurons. Ts16 is a
   naturally occurring mouse genetic abnormality, the human analog of which
   (Down syndrome) leads to altered brain development and Alzheimer
   disease, These results demonstrate that the Ts16 genotype confers a
   defect in the glutamate-mediated survival response of hippocampal
   neurons and that this defect can contribute to their accelerated death.}},

Abstract = {{We have obtained a 0.''7 FWHM H image of IRAS FSC 10214+4724. This image
   suggests FSC 10214+4724 is an are formed by a gravitational lens located
   1.''25 to the north. We have also obtained a coarse spectroscopic
   continuum of the lensing galaxy. The location and strength of a break in
   the continuum suggests the 4000 Angstrom break of an early type galaxy
   at a redshift of 0.42+/-0.02. A galaxy 23'' south is found to have a
   very similar redshift of 0.429+/-0.002.
   This redshift, coupled with the observed magnitude of the lensing galaxy
   (H=18.45+/-0.15, in a 2'' aperture), implies the lensing galaxy has a
   very plausible L{*} luminosity and a velocity dispersion of 210+/-20 km
   s(-1) (q(0)=0.5, h=0.5). Such a lens would produce a faint counter-are
   image 1.''6+/-0.''2 north of the main are. We observe such a counter-are
   in our H image, indicating that FSC 10214+4724 is indeed gravitationally
   lensed. We find that lensing by a z=0.42, sigma similar to 210 km s(-1)
   galaxy is a viable and probable solution to both the observed morphology
   and uniquely large (similar to 1x10(14) h(-2) L.) luminosity of FSC
   10214+4724. The true (unlensed) nature of FSC 10214+4724 is likely an
   ultraluminous IR galaxy of similar to 3.7x10(12) h(-2) L..}},

Abstract = {{We have performed a general analysis of optical correlators with spatal
   light modulators (SLM's) whose primary defect is a finite contrast ratio
   (CR). Our mathematical analysis identifies three noise terms that appear
   in addition to the correlation term. The filter SLM contains either a
   phase-only filter (POF) or a binary-phase-only filter (BPOF). Insertion
   of a de block at the center of the filter SLM decreases the noise
   background in the correlator plane; this de block is larger than that
   required for the same level of performance in a correlator whose SLM's
   have transmissive (or reflective) dead zones. With a noise-free input
   and the de block, our computer simulations that show the peak intensity
   falling off as the CR decreases are in quantitative agreement with the
   correlation term of the mathematical model. For a cluttered, disjoint
   noise input this agreement is only qualitative, and at low CR's the de
   block is definitely required for the BPOF correlator if the secondary
   peaks in the output are to be brought below the correlation peak.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that the phospholipids of the brain cells of fish are
   altered during cold adaptation, In particular, the l-monounsaturated
   2-polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) increase 2- to 3-fold
   upon adaptation to cold, One of the most striking changes is in the
   18:1/22:6 species of PE. We determined how this lipid affected the
   bilayer-to-hexagonal-phase transition temperature of 16:1/16:1 PE, We
   found that it was more effective in lowering this transition temperature
   than were other, less unsaturated, PE species, In addition, it was not
   simply the presence of the 18:1/22:6 acyl chains which caused this
   effect, since the 18:1/22:6 species of phosphatidylcholine had the
   opposite effect on this transition temperature. Zwitterionic substances
   that lo,ver the bilayer-to-hexagonal-phase transition temperature often
   cause an increase in the activity of protein kinase C (PKC), Indeed, the
   18:1/22:6 PE caused an increase in the rate of histone phosphorylation
   by PKC which was greater than that caused by other, less unsaturated,
   PEs, The 18:1/22:6 phosphatidylcholine had no effect on this enzyme, The
   stimulation of the activity of PKC by the 18:1/22:6 PE is a consequence
   of this lipid's increasing the partitioning of PKC to the membrane.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of aqueous KCl concentration on the electrical double layer
   properties of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) surfaces has
   been investigated. For self-assembled CTAC bilayers adsorbed onto
   amorphous silica surfaces, flat plate streaming potentials (zeta(s)
   potentials), electrostatic potentials obtained from the electrophoretic
   mobility of colloid microspheres (zeta(e) potentials) and diffuse layer
   potentials (psi(d)) derived from the force versus separation curves for
   the interaction of a colloid microsphere with a flat plate (measured
   with an atomic force microscope) have been analysed. Trends and
   differences in the zeta(s) and zeta(e) potentials have been attributed
   to incomplete electrical neutralisation of the silica surface by the
   inner adsorbed monolayer of CTAC, and differences in the silica surface
   charge density for the colloid and flat plate. It is considered that
   derived psi(d), values highlight the problem created by surface
   roughness for atomic force microscopy force curve analysis. CTAC
   miceliar surface potentials (psi(0)), which have been determined by a
   solvatochromic acid-base indicator technique, are greater than the zeta
   potentials for the planar adsorbed CTAC surfaces. Analyses in terms of a
   site-binding model and classical electrical double layer theory suggest
   that the degree of counterion dissociation from the surfactant
   headgroups (alpha) is significantly different for highly curved and
   planar surfaces; a is in the range 0.10-0.15 for the adsorbed CTAC
   bilayers and in the range 0.41-0.66 for spherical CTAC micelles when
   activities are used in the calculation. The CTAC critical micelle
   concentration and the minimum area per CTAC molecule at a planar
   interface as a function of KCl concentration have been ascertained from
   air/aqueous solution surface tension curves. The hydrophobic
   contribution to the free energy of CTAC micellisation has been
   calculated on the basis that CTAC micelles behave as Nernstian objects
   in KCI solution with the surfactant monomer acting as a potential
   determining ion. The results for the CTAC/KCl systems have been compared
   with the results obtained for similar hexadecyltrimethylammonium
   bromide/KBr systems.}},

   poly(L-glutamic acid) were prepared on mica surfaces by the
   Langmuir-Blodgett deposition of monolayers of an amphiphile containing
   the polypeptide as the hydrophilic head group. Various secondary
   structures of poly(L-glutamic acid) were formed in this monolayer at the
   air-water interface, through intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding,
   depending on the surface pressure and the pH value of the aqueous
   subphase, and transferred onto mica surfaces. Formation of the secondary
   structures was characterized by Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR)
   spectroscopy prior to the forces measurement. Surface force profiles
   consisted of a long-range electrostatic and a short-range steric
   repulsion. Secondary structures of poly(L-glutamic acid), identified by
   FT-IR with respect to their composition and orientation, were found to
   determine the short-range steric repulsion. The obtained elastic

Abstract = {{In a model polyurethane/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PU/PMMA) system, the
   partitioning of unreacted methyl methacrylate monomer (MMA) is studied
   in the late stages of its polymerization, simulated by incorporating
   controlled amounts of MMA in otherwise fully cured simultaneous
   interpenetrating networks (SIN) samples. Glass transitions temperatures
   (T-g) were determined using dynamic mechanical spectroscopy and
   differential scanning calorimetry as a function of MMA content of the
   SINs. The lowering of T-g in each phase due to the plasticization effect
   of MMA is used to calculate a plasticization coefficient for each phase,
   finally allowing calculation of the partition coefficient of MMA between
   the two phases. It is found that the MMA monomer distributes itself
   almost uniformly across the two phases of the current SIN system,
   leading to speculation as to the locus of late SIN polymerization. (C)

Abstract = {{The diffusion model is potentially useful for quantifying the effect of
   downslope gravity transport on sedimentation rate variations, which are
   commonly found between Deep Sea Drilling Project and Ocean Drilling
   Program sites. If appropriate, the model and stratigraphy could be used,
   for example, to constrain the amount and timing of fault block rotation.
   Deep Tow profiler records from the French-American Mid-Ocean Undersea
   Study area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are examined to determine whether
   they are consistent with a diffusion model. Sedimentary contacts with
   basement show that a variety of processes may be operating, some of
   which are inconsistent with the diffusion model. For example, there are
   moats around some contacts which are typical of scouring or
   nondeposition due to high current velocities. More than half of the
   contacts, however, show onlapping, which is qualitatively consistent
   with the diffusion model. Sediments generally fill low areas of the
   topography and have smooth surfaces, as expected from a diffusion model.
   Where the fluxes of sediment entering a basin are constant, the
   diffusion model predicts that the sediment surface should evolve to a
   parabola (the steady state solution). Some 20 curved surfaces in the
   profiler data were digitized and least squares parabolas fitted to them
   with rms errors of less than 1 m. The slopes of the model parabolas
   provide values for the ratio of sediment flux to diffusivity at the
   edges of the basins (steep surfaces are produced by low diffusivity or
   high fluxes). This ratio is combined with estimates of the fluxes to
   determine the apparent sediment diffusivity, K-app, for each basin. Flux
   is estimated by assuming the abyssal hill topography acts as a simple
   sediment trap, so that the lateral flux equals the width of a basin's
   pelagic catchment area times the area's mean sedimentation rate S. Using
   this method, median K-app is 0.04-0.11 m(2) yr(-1) (assuming S=10-30 m
   m.y.(-1)). Variations in K-app and the assumptions behind the diffusion
   model are discussed, and alternative causes of sediment surface tilts
   are considered, in particular differential compaction, which is modelled
   using a simple,porosity-depth function.}},

Abstract = {{In many vertebrate and invertebrate cells, inositol 1,4,5-trisphospate
   production induces a biphasic Ca2+ signal. Mobilization of Ca2+ from
   internal stores drives the initial burst. The second phase, referred to
   as store-operated Ca2+ entry (formerly capacitative Ca2+ entry), occurs
   when depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools activates a
   non-voltage-sensitive plasma membrane Ca2+ conductance. Despite the
   prevalence of store-operated Ca2+ entry, no vertebrate channel
   responsible for store-operated Ca2+ entry has been reported. trp
   (transient receptor potential), a Drosophila gene required in
   phototransduction, encodes the only known candidate for such a channel
   throughout phylogeny. In this report, we describe the molecular
   characterization of a human homolog of trp, TRPC1. TRPC1 (transient
   receptor potential channel-related protein 1) was 40\% identical to
   Drosophila TRP over most of the protein and lacked the charged residues
   in the S3 transmembrane region proposed to be required for the-voltage
   sensor in many voltage-gated ion channels. TRPC1 was expressed at the
   highest levels in the fetal brain and in the adult heart, brain, testis,
   and ovaries. Evidence is also presented that TRPC1 represents the
   archetype of a family of related human proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Damping functions for polystyrene melts with narrow and broad molecular
   weight distributions were obtained from step-strain stress relaxation
   experiments in shear and biaxial extension. A lubricated squeezing flow
   method was used to obtain the biaxial relaxation modulus. Following the
   Wagner method, we calculated the damping function in uniaxial extension
   from experimental data on the stress growth coefficient. The calculated
   damping function was independent of strain rate. In all deformation
   modes, strain dependences of the damping functions for narrow
   distribution polystyrene were stronger than those for broad distribution
   polystyrene. Experimental damping functions for narrow distribution
   polystyrene were compared with predictions of the Doi-Edwards theory.
   The predicted shear damping function agreed well with the experimental
   data. Fair agreement between the predictions and the data was observed
   in uniaxial and biaxial extensions. Compared at the same Hencky strain,
   the component of the radius of gyration tenser in the stretching
   direction is greater for uniaxial extension than for biaxial extension.
   However, stretching of the primitive chain along the contour is more
   prominent in biaxial extension than in uniaxial extension, giving a
   stronger damping (contraction of the primitive chain) in biaxial
   extension. This explains the stronger strain dependence of the biaxial
   damping function.}},

   expression (> mean value). Although we found no difference between
   treated and untreated tumors for glutathione S-transferase-pi, we found
   significant differences in the expression of glutathione peroxidase. In
   the 8 untreated patients, 7 tumors showed low glutathione peroxidase (<

Abstract = {{Identities for the electron intracule density I(R) in atoms and
   molecules are derived within the Hiller-Sucher-Feinberg (HSF) formalism.
   It is proven that, when applied to arbitrary (exact or approximate)
   electronic wave functions, these identities produce intracule densities
   that satisfy a modified condition for the electron coalescence cusp. A
   corollary of this proof provides a new, simplified derivation of the
   cusp condition for the exact I(R). An expression for the Hartree-Fock
   approximation to the HSF electron intracule density that contains only
   two- and three-electron terms is obtained and its properties are
   analyzed. A simple scaling of the three-electron contributions in this
   expression assures integrability of the approximate I(R) and improves
   its overall accuracy. Numerical tests carried out for the H-, He, Li+,
   Be2+, Li, and Be systems demonstrate that the application of the scaled
   HSF-type identity to Hartree-Fock wave functions affords dramatic
   improvements in the short-range behavior of the electron intracule
   density. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

   overruns the spin-orbit interaction at distances shorter than 7

   contribution from the potential of Omega=0(-) symmetry correlating with
   D-1(2) is of minor importance. Therefore, the absorption in the

Abstract = {{The problem of rotational energy transfer (RET) is examined from a point
   of view intermediate between the current approaches based on empirical
   models or numerical solution of the coupled scattering equations. A
   semiclassical perspective is taken in which a classically described
   collision with an atom exerts a time dependent torque on the rotor and
   the resulting forced rotor dynamics is addressed quantum mechanically.
   By treating the anharmonicity in the rotational energy levels as a
   perturbation, a simple approximate expression is found for the inelastic
   transition probability. It reveals a marked difference between the
   distribution of final rotational states incurred from an individual
   collision trajectory as compared to trajectory averaged measures of RET,
   such as cross sections. The theory is applied to the scattering of
   Li-2(A (1) Sigma(u)(+)) by Ne, Ar, Xe;Na-2(A (1) Sigma(u)(+)) by He and
   Ne; N-2(+)(X (2) Sigma(g)(+)) by He, and CN(X (2) Sigma(+)) by He. Its
   predictions compare well with those from a fully quantum mechanical
   description of rigid rotor scattering and with experiment. The insight
   into the energy transfer dynamics gained from the semiclassical approach
   is used to examine the assumptions underlying empirical models of
   rotational energy transfer. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Evaluation of cisplatin-fluorouracil exclusive chemotherapy
   for invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis staged as T1-T3N0
   with a complete response after cisplatin-fluorouracil neo-adjuvant
   chemotherapy.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of the files of 69 patients with a
   well-differentiated untreated invasive squamous cell carcinoma, staged
   as T1-T3N0 with a complete response after cisplatin-fluorouracil
   neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is presented, Actuarial analysis (Kaplan Meier
   method) of survival and local failure is presented among the group of 25
   patients treated with exclusive chemotherapy and the group of 44
   patients in whom the local treatment (partial laryngeal surgery or
   radiation therapy) initially planned was maintained.
   Results: Three-year survival and local control estimate was 91.8\% and
   69.3\%, respectively after exclusive chemotherapy and 92.5\% and 97.2\%
   if the local treatment was performed as initially planned. Patients with
   local recurrence after exclusive chemotherapy were always salvaged with
   partial laryngeal surgery or radiation therapy resulting in an overall
   100\% local control and laryngeal preservation rate.
   Conclusion: Exclusive chemotherapy for T1-T3N0 glottic carcinomas with a
   complete response after cisplatin-fluorouracil neo-aduvant chemotherapy
   should be considered especially in patients in whom preservation of
   voice is of utmost importance.}},

   coprecipitation technique and characterised by chemical analysis; XRD
   and SEM techniques, and measurements of their BET specific surface
   areas, saturation magnetisations and electrical resistivities. The
   specimens with values of x less than or equal to 1.5 are single-phase
   cubic spinels and those with x > 1.5 are two-phase cubic and tetragonal
   spinels. The relative catalytic activities of the specimens towards the
   decomposition of H2O2 in both alkaline and neutral media, measured on
   the basis of the energies of activation, a microstructure-independent
   parameter, and the rate constants normalised to unit BET surface area, a
   microstructure normalised parameter, follow the order, (given as values
   of x) 1.45 > 2.5 approximate to 2.0 > 1.0 > 1.2 > 0.8 > 0.5. All the
   MnxFe3-xO4 prepared specimens are potential substitutes for CoFe2O4, the
   high-performance catalyst for the decomposition of H2O2; the specimen
   with x = 1.45 is the most powerful and is significantly more active than
   CoFe,O,. The activity appears to depend on the availability and efficacy
   of redox conversion of Mn-II centres in the sublattices of the
   MnxFe3-xO4 catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{A 63-year-old man developed a mild hemorrhagic diathesis which led to
   the diagnosis of chronic lymphatic leukemia. Treatment with prednisone
   and chlorambucil was initiated. During the first 10 day-cycle (10 mg
   chlorambucil and 100 mg prednisone) no side effects were noted. On the
   8th day of second cycle (10 mg chlorambucil and 25 mg prednisone) the
   patient noticed fever, tiredness, myalgia, pruritus and erythema on the
   skin. The third cycle (10 mg chlorambucil alone) hat to be stopped on
   the second day due to the development of myalgia, generalized
   erythroderma with exfoliation and edema of the face and arms.
   In the patch-test with chlorambucil, a strongly positive (histologically
   verified) allergic reaction was noted. A lymphocyte stimulation test
   (detecting in vitro lymphocytes sensitized to chlorambucil) was also
   positive. These findings, together with the marked clinical reaction to
   chlorambucil alone, led to the diagnosis of a delayed hypersensitivity
   reaction to chlorambucil. Such well documented allergic reactions to
   chlorambucil are very rarely described in the literature. Up to now only
   1 case of immune hemolytic anemia, 1 case of Lyell-syndrome, 2 cases of
   delayed hypersensitivity reactions and a few cases of less well
   documented type I reactions have been described. In all these cases no
   crossreactivity with other alkylating agents occurred, and hence all
   patients could be successfully treated with cyclephosphamide.}},

Abstract = {{Reverse transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
   RNA genome is primed by the cellular tRNA(3)(Lys) molecule. Packaging of
   this tRNA primer during virion assembly is thought to be mediated by
   specific interactions with the reverse transcriptase (RT) protein.
   Portions of the tRNA molecule that are required for interaction with the
   RT protein remain poorly defined. We have used an RNA gel mobility shift
   assay to measure the in vitro binding of purified RT to mutant forms of
   tRNA(3)(Lys). The anticodon loop could be mutated without eliminating RT
   recognition. However, mutations in the T Psi C stem were found to
   partially interfere with RT binding, and D arm mutants were completely
   inactive in RT binding. Interestingly, binding of the RT protein to
   tRNA(3)(Lys) facilitates the subsequent annealing of template strand to
   the 3'-terminus of the tRNA molecule. Consistent with this finding, we
   demonstrate that mutant HIV-1 virions lacking the RT protein do contain
   a viral RNA genome without an associated tRNA(3)(Lys) primer. We also
   found that a preformed primer tRNA-template complex is efficiently
   recognized by RT protein in vitro. Extension of the template molecule
   over the T Psi C loop did result in complete inhibition of RT binding,
   suggesting the presence of additional recognition elements in the T Psi
   C loop. These results, combined with a comparative sequence analysis of
   tRNA species present in HIV-1 virions and RNA motifs selected in vitro
   for high affinity RT binding, suggest that RT recognizes the central
   domain of the tRNA tertiary structure, which is formed by interaction of
   the D and T Psi C loops.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of adenosine on superior colliculus neurons was examined by

   induced no current and furthermore, adenosine-evoked currents were not
   inhibited by selective A(1) or A(2a) adenosine receptor antagonists or a
   non-selective adenosine receptor (P-1 purinoceptor) antagonist,
   indicating that the currents are not mediated by adenosine receptors. Tn
   contrast, P-2 purinoceptor agonists, such as 2-methylthio ATP
   (2-MeSATP), ATP, ADP, and AMP, produced similar potassium currents,
   whereas alpha,beta-methylene ATP, beta,gamma-methylene ATP, or UTP had
   no response. The order of their potencies for the current amplitudes was
   2-MeSATP>ADP>adenosine>ATP>>AMP and this order corresponds to that for
   the P-2Y purinoceptor. These results, thus, suggest that adenosine

Abstract = {{Synthesis of the title analogue 2 is described. Fecht's acid (3) was
   esterified with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal to give monoester
   4 along with diester 5. Compound 4 was transformed to ester amide 6 by
   the reaction with isobutyl chloroformate and triethylamine followed by
   ammonolysis. Hoffman rearrangement of 6 effected by lead tetraacetate in
   tert-butyl alcohol led to the N-tert-butoxycarbonyl ester 7. The latter
   was reduced with Ca(BH4)(2) to give the protected amino alcohol 8.
   Removal of the N-tert-butoxycarbonyl group with 2 M HCl in methanol
   afforded the hydrochloride of amino alcohol 9. Reaction of 9 with
   5-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine and triethylamine gave the pyrimidine
   derivative 10 which, in turn, was cyclized to 6-chloropurine 11a.
   Ammonolysis of the latter intermediate afforded the title analogue 2.
   The H-1 NMR spectrum of Fecht's acid (3) in CD3COCD3 showed that four
   methylene protons were magnetically nonequivalent (two quartets) whereas
   the other four were equivalent, forming a single doublet. Compound 2
   inhibited the replication of human cytomegalovirus (IC50 32 mu M) and
   growth of murine leukemia L1210 cells (IC50 30 mu M). Zone assays showed
   inhibition of the following tumor cultures at 0.5 mg/disk: murine
   leukemia P388, mouse tumors PO3, C38, and M17/Adr as well as human
   tumors MCF-7 and CX-1..}},

   bicyclo{[}2.2.2]octanones 2a,b and 3a,b along with a small amount of the
   bicyclo{[}3.3.1]nonanones 4a,b, respectively. The yield of the
   bicyclo{[}3.3.1] ketone 4c increased in the reaction of the isopropyl
   derivative Ic. The tert-butyl derivative Id afforded the
   bicyclo{[}3.3.1]nonanone 4d as a major product together with a mixture
   of the bicyclo{[}2.2.2]octanones 2d and 3d. The remarkable substituent
   effect is explained based on the stability of the conformers 7 and 10 of
   the postulated intermediate 6. The intermediacy of 6 was verified by
   reaction of 6b prepared independently under similar conditions. Similar
   treatment of the tricyclic ketone 16 yielded the

Abstract = {{Although Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease has been reported to be an
   18-kDa enzyme with possible homology to the 16-kDa endonuclease V from
   bacteriophage T4 (Gordon, L. K., and Haseltine, W. A. (1980) J. Biol,
   Chem, 255, 12047-12050; Grafstrom, R. H., Park, L., and Grossman, L.
   (1982) J. Biol, Chem, 257, 13465-13474), this study describes three
   independent purification schemes in which M. luteus UV damage-specific
   or pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity was associated with two
   proteins of apparent molecular masses of 31 and 32 kDa. An 18-kDa
   contaminant copurified with the doublet through many of the
   chromatographic steps, but it was determined to be a homolog of
   Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L6. Edman degradation analyses of the
   active proteins yielded identical NH2-terminal amino acid sequences, The
   corresponding gene (pdg, pyrimidine dimer glycosylase) was cloned, The
   protein bears strong sequence similarities to the E. coli repair
   proteins endonuclease III and MutY. Nonetheless, traditionally purified
   M. luteus protein acted exclusively on cis-syn thymine dimers; it was
   unable to cleave site-specific oligonucleotide substrates containing a
   trans-syn -I, (6-4), or Dewar thymine dimer, a 5,6-dihydrouracil lesion,
   or an A:G or A:C mismatch, The UV endonuclease incised cis-syn
   dimer-containing DNA in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited linear
   kinet ics within that dose range, Enzyme activity was inhibited by the
   presence of NaCN or NaBH4 with NaBH4 additionally being able to trap a
   covalent enzyme substrate product, These last findings confirm that the
   catalytic mechanism of M. luteus UV endonuclease, like those of other
   glycosylase/AP lyases, involves an imino intermediate.}},

Abstract = {{Cylindrical cryptands 2a-c, in which two
   1,7-dioxa-4,10-diazacyclododecane rings are connected by two equally
   substituted propylene bridges, have been obtained in appreciable yields
   by a `'one-pot'' synthesis. The assembling of the macrotricyclic
   structure is likely driven by the template effect of metal cations.
   These compounds, both as free receptors or as complexes, exist as cis
   and trans diastereoisomers, which do not interconvert and have been
   separated and characterized by X-ray analysis. The extraction constants
   (K-e) of cryptands 2 for alkali picrates under CHCl3/H2O and
   solid/liquid two-phase conditions have been measured by UV-vis
   spectrophotometry. The complexation behavior of cryptands 2 has been
   rationalized analyzing the preorganization of binding sites in the
   minimum energy conformations obtained by molecular mechanics
   calculations. Minimum energy conformations have been calculated also for
   the previously reported cryptands 1 and have been compared with those of
   2. Results fit reasonably well with those of X-ray structures.}},

Abstract = {{The title compound 6 was synthesized as a model structure to study the
   stereochemical and mechanistic aspects of nucleophilic substitution at
   the phosphorus atom in a six-membered ring. Several synthetic methods
   were used to prepare 6, but in every case a mixture of diastereomers was
   obtained, in almost the same ratio. This mixture was used for the
   investigation of the reaction with several alcohols (methanol, ethanol,
   isopropyl alcohol) under acidic and/or basic conditions. Reactions with
   phenyllithium and two nitrogen nucleophiles, aniline and morpholine,
   were also carried out. The reactions led to mixtures of diastereomeric
   products; the ratio of these products did not always correspond to the
   diastereomeric ratio of starting material. Reactions of phosphinate
   esters were also studied, including kinetic measurements; the results
   strongly suggest an S(N)2 reaction mechanism.
   4-tert-Butyl-1-fluorophosphorinane 1-oxide (mixture of isomers) was
   synthesized and its reactions with phenoxide ions and phenyllithium were
   studied; the overall stereochemical results of these transformations
   were similar to those of the title chlorides. The stereochemical
   assignments of the phenyl- (4), methoxy- (7), phenoxy- (10), and anilino
   (13) derivatives of 6 have been firmly anchored by X-ray studies;
   assignments for other compounds are tentative and based on spectroscopic
   measurements, including H-1, C-13, P-31, and O-17 NMR data.}},

Abstract = {{Anandamide (arachidonylethanolamide) is known as an endogenous agonist
   for cannabinoid receptors. An amidohydrolase, which hydrolyzed
   anandamide, was solubilized from the microsomal fraction of porcine
   brain with 1\% Triton X-100. The enzyme was partially purified by
   Phenyl-5PW hydrophobic chromatography to a specific activity of
   approximately 0.37 mu mol/min/mg of protein at 37 degrees C. As assayed
   with C-14-labeled substrates, the apparent K-m value for anandamide was
   60 mu M, and anandamide was more active than ethanol-amides of linoleic,
   oleic, and palmitic acids. Ceramidase and protease activities were not
   detected in our enzyme preparation. The purified enzyme also synthesized
   anandamide from free arachidonic acid in the presence of a high
   concentration of ethanolamine with a specific activity of about 0.16 mu
   mol/min/mg of protein at 37 degrees C. On the basis of
   cochromatographies, pH dependence, heat inactivation, and effects of
   inhibitors such as arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone,
   p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and
   phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, it was suggested that the anandamide
   amidohydrolase and synthase activities were attributable to a single

   acid-catalyzed fluorination led to the preferential p-fluorination of
   anisole. The present results can be explained based on the capacity of
   the 2-sulfonate anion to interact with the hydroxy group of phenol or

Abstract = {{The binding of DNA topoisomerase III (Topo III) to a single-stranded DNA
   substrate containing a strong cleavage site has been examined. The
   minimal substrate requirement for Topo III-catalyzed cleavage has been
   determined to consist of 7 bases: 6 bases 5' to the cleavage site and
   only 1 base 3' to the site. Nuclease P1 protection experiments indicate
   that the enzyme also binds to its substrate asymmetrically, protecting
   similar to 12 bases 5' to the cleavage site and only 2 bases 3' to the
   cleavage site. A catalytically inactive mutant of Topo III shows the
   same protection pattern as the active polypeptide, indicating that Topo
   III is a site-specific binding protein as well as a topoisomerase.
   Consistent with this view, an oligonucleotide containing a cleavage site
   is a more effective inhibitor and is bound more efficiently by Topo III
   than an oligonucleotide without a cleavage site.}},

Abstract = {{Formation of a complex of the nucleotide exchange factor Sos, the SH2
   and SH3 containing adaptor protein Grb2/Sem-5 and tyrosine
   phosphorylated EGF receptor and She has been implicated in the
   activation of Ras by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in fibroblasts:
   related mechanisms for activation of Ras operate in other cell types. An
   increase in the apparent molecular weight of Sos has been reported to
   occur after several minutes of receptor stimulation due to
   phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. We report
   here that treatment of human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts with
   phorbol esters causes a similar shift in mobility of Sos. This
   modification of Sos does not alter its ability to bind Grb2, but
   correlates with strong inhibition of the binding of the Sos/Grb2 complex
   to tyrosine phosphorylated sequences, either a tyrosine phosphopeptide
   in cell lysates or p36 in intact cells. This effect, along with the
   mobility shift of Sos, can be mimicked in vitro by phosphorylation of
   Sos by the mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK1. A novel negative
   feedback mechanism therefore exists whereby activation of MAP kinases
   through Ras results in the uncoupling of the Sos/Grb2 complex from
   tyrosine kinase substrates without blocking the interaction of Sos with
   Grb2.}},

   yet unclear but recent evidence has accumulated to suggest that p53
   might act by regulating gene expression. Consistent with this model, p53
   can both activate and repress a number of viral and cellular promoters.
   p53 has also been shown to bind to the CCAAT-binding Factor and
   TATA-binding protein (TBP), and there is direct evidence that p53
   represses in vitro transcription by preventing TBP from binding DNA. We
   now provide evidence that p53 can repress transcription from the SV40

   dimethylsilylene with bromoform (4.4 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1)) and Ib (5.7 x

   interactions between a vacant p-AO of SiH2 and a lone electron pair of

Abstract = {{Kainic acid is known to stimulate the release of glutamate (GLU) and
   aspartate (ASP) from presynaptic neurons. It has been suggested that the
   enhanced release of these endogenous EAA's plays a significant role in
   the excitotoxic effects of KA. Domoic acid (DOM), a shellfish toxin, is
   structurally similar to KA, and has been shown to be 3-8 times more
   toxic than KA. In this study, effects of KA and DOM on the release of
   GLU and ASP from rat brain synaptosomes were investigated. Amino acid
   analysis was performed by the reversed phase HPLC, following
   derivatization with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC). Potassium
   chloride (40 mM) was used as a positive control, and stimulated GLU
   release from rat brain synaptosomes in presence or absence of Ca2+. DOM
   enhanced the release of GLU, whereas KA stimulated the release of both
   GLU and ASP from synaptosomes in the presence of Ca2+. However, their
   potency to stimulate GLU and ASP release was enhanced in absence of
   Ca2+. These results indicate that different mechanisms may be involved
   in the release of GLU and ASP in response to DOM and KA, and that
   neurotransmitter release appeared to be highly specific for these
   agonists. It would appear that DOM and KA may interact with different
   receptors on the presynaptic nerve terminal, and/or activate different
   subtypes of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels to promote influx of Ca2+
   which is targeted for different pools of neurotransmitters.}},

   was intraperitoneally administered in rats, and 1, 2 and 3 days later
   they were sacrificed. The alteration in serum findings after the
   administration of cisplatin (1.0 mg/100 g) or cephaloridine (50 and 100
   mg/100 g) demonstrated chemically induced kidney damage; blood urea
   nitrogen (BUN) concentration increased markedly and serum inorganic
   phosphorus or calcium concentration decreased significantly. Moreover,
   the administration of cisplatin (1.0 mg/100 g) or cephaloridine (100
   mg/100 g) caused a remarkable increase of calcium content in the kidney

   different endogenous ligands, Steroid binding induces a conformational
   change within the receptor protein. This structural alteration renders a
   fragment of MR resistent to proteolysis. Agonists and antagonist vary in
   how well they protect the MR fragment against proteolysis. But the two
   agonists also differ in their ability to protect, indicating that
   agonists and antagonists, but also different agonists, may induce
   distinct conformational changes. Ligand-independent removal of
   MR-associated heat-shock proteins induces no detectable structural

Abstract = {{The sequences that anchor DNA, matrix-attachment regions (MARs), can be
   identified by their specific and preferential binding to the nuclear
   matrix. This microenvironment may be hypersensitive to the formation of
   ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage, including DNA-protein cross-links
   (DPC). To examine the induction of DPC at or near MARs, we developed an
   in vitro binding assay by using nuclear matrices isolated from murine
   erythroleukemia cells by high-salt extraction of DNase I-digested
   nuclei. The cross-linking of nuclear matrix protein to DNA fragments
   containing kappa-immunoglobulin (kappa-Ig) or an hsp70 MAR was studied.
   Fragments of pBR322 of similar size to the MAR-containing fragments
   served as non-MAR controls. Two types of experiments were conducted:
   type A in which nuclei were irradiated and nuclear matrices were
   isolated and assayed for the binding of exogenous P-32-labeled DNA
   fragments, and type B in which mixtures of isolated nuclear matrices and
   {[}P-32]DNAs were irradiated and assayed for binding. Poly(dAT) served
   as a competitor in the binding assays, because it eliminated nonspecific
   binding of DNA to the nuclear matrix and revealed the radiation-induced
   increase in tightly bound DNA. When nuclear matrices were isolated from
   irradiated nuclei (0-200 Gy) and incubated with the kappa-Ig MAR
   fragment in the absence of poly(dAT) (type A experiments), much
   nonspecific, non-dose-dependent binding was observed. With poly(dAT) in
   the incubation mixture, a dose-dependent decrease (p < 0.001) in the
   binding was revealed, indicating a radiation-induced loss of available
   binding sites, perhaps due to the cross-linking of endogenous sequences.
   The pBR322 fragment did not show a similar loss of binding sites.
   Irradiation of mixtures of isolated nuclear matrices and end-labeled
   fragments (type B experiments) allowed the study of radiation-induced
   cross-linking of exogenous fragments to the matrices. If poly(dAT) was
   present during irradiation, nonspecific binding was eliminated; however,
   no significant increase (p = 0.5) in the specific binding of the DNA to
   the nuclear matrix was observed. In contrast, if poly(dAT) was added
   after irradiation, in addition to the elimination of nonspecific
   binding, a radiation dose-dependent increase in binding was revealed for
   both the kappa-Ig MAR and the hsp MAR (p < 0.001), but not for either of
   the pBR322 fragments. The results indicate that the specific interaction
   of MARs with proteins of the nuclear matrix provides a
   radiation-sensitive substrate for the formation of DNA-protein
   cross-links.}},

Abstract = {{The susceptibility of the polyunsaturated fatty acid parinaric acid
   (cis-PnA) to peroxidative damage with concomitant loss of its
   fluorescent character can be used to detect lipid peroxidation in a
   direct and sensitive way. The procedure, originally developed to measure
   peroxidation in lipid vesicles and erythrocyte membranes, has been
   adapted for the study of submitochondrial particles. Optimal conditions
   for the concentrations of cis-PnA (0.8 mol \%), mitochondrial membrane
   (100 mu M membrane phospholipid), and the radical generating system (50
   mu M NADH and 10 mu M:1 mM Fe(III)-ADP) were established. In the absence
   of peroxidation inducing compounds, a stable fluorescent signal can be
   detected. Upon addition of NAD(P)H and ADP-Fe(III), lipid peroxidation
   starts, and the observed fluorescence decrease is a measure of
   peroxidation. Both NADH and NADPH were able to induce lipid peroxidation
   in submitochondrial particles in the presence of an iron chelate. The
   use of NADH resulted in higher rates of peroxidation compared with NADPH
   at the same concentration. Whereas the rate of NADH-induced lipid
   peroxidation was maximal at very low NADH concentrations (2.5 mu M) and
   decreased when the concentration became higher, the NADPH-induced Lipid
   peroxidation reaches saturation at 100 mu M. NADH-induced lipid
   peroxidation in submitochondrial particles from different rat tissues
   (heart, skeletal muscle, and liver) resulted in a clear difference in
   peroxidation rates. The highest rates were observed in heart
   submitochondrial particles, while the lowest rates were obtained in
   submitochondrial particles derived from liver. Skeletal muscle
   submitochondrial particles showed intermediate rates of lipid
   peroxidation. The differences in peroxidation rates showed a clear
   correlation with the activity of NADH:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, and a
   relation between the electron flow through the respiratory chain and the
   peroxidation rate is demonstrated. Al the results obtained with the PnA
   assay were compared with peroxidation rates measured via oxygen
   consumption. Both methods gave identical results, demonstrating that the
   PnA assay is a reliable method to measure lipid peroxidation in
   submitochondrial particles.}},

Abstract = {{Coagulation factor VIIIa consists of a heterotrimer in which the A2
   subunit is bound to the A1/A3C1C2 dimer. The dissociation of this
   complex causes the spontaneous and reversible decay of factor VIIIa
   activity. In order to characterize the kinetics and affinity of the
   interaction between A2 and A1/A3C1C2, as well as the influence of
   different parameters on the interaction, the subunits were
   chromatographically separated and reassembled in a BIAcore instrument
   (Pharmacia Biosensor). In the binding experiments, A2 was free in
   solution, whereas A1/A3C1C2 was immobilized on the dextran surface by
   direct coupling or captured on an immobilized monoclonal anti-C2
   antibody. At our chosen standard condition (pH = 6.0, I = 0.12, and
   {[}Ca2+] = 2 mM), the association rate constant, dissociation rate
   constant, and resulting equilibrium dissociation constant were ca. 1.4 x
   10(4) M(-1) s(-1), 2.1 x 10(-4) s(-1), and 16 nM, respectively.
   Increasing the ionic strength or Ca2+ concentration resulted in both
   slower association and faster dissociation. At 0.3 M NaCl or 25 mM Ca2+,
   the dissociation constant was >1 mu M. This implies that electrostatic
   forces involved in the interaction contribute at least one-fourth of the
   total binding energy. Increasing pH caused a similar effect, yielding a
   dissociation constant of ca. 0.9 mu M at pH 7.5. In those cases where
   the equilibrium dissociation constants had been determined from solution
   phase experiments {[}Fay, P. J., \& Smudzin, T. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem.
   267, 13246-13250; Lollar, P., Parker, E. T., \& Fay, P. J. (1992) J.
   Biol. Chem. 267, 23652-23657], these constants agreed well with our
   results. In addition, direct immobilization of A1/A3C1C2 or capture on
   an antibody gave very similar rate constants, indicating that neither
   the immobilization per se nor the mode of immobilization affected the
   subunit interaction. Limited proteolysis of A1/A3C1C2 by activated
   protein C abolished its ability to bind A2, supporting the involvement
   of the negatively charged region containing residues 337-372. Heparin
   prevented A2/A1/A3C1C2 heterotrimer formation, presumably by binding to
   and blocking basic regions of importance for the interaction.}},

   experimental systems, including physiological systems. Here chaos
   control, periodic pacing, and anticontrol were applied to a
   noise-driven, nonchaotic neuronal model, and results similar to those
   recently reported for apparently chaotic, in vitro neuronal networks
   were obtained. Similar results were produced when chaos control was
   applied to a simple stochastic system. These suggest that the neuronal
   networks may not have been chaotic and that chaos control techniques can
   be applied to a wider range of experimental systems (e.g., stochastic
   systems) than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Regional specializations in the retina have been described in a number
   of species. We have investigated whether such specializations can be
   found in the optic tectum, an area of the brain responsible for the
   processing of visual information. Using the tectum of Rana pipiens, we
   have examined the distribution of three different cell types defined on
   the basis of their immunoreactivity to somatostatin, substance P, and
   serotonin antibodies. These three immunoreactive cell populations had
   differing, nonuniform distributions in the optic tectum.
   Somatostatin-like immunoreactive cells were largely restricted to the
   caudal one-third of the tectum, whereas both substance P-like
   immunoreactive (SP-ir) and serotonin-like immunoreactive (5-HT-ir) cells
   were found unequally represented throughout the tectum. The percentage
   of SP-ir cells decreased significantly in both the posterior and medial
   directions from its high in the anterior lateral tectum. Although
   serotonin-like immunoreactivity was also greatest in the lateral tectum
   and decreased significantly medially, it was largely constant in the
   anterior-to-posterior dimension. The populations of SP-ir and 5-HT-ir
   cells were nonoverlapping. Our results suggest that information may be
   processed differently in different regions of the optic tectum. (C) 1995

   (Gmelin, 1791) and Semele proficua (Pulteney, 1799), correlated with the
   habit and mode of life of both species, was made. Special attention was
   paid to the siphons, mantle, organs of the pallial cavity, musculature,
   and alimentary canal. Both species have a mosaic of morphological and
   ecological aspects, some typical of specialized suspension feeders,
   others of the deposit-feeding tellinaceans. The behavior of the siphons,
   the morphology and sorting devices of the organs in the pallial cavity,
   and the stomach contents reveal a non-selective suspension-feeding
   habit. According to the most recent view of evolution within the
   Tellinacea, S. purpurascens and S. proficua might be classified as
   representatives of the group considered intermediate in the evolutionary
   line that proceeds from an early selective suspension-feeding ancestor
   to the modern and exclusively deposit-feeding Tellinacea.
   Details of the organization of the siphonal retractors of a
   representative of the Tellinacea are given for the first time; the
   controversy regarding the occurrence of pedal elevator muscles in Semele
   is also discussed. Their presence in the genus is confirmed, although
   they are more weakly developed and functionally inoperative than those
   of fast-burrowing Tellinacea.}},

Abstract = {{Paleosols in the Lochness Formation (1.8 Ga, Australia) include both
   rare, non-red and abundant, strongly reddened varieties that formed at
   subaerial exposure surfaces in both ephemeral-river and lacustrine
   settings, Physical processes dominated non-red paleo sols, which were
   characterized by repeated episodes of desiccation, shrinking, and
   cracking alternating with wetting and introduction of sand, silt, clay,
   and iron oxyhydroxides into planar voids, Redoximorphic
   (oxidation-reduction) processes were especially intense for the red
   paleosols; redox depletions of Fe and Mn (hypoalbans) occur immediately
   adjacent to desiccation-related macropores and peds, whereas redox
   concentrations of Fe and Mn (quasi-coatings) occur within paleosol
   matrix adjacent to redox depletions, Illuviated clay and Fe-oxide
   coatings and hypocoatings are also common in planar macropores and on
   ped faces, Redoximorphic features indicate periodic water infiltration
   and saturation, accompanied by development of reducing conditions along
   planar macropores and ped surfaces in Lochness Formation paleosols,
   Variations in soil saturation were caused by seasonal fluctuations of
   lake level in lacustrine deposits, and by formation of perched
   saturation zones within floodplain deposits, respectively.
   Occurrences of red, hematitic paleosols in the Lochness Formation are
   compatible with previous interpretations of a weakly oxygenated 1.8 Ga
   paleoatmosphere. Redoximorphic features in the paleosols suggest a warm
   to cool temperate paleoclimate (mean annual soil temperature 5-20
   degrees C) characterized by seasonal saturation, by analogy with
   Quaternary redoximorphic soils. A minimal concentration of organic C (at
   least 1 wt \%), possibly of microbial or bacterial origin, must have
   been present in these Proterozoic soils to allow for Fe reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy-mineral assemblages from the rivers and wadis in the River Nile
   drainage basin reflect their origins in three petrologically and
   tectonically distinct source terranes that supply sediment to the River
   Nile and delta, The White Nile carries heavy-mineral assemblages
   dominated by calcic amphibole, epidote, garnet, staurolite,
   aluminosilicates, and opaques (ilmenite and titanomagnetite) derived
   from amphibolite- and granulite grade metamorphic rocks of the Central
   African Province, The Blue Nile and Atbara Rivers carry assemblages
   dominated by calcic amphibole, clinopyroxene, and opaques derived from
   alkali and tholeiitic basalts of the Ethiopian Highlands, Wadis (dry
   river beds) draining the Red Sea Hills contribute predominantly
   clinopyroxene, epidote, calcic amphibole, and opaques eroded from
   ophiolite complexes, calc-alkaline volcanics, and granitoids as well as
   minor metamorphic minerals from amphibolite-grade metapelites, Detrital
   ilmenite grains from the three sources are distinguished on the basis of
   TiO2, Al2O3, Cr2O3, MgO, ZnO, and V2O3 but not MnO contents determined
   by electron microprobe analysis, These data corroborate findings of
   earlier workers with respect to Al2O3, MgO, V2O3, and MnO in detrital
   ilmenite, Submicroscopic inclusions of quartz and sphene recognized on
   the basis of elevated SiO2 and CaO contents in ilmenite also distinguish
   different sources, Statistical and graphical analyses of the
   compositional data lead to the same conclusions about ilmenite chemistry
   and source areas, Opaque oxide (ilmenite and titanomagnetite) grains
   also have textural features unique to their sources. Though most grains
   are texturally homogeneous, ilmenite from the Central African Province
   contains exsolution lamellae in one crystallographic direction (0001)
   and titanomagnetite from the Red Sea Hills showing exsolution textures
   has octahedral \{111\} intergrowths, Taken together, compositions and
   textures of detrital opaque oxide grains from Nile River sediment
   sources can be used as provenance indicators of Nile delta sediments,
   This study also provides ties between igneous, metamorphic, and
   sedimentary petrology that are relevant for provenance studies of
   ancient river systems.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is a candidate retrograde messenger involved in
   synaptic plasticity, and is linked to the cholinergic system in the
   brain. We examined the role of NO in the acquisition of visual and
   spatial discriminations by daily administration of either saline or
   1-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an NO synthase inhibitor. Brains
   were assayed for NO synthase activity and two presynaptic cholinergic
   markers: hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) binding, which determines the number of
   sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake sites, and activity of
   choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which is the synthetic enzyme for
   acetylcholine. In both behavioral tasks, the acquisition rate was not
   different between groups. L-NAME reduced NO synthase activity by 85\% in
   all brain areas assayed and HC-3 binding by 38\% in hippocampus and 48\%
   in posterior cortex. ChAT activity was not different between groups in
   any region assayed. These data suggest that NO does not play a role in
   visual or spatial discrimination learning. However, NO synthase
   inhibition may play a role in the regulation of cholinergic activity.}},

Abstract = {{Urinary excretion of neopterins (N) and biopterins (B) was measured in
   48 patients with depression before and after treatment with placebo,

   significantly greater neopterin/biopterin (N:B) ratio than control
   subjects. There wa a significant correlation between NB: ratios and
   severity of depression and plasma cortisol. As a raised N:B ratio
   implies failure to convert neopterin to biopterin, it is possible that
   reduced availability of tetrahydrobiopterin, the essential cofactor for
   the formation of noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine, may exert
   rate-limiting control over the synthesis of monoamines implicated in the
   pathogenesis of depressive illness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Monoamniotic twins with ultrasonographic evidence of
   umbilical cord entanglement present a management challenge in the
   antepartum period.
   Cases: We report two pregnancies with monoamniotic twins and
   ultrasonographic evidence of cord entanglement in which longitudinal
   Doppler now velocity waveforms of the umbilical and middle cerebral
   arteries were obtained. A notch in the umbilical artery velocity
   waveform was noted in one twin member at 33 weeks' gestation and in both
   twin members of the other pregnancy at 31 weeks' gestation. Worsening of
   the umbilical artery velocity waveform notch with advancing gestation
   was noted in one fetus.
   Conclusion: The presence of a notch in the umbilical artery velocity
   waveform may reflect hemodynamic alterations in the fetal-placental
   circulation secondary to narrowing of the umbilical vessels involved in
   cord entanglement. This Doppler finding may be useful in the antepartum
   management of these pregnancies.}},

Abstract = {{The lifetimes of charged and neutral B hadrons have been measured using
   data collected by the DELPHI experiment at LEP between 1991 and 1993, B
   hadrons are tagged as jets with a secondary vertex and the charge of the
   B candidate is taken to be the sum of the charges of the particles in
   the secondary vertex. Approximately 1,434,000 multihadronic Z(0) decays
   yielded 1817 B hadron candidates. The B purity was estimated to be
   around 99.1 +/- 0.3\%, and 83\% (70\%) of the events measured as neutral
   (charged) came from neutral (charged) B's, The mean lifetimes of charged
   and neutral B hadrons were found to be 1.72 +/- 0.08 (stat.) +/- 0.06
   (syst.) ps and 1.58 +/- 0.11 (stat.) +/- 0.09 (syst.) ps respectively.
   The ratio of their lifetimes, tau((charged))/tau((neutral)), was
   1.09(-0.10)(+0.11) (stat.)+/-0.08 (syst.). By making assumptions about
   the B-s(0) and Lambda(b)(0) states, the B+ and B-0 meson life-times were
   determined to be tau(B)+ = 1.72 +/- 0.08 (stat.) +/- 0.06 (syst.) ps and
   tau(B)0 = 1.63 +/- 0.14 (stat.) +/- 0.13 (syst.) ps and the ratio of
   their lifetimes was:
   tau(B)+/tau(B)0 = 1.06(-0.11)(+0.13) +/- 0.10. The mean B lifetime was
   also deduced to be <tau(B)> = 1.64 +/- 0.06 (stat.) +/- 0.04 (syst.) ps.}},

Abstract = {{The measured short beam (three-point) shear strength was found to be
   strongly influenced by the support span-to-specimen thickness l/t ratio,
   and to a lesser extent, by the specimen thickness and the diameters of
   the loading and support cylinders. As the l/t ratio decreased, the shear
   strength increased. Transverse compressive stresses, induced by the
   support and loading cylinders, may have progressively inhibited shear
   failures as the separation of the cylinders decreased with decreasing
   l/t ratio. Nevertheless, shear failure modes were typically observed.
   Local compressive damage under the loading cylinder was a minor
   secondary event, if it occurred at all. Similar results were obtained
   for the four-point shear test specimen configuration. The four-point
   shear test method yielded shear strengths similar to those for the
   short-beam shear test for the unidirectional glass/epoxy composite but
   lower shear strengths for the unidirectional carbon/epoxy composite.}},

Title = {{INDUCTION OF HEME OXYGENASE IN TOXIC RENAL INJURY - A PROTECTIVE ROLE IN
   CISPLATIN NEPHROTOXICITY IN THE RAT}},
Journal = {{KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{Cellular content of heme is regulated by heme oxygenase, the rate
   limiting enzyme in the degradation of heme. Induction of heme oxygenase
   is a protective response in an in vivo model of heme protein mediated
   renal injury, the glycerol model of acute renal failure. In addition to
   heme, heme oxygenase is induced by diverse forms of oxidative stress,
   the functional significance of which is currently unknown. We examined
   whether heme oxygenase is induced, and the functional significance of
   such induction, in two in vivo models of oxidant-induced toxic
   nephropathy, namely, cisplatin and gentamicin nephropathies;
   nephrotoxicity in these models is not dependent on the delivery of a
   burden of heme proteins to the kidney as occurs in the glycerol model.
   We demonstrate induction of heme oxygenase mRNA and protein in the
   kidney as early as 6 and 12 hours after a single dose of cisplatin (6
   mg/kg i.v.). Pretreatment with tin protoporphyrin, a competitive
   inhibitor of heme oxygenase, led to higher serum creatinine values on
   days 3 through 5 and lower inulin clearances on day 5; tin
   protoporphyrin also exacerbated renal injury in this model. Renal
   hemodynamics studied at day 2 after cisplatin demonstrate reduced renal
   blood how rates, increased renal vascular resistance and increased
   fractional excretion of sodium in rats treated with tin protoporphyrin.
   Tin protoporphyrin alone had no significant effect on serum creatinine
   and renal hemodynamics in rats with intact, disease-free kidneys. We
   confirmed that tin protoporphyrin prevented the increase in heme
   oxygenase activity induced by cisplatin. Induction of heme oxygenase by
   cisplatin was associated with increased kidney heme content and ferritin
   content. Induction of heme oxygenase, as measured by mRNA and protein
   content, also occurred in gentamicin nephropathy, though less than that
   observed in cisplatin nephropathy. Inhibition of heme oxygenase did not
   influence sequential serum creatinine determinations in gentamicin
   nephropathy, thus indicating heterogeneity in the functional
   significance of induction of heme oxygenase in oxidative stress. We
   conclude that the induction of heme oxygenase is a protective response
   in toxic nephropathy, specifically, in cisplatin nephropathy. Ferritin
   content is also increased by cisplatin, and by sequestering iron, may
   subserve a beneficial role in this model, Endogenous heme, released from
   heme proteins, is potentially toxic and may contribute to cisplatin
   nephrotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{NaY zeolites measuring 63 and 193 nm (average crystallite size) have
   been synthesized by dosing different amounts of seeds in the
   crystallization step. Evaluation of catalytic activity of both zeolites
   after ion exchange with rare-earth ions and calcination has been carried
   out with two reactants of different molecular size: n-heptane and
   1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene. No influence of the crystallite size (and
   therefore of the external surface area) was observed for the cracking of
   n-heptane, as expected previously, However, when the cracking of
   1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene was performed, smaller-crystallite zeolite
   presented much higher conversions, as an indication that the reaction
   takes place at the outer surface of the zeolite. In fact, rates of
   reaction per external atoms of aluminum per unit cell, measured by XPS,
   are coincident, regardless of the crystallite size, confirming the
   assumption established above.}},

   for several flow geometries. The comparisons with existing analytical

   Furthermore, the gene harbours frameshift mutations in affected members

   remains elusive. However, recent studies in sporadic and

   decreased the number of follicles reaching the large antral stage at day

Abstract = {{In this study we have verified the existence of a cytosolic
   phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) in rat-liver macrophages. Stimulation of
   these cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), zymosan and
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not with the Ca2+-ionophore A23187, leads
   to phosphorylation of cPLA(2) and activation of mitogen-activated
   protein (MAP) kinase, supporting the hypothesis that MAP kinase is
   involved in cPLA(2) phosphorylation. We show furthermore, that the
   tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein prevents the LPS- but not the PMA-
   or zymosan-induced phosphorylation of cPLA(2) and activation of MAP
   kinase, indicating that tyrosine kinases participate in LPS-but not in
   PMA- and zymosan-induced cPLA(2) phosphorylation and MAP kinase
   activation. Phosphorylation of cPLA(2) does not strongly correlate with
   stimulation of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade: (1) A23187, a potent
   stimulator of AA release, fails to induce cPLA(2) phosphorylation; (2)
   withdrawal of extracellular Ca2+, which inhibits PMA-stimulated AA
   release (Dieter, Schulze-Specking and Decker (1988) fur. J. Biochem.
   177, 61-67), has no effect on PMA-induced phosphorylation of cPLA(2);
   (3) LPS induces cPLA(2) phosphorylation within minutes, whereas
   increased AA release upon treatment with LPS is detectable for the first
   time after 4 h; and (4) genistein, which prevents LPS-induced cPLA(2)
   phosphorylation, does not inhibit AA release in response to LPS. From
   these data we suggest that a rise in intracellular Ca2+, but not
   phosphorylation of cPLA(2), is essential for activation of the AA
   cascade in rat-liver macrophages.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis A is an infection transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
   Endemicity within a specific country is directly related to sanitation
   and hygienic standards, while being inversely related to socioeconomic
   conditions. We studied how the process of urbanization witnessed in
   Madrid had influenced the transmission of hepatitis A infection. In the
   Madrid Autonomous Region, this process first began in the early sixties
   and was not brought to a close until the late seventies. Catalytic
   models were used to estimate the annual infection rate, lambda, on the
   basis of seroprevalence data stratified by age. A cohort effect related
   to a fall-off in infancy-related hepatitis A virus (HAV) is to be
   observed in the results for the last few years. The model permits four
   birth cohort-based groups to be differentiated by lambda: individuals
   born pre-1960, lambda = 0.082 (95\% CI 0.095-0.070); those born in the
   early sixties, lambda = 0.052 (95\% CI 0.060-0.042); whose members were
   born in the late sixties, lambda = 0.033 (95\% CI 0.041-0.025); and
   those born in the late seventies, lambda = 0.017 (95\% CI 0.020-0.013).
   The first group includes those born before the urbanization process had
   started. The second and third groups coincide with the development stage
   of that process, hence exhibiting transitional rates. The fourth group
   reflects the process in its consolidation stage. This reduction in the
   transmission of infection has changed the manner of presentation, so
   that while isolated cases or small outbreaks tend to be more common
   nowadays, occasionally epidemics may evolve explosively. The average age
   at presentation has risen and the likelihood of symptomatic infection is
   higher.}},

Abstract = {{Recent clinical trials in patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) or
   fibrillation (VF) have occurred in the setting of the disappointing
   results of postinfarction secondary prevention studies using Class I
   antiarrhythmics (e.g., CAST). ESVEM addressed in a randomized trial
   whether electrophysiologic study (EPS) or Holter monitoring (HM) is a
   more accurate predictor of long-term antiarrhythmic drug efficacy in
   VT/VF patients (N = 486) and what the relative efficacy of various
   antiarrhythmic agents is for VT/VF. Surprisingly, arrhythmia recurrence
   rates were not significantly different by the method of determining an
   efficacy prediction. However, arrhythmia recurrence and mortality were
   lower (by about 50\% at 1 year) in patients treated with sotalol (a
   mixed Class II/III agent) than with other drugs (Class I). CASCADE
   evaluated empiric amiodarone versus guided (EPS or HM) standard (Class
   I) therapy in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF. The
   primary endpoint of cardiac death, resuscitated VF, or syncopal shock
   (in ICD patients) was reduced by amiodarone compared with conventional
   therapy (9\% vs 23\% at 1 year). An interim report of the ongoing CASH
   study suggested in 230 survivors of cardiac arrest that propafenone
   (Class IC) provided less effective prophylaxis (approximately 20\%
   1-year mortality) compared with randomly assigned therapies with
   amiodarone, metoprolol, or an ICD (approximately 14\% mortality rates)
   and was excluded from further study. These studies have led to a
   paradigm shift in the approach to antiarrhythmic therapy of VT/VF: drugs
   with antisympathetic plus Class III (refractoriness prolonging) action
   (i.e., sotalol, amiodarone) are superior to traditional drugs with Class
   I (conduction slowing) effects, even when guided by EPS or HM.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the effects of rolipram, a specific type IV
   phosphodiesterase inhibitor, on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha
   production and HIV-1 replication.
   Design: TNF-alpha enhances HIV-1 replication in vitro; blocking
   TNF-alpha and thereby inhibiting HIV-1 replication may therefore
   potentially delay progression of HIV disease. Pentoxifylline is a
   non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor that blocks TNF-alpha synthesis
   and HIV-1 replication in vitro and has been shown in preliminary
   clinical studies to decrease viral replication in HIV-1-infected
   patients. Rolipram, which selectively inhibits the predominant
   phosphodiesterase isoenzyme of monocytes, inhibits lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS)-induced TNF-alpha with 500-fold greater potency than
   pentoxifylline. We, therefore, hypothesized that rolipram would be a
   powerful inhibitor of HIV-1 replication.
   Methods: The effects of rolipram and pentoxifylline on TNF-alpha
   production and HIV-1 replication were determined in infected and
   uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), in a chronically
   infected promonocytic cell line (U1) and in an acutely infected
   monocytic cell line (BT4A3.5). TNF-alpha was determined by specific
   radioimmunoassay and HIV-1 replication was measured by p24 antigen and
   HIV-1 mRNA production.
   Results: Rolipram inhibited TNF-alpha production in LPS- and phorbol
   myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated PBMC and in PMA-stimulated U1 cells.
   Rolipram also inhibited HIV-1 replication in the U1 cell line, as well
   as in acutely infected PBMC and BT4A3.5 cells. Depending on the
   experimental conditions, rolipram was 10-600 times more potent, on a
   molar basis, than pentoxifylline.
   Conclusion: Rolipram is a potent inhibitor HIV-1 replication and
   therefore deserves further investigation as a potential therapeutic
   agent in the treatment of HIV-1-infected patients.}},

Abstract = {{Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of chronic total coronary
   occlusions has a low primary success rate and is associated with a high
   percentage of restenosis. The aim of this retrospective study was to
   assess the long-term benefits of these procedures. In a series of 201
   patients with 203 chronic total occlusions, the technical success rate
   was 51\%, the clinical success rate was 46\% with 3\% of major
   complications. The only factor associated with a favourable outcome was
   the presumed duration of the occlusion. The clinical follow-up period
   was established at 6 years. The result of the initial procedure was used
   to establish two groups of patients: group I, clinical success, and
   group II, clinical failure. Patients in group I had a probability of
   survival greater than that of those in group II (97 vs 92\%; p < 0.05);
   survival without coronary bypass surgery was also significantly better
   (89 vs 74\%; p < 0.003). On the other hand, the probability without
   angioplasty was less in group 1 (70 vs 77\%; p < 0.01), the result of a
   high restenosis rate (48\%). A Cox analysis identified clinical success
   of angioplasty as a good prognostic factor for survival. Moreover, the
   clinical status at long-term was significantly better in patients in
   group I. These results indicate that in patients with chronic total
   coronary occlusions, the success of angioplasty has a favourable effect
   on long-term outcome both in terms of survival and in quality of life.
   They must be interpreted in the light of the limitations inherent in a
   retrospective study and should be confirmed by prospective trials.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of sotalol in the treatment of sustained ventricular
   arrhythmias has been proved; however, whether its antiarrhythmic effect
   is due to a p-blocking activity, a class III antiarrhythmic activity, or
   a combination of both is not known. We conducted a prospective
   randomized study to compare the effects of metoprolol, a `'pure''
   beta-blocking agent, and of sotalol, a beta-blocking agent with
   additional class III antiarrhythmic properties, in 34 consecutive
   patients with documented sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia
   (VT) unrelated to transient causes. After undergoing baseline programmed
   electrical stimulation (PES-1) to assess arrhythmia inducibility, the
   patients were randomly assigned to a (double-blind) treatment of either
   metoprolol (16 patients) or sotalol (18 patients). Before the chronic
   regimen was initiated, arrhythmia inducibility was reassessed after the
   intravenous administration of either 0.15 mg/kg metoprolol or 1.5 mg/kg
   sotalol (PES-2), according to drug assignment. During the chronic oral
   regimen, a third PES (PES-3) was performed after a median followup of 72
   days. Resting and exercise EGG, Holter monitoring and echocardiography
   were performed at baseline and during follow-up. During a 2-year
   follow-up, a nonfatal arrhythmia recurred in 1 patient of the metoprolol
   arm and in 5 patients of the sotalol arm; 1 patient in the latter group
   died suddenly 2 months after the recurrence, while receiving amiodarone
   therapy. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in the
   incidence of arrhythmia recurrence, sudden death, or total mortality
   between the two groups. During RES-I, a sustained ventricular arrhythmia
   was inducible in 18 of 34 patients (53\%), 8 in the metoprolol and 10 in
   the sotalol arm. As compared with oral metoprolol, oral sotalol
   significantly reduced arrhythmia inducibility, but this finding did not
   correlate with clinical outcome. Neither drug proved superior in
   preventing the recurrence of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia or
   spontaneous or induced ischemic events. Logistic regression showed that
   gender, age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the number of

   properties may more relevantly affect the clinical outcome in these

Abstract = {{It has recently been observed that nerve growth factor induces the rapid
   onset of thermal hyperalgesia, and the more delayed onset of mechanical
   hyperalgesia when administered to mature rats. Though several mechanisms
   have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, it is still not well
   understood. Previous studies have shown that nerve growth factor can
   directly excite nociceptive sensory ganglion neurons in culture via
   activation of kappa excitatory opioid receptors. The possible
   involvement of these excitatory opioid receptors in mediating the
   hyperalgesia was investigated. Nerve growth factor-induced thermal
   hyperalgesia in rodents was prevented by co-administration of the
   non-selective opiate antagonist naloxone, as well as by the
   kappa-selective antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. Addition of the
   long-acting opioid antagonist, naltrexone, partially prevented
   mechanical hyperalgesia. Administration of low dose dynorphin to mice (a
   selective kappa-receptor agonist) mimicked the hyperalgesic effects of
   nerve growth factor. Opiate antagonists and anti-nerve growth factor
   antibody both interfered with Freund's adjuvant-induced inflammatory
   hyperalgesia.
   Altogether, these observations suggest that activation of excitatory
   opioid receptors plays a role in mediating nerve growth factor-induced
   hyperalgesia and that, in turn, nerve growth factor contributes to the
   hyperalgesia associated with inflammatory states. Since opioid receptor
   antagonists are well tolerated clinically, they may be useful for
   patients receiving nerve growth factor as part of ongoing trials of the
   factor in peripheral neuropathy.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms of resistance were investigated in a near isogenic
   permethrin-resistant strain of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa
   decemlineata (Say)). The near isogenic strain was bred from a
   Massachusetts field strain that was multiply resistant to a number of
   insecticides by backcrossing to a laboratory susceptible strain.
   Permethrin resistance was principally associated with two contributing
   factors, an increased level of carboxylesterase activity and a site
   insensitivity associated with the nervous system. Pharmacokinetically,
   there were no differences noted in the rate of permethrin penetration or
   excretion between strains. An increased level of carboxylesterase
   activity was associated with the permethrin-resistant strain resulting
   in a 1.5-fold greater hydrolytic rate of a-naphthyl butyrate.
   Additionally, the permethrin-resistant strain produced more hydrolytic
   metabolites of C-14-labeled permethrin when incubated under in vivo and
   in vitro conditions compared to the nearly isogenic susceptible strain.
   The increased carboxylesterase activity associated with permethrin
   resistance is largely membrane-associated when whole-body extracts are
   examined. Increased carboxylesterase activity showed a preference of
   alpha-naphthyl butyrate over alpha-naphthyl acetate, suggestive of a
   more hydrophobic catalytic center associated with the resistant form of
   enzyme activity. The near isogenic permethrin-resistant strain was also
   determined to br cross-resistant to DDT, indicating the possibility of
   site insensitivity as an additional mechanism involved in permethrin
   resistance. Time to 50\% knockdown for the resistant strain was 3.6
   times longer than for its nearly isogenic susceptible strain (i.e., 56
   min versus 15 min, respectively). Recovery from permethrin-induced
   knockdown was largely attributed to enhanced oxidative metabolism of
   permethrin by the resistant strain. Electrophysiological recordings
   determined the resistant strain to be recalcitrant to neuronal
   hyperexcitability caused by permethrin in the susceptible strain. These
   findings are consistent with a nerve insensitivity factor associated
   with kdr and kdr-type resistances in other insects. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{When swollen in hypotonic media, HL-60 cells exhibit a regulatory volume
   decrease (RVD) response as a result of net losses of K+ and Cl-. This is
   primarily caused by a dramatic increase in Cl- permeability, which may
   reflect the opening of volume-sensitive channels (11). To test this
   hypothesis, we measured volume-activated Cl- currents in HL-60 cells
   using the patch-clamp technique. The whole cell Cl- conductance (in
   nS/pF at 100 mV) increased from 0.09 +/- 0.06 to 1.15 +/- 0.19 to 1.64
   +/- 0.40 as the tonicity (in mosmol/kgH(2)O) of the external medium was
   decreased from 334 to 263 to 164, respectively. Cl- currents showed no
   significant inactivation during 800-ms pulses. Current-voltage curves
   exhibited outward rectification and were identical at holding potentials
   of 0 or -50 mV, suggesting that the gating of the channels is voltage
   independent. The selectivity sequence, based on permeability ratios
   (P-X/P-Cl) calculated from the shifts of the reversal potentials, was
   SCN- > I- approximate to NO3- Br- > Cl- much greater than gluconate.
   4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS; 0.5 mM)
   inhibits HL-60 Cl- channels in a voltage-dependent manner, with similar
   to 10-fold increased affinity at potentials greater than +40 mV.
   Voltage-dependent blockade by SITS indicates that the binding site is
   located near the outside, where it senses 20\% of the membrane
   potential. These Cl- channels were also inhibited in a
   voltage-independent manner by the oxonol dye bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric
   acid)pentamethine oxonol {[}diBA-(5)-C-4] with a concentration that
   gives half inhibition (IC50) of 1.8 mu M at room temperature. A similar
   apparent IC50 value (1.2 mu M) was observed for net Cl-36(-) efflux into
   a Cl--free hypotonic medium at 21 degrees C. It seems likely, therefore,
   that the volume-activated Cl- channels are responsible for the net Cl-
   efflux during RVD. These Cl- channels have properties similar to the
   `'mini-Cl-'' channels described in lymphocytes and neutrophils and are
   strongly inhibited by low concentrations of diBA-(B)-Ca.}},

Abstract = {{Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is used in our recently introduced therapy of
   post-traumatic brain oedema and is suggested to reduce ICP through
   reduction in both cerebral blood volume and brain water content. This
   study aims at increasing our knowledge of the mechanisms behind the ICP
   reducing effect of DHE by analysing cerebrovascular effects of a bolus
   dose of DHE in severely head injured patients (GCS<8).
   Mean hemispheric cerebral blood flow (CBF) calculated from the clearance
   of i.v. (133)Xenon, ICP, and cerebral arterio-venous difference in
   oxygen content (AVDO(2)); were measured before and after
   hyperventilation and after a bolus dose of DHE (4 mu g/kg). The patients
   were divided into two groups, one with preserved and one with impaired
   cerebrovascular CO2-reactivity to hyperventilation, the latter being
   predictive of poor outcome. The haemodynamic effects of DHE were
   compared to those of hyperventilation. Regional CBF and brain volume
   SPECT measurements were performed in two patients.
   DHE increased cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) by about 20\% and
   significantly reduced ICP in both groups of patients, resulting in
   unchanged AVDO(2). Hyperventilation with preserved CO2-reactivity caused
   a similar decrease in ICP as by DHE but with a much larger increase in
   CVR (by 70\%) and a substantial increase in AVDO(2). Hyperventilation
   with impaired CO2-reactivity reduced ICP but otherwise had no
   significant cerebrovascular effects.
   The study supports the concept that the ICP reducing effect of DHE
   results more from constriction of the large veins than from arterial
   vasoconstriction, also implying a relatively smaller risk of ischaemia
   with DHE than with hyperventilation.}},

   lie in a geodesic ball of radius 1/4 pi when n = 2 and to even smaller
   geodesic balls for larger n. The techniques used are analogous to those
   for our recent proof of the Payne-Polya-Weinberger conjecture:

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental investigation into the effect of

   characteristics of a highly-swept wing with drooped leading edges. The
   experiments were performed in a low-speed windtunnel on a wing of the
   same delta planform as that used in a previous study((1-2)). The latter
   wing was of fixed camber, while the subject of the present study was a
   wing with three different leading edge droop angles. The maximum
   reduction in drag due to the VGs was found to be about half that for the
   fixed-camber wing. This is reconciled with the different behaviour of
   the flow on the upper surface for the two types of wing. Without
   control, the drag of the variable-droop wings is much lower than that of
   the fixed-camber wing. As a result, with control: the variable droop
   wings have lower drag than that of the fixed-camber wing. Compared to
   that of the variable-droop wings without control, the fixed-camber wing,
   with control, has lower lift-dependent drag for lift coefficients

Abstract = {{The tail-cast suspension rat model has been developed in ground
   laboratories interested in space physiology for extensive study of
   mechanisms causing the pathophysiological syndrome associated with space
   flights, We used individually-caged male rats to explore the effects of
   acute and chronic (7d) orthostatic restraint (OR) and head-down
   anti-orthostatic restraint (AOR) on a series of physiological variables;
   The acute restraint study showed that (1) the installation of the OR
   device induced an acute reaction for 2 days, with a substantial rise in
   ACTH (x2) and CORT (x6), and that (2) the head-down tilt from OR to AOR
   induced (i) within 10 min and lasting 60 min a 2-fold rise in the
   intra-cerebro-ventricular pressure (Picv) monitored with an icy
   telemetric recording system, which receded to normal between 60 and 120
   min; and (ii) within 30 min a short-lived 4-fold rise in plasma ACTH and
   CORT levels, Chronic OR induced (1) the suppression of the diurnal
   ACTH/CORT rhythm, with increased mean levels, especially for ACTH, (2) a
   degraded circadian locomotor activity rhythm manifested by a significant
   reduction in the spectral power of the 24h periodicity and a concomitant
   emergence of shorter (ultradian) periodicities, (3) an associated, but
   less pronounced alteration of the diurnal rhythm in body temperature;
   and (4) a marked increase in baseline plasma levels of IL-1 beta and an
   increased reactivity in cytokine release following an E, coli endotoxin
   (LPS) challenge. AOR induced (1) a similar obliteration of the circadian
   ACTH/CORT rhythm, (2) the loss of close correlation between ACTH and
   CORT, (3) a generalized increase in baseline plasma IL-1 beta levels and
   (4) more extensive degradation of the circadian periodicity for both
   locomotor activity and, to a lesser extent, body temperature, replaced
   by dominant spectral powers for ultradian periodicities (3 to 10 h). In
   conclusion, both experimental paradigms - but AOR more than OR - caused
   a blockade of the circadian rhythmicity of major physiological
   variables, the loss of normal correlations between ACTH and CORT, and
   inflammatory-immune hyperreactivity. These pathophysiological disorders
   may all be parts of a complex chronic stress syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Digital ground-motion data recorded by the Western Canada Telemetered
   Network (WCTN) are used to examine the attenuation and source parameters
   of earthquakes in the Cascadia region of southwestern British Columbia
   and northwestern Washington. The data base is comprised of over 1000
   vertical-component Fourier spectra, from earthquakes of magnitude 3 to 7
   at distances from 10 to 500 km. Regression analyses determine the shape
   and coefficients of the regional attenuation curve and source spectra
   for 68 earthquakes. Seismic moment and stress drop are inferred from the
   amplitudes of the source spectra.
   Shallow (h < 10 km) earthquakes have an attenuation curve with a complex
   shape, exhibiting significant flattening (no apparent geometric
   spreading) in the distance range from 75 to 230 km; this shape is
   probably a result of strong reflected phases from mid-crustal
   discontinuities and the subducting slab. Events within the subducting
   slab and the lower crust exhibit a simple R(-1) attenuation curve. The
   anelastic attenuation coefficient for the region as a whole is given by
   Q = 380f(0.39).
   The duration of motion for each WCTN record is determined as the value
   that yields the observed relationship between time-domain and
   spectral-domain amplitudes, according to random process theory. These
   durations are approximately constant within 50 km of the source, then
   increase with distance as 0.07R.
   The high-frequency ground motions from Cascadia earthquakes are
   relatively weak. Cascadia source spectra are characterized by an average
   Brune stress drop of about 30 bars. This is significantly lower than the
   average California stress drop of 70 to 100 bars, and dramatically lower
   than the average eastern stress drop of 150 to 200 bars. It is concluded
   that there are significant regional variations in source parameters.
   Hazard estimates for the Cascadia region based on California
   ground-motion relations may be overly conservative.}},

Abstract = {{Metastatic renal cell carcinoma has occasionally been reported to mimic
   malignant pleural mesothelioma. Morphologically, histochemically and
   immunohistochemically, similarities in the two tumours exist making
   their differentiation difficult, particularly in biopsy specimens. The
   aim of this study was to make a comparative immunohistochemical analysis
   of the two tumours by use of a panel of four antibodies (Leu M1; Ber
   EP4; thrombomodulin and Tamm-Horsfall protein). Their suitability in
   differentiating between the two tumours was assessed. We examined 20
   cases of renal cell carcinoma and 20 cases of malignant pleural
   mesothelioma. On immunostaining with Leu M1, 14 of 20 renal cell
   carcinomas were positive, yielding 70\% sensitivity and 95\% specificity
   and one of 20 mesotheliomas. In comparison, Ber EP4 antibody stained
   only seven of 20 of the renal cell carcinomas. In addition, it was noted
   that four tubulopapillary pattern renal cell carcinomas stained
   positively with both anti-Leu M1 antibody and Ber EP4 antibody.
   Thrombomodulin immunostaining was present in 11 of 20 mesotheliomas
   (55\% sensitivity and demonstrated 95\% specificity) and one of 20 renal
   cell carcinomas. For epithelial mesotheliomas only, thrombomodulin
   staining was identified in 10 of 14 cases. In the differentiation of
   renal cell carcinoma from epithelial mesothelioma we recommend the use
   of Leu M1 and thrombomodulin as diagnostically useful markers. None of
   the antibodies used in this study was effective in distinguishing
   sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma from sarcomatous mesothelioma.
   Tamm-Horsfall protein showed little diagnostic utility in
   differentiating the two tumours.}},

   (MICSPOMS) is a special kind of optical reflection interference filter,
   consisting of a metal mirror, followed by a thin layer of an optical
   transparent interlayer, represented by the ionic strength sensitive
   polymer. Therefore, by monitoring the slope of the narrow bandwidth
   reflection minimum of this layer system a high sensitivity for the
   analyte, which causes the swelling, is obtained. To obtain swellability
   and attachment to the metal surface as well as photostructuring
   properties a crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone photopolymer was

Abstract = {{For cultured pearl production, a mantle allograft from a donor is

   Encapsulation of the grafts by hemocytes follows. The mantle allograft's

   hemocyte capsule, and eventually form a follicle, called a pearl sac,
   surrounding the bead. To clarify the cell types involved and timing of

   various phases of pearl sac formation were injected with a thymidine
   analog, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and dividing cells labeled with
   BrdU were visualized with anti-BrdU antibody. At 4 days after
   implantation, the epidermal cells (dominant cells in the outer
   epithelium) of the allograft initiated active proliferation and
   emigration. Their mitoses continued during emigration and after
   establishment of the pearl sac. No incorporation of BrdU into the other
   two types of mantle epithelial cells (mature mucous cells and cells with
   large granules) was observed. In the gonad surrounding the pearl sac, a
   large number of connective tissue cells among gonadal follicles and
   around the intestine showed peak mitotic activity around one week after
   the operation, which implied activation of hemocyte production.}},

Abstract = {{The electronegativity difference between silicon and SiO2 produces a
   dipole layer at the Si-SiO2 interface which determines the barrier
   height between the silicon and SiO2 conduction bands. Because thermally
   grown SiO2 is amorphous, the alignment of these dipoles with respect to
   each other fluctuates resulting in a barrier height distribution,
   Photon-assisted injection of electrons into the thermally grown gate
   oxide of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor is used to
   extract this distribution by experiment. The ratio of the injected gate
   current to the short-circuit source-drain photocurrent collected under
   the gate is shown to be the Laplace transform of the barrier height
   distribution. By inverting the Laplace transform, measured under the
   specific experimental conditions described, the barrier height
   distribution is found to be Gaussian. The average zero-field barrier
   height is found to be 3.5 eV with a standard deviation of 0.64 eV
   measured in the oxide over a plane parallel to the Si-SiO2 interface.
   The relation is given between the average barrier height and the
   high-field extrapolated barrier height of 3.1 eV, and it is argued that
   the standard deviation is a measure of the degree of disorder in the

Abstract = {{It is known to those skilled to the art that the electric wires used in
   high voltage operating electric equipments such as TV sets, microwave
   ovens, duplicators and etc., have such a structure that a conductor is
   coated with an insulating layer which is encapsulated with a protecting
   jacket layer. The electric wire specification such as UL and CSA
   requires superior cut-through property and flame-retardant property of
   the wire for utilization safety. The cut-through property of insulation
   material, for example, high density polyethylene, can be increased by
   crosslinking of the polymer. Also the flame-retardant property of jacket
   material which protects the flammable inner insulation can be raised by
   flame-retardant formulating of the material. In the wire and cable
   industry, crosslinking by electron beam processing is more effective
   than that by chemical processing in the viewpoint of through-put rate of
   the products. The jacket layer of the wire plays the role of protecting
   the insulation material from burning. The protecting ability of the
   jacket is related to its inherent flammability and formability of
   swollen carbonated layer when burned. Crosslinking of the material gives
   good formability of swollen carbonated layer, and it protects the
   insulation material from direct flame. In formulating the
   flame-retardant jacket material, a crosslinking system must be
   considered with base polymers and other flame-retardant additives.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-deficient maize seedlings exhibit a starvation syndrome
   characterized by an increase in different parameters such as root fresh
   weight (+30\%), protein (+25\%) and plasma membrane-associated NADH
   Fe3+-EDTA reductase (NFR; +45\%). NFR activity was found associated with
   9 000 g (20 min) and 110 000 g (1 h) sediments, purified plasma membrane
   and 110 000 g supernatants. No differences were observed between the
   properties of reductases from Fe-starved versus Fe-sufficient roots. The
   characterization of NFR was undertaken. Low M(r) forms (46 and 28 kDa,
   as detected by size-exclusion chromatography) were present in all
   fractions whereas 210 and 110 kDa forms were unique in membranes and 110
   000 g supernatants, respectively.
   The 210 kDa form was solubilized from microsomes and characterized. The
   enzyme is acetone-resistant and appears to be comprised largely if not
   totally of the low M(r) forms (46 and 28 kDa, corresponding to 30 and 32
   kDa bands, respectively, in SDS-PAGE). The 210 kDa form tended to break
   down to subunits following dilution, and the effect could be prevented
   by addition of 10\% (v/v) glycerol. A three-step purification procedure
   for microsomal NFR was devised, consisting of acetone fractionation of
   lysophosphatidycholine solubilized microsomes, Blue Sepharose CL-6B
   affinity chromatography and a final size exclusion chromatography in the
   absence of detergent, resulting in a 700-fold purification of the 28 kDa
   protein. the best electron acceptor for the purified 28 kDa form was
   ferricyanide (400 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) protein) followed by
   Fe3+-chelates (up to 200 mu mol min(-1) mg(-1) protein) and other
   compounds to a lesser extent (cyt c, DCPIP). The 46 kDa form, on the
   other hand, had high ferricyanide reductase activity (about 300 mu mol
   min(-1) mg(-1) protein) and relatively low Fe3+-chelate reductase
   activity. The properties of NFR (high M(r) active forms, donor and
   acceptor specificity, purification behaviour, large hydrophilic domains,
   size of subunits) suggest a relationship with the NADH-cyt b(5)
   reductase family of FAD-containing proteins. None of the latter
   flavoproteins is a transmembrane enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{In order to obtain a precise estimate of the relative risk of squamous

   scrutinizing the pathology and case records, 17 cases of SCC were
   considered as being certainly secondary to venous leg ulcers, whereas in
   six cases of remitting/relapsing ulcers the connection was probable. The
   relative risk calculated on 17 cases was 5.80(95\% confidence interval=
   3.08-9.29). The median duration of the ulcer before the diagnosis of
   cancer was 25 years. The mean follow-up time of the cohort was 8.5

Abstract = {{Previous research has noted a high rate of drug use by women arrestees.
   Not only are women arrestees more likely to be found drug positive by
   urinalysis than are men arrestees, but in recent years, in part because
   of drug use, women have constituted the fastest growing population
   segment involved with the criminal justice system. One small but
   important subgroup of women arrestees are those who are pregnant and,
   thus, who particularly need intervention. This article utilizes Drug Use
   Forecasting (DUF) data from Los Angeles jails to examine whether or not
   pregnant drug-abusing women arrestees differ from nonpregnant
   drug-abusing women arrestees in terms of perceived need for treatment.
   Bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression show that
   pregnant drug-using women are not more likely than nonpregnant women to
   perceive a need for treatment. Although pregnancy status is not related
   to perceived need, a number of other factors are related, including
   being single, Euro-American ethnicity, using cocaine or opioids for more
   than three days in the past 30 days, being self-identified as currently
   drug dependent, having a substance abuse treatment history, and having
   lower legal incomes. Interventions with drug-using women arrestees
   should be made early in their drug use and criminal careers and should
   Target both pregnant and nonpregnant women.}},

Abstract = {{We present a determination of \textbackslash{}V-cb\textbackslash{} from
   semileptonic B decays that includes resummation of supposedly large
   perturbative corrections, originating hom the running of the strong
   coupling. We argue that the low value of the BLM scale found previously
   for inclusive decays is a manifestation of the renormalon divergence of
   the perturbative series starting already in third order. A reliable
   determination of \textbackslash{}V-cb\textbackslash{} from inclusive
   decays is possible if one either uses a short-distance b quark mass or
   eliminates all unphysical mass parameters in terms of measured
   observables, such that all infrared contributions of order 1/m(b) cancel
   explicitly. We find that using the <(MS)over bar> running mass
   significantly reduces the perturbative coefficients already in low
   orders. For a semileptonic branching ratio of 10.9\% we obtain
   \textbackslash{}V-cb\textbackslash{}(tau(B)/1.50 ps)(1/2) = 0.041 +/-
   0.002 from inclusive decays, in good agreement with the value extracted

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Deflection routing can be used in networks whose stations have the same
   number of input and output links, Fixed-length packets arrive
   synchronously on the station's input links at the beginning of time
   slots, and each packet is routed via the output link that offers the
   shortest path to its destination, Since the number of packet buffers at
   each output link is finite, the simultaneous contention of two packets
   for the last buffer of a common output link must be resolved by
   `'deflecting'' one of the packets to another output link, Thus, the
   deflection of a packet could result in the packet following a route that
   is not a shortest path, The potentially unbounded number of routes that
   a given packet can take makes analyzing the performance of such networks
   difficult, In particular, there currently are no analytical models that
   can analyze multibuffer deflection-routing networks with nonuniform
   traffic, Using independence assumptions, we develop a performance model
   of deflection routing that allows us to estimate accurately and
   efficiently the mean transport time and throughput in a network that has
   any given two-connected topology, multiple buffers at each output port,
   and an arbitrary traffic matrix.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of large solid particles on the residence time distribution
   of the fluid in two-phase flow was studied in a pilot scale continuous
   tubular system. The residence time distribution was characterized with
   four parameters: the normalized minimum and mean residence time, the
   normalized standard deviation and the skewness. The effect of particle
   concentration (1 and 3\%) and particle diameter (diameters approximately
   0.3 and 0.4 of the tube diameter) were analysed for fluids with
   different viscosities and at different flow rates. It was observed that
   the presence of particles, even at very low concentration, has a
   significant effect, increasing the mean residence time and decreasing
   the standardized dispersion. This effect was attributed to particles
   breaking the velocity profile of the fluid and causing some localized
   mixing due to their rotational velocity. Although the presence of
   particles affected the results, their concentration (or number) was not
   relevant, in the range tested, which is very low for particulate foods.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine if previous oral contraceptive (OC) use is
   associated with changes in early follicular phase FSH, LH or E(2).
   Design: A cross-sectional study examining determinants of early
   follicular phase hormone levels.
   Subjects: Subjects included 106 premenopausal women with a family
   history of ovarian cancer and 116 premenopausal women without this
   history who were not taking OCs currently. All subjects completed a
   structured interview and gave an early follicular phase blood sample.
   Setting: Gynecologic Epidemiology Center and Familial Ovarian Cancer
   Research Center.
   Main Outcome Measures: Follicle-stimulating hormone, LH, and E(2) were
   measured in early follicular phase plasma samples.
   Results: Recency or length of prior OC use did not affect early
   follicular phase LH or E(2) levels. Length of OC use did not affect FSH
   levels in all subjects; but lower levels of FSH were observed in women
   over age 45 who had used OCs for >5 years. Early follicular phase FSH is
   lower in women with OC use within the past 5 years compared with women
   with more remote use or who never used OCs, after adjustment for age,
   smoking, and family history status.
   Conclusions: Past use of OCs may have a residual effect on basal FSH
   levels in women not using them currently that depends on recency of use
   and to a lesser extent duration of prior use.}},

Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has several downregulatory
   functions on the immune system: inhibition of interleukin-2 receptor
   induction, decrease of interferon-gamma-induced class II antigen
   expression, inhibition of macrophage activation, as well as cytotoxic
   and lymphokine-activated killer cell generation. TGF-beta has also been
   recognized as an important immunoregulator in murine leishmaniasis, for
   which it increases susceptibility to disease. In the present stud we
   evaluate the involvement of TGF-beta in human leishmaniasis in vitro and
   in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. Human macrophages produce
   active TGF-beta after infection by Leishmania amazonensis (480 +/- 44.7
   pg/ml; mean +/- SEM), L. donovani chagasi (295 +/- 7.6 pg/ml), or L.
   braziliensis (196 +/- 15.7 pg/ml). When TGF-beta was added to cultures
   of human macrophages infected with L. braziliensis it led to an increase
   of approximately 50\% in parasite numbers as compared with untreated
   cultures. Exogenous TGF-beta added to macrophage cultures was able to
   reverse the effect of interferon-gamma in controlling Leishmania growth.
   Even at 100 IU/ml interferon-gamma the presence of TGF-beta increases
   the number of intracellular parasites. On the other hand, TNF-alpha at
   high concentration (100 IU/ml) totally blunts the suppressive effect of
   TGF-beta. Immunostaining for TGF-beta was observed in the dermis,
   produced by fibroblasts and occasionally by inflammatory cells in the
   biopsies from human leishmaniasis lesions, being present in most of the
   biopsies taken from patients with early cutaneous leishmaniasis (less
   than 2 months of ulcer development) and in cases of active mucosal
   leishmaniasis. Taken together these observations suggest an important
   role for TGF-beta in human leishmaniasis, with its production by
   infected macrophages being probably related to parasite establishment in
   the early states of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Corticosteroids are widely used to treat children with
   inflammatory bowel disease although the response is variable,
   side-effects are common, and many patients develop a partial or complete
   steroid resistance. The mechanism underlying these phenomena are
   unclear. Corticosteroids mediate some of their actions through
   lipocortin-1, and the induction of autoantibodies to lipocortin has been
   proposed as a possible mechanism by which steroid efficacy is suboptimal
   in vivo.
   Patients and methods: We have measured serum lipocortin-1 antibody
   concentration by ELISA in 38 children with Crohn's disease, 12 with
   ulcerative colitis and in 15 controls.
   Results: IgG and IgA anti-lipocortin-1 antibody levels were higher in
   the Crohn's group than in the ulcerative colitis or control groups.
   Elevated concentrations did not relate to disease activity, history of
   steroid therapy or steroid-responsiveness. Lipocortin IgM antibody
   status was similar in all three groups.
   Conclusion: It is therefore unlikely that serum antibodies to
   lipocortin-1 have a role in the development of steroid-resistance in
   children with inflammatory bowel disease.}},

Abstract = {{The proteolytic enzyme stromelysin-l is a member of the family of matrix
   metalloproteinases and is believed to play a role in pathological
   conditions such as arthritis and tumor invasion. Stromelysin-1 is
   synthesized as a proenzyme that is activated by removal of an N-terminal
   prodomain. The active enzyme contains a catalytic domain and a
   C-terminal hemopexin domain believed to participate in macromolecular
   substrate recognition. We have determined the three-dimensional
   structures of both a C-truncated form of the proenzyme and an inhibited
   complex of the catalytic domain by X-ray diffraction analysis. The
   catalytic core is very similar in the two forms and is similar to the
   homologous domain in fibroblast and neutrophil collagenases, as well as
   to the stromelysin structure determined by NMR. The prodomain is a
   separate folding unit containing three alpha-helices and an extended
   peptide that lies in the active site of the enzyme. Surprisingly, the
   amino-to-carboxyl direction of this peptide chain is opposite to that
   adopted by the inhibitor and by previously reported inhibitors of
   collagenase. Comparison of the active site of stromelysin with that of
   thermolysin reveals that most of the residues proposed to pray
   significant roles in the enzymatic mechanism of thermolysin have
   equivalents in stromelysin, but that three residues implicated in the
   catalytic mechanism of thermolysin are not represented in stromelysin.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing numbers of people suffer from HIV infection, in many sectors
   of society. However, the extent to which health care services meet their
   needs is open to question. This study aimed to gather consumer views and
   assess the extent to which care was adequate, through interviews with 85
   clients. Their responses were then compared with those of service
   providers (published in this journal 2 years ago). Overall there was a
   general expression of appreciation and satisfaction, although in many
   cases financial and social deprivation was so extreme that it appeared
   that established services could not compensate. However, the need for
   better housing and more confidentiality of records was emphazised. The
   need for greater security from the consequences of prejudice was felt
   strongly and many distressing incidents were recounted. The major
   contrast between consumers' and service providers' views focused on
   whether separate and specialist provision was required. Providers were
   aware that care would need to be integrated with other generalist
   services in the future in order to cope with the scale of need, while
   consumers were keen to retain specialist clinics and wards to protect
   their confidentiality and sustain the level of expertise they
   appreciated. Within this sample, however, minority groups wished to have
   their particular needs recognized, in particular women with children and
   heterosexual males resented being grouped with the majority group of
   consumers with HIV/AIDS.}},

Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) has emerged as a pre-eminent
   negative growth factor with inhibitory effects on a range of malignant
   epithelial cell types. There is increasing evidence that the malignant
   phenotype is associated with an imbalance of growth factors within the
   local microenvironment of tissues. Oncogenic events promoting neoplastic
   progression could involve either an excess of positive growth factors or
   a deficiency of negative ones such as TGF beta. Whether altered levels
   of TGF beta are directly implicated in processes of carcinogenesis
   remains unresolved, but local endogenous levels of TGF beta can be
   manipulated pharmacologically. This may be of relevance to the mode of
   action of some agents with proven therapeutic efficacy. Thus, boosting
   of endogenous TGF beta levels could correct any pre-existing or acquired
   deficiency, or compensate for overproduction of positive stimulatory
   growth factors resulting from activation of cellular proto-oncogenes.
   This article reviews the evidence for modulation of TGF beta synthesis
   and production by several commonly used pharmacological agents, and
   assesses the clinical potential of this strategy both for the treatment
   of established tumours and prevention of malignancy.}},

Abstract = {{Retinoids are currently being tested for the treatment and prevention of
   several human cancers, including breast cancer. However, the anti-cancer
   and growth inhibitory mechanisms of retinoids are not well understood.
   All-trans retinoic acid (RA) inhibits the growth of the estrogen
   receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, in a reversible
   and dose-dependent manner. In contrast, insulin-like growth factors
   (IGF-I, IGF-II) acid insulin are potent stimulators of the proliferation
   of MCF-7 and several other breast cancer cell lines. Pharmacologic doses
   of RA (greater than or equal to 10(-6) M) completely inhibit
   Icf-l-stimulated MCF-7 cell growth. Published data suggest that the
   growth inhibitory action of RA on IGF-stimulated cell growth is linear
   and dose-dependent, similar to RA inhibition of unstimulated or
   estradiol-stimulated MCF-7 cell growth. Surprisingly, we have found that
   IGF-I or insulin-stimulated cell growth is increased to a maximum of
   132\% and 127\%, respectively, by cotreatment with 10(-7) M RA, and that
   10(-9)-10(-7) M RA increase cell proliferation compared to IGF-I or
   insulin alone. MCF-7 cells that stably overexpress ICF-II are also
   resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of 10(-9)-10(-7) M RA.
   Treatment with the IGF-I receptor blocking antibody, alpha IR-3,
   restores RA-induced growth inhibition of ICF-l-treated or
   IGF-II-overexpressing MCF-7 cells, indicating that the IGF-I receptor is
   mediating these effects. IGFs cannot reverse all RA effects since the
   altered cell culture morphology of RA-treated cells is similar in
   growth-inhibited cultures and in ICF-II expressing clones that are
   resistant to RA-induced growth inhibition. These results indicate that
   RA action on MCF-7 cells is biphasic in the presence of IGF-I or insulin
   with 10(-9)-10(-7) M RA enhancing cell proliferation and greater than or
   equal to 10(-6) M RA causing growth inhibition. As IGF-I and IGF-II
   ligands are frequently detectable in breast tumor tissues, their
   potential for modulation of RA effects should be considered when
   evaluating retinoids for use in in vivo experimental studies and for
   clinical purposes. Additionally, the therapeutic use of inhibitors of
   IGF action in combination with RA is suggested by these studies. (C)

   Initiative (an activity under the Nordic Council through its Nordic

   national health service exists in all Nordic countries and there are
   important common legal foundations with great similarities between

   considerable legal differences, but these differences do not necessarily
   reflect differences in underlying principles. Important ethical
   principles relevant to genetic testing that are shared by the Nordic
   countries include the concept of social justice with great stress on
   equality of treatment, the right to autonomy, the right to full
   disclosure of test results, strict confidentiality with respect to test

   were taken from the clinically uninvolved skin of 18 untreated patients
   with plaque-stage MF, 1 cm (near) and greater than or equal to 10 cm
   (far) from the MF plaques, and from 23 normal, healthy controls. Eight
   to 12 serial sections from each specimen were examined. The most common
   histologic finding, which was observed in six (33\%) biopsies of near
   skin and four (22\%) biopsies of far skin compared with only one (4\%)
   biopsy of normal control (p = 0.02 and 0.1, respectively), consisted of
   mononuclear-cell infiltrate around a blood vessel in the papillary
   dermis, with extension of some of these cells into the overlying
   epidermis. More diffuse and epidermotropic mononuclear cell infiltrates
   were seen in an additional three (17\%) biopsies of near skin, whereas
   mild nonepidermotropic superficial perivascular or perifollicular
   mononuclear cell infiltrates were observed in an additional four (17\%)
   biopsies of the normal controls, In conclusion, the most common
   histologic finding in our study, which was observed predominantly in the
   MF group, might represent an earlier stage and clinically undetectable
   involvement of the normal-looking skin in MF patients.}},

Abstract = {{Three hundred seventy-five consecutive total hip arthroplasty revisions
   done using proximally porous-coated femoral components of 6 designs were
   reviewed a mean of 4.7 years after surgery. Fifty-nine hips have been
   rerevised for aseptic femoral loosening, and 4 for osteolysis. Moderate
   or severe pain was present in 23\% of surviving hips, and radiographic
   evidence of femoral loosening was present in 38\% of surviving hips at
   the most recent followup. At 8 years, survivorship free of revision for
   aseptic femoral failure (for loosening or osteolysis) was 58\% (95\%
   confidence intervals, 44.3\%, 69.6\%); survivorship free of aseptic
   femoral loosening (revision for aseptic loosening or radiographic
   loosening) was 20\% (95\% confidence intervals, 12\%, 27\%); and
   survivorship free of symptomatic femoral loosening (revision for aseptic
   loosening or radiographic femoral loosening with moderate or severe
   pain) was 45\% (95\% confidence intervals, 32.3\%, 56\%). More severe
   preoperative bone loss correlated with poorer survivorship free of
   aseptic loosening and subsidence of greater than or equal to 5 mm.
   Differences among the prosthetic-type groups with respect to patient's
   age, gender, and bone loss severity precluded direct comparison of
   performance for each prosthetic type; however, all the prostheses had a
   significant rate of rerevision and aseptic loosening. Stable long-term
   fixation with the proximally porous-coated femoral components used in
   this series was not achieved on a predictable and reproducible basis.
   The damaged, weakened bone often present in the proximal femur during
   revision probably does not provide an optimal environment for sturdy
   initial or longterm biologic fixation of these devices that rely on the
   proximal femoral bone for fixation.}},

Abstract = {{Fungal communities from the A horizon of an Eucalyptus forest sandy
   soil, in Rocha, Uruguay, were analyzed. Two proximate sites, one
   affected by fire (site A) in January 1989 and the other undisturbed
   (site B), were selected. The composition and organization of both
   communities was revealed th rough the analysis of 240 samples collected
   eight times over 12 months period (March, April, May, June, August,
   October, 1989; January and April 1990). From these samples, 125,862
   isolates belonging to 159 taxa were obtained. At both sites, the
   propagules of the opportunistic decomposer remained scarce throughout
   the year. and the number of species per 100 isolates was very low. At
   site A, Gongronella butleri was the dominant species during the year,
   except in March, when Eupenicillium brefeldianum, Penicilium decumbens
   and Talaromyces flavus codominated. At site B, Gongronella butleri,
   Penicillium fellutanum and Penicillium donkii codominated or alternated
   their dominance. The index of Similarity between both sites was 44\%
   which reflects that the differences between microfungal populations of
   both soils represented more changes in species number of propagules than
   in species composition, except in the first sampling month. It seems,
   consequently, that the fire was not damaging enough to modify the
   composition of the fungal opportunistic decomposer community. However,
   the higher number of propagules at burned site A than at undisturbed
   site B suggests that, in the former site, some fungal populations were
   favored. This could be due to the rainfall during late March 1989 (at
   the start of the sampling), which stimulated Eucalyptus regrowth and
   also Acacia and Eucalyptus seed germination, two to three months after
   the fire. Consequently, early new conditions not far from that of
   undisturbed site B were established and the resilience of fungal soil
   populations of site 4 seems to be high due to early regrowth of the
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aims of this study were to compare in a randomized trial
   the results of high-dose versus conventional-dose chemotherapy as
   first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. The comparison
   included complete response (CR) rate, duration of response, and duration
   of survival.
   Patients and Methods: Ninety patients were entered onto a study to
   compare two cycles of high-dose cyclophosphamide 2.4 g/m(2),
   mitoxantrone 35 to 45 mg/m(2), and etoposide (VP16) 2.5 g/m(2) (HD-CNV)
   versus six to eight cycles of conventional-dose cyclophosphamide 600
   mg/m(2), mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2), and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) (CNV) as
   first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. The high-dose regimen
   included either autologous bone marrow or peripheral-blood stem-cell
   rescue. All 90 patients are assessable.
   Results: The response rates were significantly different. The overall
   response rate for HD-CNV was 43 of 45 (95\%), with 23 of 45 patients
   (51\%) achieving CR. Twenty-four of 45 patients (53\%) who received
   conventional CNV have responded, with only two patients achieving CR.
   Both duration of response and duration of survival were significantly
   longer for patients who received HD-CNV. Toxicity of the high-dose
   therapy was moderate in most patients. Grade 2 to 3 mucositis and
   hematologic suppression that required supportive treatment was
   universal, but hematologic recovery to a neutrophil count more than
   500/mu L and platelet count more than 40,000/mu L occurred at day 18
   (median) after therapy.
   Conclusion: HD-CNV appears to be a promising schedule that results in a
   significant proportion of CRs and increased survival in patients with
   metastatic breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{P-o, the major protein of the PNS myelin, is palmitoylated at the
   cytoplasmic Cys(153), TO gain insights into the mechanism of P-o
   acylation, the in vitro palmitoylation of both P-o and a synthetic
   Cys(153)-containing octapeptide was studied. Incubation of PNS myelin
   membranes or isolated P-o with {[}H-3]palmitoyl-CoA resulted in specific
   labeling of this protein, suggesting that the reaction is nonenzymatic.
   Incorporation of the labeled fatty acid into P-o was not affected by
   boiling the isolated P-o for 15 min before incubation or by adding
   sciatic nerve homogenate to the reaction mixture, which confirms the
   nonenzymatic nature of the reaction. After chemical deacylation, P-o was
   palmitoylated at a higher rate, suggesting that the original site was
   reacylated. Furthermore, tryptic digestion and peptide mapping showed
   that the same sites are acylated in vitro as in nerve slices indicating
   that the reaction has physiological significance. On incubation with
   {[}C-14]palmitoyl-CoA, the synthetic peptide encompassing the natural
   P-o acylation site (I(150)RYCWLRR(157)) was also spontaneously acylated
   at the cysteine residue. Thus, the integrity of the protein is not
   required for the nonenzymatic transacylation reaction. At pH 7.4 and 37
   degrees C, peptide palmitoylation followed a second-order reaction (k(2)
   = 246 +/- 6 M(-1) min(-1))and is likely a bimolecular nucleophilic
   substitution with the peptide thiolate attacking the highly reactive
   thioester bond in palmitoyl-CoA, The activation energy calculated from
   the Arrhenius plot is similar to 2 kcal/mol and much lower than that of
   enzyme-catalyzed transacylations, Finally, two other P-o peptides
   (V(121)PTRYG(126) and K(109)TSQVTL(115)) as well as various unrelated
   thiol-containing compounds, including cysteine, glutathione, pressinoic
   acid (CYFQNC), and crustacean cardioactive peptide (PFCNAFTGC), were not
   autoacylated. These results indicate that the IRYCWLRR peptide
   represents a particular structural motif and/or has some chemical
   features that allow the reaction to occur spontaneously.}},

   concentrations up to approximately 200 ng . L(-1) in water and to about
   4 mu g . g(-1) in dry sediment, resulting in body burdens of about 3.5
   mu g .(g dry weight)(-1). Mentum deformities in Chironomus spp. larvae
   in Lake 382 and five reference lakes ranged from 0 to 16\%, which was
   within the range reported for other contaminated lakes (2 to 83\%). The
   frequency of deformities in Lake 382 was not detectably different either
   in larvae collected between 1989 and 1992, or in those from reference
   lakes. Incidence of deformities was higher in four of the five reference
   lakes than in Lake 382. The constancy of the deformities (confined
   mainly to the median tooth, commonly with cleft or forked median teeth)
   is consistent with an inherited genetic effect; therefore, we consider
   the deformities to be natural abnormalities. We conclude that the low
   cadmium levels added to Lake 382 did not induce mentum deformities and
   that background levels of deformities are high (up to 16\%) in
   Experimental Lakes Area lakes. The common occurrence of natural
   abnormalities must be considered when using chironomid mouthpart
   deformities as an index of environmental degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Hymenoptera allergies are a cause of considerable morbidity. However,
   deaths due to insect sting constitute a health hazard that can be
   minimized by effective therapy. We report the results of a study of 1815
   men and women, aged 20-44 years and resident in three areas of Sweden.
   The prevalence of sensitization to the venom allergens of honeybees and
   wasps was assessed by RAST. Atopy and allergic diseases were considered
   possible risk factors for symptom development. Of the 1815 subjects,
   1399 were randomly chosen from the general population. Of the random
   sample, 9.3\% had specific bee or wasp IgE, 1.5\% reported systemic
   reactions to bee or wasp stings, and 0.6\% had both. Sensitization to
   bee or wasp correlated positively with atopy (odds ratio (OR) 2.0,
   confidence interval (CI) 1.4-2.8, P<0.0001), male sex (OR 1.8, CI
   1.3-2.5, P<0.001), and age (OR 2.0, CI 1.4-2.8, P<0.01), and negatively
   to living in the northernmost of the three centers (OR 0.4, CI 0.3-0.7,
   P<0.001). Atopy was not found to be a risk factor for systemic
   reactions. We conclude that the prevalence of Hymenoptera allergy in
   Sweden is rather low when compared with other countries. Subjects with
   atopy seem to have an increased risk of becoming sensitized but do not
   develop systemic reactions more frequently than nonatopic subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Research and theory combine to suggest that the relationship between
   religious belief and psychological well-being should be more positive
   among Black than among White individuals. Further; this relationship
   should be mediated by social psychological aspects of religion that have
   positive implications for well-being, such as self-enhancing religious
   attributions and a positive social identity associated with one's
   religious affiliation. These predictions were examined in a sample of 66
   Black and 59 White university students. Religious belief salience and
   psychological well-being were moderately positively correlated, but only
   among Black subjects. The relationship between religious belief and
   well-being was partially mediated by attributions to God that enhance
   life meaning and positive social identification resulting from one's
   religious affiliation, again only among Black subjects. Implications of
   these results for the self-maintenance of Black college students are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A bioreactor system for the continuous cultivation of animal cells with
   a high potential for scale-up is presented. This reactor system consists
   of radial-flow fixed-bed units coupled with a dialysis module. The
   dialysis membrane enables the supply of low-molecular-weight nutrients
   and removal of toxic metabolites, while high-molecular-weight nutrients
   and products (e.g. monoclonal antibodies) are retained and accumulated.
   This concept was investigated on the laboratory scale in a bioreactor
   with an integrated dialysis membrane. The efficiency of the reactor
   system and the reproducibility of the cell activity (hybridoma cells)
   under certain process conditions could be demonstrated in fermentations
   up to 77 days. Based on model calculations, an optimized fermentation
   strategy was formulated and experimentally confirmed. Compared to
   chemostat cultures with suspended cells, a ten-times higher mAb
   concentration (383 mg l(-1)) could be obtained. The highest volumetric
   specific mAb production rate determined was 6.1 mg mAb (1 fixed bed)(-1)
   h(-1).}},

   characterized by a K-d around 60 pM, when measured under equilibrium
   conditions. The binding specificity respected a decreasing order as
   follows: estradiol (E(2): 100\%) > 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (40HTAM: 52.7\%)
   > estriol (E(1): 5.7\%) > estrone (E(1): 2.1\%)>TAM (0.2\%). The
   induction of alkaline phosphatase activity (APase) used as an
   estrogen-specific response, confirmed the intrinsic estrogenicity of
   progestins derived from 19-nor-testosterone (19NT): norethindrone (NOR),
   norethynodrel and levonorgestrel, at concentrations ranging from 10(-8)
   to 10(-6) M. The effect of NOR was partially blocked by the antiestrogen
   40HTAM, which was also partially agonistic in this model, but neither by
   the antiprogestin mifepristone (RU486) nor by the aromatase inhibitor
   aminoglutethimide. A simulatory effect was also detected at 10(-7) or
   10(-6) M with ethindrone, the testosterone- (T) derived progestin
   homologous to NOR, and with both androgenic parent-compounds, i.e. T and
   19NT themselves. In contrast, progesterone (P) derivatives like
   medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and chlormadinone acetate (CMA)
   remained totally inactive, as well as 19-nor-progesterone (19NP) itself
   or its progestagenic derivatives: ORG 2058 and nomegestrol acetate
   (NOM). Structure-activity relationships deduced from these studies
   suggest that it is not the absence of the 19-methyl group which can
   account for the estrogenic potential of the so-called
   `'19-norprogestins'', but rather their steroid structure derived from T
   in a broad sense (including the 19NT derivatives), as opposed to the
   non-estrogenic therapeutic progestins derived from P like MPA or CMA, or
   from 19NP like NOM.}},

Abstract = {{Farmers of rainfed cowpea/groundnut/millet/sorghum cropping systems in
   Kano, Nigeria, ranked arthropods as the major production constraint in
   cowpea and groundnut in 1991 and 1992. At least 25\% of the farmers also
   reported severe infestations by Striga gesneroides, a parasitic weed of
   cowpea. Drought was regarded as the major constraint in millet and
   sorghum. Farmers reported a total of 19 arthropod species, of which 10
   occurred on two or more crops, five exclusively on cowpea, two on
   groundnut and two on sorghum. In an identification cation test of common
   phytophagous arthropods, farmers used specific names for aphids and
   podsucking bugs but more variable, descriptive names for flower thrips,
   pod borers and bruchics. More than half the farmers (57.5\%) correctly
   identified the feeding site and host plant of the arthropods. Despite
   the high level of pest awareness, the majority of farmers did not
   practice any type of pest control. Less than 15\% used chemical
   insecticides primarily because of their high cost and lack of
   availability. Traditional control was practised by less than 11\% of the
   farmers and was limited to manual removal of pests, beating with
   branches, and sprinkling ashes or manure with or without kerosene or
   petrol on the crop.}},

Abstract = {{We use the mapping between the Burgers equation and the problem of a
   directed polymer in a random medium in order to study the fully
   developed turbulence in the N-dimensional forced Burgers equation, The
   stirring force corresponds to a quenched (spatiotemporal] random
   potential for the polymer. The properties of the inertial regime are
   deduced from a study of the directed polymer on length scales smaller
   than the correlation length of the potential, which is not the regime
   usually considered in the case of polymers. From this study we propose
   an ansatz for the velocity field in the large-Reynolds-number limit of
   the forced Burgers equation in N dimensions, which should become exact
   in the limit N --> infinity. This ansatz allows us to compute exactly
   the full probability distribution of the velocity difference u(r)
   between points separated by a distance r much smaller than the
   correlation length of the forcing. We find that the moments {[}u (q)(r)]
   scale as r zeta((q)) with zeta(q)=1 for all q less than or equal to 1
   {[}in particular, the q=3 moment agrees with Kolmogorov's scaling
   zeta(3)=1]. This strong `'intermittency'' is related to the large-scale
   singularities of the velocity field, which is concentrated on an (N -
   1)-dimensional frothlike structure, which is in turn related to the
   one-step replica-symmetry-broken nature of the associated disordered
   problem. We also discuss the similarities and differences between
   Burgers turbulence and hydrodynamical turbulence and we comment on the
   anomalous tracer fluctuations in a Burgers turbulent field. Since this
   replica approach is rather unusual in turbulence problems, we provide
   all the necessary details of the method.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of phenanthrene transfer to the bacteria during
   biodegradation by a Pseudomonas strain was investigated using a
   sensitive respirometric technique (Sapromat equipment) allowing the
   quasicontinuous acquisition of data on oxygen consumption. Several
   systems of phenanthrene supply, crystalline solid and solutions in
   non-water-miscible solvents (silicone oil and
   2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylmonane) were studied. In all cases, analysis of
   the kinetics of oxygen consumption demonstrated an initial phase of
   exponential growth with the same specific growth rate. In order to
   analyze the second phase of growth and phenanthrene degradation, a study
   of the kinetics of phenanthrene transfer to the aqueous phase was
   conducted by direct experimentation, with the crystal and silicone oil
   systems, in abiotic conditions. The data allowed the validation of a
   model based on phase-transfer laws, describing the variations, with
   substrate concentrations, of rates of phenanthrene transfer to the
   aqueous phase. Analysis of the biodegradation curves then showed that
   exponential growth ended in all cases when the rates of phenanthrene
   consumption reached the maximal transfer rates. Thereafter, the
   biodegradation rates closely obeyed, for all systems, the transfer rate
   values given by the model. These results unambiguously demonstrated
   that, in the present case, phenanthrene biodegradation required prior
   transfer to the aqueous phase. With the silicone oil system, which
   allowed high transfer and biodegradation rates, phenanthrene was
   directed towards higher metabolite production and lower mineralization,
   as shown by oxygen consumption and carbon balance determinations.}},

Abstract = {{Cylindrical cavities, viewed through the side as they collapsed onto
   solid surfaces, were studied using high-speed streak and framing
   photography. The cavities were collapsed asymmetrically using shock
   waves of varying amplitude so that the rear surface formed a high-speed
   jet which crossed the cavity and interacted with the target surface.
   Schlieren optics were used to visualise waves in the fluid and in the
   target. Two features of the collapsing bubble affected the damage to the
   target surface. The first was the impact of the high-speed liquid jet on
   either the rear wall of the cavity or the target itself. The second was
   the production of a strong compression wave on the rebound of the bubble
   after it reached minimum volume. Damage to the targets related to their
   material properties. Metals, with low compressive but higher tensile
   strengths, plastically deformed beneath the penetrating jet to form a
   pit. Brittle materials, with high compressive but low tensile strengths,
   deformed by cracking. The position of the cavity relative to the surface
   had a major effect upon the geometry of the damage. With the cavity
   close to the target, the penetrating jet dominated the damage leaving
   single pits. With the cavity at some distance, the rebound wave was more
   important than the jet giving rise to a circular damage mark. This
   mechanism can be used to re-interpret previous experimental observations

Abstract = {{Objectives. We sought to determine whether 12,500 IU of unfractionated
   heparin given subcutaneously twice daily for 4 months after percutaneous
   transluminal coronary angioplasty beneficially influences the subsequent
   rate of angiographic restenosis and the incidence of clinical events.
   Background. Heparin has been shown to exhibit powerful antiproliferative
   effects against smooth muscle cells in several animal models.
   Methods, A randomized trial with blinded data analysis was undertaken to
   assess the effect of unfractionated subcutaneous heparin on angiographic
   restenosis after coronary angioplasty, After successful angioplasty,
   patients were randomized to receive no heparin or 12,500 IU of heparin
   given subcutaneously twice daily for 4 months, Quantitative coronary
   angiography,vas performed before angioplasty, immediately after
   angioplasty and at follow-up (''early'' {[}before 4 months] or
   electively {[}at 4 months]).
   Results. The study group comprised 339 patients, 167 randomly assigned
   to receive heparin, 172 to receive no heparin, Repeat cardiac
   catheterization was performed in 90\% of randomized patients, At early
   and elective restudy (mean 4.2 months), the mean +/- SD difference in
   minimal lumen diameter between the postangioplasty and follow-up
   measurement was -0.55 +/- 0.58 mm for the no heparin group and -0.43 +/-
   0.59 mm for the heparin group (p = NS), Clinical events during the
   follow-up period did not differ significantly between groups: fatal
   myocardial infarction (1 patient in each group), coronary bypass
   grafting (5 patients in each group), repeat angioplasty (12 in the no
   heparin, 6 in the heparin group), angina at 4-month assessment (33\% in
   the no heparin, 32\% in the heparin group).
   Conclusions. Long-term treatment with high dose subcutaneous heparin
   (12,500 IU twice daily) for 4 months did not favorably influence
   angiographic or clinical outcome after coronary angioplasty.}},

Abstract = {{Monodisperse aerosol particles can be used to non-invasively probe
   intrapulmonary airspace dimensions, In this study, the aerosol-derived
   airway morphometry technique was used to study airspace dimensions in 79
   healthy subjects, in order to assess reference data for the future
   clinical application of aerosol-derived airway morphometry, and to
   investigate the effect of lung inflation, anthropometric, and lung
   function parameters on aerosol-derived airway morphometry,
   Intrapulmonary airspace dimensions were assessed by measuring the
   deposition of monodisperse, hydrophobic submicron aerosol particles
   during breathholding. Additionally, measurements of spirometric and body
   plethysmographic lung function were performed,
   Airspace dimensions were in good agreement with morphometric lung data,
   Airspace dimensions increased with increasing lung inflation.
   Interindividual variation of airspace dimensions was lowest in the lung
   periphery, at high levels of lung inflation, and when the volumetric
   lung depth was normalized to the end-inspiratory lung volume, Analysis
   of variance showed an increase of airspace dimensions with age,
   The results of this study indicate that aerosol-derived airway
   morphometry is dependent on the level of lung inflation and the age of
   the subject, These results suggest that in contrast to conventional lung
   function techniques, aerosol-derived airway morphometry might be a
   powerful tool for the detection of small changes in peripheral airway
   geometry.}},

Abstract = {{According to the terms of the Ministerial Declaration on the Protection
   of the North Sea, input of the nutrients phosphorus (P) and Nitrogen (N)
   to the coast from the Norwegian-Swedish border to Lindesnes should be
   reduced by about 50\% between 1985 and 1995. The State Pollution Control
   Authority (SFT) has analyzed how Norway can achieve this reduction in
   the most cost-effective way and at the same time achieve the greatest
   possible improvement in water quality along the Norwegian coast and in
   its watercourses.
   Two alternative sets of measures were analyzed, both of which would meet
   the requirements of the Declaration. The lowest-cost alternative would
   have average annual costs of about NKr 930 million (U.S.\$150 million),
   and investments of about NKr 4000 million (U.S.\$643 million). However,
   this set of measures would not take account of local water quality, and
   measures would therefore not always be introduced where the need is most
   pressing. SFT proposed that an alternative set of measures be
   implemented, almost all of which would also help to achieve local goals
   for water quality. This alternative will have annual costs of about NKr
   980 million (U.S.\$158 million), and investments of about NKr 4100
   million (U.S.\$659 million).}},

Abstract = {{Popular music has moved to the centre of economic life, suggesting a
   shift in the political economy of advanced societies. The transition has
   been marked by a concomitant shift in the centrality of popular music in
   social life, assisted by new technologies. More importantly, the changes
   have been brought about by the reorganization of record company
   ownership and activity since the 1980s. This paper suggests that
   cultural studies could apply aspects of the research and analysis
   methods developed in institutional economics, to a study of the
   relationship between cultural and economic formations. Institutional
   economics, especially as proposed by Thorstein Veblen, provides a
   pragmatic critique for cultural industries in an era of globalization
   and rising corporate power. In this paper I have used institutional
   economics to illustrate how the shift in the organization of popular
   music has taken place within the corporate economy. The use of popular
   music as a feature of the corporate economy has involved the expansion
   of all forms of entertainment into the information economy, This
   convergence of activities and interests located in and around popular
   music is described by the term `cultural mobility'.}},

   EFFECTS OF NEUROHORMONAL MODULATION BY DIGOXIN AND IBOPAMINE}},

Year = {{1995}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study assessed the effects of digoxin and ibopamine on
   variables of heart rate variability in relation to neurohormonal
   activation.
   Background. Analysis of heart rate variability can be used to study the
   autonomic dysfunction that characterizes chronic heart failure. In the
   Dutch Ibopamine Multicenter Trial, patients with heart failure were
   found to have increased neurohormonal activation with placebo therapy
   but not with digoxin and ibopamine therapy.
   Methods. We studied 59 patients with mild to moderate heart failure
   (mean {[}+/-SEM] age 60 +/- 1 years, mean ejection fraction 0.30 +/-
   0.01). Patients were randomized to double-blind treatment with digoxin
   (0.25 mg {[}n = 22]), ibopamine (100 mg three times a day {[}n = 19]) or
   placebo (n = 18); background therapy consisted of furosemide (up to 80
   mg).
   Results. After 3 months, plasma norepinephrine levels had increased with
   placebo, whereas they decreased with digoxin (+31 vs, -60 pg/ml,
   respectively, p < 0.01). With ibopamine, a nonsignificant decrease was
   observed (-27 pg/ml, p = 0.10). All variables of heart rate variability
   showed a deterioration in the placebo group. With digoxin, the percent
   differences between successive RW intervals >50 ms (pNN50) increased
   (+1.7 +/- 0.9\%, p < 0.01), along with absolute and normalized high
   frequency power (+40 +/-33 ms(2), p < 0.05 and +2.4 +/- 1.7\%, p < 0.01,
   respectively). These changes were observed during daytime hours only and
   were most pronounced in patients with the most impaired baseline heart
   rate variability. With ibopamine, nonsignificant trends similar to the
   changes with digoxin were observed,
   Conclusions. In patients with early stages of heart failure, digoxin may
   prevent a progressive deterioration in heart rate variability, whereas
   ibopamine does not show statistically significant effects. The changes
   in heart rate variability with digoxin parallel an observed decrease in
   neurohormonal activation. Digoxin apparently enhances cardiac vagal tone
   in the setting of neuroendocrine activation.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-one representative vocalizations of two species of rain forest
   monkeys (blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis, and grey-cheeked mangabeys,
   Cercocebus albigena) and two species of savanna monkeys (vervet monkeys,
   Cercopithecus aethiops, and yellow baboons, Papio cynocephalus) were
   broadcast in both rain forest and savanna habitats. Broadcast signals
   were re-recorded at distances of 12.5 and 100 m, digitized, and analysed
   on a supercomputer to measure the magnitude of distortion of the vocal
   repertoires of the savanna and forest monkeys in both the `appropriate'
   and `inappropriate' habitats. Independent distortion analyses were
   conducted in the time and frequency domains. The results showed that (1)
   distortion was strong following transmission distances of only 12.5 m in
   both habitats, (2) distortion scores were further increased, but only by
   a modest amount, when transmission distance was increased, (3)
   distortion scores were greater in the savanna habitat than in the rain
   forest habitat, (4) rain forest monkey calls were distorted less in the
   `appropriate' rain forest habitat than in the `inappropriate' savanna
   habitat, but (5) savanna monkey calls were similarly distorted in both
   habitats. The results were consistent with the idea that the rain forest
   environment is generally more favourable for high-fidelity sound
   propagation, and that selection for reduced distortion has more strongly
   influenced the physical form of the vocal repertoire of the two rain
   forest species than that of the two savanna species. (C) 1995 The

   experiment is analysed to reveal the mesoscale structure of a kata-cold

   fronts and this paper is concerned with the detailed structure of one of
   the surface cold fronts. Two kinds of circulations are shown to coexist
   at such a front: vertical convection and a slantwise circulation. The
   slantwise circulation is a feature not normally resolved by conventional
   observations of kata-cold fronts: it is shown to be a small-scale
   version of the rearward-sloping ascent encountered in ana-cold fronts.
   Much of the slantwise circulation was cloud-free but where it impinged
   upon the boundary layer it triggered the development of a narrow band of
   convective cloud, the tops of which extended downstream within air that

Abstract = {{Two experiments were conducted to assess the influence of agonistic
   relationships among male guppies on their sexual and aggressive
   behaviour under different social conditions. In experiment 1, each male
   of small mixed-sex groups of guppies was systematically removed and
   reintroduced to the group. Only during the alpha male reintroduction
   were there any changes in the sexual behaviour of the remaining males;
   the female-preferred sigmoid display of the beta males was depressed.
   During reintroductions, the alpha male was responsible for most
   aggression directed towards the reintroduced male. Females also
   responded aggressively towards the reintroduced males, particularly the
   alpha male. In experiment 2, an unfamiliar male was introduced to each
   established mixed-sex group. Again, rank-related behaviour was evident;
   most aggression directed towards the unfamiliar male was performed by
   the alpha male. The unfamiliar male also performed fewer sigmoid
   displays than did the alpha male. Thus, agonistic relationships among
   males may be responsible for suppression of sexual behaviour by
   subordinate and non-resident males and should be considered as a factor
   in sexual selection processes in guppies. (C) 1995 The Association for
   the Study of Animal Behaviour}},

Abstract = {{The hydroxyl radical OH oxidizes many trace gases in the atmosphere. It
   initiates and then participates in chemical reactions that lead to such
   phenomena as photochemical smog, acid rain, and stratospheric ozone
   depletion. Because OH is so reactive, its volume mixing ratio is less
   than 1 part per trillion volume (pptv) throughout the troposphere. Its
   close chemical cousin, the hydroperoxyl radical HO2, participates in
   many reactions as well. The authors have developed an instrument capable
   of measuring OH and HO2 by laser-induced fluorescence in a detection
   chamber at low pressure. This prototype instrument is able to detect
   about 1.4 x 10(5) molecules cm(-3) (0.005 ppty) of OH at the ground in a
   signal integration time of 30 s with negligible interferences. The
   absolute uncertainty is a factor of 1.5. This instrument is now being
   adapted to aircraft use for measurements throughout the troposphere.}},

Abstract = {{Consumption and growth rates of juvenile bluefish Pomatotomus saltarix
   increased with increasing temperature and decreased with increasing fish
   size in short-term (7 days) experiments. Salinity had no effect on
   growth or consumption rate in a short-term experiment. In a long-term
   (90 days) mesocosm experiment, consumption and growth rates declined
   with increasing body size. Predictive equations developed from
   short-term experiments did not adequately predict observed consumption
   rates in the mesocosm experiment. However, growth in the mesocosm
   experiment was similar to field growth. Also, mesocosm consumption rates
   and consumption rates calculated using field growth and mesocosm growth
   efficiencies were similar to published independent field estimates of
   consumption rate. Our results indicate that experiments to determine the
   effects of temperature and the allometry of body size on growth and
   consumption rates should be conducted over long time periods simulating
   field conditions. Juvenile bluefish have rapid growth and their
   individual cumulative consumption is large. This result suggests that
   bluefish may have a large effect on their prey populations. This effect
   has yet to be quantified. (C) 1995 The Fisheries Society of the British

Abstract = {{We evaluated the diagnostic utility and prognostic value of
   immune-complex-dissociated (ICD) HIV-1 p24 antigen detection in a
   prospective cohort study of perinatally acquired HIV-1 infection in
   Butare, Rwanda. HIV-1 p24 antigen was measured after acid dissociation
   in plasma samples collected at 6 weeks and 3 months of age from 36 HIV-1
   infected and 80 uninfected children born to HIV-1 infected women. Among
   children with persistent HIV-1 antibody after 12 months of age, 26.7\%
   of samples tested ICD HIV-1 p24 antigen positive. Among children who
   died between 3 and 12 months of age but were classified as HIV-1
   infected, 17.6\% tested p24 antigen positive at 6 weeks of age and
   33.3\% at 3 months of age. Female infants were more likely to test p24
   antigen positive than male infants (p = 0.046). The specificity of the
   assay was 96.8\%. Cumulative probabilities of child survival to 36
   months of age were computed by HIV-1 status of the child and early p24
   antigenemia. The mean survival time was 7 months for HIV-1 infected
   children with a high (>50 pg/ml) p24 antigen concentration versus 20
   months for children with p24 antigen concentrations between 10 and 50
   pg/ml (p = 0.02). Cumulative probabilities of survival to 36 months of
   age were 0\% among HIV-1 infected children with at least one positive
   p24 antigen test, 44\% among confirmed HIV-1 infected children who were
   p24 antigen-negative at both 6 weeks and 3 months of age, and 95\% among
   seroreverting children (p < 0.001). These results suggest a lower
   sensitivity of the ICD HIV-1 p24 antigen assay among Rwandan children
   compared with previous reports from developed countries. However, a
   positive p24 antigen test was strongly predictive of rapid progression
   to AIDS and early death.}},

   consecutive patients who had previously been seen in the department. At
   stage two, 61 patients returning within one month for a follow-up
   appointment completed either the paper or computer version both before
   and after that appointment as well as a study evaluation form.
   Reliability as measured by intraclass correlation coefficients is high
   for simultaneous administration of the paper and computerized versions.
   Reliability over a short interval (before and after the patient's
   appointment) is acceptable. Reliability over a longer interval between
   the two consecutive appointments (mean and median 18 days) also appears
   to be acceptable for both computer and paper versions. Three-quarters of
   the patients felt that the SF-36 could provide useful information to
   their physicians. Among psychiatric outpatients, the test-retest
   reliability of the SF-36 appears to be acceptable for use in outcome
   studies. The SF-36 can be administered using a computer without
   jeopardizing reliability. Both versions are acceptable for use with
   psychiatric patients.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-two neonates (26 term and 6 premature) having seizures were
   prospectively recruited and studied. Using prolonged video/EEG
   monitoring, we quantified seizure variables (electrographic and clinical
   seizure durations, interictal periods and electrographic seizure spread)
   for all 1,420 seizures recorded. The effects of time and antiepileptic
   drug (AED) therapy were analyzed statistically. Seizures were generally
   frequent, with limited electrographic spread. However, some neonates had
   consistently longer interictal periods and 13\% had mean interictal
   periods >60 min. Seizure variables were relatively stable over time, but
   they changed with AED therapy. There was a trend to decreased seizure
   duration, increased length of interictal periods, and decreased
   electrographic spread. Furthermore, there was evidence of reduced
   clinical features after sequential AED infusions. Seizures ceased during
   the monitoring period in 22 neonates. Eighty-five percent of all
   seizures had no clinical manifestations. Among neonates with clear
   clinical correlates, clinical observations underestimated electrographic
   seizures in individual neonates by a mean of 54\% (range 0-95\%).
   Seizures generally had limited electrographic spread. Use of only four
   recording electrodes, characteristic of some portable EEG systems,
   underestimated seizures in 19 neonates, and missed all seizures in 2.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To investigate serum anti-beta(2)-glycoprotein-I antibodies
   (a beta(2)GP-I) in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome
   (APS).
   Methods. We studied a beta(2)GP-I by Western blot, dot blot, and ELISA
   in the sera of 15 patients with primary APS with high titers of
   immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or immunoglobulin M (IgM) anticardiolipin
   antibodies (aCL) at the time of study and compared findings with the
   sera of 13 aCL positive patients with syphilis and 76 healthy controls.
   Sera were also inhibited with cardiolipin micelles and tested for aCL
   and a beta(2)GP-I activities.
   Results. Twelve patients with primary APS but no syphilis patient or
   control subject had IgG to phospholipid-free beta(2)GP-I (p < 0.0001 for
   both comparisons). The aCL activity was inhibited with cardiolipin
   micelles but this treatment had less effect on a beta(2)GP-I activity.
   We found no IgM a beta(2)GP-I in any serum. Nine of 14 patients had had
   lupus anticoagulant activity; 8 of these had a beta(2)GP-I.
   Conclusion. Patients with primary APS frequently have IgG a beta(2)GP-I
   that appear to differ from aCL. If aCL present in patients with primary
   APS actually react with a phospholipid induced neoepitope on
   beta(2)GP-I, as recently proposed, patients with primary APS have
   autoantibodies against 2 epitopes on beta(2)GP-I. Lack of a beta(2)GP-I
   in patients with syphilis might also contribute to protection from
   developing the APS.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the computerized tomographies (CTs) of the thorax and
   the pulmonary diffusing capacity for CO (DL(CO)) in eight male athletes
   before and after a triathlon. DL(CO) and alveolar volume (VA) were
   simultaneously measured during 9 s of breath holding. The transfer
   coefficient (K-CO = DL(CO)/VA) was then calculated. CT scanning was
   performed during breath holding with the subjects in the supine
   position. Scanner analysis was done by 1) counting the linear and
   polygonal opacities (index of interstitial fluid accumulation) and 2)
   calculating the physical mean lung density and the mean slice mass.
   Results showed a significant reduction in DL(CO) (44.9 +/- 2.3 vs. 42.9
   +/- 1.7 ml . min(-1). mmHg(-1); P < 0.05) and K-CO (6.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.6

   +/- 0.01 g/cm(3); P < 0.0001). The number of polygonal and linear
   opacities increased after the race (P < 0.001). This study confirmed

Abstract = {{An increased extracellular K+ concentration ({[}K+](o)) is thought to
   cause muscle fatigue. We studied the effects of increasing {[}K+](o)
   from 4 mM to 8-14 mM on tetanic contractions in isolated bundles of
   fibres and whole soleus muscles from the rat. Whereas there was little
   depression of force at a {[}K+](o) of 8-9 mM, a further small increase
   in {[}K+](o) to 11-14 mM resulted in a large reduction of force. Tetanus
   depression at 11 mM {[}K+](o) was increased when using weaker
   stimulation pulses and decreased with stronger pulses. Whereas the
   tetanic force/resting membrane potential (E(M)) relation showed only
   moderate force depression with depolarization from -74 to -62 mV, a
   large reduction of force occurred when E(M) fell to -53 mV. The
   implications of these relations to fatigue are discussed. Partial
   inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump with ouabain (10(-6) M) caused additional
   force loss at 11 mM {[}K+](o) Salbutamol, insulin, or calcitonin
   gene-related peptide all stimulated the Na+-K+ pump in muscles exposed
   to 11 mM {[}K+](o) and induced an average 26-33\% recovery of tetanic
   force. When using stimulation pulses of 0.1 ms, instead of the standard
   1.0-ms pulses, force recovery with these agents was 41-44\% which was
   significantly greater (P<0.025). Only salbutamol caused any recovery of
   E(M) (1.3 mV). The observations suggest that the increased Na+
   concentration difference across the sarcolemma, following Na+-K+ pump
   stimulation, has an important role in restoring excitability and force.}},

   Design: Cross-sectional household survey in 18 countries of the

   Respondents: Representative samples of 1300-6995 individuals aged 15-49
   years, interviewed in 1989-1993.
   Methods: Face-to-face interviewing.
   Results: We observed a huge variability between study sites, with the
   proportion of men reporting sexual contact outside regular partnerships
   in the last year ranging from 4 to 47\%. Contacts with sex workers range
   from 1 to 25\%. Women were much less likely to report non-marital sex
   than men.
   Conclusions: This first cross-cultural attempt to examine aspects of
   sexual lifestyles suggests that broad generalizations about
   multiple-partner sexual networking in particular regions are misleading.
   Gender, marital status, age and a few other demographic correlates were
   disclosed as powerful determinants of sexual behaviour, although the
   strength of associations varied greatly between specific locations.

Abstract = {{A new method has been devised for the determination of diclofenac sodium
   in bulk and in pharmaceutical preparations using Eu3+ ions as the
   Fluorescent probe. The technique was built around the hypersensitive
   property of the transitions of the fluorescent probe ion, Eu3+, at 616
   nm. This is normally a forbidden transition, but the interaction with
   diclofenac sodium, which contains a carboxylic group, makes the
   transition allowed and enhances the intensity of its fluorescence
   emission. The Eu3+ fluorescence emission at 592 nm comes from a
   non-hypersensitive transition and is not affected by ligation. The
   intensity ratio, R, defined as I-592/I-616, was used as a measure of the
   percentage of bound probe ions. Diclofenac and Eu(III) forms a (1:1)
   molar complex.
   The relative stability constant of the complex was found to be 10(5). A
   linear relationship between bound Eu3+ and the concentration of
   diclofenac sodium was found for concentrations from 10 to 200 mu g
   ml(-1), with a recovery percentage of 100.22 +/- 2.27. The method shows
   a good agreement with a spectrophotometric method.}},

   that the discrete divergence and gradient be negative adjoint of each

   DIVGRAD. The adjointness requirement on the divergence and gradient
   guarantees that the Laplacian is a symmetric negative operator, The
   discrete approximations we derive are fourth-order on smooth grids, but
   the approach can be extended to create approximations of arbitrarily

Abstract = {{Grain mycoflora, occurrence of aflatoxigenic species and presence of
   mycotoxins (aflatoxins B-1, B-2, G(1) and G(2,,) zearalenone and
   ochratoxin A) were evaluated in samples of freshly harvested corn
   collected at different locations in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil,
   during 1992. Invasion of grains by the potentially mycotoxigenic genera
   Fusarium and Penicillium was rather high. The genus Aspergillus was also
   isolated but at a lower frequency compared with the other two genera.
   The Aspergillus species detected were: A. versicolor, A. flavus, A.
   niger, A. alutaceus, A. wentii, Eurotium chevalieri, Eurotium rubrum,
   Eurotium amstelodami and Eurotium repens. Eight Penicillium species were
   recovered, namely: P.variabile, P. funiculosum, P. citrinum, P.
   pinophilum, P. brevicompactum, P. canescens, P. raistrikii and P.
   spinulosum. Four of the seventeen A. flavus isolates were found to be
   either B1 or B1, and B2 aflatoxin producers. Despite the presence of
   potentially toxigenic fungi, zearalenone ( produced by Fusarium spp.),
   aflatoxin (produced by A. glavus/A. parasiticus) acid ochratoxin A
   (produced by Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp.) were not detected in
   the grain samples. The occurrence of non-toxigenic strains, unfavorable
   field and environmental conditions, interactions between fungal species
   and resistant varieties of corn are some of the factors that, alone or
   in combination, may explain the absence of mycotoxins in corn harvested
   during 1992 in the State of Sao Paulo.}},

   the occupational therapy literature, common ones include collaboration
   with other professionals and incorporation of one or more aspects of the
   diabetes regimen into the person's life-style.
   When addressing persons who have both diabetes and vision loss,
   therapists consider their own knowledge base as well as the persons'
   needs in managing their diabetes. Treatment ideas include enhancing the
   visual environment or incorporating tactile and auditory feedback with

Abstract = {{Mice homozygous for the recessive limb deformity (Id) mutation display
   both limb and renal defects. The limb defects, oligodactyly and
   syndactyly, have been traced to improper differentiation of the apical
   ectodermal ridge (AER) and shortening of the anteroposterior limb axis.
   The renal defects, usually aplasia, are thought to result from failure
   of ureteric bud outgrowth. Since the Id locus gives rise to multiple RNA
   isoforms encoding several different proteins (termed formins), we wished
   to understand their role in the formation of these organs. Therefore, we
   first examined the embryonic expression patterns of the four major Id
   mRNA isoforms. Isoforms I, II and III (all containing a basic amino
   terminus) are expressed in dorsal root ganglia, cranial ganglia and the
   developing kidney including the ureteric bud. Isoform IV (containing an
   acidic amino terminus) is expressed in the notochord, the somites, the
   apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb bud and the developing kidney
   including the ureteric bud. Using a lacZ reporter assay in transgenic
   mice, we show that this differential expression of isoform IV results
   from distinct regulatory sequences upstream of its first exon. These
   expression patterns suggest that all four isoforms may be involved in
   ureteric bud outgrowth, while isoform IV may be involved in AER
   differentiation. To define further the developmental consequences of the
   Id limb defect, we analyzed the expression of a number of genes thought
   to play a role in limb development. Most significantly, we find that
   although the AERs of Id limb buds express several AER markers, they do
   not express detectable levels of fibroblast growth factor 4 (fgf-4),
   which has been proposed to be the AER signal to the mesoderm. Thus we
   conclude that one or more formins are necessary to initiate and/or
   maintain fgf-l production in the distal limb. Since Id limbs form distal
   structures such as digits, we further conclude that while fgf-l is
   capable of supporting distal limb outgrowth in manipulated limbs, it is
   not essential for distal outgrowth in normal limb development. In
   addition,ld limbs show a severe decrease in the expression of several
   mesodermal markers, including sonic hedgehog (shh), a marker for the
   polarizing region and Hoxd-12, a marker for posterior mesoderm. We
   propose that incomplete differentiation of the AER in Id limb buds leads
   to reduction of polarizing activity and defects along the
   anteroposterior axis.}},

   sampling of adults were developed. There was a functional relationship
   between the variance and mean of untransformed froghopper counts, but
   this was eliminated by the Healy and Taylor transformation. Samples
   using 5 consecutive stems per sampling unit minimized the variance:mean
   ratios for all sample sizes used to sample symptoms. The Iwao patchiness
   regression was the only appropriate model for symptom data, and the
   slope indicated that damage is distributed uniformly between samples.

Abstract = {{Models of physical systems range from those of initial individual
   cognition to mathematical representations on a computer which are
   accepted as the developed find models. It is conjectured that a
   formalization of the qualitative cognitive models will help us to
   understand how they are formed and will eventually help us to produce
   better computer models. The structure of these models would provide
   qualitative descriptions and explanations of behaviour which could be
   assimilated by non-specialists. It is argued that cognitive models
   should be produced with an awareness of the possible form of the final
   computer model. To illustrate this, a case study of the development of
   the cognitive and computer models of a naturally parallel physical
   process is presented. This early work is part of the broader goal of
   producing an appropriate computing environment through which various
   models and techniques are combined for producing explanations. A
   procedure for developing models from the primitive stage to computer
   implementation is suggested. Theories in cognitive science and research
   on mental models are briefly discussed. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{The species flock of haplochromine cichlid fishes in Lake Victoria is
   one of the most extensive and recent radiations of vertebrates known.
   Over the past 15 years, however, many of the haplochromine cichlid
   species have vanished, and predation by the introduced Nile perch (Lates
   niloticus) is thought to be one of the most significant factors
   underlying this mass extinction. Information on the hypoxia tolerance of
   haplochromines from Late Victoria is valuable for predicting their
   response to the increasing anoxia within the lake and in evaluating
   their potential use of low oxygen regions as refugia from predation by
   introduced Nile perch. This study examines the response of nine cichlid
   species from Lake Victoria (eight indigenous, one introduced) and three
   cichlid species from Late Tanganyika to different low-oxygen regimes
   under laboratory conditions. Fish were exposed to progressive and acute
   hypoxia, with and without access to the surface. All species used
   aquatic surface respiration at very low P-O2. Buccal bubble holding and
   active swimming at the surface during aquatic surface respiration were
   used by many species and may serve to increase its efficiency.
   Lacustrine cichlids endemic to Lake Victoria were more tolerant of
   hypoxia than ecologically similar species from Lake Tanganyika. The two
   species ex;unmined that are widespread in a variety of aquatic habitats
   exhibited a relatively high tolerance to hypoxia with well-developed
   aquatic surface respiration and bubble-holding capabilities and no loss
   of equilibrium during progressive hypoxia. Species strongly affected by
   recent changes in Lake Victoria were not consistently poorer in their
   hypoxia tolerance than less-affected species. But, two of the
   less-affected species are inhabitants of shallow, rocky habitats, an
   environment that may be both rich in oxygen and roell defended against
   the Nile perch because of the structural complexity of the rocky,
   littoral area. The generally high levels of hypoxia tolerance in the
   cichlid species examined from Lake Victoria suggest that these species
   potentially could use low-oxygen refugia to escape Nile perch predation.
   Some species that are thought to have disappeared may currently inhabit
   low-oxygen refugia that have not been adequately sampled}},

Abstract = {{The conception of a heat function, just like the stream function used in

   been introduced to visualize the convective heat transfer or the flow of
   energy around a sphere when the sphere is either being cooled or heated
   by a stream of fluid flowing around it. The heat function is developed
   in a spherical polar coordinate and is used to generate the heat lines
   around the sphere. The heat lines essentially show the magnitude and
   direction of energy transfer around the sphere with and without the
   existence of a finite radial velocity at the surface. The steady state
   hydrodynamic field around the sphere is numerically obtained up to a
   maximum Reynolds number of 100 and the corresponding thermal field has
   been obtained by solving the steady state energy equation. The field
   properties thus obtained are utilized to form the heat function, which
   becomes an effective tool for visualization of convective heat transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Using the theoretically calculated point-defect total-energy values of
   Baraff and Schluter in GaAs, an amphoteric-defect model has been
   proposed by Walukiewicz to explain a large number of experimental
   results. The suggested amphoteric-defect system consists of two
   point-defect species capable of transforming into each other: the doubly
   negatively charged Ga vacancy T-Ga(2-) and the triply positively charged
   defect complex (AS(Ga) + V-As)(3+), with As-Ga being the antisite defect
   of an As atom occupying a Ga site and V-As being an As vacancy. When
   present in sufficiently high concentrations, the amphoteric defect
   system V-Ga(2-)/(As-Ga + V-As)(3+) is supposed to be able to pin the
   GaAs Fermi level at approximately the E(v) + 0.6 eV level position,
   which requires that the net free energy of the V-Ga/(AS(Ga) + V-As)
   defect system to be minimum at the same Fermi-level position. We have
   carried out a quantitative study of the net energy of this defect system
   in accordance with the individual point-defect total-energy results of
   Baraff and Schluter, and found that the minimum net defect-system-energy
   position is located at about the E(v) + 1.2 eV level position instead of
   the needed E(v) + 0.6 eV position. Therefore, the validity of the
   amphoteric-defect model is in doubt. We have proposed a simple criterion
   for determining the Fermi-level pinning position in the deeper part of
   the GaAs band gap due to two oppositely charged point-defect species,
   which should be useful in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has demonstrated the advantages of ultrathin slab gel
   electrophoresis for fluorescence-based automated DNA sequence analysis.
   The increased heat transfer efficiency of the thin (typically 50-100 mu
   m) gels permits higher electric fields to be employed with concomitant
   increases in separation speed. Issues arise, however, in introducing the
   laser beam used for fluorescence excitation into the thin gels. This
   paper presents methods for bringing the excitation beam into the thin
   gels from the side. This permits a low-power air-cooled argon ion laser
   source to be utilized and produces much lower fluorescence and
   scattering background than alternative approaches. The beam is
   effectively trapped between the plates due to the high efficiency of
   reflection at the low-angle grazing incidence of the beam. A theoretical
   model describing beam throughput was developed which agrees web with
   experimental observations. In this model, attenuation of the beam
   intensity is attributed to four factors: aperturing at the entrance of
   the gel; reflective losses upon entrance into the gel; scattering during
   transmission through the gel; and reflective losses occurring upon
   successive `'bounces'' of the beam from the gel-glass interface during
   propagation of the beam.}},

Abstract = {{Droloxifene (DRO), an estrogen antagonist/agonist, has been shown to
   possess estrogen-like effects in inhibiting bone turnover leading to
   cancellous bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The purpose of this
   study was to determine the effects of DRO on cortical bone turnover in
   OVX rats. Sprague Dawley female rats at 5 months of age were
   sham-operated (sham, n=8) and orally treated with vehicle, or OVX (n=56)
   and orally treated with either vehicle, DRO at 0.1, 1, 5, or 10
   mg/kg/day, or 17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE) at 3 or 30 mu g/kg/day for
   4 weeks. Static and dynamic cortical bone histomorphometry was performed
   on double fluorescent labeled, undecalcified cross sections of tibial
   diaphyses (proximal to the tibiofibular junction). There were no
   significant differences in tibial diaphyseal cross sectional area,
   marrow cavity area, and cortical bone area between groups after 4 weeks
   of administration. Periosteal mineralizing surface, mineral apposition
   rate, and bone formation rate-surface referent and endocortical eroded
   surface increased significantly, while endocortical mineral apposition
   rate and bone formation rate-surface referent increased nonsignificantly
   in OVX controls compared to sham controls. Treatment with DRO at doses
   of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day dose-dependently attenuated the OVX-induced
   higher bone formation indices in both the periosteal and endocortical
   surfaces and higher bone resorption index in the endocortical surface.
   At the highest dose (10 mg/kg/day), DRO completely inhibited the
   increases in bone formation and resorption indices in OVX rats.
   Similarly, EE at 30 mu g/kg/day inhibited the increase in periosteal and
   endocortical bone formation and endocortical bone resorption associated
   with estrogen deficiency in rats, while at 3 mu g/kg/day, EE decreased
   only periosteal mineral apposition rate in OVX rats. Our results
   indicated that DRO prevented OVX-induced higher bone turnover on
   endocortical surfaces and higher bone formation in periosteal surfaces
   of tibial diaphyses in an identical manner to EE. Therefore, we
   concluded that DRO is an estrogen agonist on cortical bone in

Abstract = {{In this study, we measured the soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R)
   level to evaluate the cellular immune status in 61 patients with
   different types of glomerular diseases; 40 healthy volunteers were used
   as control. All patients with glomerular diseases had levels of serum
   sIL-2R significantly higher than those of the controls (766 +/- 59 vs
   280 +/- 23 U/ml; p < 0.05). Even patients with normal renal function
   still had higher serum sIL-2R levels than the controls, no matter to
   which subgroups they belonged (primary glomerulonephritis, lupus
   nephritis or diabetic nephropathy). Serum sIL-2R levels were similar
   among the three subgroups. The serum levels of sIL-2R correlated well
   with age and were significantly higher in older patients, although this
   was not observed in the control group. Serum sIL-2R levels were
   significantly higher in patients with active urinary sediment and in
   patients with impaired renal function and showed a significant negative
   correlation with creatinine clearance (r = -0.56; p < 0.05). Although
   urinary and serum sIL-2R levels were quite well correlated, (r = 0.35; p
   < 0.05), the urinary levels of sIL-2R did not differ in patients with
   different disease activity or different renal functions although they
   had a significant correlation with 24-hour urinary protein (r = 0.39; p
   < 0.05). Patients with nephrotic syndrome also had higher urinary sIL-2R
   levels than other patients (529 +/- 106 vs 280 +/- 31 U/ml; p < 0.05).
   We conclude that greater T-cell activation might contribute to the
   pathogenesis of different glomerulonephritis entities, and serum levels
   of sIL-2R can serve as a useful clinical marker of glomerulonephritis
   activity. Renal function influenced the serum levels of sIL-2R
   significantly. This factor must be considered when we interpret the
   data. Urinary sIL-2R levels did not reflect the disease activity as
   well. This might be due to the secondary influence of the extent of the
   glomerular protein leak. Further investigation is needed to define the
   exact excretory pathway of this substance.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic exercise may be used as a safe, therapeutic approach to reduce
   sympathetic nerve activity at rest and thus may be beneficial for
   individuals with hypertension. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that
   a single bout of mild to moderate dynamic exercise would decrease
   cardiac sympathetic tonus at rest. We designed two experimental
   protocols to test this hypothesis in male spontaneously hypertensive
   rats. In protocol 1 (n=6) cardiac sympathetic tonus and parasympathetic
   tonus were determined before and after a single bout of dynamic
   exercise. We developed protocol 2 (n=5) to determine the component of
   the autonomic nervous system responsible for the postexercise reduction
   in heart rate. Rats were instrumented with catheters inserted into the
   descending aorta for measurements of arterial pressure, mean arterial
   pressure, and heart rate and into the jugular vein for infusion of
   drugs. A single bout of mild to moderate dynamic treadmill exercise (12
   m/min, 10\% grade for 42+/-1 minutes, representing approximately 74\% to
   79\% of maximal heart rate) resulted in a postexercise reduction in mean
   arterial pressure (163+/-7 to 149+/-5 mm Hg; P<.05). Associated with the
   postexercise by potension was a reduction in sympathetic and
   parasympathetic tonus (47+/-12\% and 71+/-12\%, respectively). The
   reduction in heart rate during the early recovery phase was due to a
   withdrawal of sympathetic tonus, because beta(1)-adrenergic receptor
   blockade significantly enhanced the postexercise reduction in heart
   rate, and muscarinic-cholinergic receptor blockade did not affect the
   postexercise decrease in heart rate until 20 minutes after exercise.
   These results demonstrate that (1) sympathetic tonus and parasympathetic
   tonus are attenuated after a single bout of dynamic exercise and (2) the
   reduction in sympathetic tonus and parasympathetic tonus mediated
   cardiodeceleration during the early recovery period.}},

   the pancreas of the embryo at the 15-mm stage, and were also detected in
   the vitellointestinal duct of the yolk stalk at the 20-mm stage. These
   cells were polymorphic, with occasional processes that were sometimes
   directed toward the vascular wall or into the cavity of the
   vitellointestinal duct. At the 34-mm stage, immunostained cells could
   also be found in the proximal part of the spiral intestine and, by the
   74-mm stage, immuno-positive cells were present in the gastric mucosa.
   In the gut and pancreas, the cells gradually increased in number with
   development, whereas in the vitellointestinal duct and internal yolk
   sac, they decreased and seemed to disappear following hatching. Thus, in
   juveniles, the distribution of the neuropeptide Y-like-immunoreactive
   cells in the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system had attained that
   of adults. Electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry demonstrated that,

Abstract = {{Stochastic timed Petri nets are developed to evaluate the relative
   performance of distributed shared memory models for scalable
   multiprocessors, using multithreaded processors as building blocks. Four
   shared memory models are evaluated: the Sequential Consistency (SC)
   model by Lamport (1979), the Weak Consistency (WC) model by Dubois et
   al, (1986), the Processor Consistency (PC) model by Goodman (1989), and
   the Release Consistency (RC) model by Gharachorloo et al, (1990). We
   assumed a scalable network with a sufficient bandwidth to absorb the
   increased traffic from multithreading, coherent caches, and memory event
   reordering, The embedded Markov chains are solved to reveal the
   performance attributes, Under saturated conditions, we find that
   multithreading contributes more than 50\% of the performance
   improvement, while the improvement from memory consistency models varies
   between 20\% to 40\% of the total performance gain, Petri net models are
   effective to predict the performance of processors with a larger number
   of contexts than that can be simulated in previous benchmark studies.
   The accuracy of these memory performance models was validated with the
   simulation results from Stanford University, Our analytical results
   reveal the lowest performance of the SC model amongst four memory
   consistency models, The PC model requires to use larger write buffers,
   while the WC and RC models require smaller write buffers. The PC model
   may perform even lower than the SC model, if a small buffer was used,
   The performance of the WC model depends heavily on the synchronization
   rate in user code. For a low synchronization rate, the WC model performs
   as well as the RC model, With sufficient multithreading and network
   bandwidth, the RC model shows the best performance among the four

Abstract = {{Equations of motion are derived for general slung load systems,
   Systematic approaches have not previously been studied for deriving
   slung load dynamic models, but an interest in simulation, analysis, and
   control for slung loads carried by two or more helicopters motivates
   attention to this topic, Slung load systems are approximated as several
   rigid bodies connected by suspensions consisting of straight line cables
   and links which can be assumed elastic or inelastic and which transmit
   force only along the link Equations for the general system are obtained
   from the Newton-Euler equations with the introduction of generalized
   speeds, Several systematic formulations are given which generalize
   previous case-specific results from the slung load literature or occur
   in the existing literature on the dynamics of multibody systems, A novel
   formulation is derived for inelastic suspensions from the elastic
   suspension equations and in which the constraint fortes appear
   explicitly, The result is computationally more efficient for slung loads
   than the other formulations, is readily combined with the elastic
   suspension equations in a single simulation, and is readily applied to
   complex dual and multilift systems. The new formulation is applied to a
   4-body dual lift system, Simulation equations are given along with a
   review of issues related to simulation of the dynamics, and numerical

   that was further modified by inserting a sequence of 24 bp. This
   competitive PCR assay system can be used for the quantification of
   HTLV-I and HTLV-II proviral DNA as demonstrated by using HTLV-I- and
   HTLV-II-infected cell lines and/or patient material. We determined the
   HTLV-II proviral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of
   11 Italian injecting drug users (IDUs) infected by this virus and in
   PBMCs of 10 seropositive Amerindian and Central African individuals from

   the number of HTLV-II proviral sequences in the PBMCs of Italian drug
   abusers, ranging from 5-10 to 16,239 copies/10(5) cells. There was no
   clear-cut correlation between proviral load, CD8 count, stage of HIV-1
   infection, and therapy. A considerable variation in HTLV-II proviral

Abstract = {{Corpora amylacea (CA) are glycoproteinaceous inclusions that accumulate
   in the human central nervous system during normal ageing, and to an even
   greater extent in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative
   disorders. They are particularly prominent in subpial and subependymal
   regions, and are most commonly located within astrocytes and their
   processes. We previously demonstrated that human CA share many
   tinctorial and histochemical properties in common with Gomori-positive
   cytoplasmic granules which accumulate in periventricular astrocytes of
   the ageing vertebrate brain and in rat astroglial cultures exposed to
   the sulphydryl agent, cysteamine (CSH). In the present study, long-term
   exposure of neonatal rat astrocyte cultures to CSH resulted in the
   formation of large spherical, PAS-positive cytoplasmic inclusions which
   are highly reminiscent of, if not identical to, human CA. As in the case
   of human CA and Gomori-positive astrocyte granules, the CSH-induced
   CA-lilte inclusions exhibit non-enzymatic peroxidase activity and
   consistent immunolabelling with antibodies directed against the
   mitochondrial protein, sulphite oxidase. Taken together, our findings
   suggest that progressive mitochondrial damage and macroautophagy play an
   important role in the biogenesis of CA (and Gomori-positive granules) in
   astrocytes of the ageing periventricular brain.}},

Abstract = {{The murine pre-B cell line 70Z/3 responds to lipopolysaccharide by
   upregulating the surface expression of kappa (kappa) light chain through
   activation of the transcription factor NF kappa B. Interleukin-4 (IL-4),
   a T cell cytokine, is a known inhibitor of some LPS-mediated events. We
   investigated whether IL-4 could inhibit the up-regulation of kappa light
   chain and activation of NF kappa B by LPS in 70Z/3. IL-4 partially
   inhibited both the LPS-induced expression of kappa light chain and also
   the activation of NF kappa B as judged by an NF kappa B reporter gene
   assay. Additionally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed
   this effect on LPS-induced NF kappa B DNA binding activity in the
   nucleus. Surprisingly, proteolytic degradation of I kappa B alpha
   (MAD3), a prerequisite for NF kappa B activation, was unaffected by
   IL-4, implying that this cytokine inhibits some subsequent undefined
   event in the activation of NF kappa B. IL-4 was also found partially to
   inhibit NF kappa B activity induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta). These results indicate
   that there may be a common mechanism for the well-documented
   anti-inflammatory effects of IL-4 and that this mechanism involves the
   transcription factor NF kappa B.}},

Abstract = {{An anthropometric mannequin implemented in robotic modelling software
   has proved very useful in the simulation of static and semi-dynamic
   reachability envelopes. Its prediction of working postures has been
   verified to some extent during neutral buoyancy trials. While a robotic
   solution is useful for static analyses or rough estimates of simple
   movements, more realistic movement strategies need to be identified
   directly measuring astronauts' in-orbit behaviour.
   A set of experiments is to be performed as part of the EUROMIR `95
   mission to the MIR orbiting station in which dynamic posture (i.e.
   posture and movement) measurements will be taken using the ELITE system.
   The data and analyses of the data will be used to animate the Alenia
   anthopometric mannequin and to develop movement algorithms more similar
   to those of a person in microgravity than the robotic solutions
   currently employed.
   This paper presents the experiments to be performed and the changes to
   Alenia's mannequin that will allow the model to effect movements
   according to the experimental results, It is aimed at expanding the
   dialog between the biomechanical and human factors disciplines started
   in this experiment to other potential end-users of the experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Rheumatologists usually recommend monthly blood monitoring when patients
   with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are treated with slow-acting
   anti-rheumatic drugs (SAARDs). Is monthly monitoring needed or could its
   frequency be reduced? We audited the opinions of UK rheumatologists and
   reviewed clinical experience at three centres. To ascertain the interval
   at which patients are monitored and the determinants of monitoring
   policy we sent a questionnaire to 193 consultant rheumatologists; 143
   (74\%) replied. The majority use monthly monitoring for most SAARDs
   except sulphasalazine, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. There is
   extensive variation, which is not related to the type of rheumatology
   unit or whether a shared scheme with general practitioners is used.
   Reviewing experience in 390 patients treated with SAARDs at three
   adjacent rheumatology units in London showed that haematological adverse
   reactions were infrequent. During 1560 patient-years of treatment
   involving 18 720 monthly monitoring visits there were 13 haematological
   adverse reactions(ll thrombocytopenias and two leucopenias). Five
   thrombocytopenias occurred in the first 6 months of therapy; two were
   gradual and three developed more rapidly over 1-2 months. Six
   thrombocytopenias developed after 6 months of treatment; five occurred
   gradually over 5 months or more and one borderline low platelet count
   was seen once. The two leucopenias were borderline low white cell counts
   occurring gradually over 3-6 months. Such frequent monitoring is
   expensive. The total cost of monitoring 390 patients for 1560
   patient-years was \$420 000. The cost of detecting each adverse reaction
   was \$32 000. Three-monthly monitoring when therapy is established after
   an initial stabilizing period would have identified seven out of eight
   late adverse reactions. Monitoring policies are mainly based on clinical
   consensus with few prospective studies of their value; they need
   re-evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Silver staining was used to detect amplified microsatellite loci from
   the bovine genome. The standard silver-staining procedure was modified
   to allow more direct control in the development of signals.
   Microsatellites were analysed, to compare the silver-staining technique
   and the direct incorporation of a radioactive tracer. With silver
   staining, levels of sensitivity were achieved that are typical of those
   with radioisotopic detection. Also, silver staining is a cheaper
   process, is less hazardous to operators and the environment, and can be
   performed in laboratories without radioisotopic facilities. A
   significant advantage of silver staining is the speed of the process,
   producing results of a typing in 1 day.}},

Abstract = {{In plant species that are pollinated by a variety of animal species,
   spatial and temporal variability in the taxonomic composition of those
   pollinators may cause spatial and temporal variability in selection on
   floral traits. While temporal variation in pollinator composition has
   been widely reported, spatial variability, particularly on a local
   scale, has been studied less frequently; nevertheless, available
   evidence suggests that local spatial variability may be a widespread
   feature of plant-pollinator interactions. In addition, the causes of
   this spatial variability are poorly known. This study was undertaken to
   quantify variability in the taxonomic composition of pollinators
   visiting local populations of black mustard, Brassica nigra, and to
   determine some of the causes of this variability. Simultaneous
   observations were conducted in seven pairs of black mustard populations.
   The members of each pair were in close spatial proximity but differed in
   number of plants. Larger plant populations were visited by significantly
   greater numbers of honey bees and significantly fewer small bees than
   small populations on a per-plant basis. There was also a trend toward
   greater syrphid fly visitation in small populations. The increased
   numbers of honey bees at large plant populations is probably due to
   their ability to recruit long distances to the most rewarding plant
   populations. The lower number of small bees at large plant populations
   may be due to competition from honey bees and/or spreading a constant
   number of small bees over the larger number of plants in large
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Anatomical, neurophysiological, and neurochemical evidence supports the
   notion of parallel basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor systems. We
   developed a neural network model for the functioning of these systems
   during normal and parkinsonian movement. Parkinson's disease (PD), which
   results predominantly from nigrostriatal pathway damage, is used as a
   window to examine basal ganglia function. Simulations of dopamine
   depletion produce motor impairments consistent with motor deficits
   observed in PD that suggest the basal ganglia play a role in motor
   initiation and execution, and sequencing of motor programs. Stereotaxic
   lesions in the model's globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus suggest
   that these lesions, although reducing some PD symptoms, may constrain
   the repertoire of available movements. It is proposed that paradoxical
   observations of basal ganglia responses reported in the literature may
   result from regional functional neuronal specialization, and the
   non-uniform distributions of neurochemicals in the basal ganglia. It is
   hypothesized that dopamine depletion produces smaller-than-normal
   pallidothalamic gating signals that prevent rescalability of these
   signals to control variable movement speed, and that in PD can produce
   smaller-than-normal movement amplitudes.}},

   acid (AA), a threefold increase in the amount of free salicylic acid
   (SA) in the treated leaves was observed 3 h after treatment. The highest
   level of free SA was measured 6 h after treatment, reaching 3.21 gig
   fresh weight compared to 0.15 g/g fresh weight in controls. The levels
   of conjugated SA in the treated leaves increased up to 51 g/g fresh
   weight 3 days after treatment compared to 0.83 g/g fresh weight in
   controls. Four days after treatment with AA the upper leaves became
   resistant to the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans,
   but no accumulation of SA was observed. This systemic protection was
   observed in plants treated with AA at concentrations as low as 10 ppm
   and is unlikely to have arisen from AA translocated in the plant. In
   addition, treatment with AA protected potato plants against the early
   blight pathogen, Alternaria solani, indicating a broader spectrum of
   protection. Local but not systemic accumulation of a
   pathogenesis-related (PR)1-like protein was observed 24 h after
   treatment with AA. Application of SA on potato leaves did not confer
   resistance against P. infestans, but a local accumulation of a PR1-like
   protein was observed 24 h after treatment. Younger leaves of healthy
   susceptible and resistant potato plants contained higher levels of SA
   than older leaves, and this gradient correlated with their natural
   resistance to P. infestans. In general, cultivars showing field
   resistance contained higher amounts of conjugated SA than did
   susceptible cultivars.}},

   metasedimentary rocks, deposited during the final stages of magmatic and
   tectonic accretion within the greenstone-granite Uchi Subprovince to the
   north at around 2720 to 2710 Ma. The sedimentary rocks were intruded by
   a suite of calc-alkalic plutons at 2698 Ma. Major regional deformation,
   amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphism, anatexis, and emplacement
   of an extensive peraluminous granitic suite culminated at 2691 Ma. Late
   episodes of metamorphism, metasomatism, and emplacement of pegmatites
   occurred locally at circa 2680 and 2669 Ma. In contrast, the Winnipeg
   River Subprovince to the south consists of widespread tonalitic suites
   formed mainly between 3200 and 2800 Ma and granodioritic to granitic
   intrusions formed between 2710 and 2690 Ma. Metamorphism occurred at
   around 2710 Ma in southern domains, and a distinct granulite facies
   event at around 2680 Ma affected central and northern domains of the
   Winnipeg River Subprovince. The rapid sequence of events recorded in the
   ERS supports the notion that metamorphism was caused by thermal
   perturbations related to injection of granitic magmas. These melts were

Abstract = {{Arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis has recently been shown to be an
   effective procedure with significant advantages when properly indicated.
   We report on the results of arthroscopic ankle fusion in 16 patients
   with idiopathic or posttraumatic osteoarthritis and rheumatoid disease.
   We used standard ankle arthroscopic technique and simple noninvasive
   distraction with hanging weights. All 16 patients had a successful
   fusion at an average of 9.5 weeks postoperatively. Complications
   included 1 lateral cutaneous neuroma, and 1 patient who required removal
   of screws because of superficial pain. Postoperative evaluation showed
   complete resolution of pain in 14 of 16 patients and significant
   improvement in gait. Fourteen of 16 patients were completely satisfied
   with the result and cosmesis, and only 1 patient required shoe
   modification. These results substantiate previous reports that
   arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis is successful, and where indicated, has
   significant advantages over the open technique.}},

Abstract = {{Although elderly patients are accounted for in all large series of major
   hepatic resections, the role of age as a determinant of outcome remains
   unclear. At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, we review a series of 20 major
   hepatectomies for neoplasia performed in patients older than 66 years of
   age (4 of them greater than or equal to 80 years old) over a 5-year
   period. A retrospective comparison was conducted with a group of 22
   hepatectomies for malignancy performed in 20 patients younger than 59
   years of age during the same time period. The younger group had a
   significantly greater degree of liver resected (12 trisegmentectomies vs
   3). Although one operative death (5\% mortality) was observed in the
   elderly group, no statistically significant difference was noted, when
   compared to the younger group (Chi-square, P = 0.48). Likewise, no
   significant difference in the complication rate (20\% vs 33\%) was
   noticed (Chi-square, P = 0.8). Severe postoperative liver dysfunction
   was present in 2 cases (10\%) in the elderly group and one (4\%) in the
   younger group. These patients underwent a right trisegmentectomy; (TS).
   Nine patients from each group were resected without red blood cell
   transfusion. We conclude that major hepatic resection in elderly
   patients without severe comorbid disease is a safe procedure that is not
   associated with an increased perioperative morbidity or mortality rate.}},

Abstract = {{Gender and kinship were examined with regard to caregivers' use of
   informal and formal support and to two models of support (substitution
   or supplementation). Three groups of caregivers of a demented relative
   living at home-husbands, wives, and adult daughters-were compared on
   measures of both informal and formal support. The gender hypothesis
   deals with the similarities among caregivers of the same gender with
   respect to support. The kinship hypothesis refers to the similarities
   among caregivers having the same kinship with the carereceiver. The
   gender hypothesis was confirmed for informal informational support while
   the kinship hypothesis was supported for informal conflictual support.
   For most of the comparisons, the three groups of caregivers shared more
   similarities than differences. The interchangeability between informal
   and formal support seems to fall under the perspective of kinship
   because the daughter group is the only one where a model of
   supplementation was observed. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Conditions associated with nausea and vomiting, such as motion sickness
   or side effects of medications, are commonly associated with a clinical
   picture consistent with parasympathetic activation and sympathetic
   withdrawal. It can be postulated, therefore, that vestibular stimulation
   contributes to sympathetic withdrawal. To test this hypothesis five
   normal volunteers, 24-33 years old, were studied during caloric
   vestibular stimulation while monitoring muscle sympathetic nerve
   activity directly through a needle electrode placed in a peroneal nerve.
   The ear was irrigated with water at a flow rate of 450 ml/min and 37
   degrees C. The water temperature was sequentially lowered by 7 degrees C
   intervals until intolerable side effects developed or a temperature of
   16 degrees C was reached. Nystagmus was induced in all subjects, but
   heart rate, blood pressure, muscle sympathetic nerve activity and plasma
   norepinephrine levels did not change significantly during or after
   caloric stimulation, even when the subjects felt dizzy and nauseated. No
   evidence of sympathetic withdrawal was observed in any subject either by
   muscle sympathetic nerve activity or plasma norepinephrine measurements.
   In conclusion, we have found that selective vestibular stimulation is
   not accompanied by significant changes in the sympathetic nervous system
   function. In particular, no sympathetic withdrawal was observed. It
   could be argued that lack of sympathetic stimulation is an inadequate
   response to the symptoms associated with caloric stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{Macrosocial theories of democratization point to the pluralism attendant
   on industrialization, class conflicts and alliances, the state and its
   social environment, and transnational linkages as influential in the
   growth of political and civil rights. Unfortunately, these theories
   neglect the ecological and technological histories of many contemporary
   states. Proto-modernity, defined as a rich demographic and institutional
   inheritance rooted in the preindustrial past, is theorized to lay the
   foundations of pluralism and class structure, in essence allowing some
   states to democratize more easily than others. In this longitudinal,
   cross-national analysis using data from a maximum of 83 countries, I
   find robust support for the importance of modernity and proto-modernity
   to the growth of democracy. By contrast, results are inconclusive on
   whether stratification affects democratization.}},

Abstract = {{To study the in vitro susceptibility of peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells (PBMC) to hepatitis C virus (HCV), we incubated cells from healthy
   donors with HCV-positive sera. Using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization,
   the genomic viral RNA was detected in PBMC and in their supernatants
   until 25 days post-incubation. The PBMC of the different donors were not
   all permissive to HCV, but results were more constantly positive when
   cells from four donors were pooled. Quantification of the genomic viral
   RNA by the branched-DNA assay showed a decrease in the HCV RNA
   concentration during the first week of culture followed by a peak during
   the second or third week, and also an increase in the total amount of
   viral RNA in the inoculated cells. Although HCV RNA could be detected in
   the supernatants by RT-PCR, the concentration was very low. Using a
   sense-specific RT-PCR method, the HCV negative-strand was also detected
   in the cells but not in the supernatants. In two experiments PBMC were
   successfully infected using HCV-positive culture supernatants, therefore
   suggesting that infectious particles can be produced in this system. Our
   findings demonstrate that PBMC are permissive for HCV replication in
   vitro but the replication level is very low. The HCV RNA concentration
   measured in PBMC of 10 chronically infected patients was not
   significantly higher than the maximal concentration obtained in PBMC
   infected in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{The chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin coronatine is produced by several
   Pseudomonas syringae pathovars, including glycinea, morsprunorum,
   atropurpurea, and the closely related tomato and maculicola. To date,
   all coronatine-producing pv. glycinea, morsprunorum, and atropurpurea
   strains that have been examined carry the gene cluster that controls
   toxin production on a large plasmid. In the present study the genomic
   location of the coronatine gene cluster was determined for
   coronatine-producing strains of the pv. tomato-maculicola group by
   subjecting their genomic DNA to pulsed-field electrophoresis and
   Southern blot analysis with a hybridization probe from the coronatine
   gene cluster. The cluster was chromosomally borne in 10 of the 22
   strains screened. These 10 strains infected both crucifers and tomatoes
   but could not use sorbitol as a sole source of carbon. The remaining 12
   coronatine-producing strains had plasmid-borne toxin gene clusters and
   used sorbitol as a carbon source, Only one of these strains was
   pathogenic on both crucifers and tomatoes; the remainder infected just
   tomatoes. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the pv,
   tomato-maculicola coronatine gene clusters was performed with probes
   from P. syringae pv, tomato DC3000, a tomato and crucifer pathogen.
   Although the coronatine cluster appeared, in general, to be highly
   conserved across the pv, tomato-maculicola group, there were significant
   differences between plasmid-borne and chromosomally borne genes. The
   extensively studied coronatine cluster of pv, glycinea 4180 closely
   resembled the plasmid borne clusters of the pv, tomato-maculicola group.}},

   beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis. Diagnosis of GAS
   pharyngitis is best accomplished by a throat culture. Penicillin (either
   oral penicillin V or injectable benzathine penicillin) remains the
   treatment of choice, because it is cost effective, has a narrow spectrum
   of activity, has long-standing proven efficacy, and GAS resistant to
   penicillin have not been documented. Various macrolides, oral
   cephalosporins, and other beta-lactam agents are acceptable
   alternatives, particularly in penicillin-allergic individuals.
   The individual who has had an attack of rheumatic fever is at very high
   risk of developing recurrences after subsequent GAS pharyngitis and
   needs continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent such recurrences
   (secondary prevention). The duration of prophylaxis depends on the
   number of previous attacks, the time lapsed since the last attack, the
   risk of exposure to streptococcal infections, the age of the patient,
   and the presence or absence of cardiac involvement. Penicillin is again
   the agent of choice for secondary prophylaxis, but sulfadiazine or
   erythromycin are acceptable alternatives in penicillin-allergic
   individuals.
   This report is an update of a 1988 statement by this committee. It
   expands on the previous statement, includes more recent therapeutic
   modalities, and makes more specific recommendations for the duration of
   secondary prophylaxis.}},
