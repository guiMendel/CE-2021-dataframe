Abstract = {{The characteristics of the inhibitory effect of calcium ion

   (I-125-omega -CTX) binding and on the labeling of I-125-omega -CTX to
   crude membranes from chick brain were investigated. The inhibitory
   effect of Ca2+/CaM depended on the concentrations of free Ca2+ and CaM.
   The IC50 values for free Ca2+ and CaM were about 2.0 x 10(-8) M and 3.0
   mug protein/ml, respectively. The inhibitory effect of Ca2+/CaM was
   attenuated by the CaM antagonists W-7, prenylamine and CaM-kinase II
   fragment (290-309), but not by the calcineurin inhibitor FK506. Ca2+/CaM
   also inhibited the labeling of a 135-kDa band (which was considered to
   be part of N-type Ca2+ channel alpha (1) subunits) with I-125-omega -CTX
   using a cross-linker. These results suggest that Ca2+/CaM affects
   specific 125I-omega -CTX binding sites, probably N-type Ca2+ channel
   alpha (1) subunits, in crude membranes from chick whole brain.}},

Abstract = {{1 The mechanism of vasorelaxation induced by SR33805 was investigated by
   simultaneously monitoring the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ({[}Ca2+](i))
   and force, and by determining level of myosin light chain (MLC)
   phosphorylation in the medial strip of the porcine coronary artery.
   2 SR33805 inhibited the sustained increases in {[}Ca2+](i) and force
   (IC50; 3.2 +/- 1.0 and 49.4 +/- 27.5 nM, respectively) induced by 118 mM
   K+-depolarization. There was about a 10 fold difference in the
   inhibitory potency between {[}Ca2+](i) and force.
   3 SR33805 completely inhibited the {[}Ca2+](i) elevation induced by a
   thromboxane A(2) analogue, U46619 and histamine, at concentrations (1
   muM) higher than those required for the complete inhibition of
   K+-depolarization induced {[}Ca2+](i) elevation.
   4 SR33805 had no effect on the {[}Ca2+](i) elevation induced by
   histamine or caffeine in the absence of extracellular Ca2+
   5 SR33805 caused a leftward shift of the {[}Ca2+](i)-force relationship
   of the contraction induced by cumulative application of extracellular
   Ca2+ during 118 mM K+-depolarization. The relationship between
   {[}Ca2+](i) and MLC phosphorylation also shifted to the left by SR33805,
   while the relationship between MLC phosphorylation and force remained
   unaffected.
   6 In conclusion, SR33805 caused an apparent leftward shift of the
   {[}Ca2+](i)-force relationship, accompanied by a greater degree of MLC
   phosphorylation for a given level of {[}Ca2+](i). The mechanism of this
   leftward shift, however, still remains to be elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoropolymer coatings, particularly those based on polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) resins, have a 35 year history of outstanding
   performance in outdoor applications. However, the chemical inertness of
   PVDF presents challenges to the paint formulator in that it prevents
   adhesion to substrates and makes it difficult to disperse pigments. To
   overcome these difficulties, an acrylic modifier resin is usually added
   to the PVDF resin. The acrylic modifier is traditionally physically
   blended with the PVDF resin to improve coating adhesion and enhance
   pigment dispersion. The physical blending results in a PVDF/acrylic
   mixture on a macro-molecular scale. ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. has
   developed a novel approach to mix the fluoropolymer and acrylic on
   micro-molecular scale. Because of this intimate mixing, and the wide
   latitude of the acrylic and fluoropolymer monomers that can be utilized,
   a wide range of unique properties can be achieved in solvent-base
   dispersion coatings, and water-borne coatings. The unique properties of
   the solvent-base and water-borne coatings are discussed in this paper.

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To examine the association between incidentally discovered
   renal artery stenosis and deterioration of renal function as determined
   by the change in serum creatinine concentration over time.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of consecutive
   patients who underwent aortography for aortoiliac vascular disease.
   Angiograms were reviewed for renal artery stenosis, defined as a
   narrowing of at least 20\% compared with adjacent normal renal artery.
   For patients with at least 180 days of subsequent follow-up, the change
   in serum creatinine concentration per year was compared in patients who
   had or did not have renal artery stenosis.
   RESULTS: Of the 201 patients, 96 (48\%) had some degree of renal artery
   stenosis in one or both renal arteries, including 53 (26\%) who had at
   least one stenosis greater than or equal to 50\% and 40 (20\%) who had
   bilateral stenoses. The only clinical predictor of renal artery stenosis
   was a history of coronary artery disease (odds ratio = 2.0, 95\%
   confidence interval: 1.2 to 3.8, P = 0.001). Among the 174 patients with
   greater than or equal to 180 days of follow-up, there was no
   statistically significant difference (P = 0.88) in the mean change in
   serum creatinine concentration per year in the 78 patients with renal
   artery stenosis (0.06 +/- 0.33 mg/dL per year) as compared with the 96
   patients without renal artery stenosis (0.06 +/- 0.22 mg/dL per year).
   Grouping the patients by the maximal percentage of stenosis did not
   reveal any difference in the mean changes in serum creatinine
   concentration per year.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although renal artery stenosis is a common incidental
   finding in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, it is an
   uncommon cause of progressive renal disease. (C) 2000 by Excerpta

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To clarify the morphologic features of idiopathic submacular
   choroidal neovascularization using optical coherence tomography.
   METHODS: Using optical coherence tomography, we prospectively examined
   17 consecutive eyes (17 patients; eight men, nine women; mean age +/-
   SD, 36.0 +/- 9.3 years) with idiopathic submacular choroidal
   neovascularisation. During the follow up period (mean +/- SD, 7.5 +/-
   3.8 months), we repeated optical coherence tomography in 15 eyes;
   optical coherence tomography was performed only at the initial
   examination in two eyes that underwent submacular surgery.
   RESULTS: Choroidal neovascularization was observed in the subsensory
   retinal space anterior to the retinal pigment epithelium as a highly or
   moderately reflective mass, which protruded from the retinal pigment
   epithelium in 13 of 17 eyes (protruding type). In four eyes, choroidal
   neovascularization was a highly reflective fusiform mass at the level of
   the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris (fusiform type).
   During the follow-up period, choroidal neovascularization regressed and
   the protruding mass became a highly reflective fusiform mass in 10 of 11
   eyes with the protruding type that underwent repeated examination. In
   three of the 10 eyes, during 5 to 10 months from initial examination,
   the choroidal neovascularization was exacerbated and it again protruded
   into the subsensory retinal space anterior to the retinal pigment
   epithelium. Four eyes with the fusiform type remained the same
   throughout the follow-up period. The overlying retina was thickened and
   had low reflectivity in all 17 eyes at the initial examination. Optical
   coherence tomography identified subretinal fluid in only 11 of the 13
   eyes with protruding type choroidal neovascularization.
   CONCLUSIONS: Optical coherence tomography confirmed subsensory retinal
   location of idiopathic submacular choroidal neovascularization anterior
   to the retinal pigment epithelium. Protruding choroidal
   neovascularization transforms to fusiform tissue at the level of the
   retinal pigment epithelium during the process of regression. Sensory
   retinal edema was always associated with choroidal neovascularization,

Abstract = {{Objectives. To analyze retrospectively the sexual functioning and
   treatment outcome in patients after radiotherapy (RT) for Peyronie's
   disease.
   Methods. During 1982 to 1997, 179 patients with Peyronie's disease were
   treated at our radiation oncology department. One hundred thirty
   patients whose address could be traced were sent a questionnaire about
   their symptoms before RT, treatment outcome, and current sexual
   functioning (the past 4 weeks). One hundred six patients, mean age 59
   years, responded.
   Results. Before RT, 44\% reported painful erections, 97\% penile
   curvature, and 18\% erectile dysfunction. Sixty-nine percent reported
   that after RT, penile pain was diminished and 29\% that penile curvature
   was decreased; 13\% reported improved erections, With respect to their
   current sex life, 51\% reported sometimes or always having problems
   getting an erection and 61\% in maintaining an erection; 36\% never
   experienced spontaneous erections. Fifty-four percent reported not
   having erections rigid enough for sexual activity. Since RT (mean 9
   years), there had been a moderate or severe decrease in sexual interest
   (17\%), sexual activity (41\%), and sexual pleasure (32\%). Overall,
   49\% of patients were dissatisfied with their current sexual
   functioning.
   Conclusions. Low-dose external RT resulted in relief of pain in two
   thirds of patients with Peyronie's disease. An improvement in penile
   curvature was reported in one third of patients. One half of men
   reported problems in getting an erection. The rigidity of erections was
   satisfactory in only 54\%. There was a moderate to severe decrease in
   sexual interest, activity, and pleasure after RT; however, this was
   associated with age, although comorbidity or medications cannot be
   excluded. UROLOGY 56: 1030-1034, 2000, (C) 2000, Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental task for supply-chain managers is to determine
   wholesale-prices. Such determination is a core theme in the marketing
   science literature on distribution channels-which seems to have
   concluded that channel coordination-setting wholesale-prices to maximize
   total channel profit-represents the best of all possible objectives,
   This judgment is based on analyses of bilateral monopoly models, within
   which profit may be redistributed to the benefit of all channel members.
   However, many manufacturers deal with multiple, competing retailers. The
   pure logic of bilateral monopoly models holds in the presence of
   multiple retailers if and only if the manufacturer can price
   discriminate between retailers. Although mechanisms for price
   discrimination exist, in many situations they are infeasible, illegal,
   or both.
   When retailers compete there are two feasible and legally permissible
   methods of achieving channel coordination: an explicit quantity-discount
   schedule or a menu of two-part tariffs. (The latter is derived in detail
   in this paper.) A feasible and legally permissible alternative to
   channel coordination is for the manufacturer to utilize a sophisticated
   Stackelberg two-part tariff-itself a form of a quantity-discount
   schedule. Although such a tariff cannot coordinate the channel, it is
   the best of all possible two-part tariffs from the viewpoint of
   maximizing manufacturer profit.
   Because manufacturers are ultimately interested in their own
   profitability, it follows that channel coordination is
   manufacturer-optimal only if it generates at least as great a level of
   profit for the manufacturer as does noncoordination. In this paper we
   determine the conditions under which a channel-coordinating
   wholesale-price strategy will manufacturer-profit dominate a
   sophisticated Stackelberg two-part tariff: We show that the optimal
   policy is dependent on (1) the retailers' fixed costs, (2) the relative
   size of the retailers, and (3) the degree of inter-retailer competition.
   We conclude that, from the perspective of a manufacturer, channel
   coordination is often undesirable relative to utilizing a
   noncoordinating, sophisticated Stackelberg price-strategy. Therefore,
   channel coordination can no longer be regarded as the ultimate goal
   which supply-chain managers should uncritically pursue.}},

Abstract = {{Broad-tailed and rufous hummingbirds avoid plants and flowers that have
   recently been visited by nectar-robbing bees. However. the cues the
   hummingbirds use to make such choices are not known. To determine the
   proximate cues hummingbirds use to avoid visiting nectar-robbed plants,
   I conducted multiple field experiments and one aviary study using the
   nectar-robbed, hummingbird-pollinated plant Ipomopsis aggregata. In the
   first held experiment, free-flying hummingbirds were presented with
   plants in which I manipulated nectar volume and the presence of
   nectar-robber holes. Hummingbirds visited significantly more plants with
   nectar and probed more available flowers on those plants, regardless of
   the presence of nectar-robber holes. Thus, I hypothesized that
   hummingbirds may avoid robbed plants based on their spatial memory of
   unrewarding plants and/or visual cues that nectar absence provides. In
   an aviary study, I removed spatial cues by re-randomizing the position
   of plants after each hummingbird-foraging bout, but hummingbirds still
   selected plants with nectar. Nectar map provide a visual cue in I.
   aggregata flowers because corollas are translucent, and nectar is
   visible through the side of the corolla. To determine if hummingbirds
   use this visual cue to avoid plants with no nectar, I masked corolla
   translucence in a field study by painting flowers with acrylic paint.
   Hummingbirds still visited significantly more plants with nectar and
   probed more flowers on those plants, whether ol not the corollas were
   painted. These results suggest that hummingbirds use nectar as a
   proximate cue to locate and avoid non-rewarding, nectar-robbed plants,
   even in the absence of spatial cues and simple visual cues.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To measure exhaled nitric oxide (NO) and compare it with lung
   function after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in adult patients. Pulmonary
   dysfunction is sometimes observed after CPB. Impaired production of NO
   may account for this dysfunction.
   Design: Prospective, single-center, observational study.
   Setting: University hospital operating room, intensive care unit.
   Patients: Sixteen adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB.
   Interventions: None except cardiac surgery with OPE.
   Measurements and Main Results: Exhaled NO was measured continuously by
   the chemiluminescence method and was expressed as the peak and mean NO
   concentrations, and the NO output (V-NO). These parameters were
   calculated by averaging four sequential tidal NO values. The data were
   obtained serially from before CPB to 16 hrs after GPB. Lung function was
   evaluated by monitoring lung compliance, pulmonary artery pressure, and
   alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (P(A-a)O-2). The cardiac index did
   not change except for a significant increase at 16 hrs compared with 6
   hrs after CPB. Peak NO, mean NO, and V-NO decreased from 15.4 +/- 2.0
   ppb (before OPE) to 8.2 +/- 0.8 ppb (6 hrs after CPB), from 5.7 +/- 0.7
   ppb to 2.8 +/- 0.6 ppb, and from 29.2 +/- 3.1 nL/min to 15.7 +/- 2.2
   nL/min, respectively These changes were associated with the increases in
   pulmonary artery pressure and alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, and
   the decrease in lung compliance. V-NO recovered to the level measured
   before CPB 16 hrs after CPB, which was consistent with the physiologic
   recovery in pulmonary hypertension, lung compliance, and gas exchange.
   Conclusion: Measurement of exhaled NO as V-NO, which was associated with
   lung dysfunction, may he an indicator of lung injury in adult patients
   after cardiopulmonary bypass.}},

Abstract = {{Keloids are benign dermal tumors, characterized by overgrowth of
   lesions, invasiveness beyond the original boundary of the insult, and
   recurrence of lesions. The exact etiology is unknown, however. Our
   hypothesis is that keloids are acquired as a result of an abnormal or
   prolonged wound healing process, with persistent proliferation and
   extracellular matrix production of fibroblasts that should otherwise
   discontinue in normal wound healing. In this study, we examined the
   response of keloid fibroblasts to proapoptotic signaling. Cell-permeable
   ceramide, N-acetyl-D-sphingosine, induced apoptosis of dermal
   fibroblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was detected by
   phase contrast microscopy, fluorescent microscopy, the TUNEL method,
   flow cytometric analysis, and WST-1 assay. In contrast, keloid
   fibroblasts resisted apoptosis induced by N-acetyl-D-sphingosine
   (percent survival with 40 mM ceramide treatment for 12 h, normal versus
   keloid: 9.6\% +/- 6.6\% vs 66.8\% +/- 5.5\%). Western blotting analysis
   showed insulin-like growth factor I receptor overexpression in keloid
   ftbroblasts, but not in normal fibroblasts. Exogenously added
   insulin-like growth factor I enhanced the resistance of keloid
   fibroblasts to ceramide-induced apoptosis. Wortmannin, a
   phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor, suppressed the antiapoptotic
   action of insulin-like growth factor I in keloid fibroblasts. Our
   results suggest that keloid fibroblasts overexpressing insulin-like
   growth factor I receptor are resistant to apoptosis, thus allowing
   persistent proliferation and production of excessive extracellular
   matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Test results obtained on the effect of specimen size and aggregate size
   on concrete compressive strength and modulus of elasticity are
   presented. The concrete was prepared using 4.75, 9.5, 19.0, 37.5, and
   75-mm nominal maximum size aggregate. Over 600 cylinders were cast and
   tested for concrete compressive strength and modulus of elasticity. Four
   different sizes of plastic cylinder molds were used: 150 by 300 mm, 100
   by 200 mm, 75 by 150 mm, and 50 by 100 mm. The testing was carried out
   in accordance with ASTM standards for concrete compressive strength
   (ASTM 39) and modulus of elasticity (ASTM C 469).
   The test results were presented in terms of the concrete modulus of
   elasticity-to-compressive strength ratio (E/f(c)') versus cylinder
   diameter, maximum aggregate size, age at testing, among other factors.
   The results revealed that a size effect exists. The strength ratio was
   higher for the larger nominal maximum aggregate size concrete at each
   testing date. Hence, as the nominal maximum aggregate size decreased,
   the strength ratio decreased. The strength ratio followed a dished trend
   with respect to specimen size. For each cylinder size, as the nominal
   maximum aggregate size increased, the coefficient of variation
   increased. It was also found that for the same nominal maximum aggregate
   size specimens, the coefficient of variation increased as the cylinder
   size decreased.}},

Abstract = {{We report a unique case of a 3-year-old boy with a pial arteriovenous
   malformation (AVM) in the medulla. The patient presented with a
   subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a 3 x
   1 cm flow void area in the premedullary cistern that was compressing the
   medulla posteriorly. Cerebral angiography and MR angiography showed an
   aneurysm-like vascular pouch that was fed by the anterior spinal artery
   and had multiple draining veins. The case was diagnosed as a
   fistula-type AVM. Treatment options consisted of endovascular
   embolization or open surgery. We used a left far lateral approach to
   obliterate the anterior spinal artery. immediately after the clip was
   applied to the feeding artery, the pouch began to shrink, and the color
   of the draining veins changed from red to blue. An intraoperative
   angiography showed that the AVM had disappeared. The patient recovered
   fully 1 month after surgery. This case was classified as fistula-type
   AVM, pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Microsurgical obliteration of the
   anterior spinal artery is considered to be the treatment of choice for
   perimedullary AVF located in the premedullary cistern if the
   endovascular treatment is not considered to be feasible. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study was performed to
   investigate the microstructural changes in tungsten during low-energy
   He+ ion irradiations in an electron microscope linked with an ion
   accelerator. The irradiations were carried out with 8 and 0.25 keV He+
   ions at 293, 873 and 1073 K. In the case of the 8 keV irradiation,
   irradiation-induced vacancies act as nucleation sites for dislocation
   loops and helium (He) bubbles. Accordingly, such defects were formed
   even at the higher temperatures. With increasing irradiation
   temperature, the growth rates of dislocation loops and He bubbles rise
   remarkably. Although no vacancies are produced during 0.25 keV
   irradiation, He platelets, interstitial loops and He bubbles were
   formed. Impurity atoms may act as trapping centers for He atoms, which
   form bubbles by ejecting W atoms from their lattice site. (C) 2000

   normal breast tissues were significantly (p < 0.01) lower than those in
   ER-positive breast cancers but not significantly different from those in
   ER-negative breast cancers. However, ER-<beta> mRNA levels in normal
   breast tissues were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those in
   ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers. Proportions of ER-<beta>1
   and ER-beta2 mRNA expression among total ER-beta mRNA expression were
   significantly higher and those of ER-beta5 and ER-beta5' mRNA were
   significantly lower in normal breast tissues than in ER-positive and

   demonstrate that ER-alpha mRNA is up-regulated and ER-alpha mRNA is

Abstract = {{A literature review was performed to determine when direct exchange was
   most likely to be successful, Twelve reports provided outcome data on
   infected hip replacements treated with direct exchange. The average
   duration of followup was 4.8 years, but the range was broad (0.1-17.1
   years). Of the 1299 infected hip replacements treated with direct
   exchange, 1077 (83\%) were thought to be free of infection at the last
   followup, Antibiotic-impregnated bone cement was used in 1282 of the
   cases (99\%), There was wide variability in the duration of parenteral
   antibiotic therapy, ranging from just 24 hours to as many as 8 weeks. In
   some cases, no oral antibiotics ever were given, whereas in others, oral
   antibiotics were given for as many as 8 months after parenteral therapy.
   Factors associated with a successful direct exchange included: (1)
   absence of wound complications after the initial total hip replacement;
   (2) good general health of the patient; (3) methicillin-sensitive
   Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus
   species; and (4) an organism that was sensitive to the antibiotic mixed
   into the bone cement. Factors associated with failure included: (1)
   polymicrobial infection; (2) gram-negative organisms, especially
   Pseudomonas species; and (3) certain gram-positive organisms such as
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Group D
   Streptococcus, Methicillin-resistant organisms have become more common.
   Many current revision surgical techniques use cementless implants,
   Fixation without any cement (no depot antibiotics) may be a
   contraindication to direct exchange. Additionally, there essentially are
   no data on the use of bone graft in association with direct exchange.
   For these reasons, the indications for direct exchange are limited.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To analyze the clinical data and test results collected in a
   group of patients exhibiting eyelid-closure blepharoclonus (BLC) on
   clinical neurologic examination.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients were referred for neurologic
   evaluation for reasons other than BLC. Clinical electrophysiologic
   evaluations, including cranial nerve testing and electromyograms, were
   done according to standards. All patients had neuroimaging studies,
   including brain magnetic resonance imaging and head computerized
   tomography, or both, and many had electroencephalograms. Additional
   tests were done based on the patient's symptoms or reasons for referral.
   Results: Eight patients had reflex BLC. Two cases were precipitated by
   vertical gaze; one of these patients had hereditary palmoplantar
   keratoderma and cataplexy, and the other patient had Ehlers-Danlos
   syndrome and familial BLC. Other precipitants included speech in four
   cases, postural changes in two cases, and light stimulation in one case.
   Two patients had generalized myoclonus independent of their BLC, two
   patients had a history of sleep myoclonus, and several patients had
   BLC-associated facial myoclonus. One patient had BLC-associated
   myoclonus of the right shoulder. Synkinetic cranial movements were
   detected in 11 patients (four oculofacial, three oculopterygoid, one
   oculolingual, two dual cases, and one case of imitation synkinesis.)
   Three patients had familial BLC, seven patients had congenital
   developmental disorders, six patients had synkinetic tremors, and six
   patients had restless feet. Some indication of peripheral neuropathy was
   evident in eight patients.
   Conclusions: Eyelid-closure BLC is an underrecognized, sporadic or
   familial, mostly benign, chronic eyelid-movement disorder that may be
   associated with tremors, myoclonus, cranial synkinesis, and restless
   feet. Reflex mechanisms may be identified in some patients. Gaze-induced
   BLC seems to have the greatest clinical relevance. In the current
   series, there were no examples of posttraumatic BLC, multiple sclerosis,
   hydrocephalus, or blepharospasm conditions previously reported to be
   associated with BLC. No electroencephalographic abnormalities were
   recorded during BLC, ruling out eyelid-closure epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research on polyrhythmic performance can be broadly summarized
   in terms of 2 classes of models: timekeeper models and nonlinear
   dynamical models. In the former approach, research has been focused on
   patterns of covariance among time intervals, and in the latter approach,
   the concentration has been on pattern (in)stability and the
   spatiotemporal properties of oscillating limbs. It is suggested that one
   can achieve a more comprehensive theory that incorporates the strengths
   of each of these approaches by endowing timekeeper models with nonlinear
   dynamics or by endowing nonlinear oscillator models with stochastic
   variability. Additionally, those models are complemented by a
   topological description of performance based on knot theory. Knot theory
   provides a new index of difficulty for polyrhythmic tapping, a spatial
   interpretation of transitions between different stable rhythms, and a
   possible instantiation of N. A. Bernstein's (1967a) notion of a
   topological motor program.}},

   information sources on the Internet, there is an ever-greater need to
   evaluate queries involving (sub)string matching. In many cases, matches
   need to be on multiple attributes/dimensions, with correlations between
   the multiple dimensions. Effective query optimization in this context
   requires good selectivity estimates. In this paper, we use pruned
   count-suffix trees (PSTs) as the basic data structure for substring
   selectivity estimation. For the 1-D problem, we present a novel
   technique called MO (Maximal Overlap). We thm develop and analyze two
   1-D estimation algorithms, MOC and MOLC, based on MO and a
   constraint-based characterization of all possible completions of a given
   PST. For the k-D problem, we first generalize PSTs to multiple
   dimensions and develop a space- and time-efficient probabilistic
   algorithm to construct X-D PSTs directly. We then show how to extend MO
   to multiple dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate, both analytically and
   experimentally, that MO is both practical and substantially superior to
   competing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The activation of primary human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) and of
   the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B by Chlamydia pneumoniae, an
   important respiratory pathogen, was characterized. A time-dependent
   enhanced release of interleukin (IL)-8 and prostaglandin-E-2 and an
   increased expression of the epithelial adhesion molecule intercellular
   adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), followed by subsequent transepithelial
   migration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), were also
   demonstrated. The transepithelial PMN migration could be blocked by an
   anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) but not by MAbs against IL-8. In
   addition, there was an enhanced C. pneumoniae-mediated activation of
   NF-kappaB within 30-60 min in HAECs and BEAS-2B, which was followed by
   increases in mRNA synthesis of IL-8, ICAM-1, and cyclooxygenase-2, with
   maximal effects occurring 2 h after infection, Thus, C. pneumoniae
   infects and activates HAECs and BEAS-2B and therefore may be able to
   trigger a cascade of pro- and anti-inflammatory reactions during
   chlamydial infections.}},

Abstract = {{Background aid Purpose-We sought to characterize the subtypes of stroke
   associated with pregnancy and the puerperium, with emphasis on timing,
   etiology, risk factors, and outcome.
   Methods-We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to
   the Toronto Hospital between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1997, with a
   diagnosis of stroke during pregnancy or within 6 weeks postpartum.
   Strokes were classified as ischemic (arterial or venous) or hemorrhagic
   (subarachnoid or intracerebral). All patients were investigated with at
   least a CT scan of the head, and most had MRI and/or cerebral
   angiography.
   Results-Of approximately 50 700 admissions for delivery, 34 patients
   with a diagnosis of stroke were identified (21 infarctions and 13
   hemorrhages). Of patients with infarction, 13 were arterial and 8 were
   venous. Nine of 13 arterial events occurred in the third trimester or
   puerperium. Seven of 8 venous occlusions occurred postpartum. An
   etiologic diagnosis was made in 7 of 13 patients with arterial territory
   infarction, including cardiac emboli, coagulopathies, and carotid artery
   dissection. Of patients with hemorrhage, 7 were subarachnoid and 6 were
   intracerebral. The etiology was identified in 10 patients: 3 were due to
   ruptured aneurysms, 5 were associated with arteriovenous malformations,
   and 2 were associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. All
   patients with infarction survived, but 3 patients with hemorrhage died.
   Conclusions-The majority of strokes associated with pregnancy were
   arterial occlusions. Most presented during the third trimester and
   puerperium.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, several methods have been proposed for
   decontaminating noisy chaotic signals by exploiting the short-term
   predictability of chaotic signals. This work evaluates the
   effectiveness, for a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)
   telecommunications system, of a noise reduction approach using a
   deterministic optimization technique.
   Noise reduction is governed by a cost function which consists of two
   terms: the first gives the distance between the noisy and enhanced
   orbits, while the second one checks the dynamics of the cleaned signal.
   These two terms are weighted by a scalar Gamma. The effect of this
   factor on the noise reduction performance is also studied.
   Evaluation of the noise performance of a telecommunication system by
   computer simulation requires a very long simulation time. We propose a
   computationally-efficient criterion for quantifying the performance
   improvement of a DCSK system. We show that the noise reduction technique
   improves the overall noise performance only if the energy per
   bit-to-noise spectral density (E-b/N-0) exceeds a certain threshold. The
   effect of code length on this threshold level is also evaluated.
   Finally, the effect of parameter mismatch, which is present in every
   practical system, is analyzed.}},

   erasure or good cooling. This worth turns out to be given by the
   distinguishability of the resource's state from its equilibrium state in
   the sense of a statistical inference problem. Accordingly.
   Kullback-Leibler relative information is a decisive quantity Tor the
   ``worth{''} of the resource's state. Due to the asymmetry of relative
   information. the reliability of the erasure process is bounded rather by
   the relative information of the equilibrium state with respect to the
   actual state than by the relative information of the actual state with

Title = {{Management factors affecting activity and aggression in dynamic group
   housing systems with electronic sow feeding: a field trial}},

Abstract = {{A series of 24-h video studies an four commercial Danish pig herds
   investigated the behaviour of pregnant sows kept in dynamic groups (72
   to 200 sows) with electronic sow feeding (ESF). The herds mainly
   differed with respect to provision of a layer of unchopped straw as
   bedding material, the frequency of introduction/removal of animals,
   space allowance in the lying area, group size and number of feeding
   stations, and starting times for the feeding cycle. All herds had one
   feeding cycle per 24 h. Six 24-h video recordings in the most settled
   period with respect to rank relationships (2 to 12 days after the last
   introduction) were collected from each herd and analysed according to
   activity and aggressive interactions. In two of the four herds
   recordings were collected in two separate periods with different
   starting times for the feeding cycle. In all herds peaks of activity in
   the morning and in the afternoon were evident. Furthermore, the diurnal
   variation was overlaid by an increase in activity at the start of the
   feeding cycle. The activity and aggression in the feeding area as well
   as the duration per sow of the period with high feeder occupation were
   lowest in herds where a layer of straw bedding was provided. Changing
   feeding start from day time to night time was accompanied by a reduced
   feeder occupation in the period following start of the feeding cycle.
   However, in herd 1 (characterized by no litter, high stocking density
   and high frequency of grouping) the level of aggression was reduced,
   whereas it was increased in herd 2 (characterized by straw in lying
   area, low stocking density, low frequency of regrouping). Number of
   regroupings and space allowance apparently had no obvious effects on the
   average frequency of aggression or the aggression per sow at risk in
   periods between introduction of new animals, but space allowance may
   have improved social function by weakening the association between
   activity and aggression. Due to the small number of herds included the
   present results were descriptive rather than conclusive. However, the
   study supports the suggestions that provision of unchopped straw as
   bedding material and starting the feeding cycle in the evening for
   overnight feeding may improve behaviour in dynamic group housing systems
   with ESF However, the benefits of starting the feeding cycle in the
   evening may depend on low disturbance in daytime from other management
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the effect of crude saponin and non-saponin fraction
   of Korean red ginseng (KRG) on the blood pressure and nitric oxide (NO)
   production in the conscious rats and cultured endothelial cell line, ECV
   304 cells. METHODS: Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were
   monitored in the conscious rats. Nitric oxide levels and the expression
   of nitric oxide synthase were measured by a spectrophotometric assay
   using Griess reagents and Western blotting, respectively. Nitric-oxide
   synthase activity was measured based on the conversion rate of
   {[}H-3]arginine to {[}H-3]citrulline. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure
   was decreased by crude saponin (100 mg/kg, iv) of KRG in the conscious
   control and one-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive (1K, 1C-GBH)
   rats. The hypotensive effect induced by crude saponin of KRG reached
   maximum at 2 - 4 min and slowly recovered after 20 min to the initial
   level in both groups. Crude saponin of KRG induced tachycardia in the
   conscious rats but induced bradycardia in the anesthetized rats. In
   contrast to crude saponin of KRG, hypotensive effect induced by
   saponin-free fraction was minimal. Nitric oxide concentrations were
   increased by the treatment of crude saponin in conscious rats as well as
   in the cultured ECV 304 cells. The protein expression level of
   endothelial constitutive nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) in the aorta of
   rats was not increased by crude saponin (100 mg/kg, ip for 3 d).
   However, nitric-oxide synthase activity was increased by crude saponin
   of KRG in the aortic homogenate of rats. CONCLUSION: The hypotensive
   effect of red ginseng is mainly due to saponin fraction of KRG in the
   conscious rats, and this effect may be due to an increase in the
   nitric-oxide production by KRG.}},

Abstract = {{Background Ras protein is a key signal transducer in the cause of cell
   proliferation. We studied the effects of active and negative mutants of
   the Ras gene on arterial neointimal formation in rats, with the aim of
   elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating restenosis following
   percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
   Materials and methods. AdRasV12 and AdRasN17: the recombinant
   adenoviruses containing a constitutively active mutant and a dominant
   negative mutant of Ras, respectively, were used to determine whether Ras
   is necessary and sufficient to modulate the smooth muscle cell
   proliferation and neointima formation. Following balloon injury, rat
   common carotid arteries were treated in their distal half with AdRasV12,
   AdRasN17, or AdLacZ, with the proximal bah used as uninfected control.
   Results. In rat arteries subjected to balloon injury, either uninfected
   or treated with AdLacZ, there were pronounced SMC proliferation and
   neointima formation. These changes were markedly augmented by AdRasV12
   and reduced by AdRasN17.
   Conclusion. Res is necessary and sufficient for SMC proliferation and
   neointima formation and may play a critical role in restenosis following
   balloon angioplasty. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Laccase immobilization onto a hydrophilic PVDF microfiltration membrane
   and its application for removing a herbicide derivative,
   N',N'-(dimethyl)-N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)urea (2-HF), from waste water were
   studied. 2-HF was transformed via an oxidation reaction catalyzed by
   laccase mostly into an insoluble product, which was simultaneously
   separated by filtration through the membrane. The microfiltration
   membrane used to graft laccase was treated with hydrazine to form a
   hydrazide group on its surface, which further reacts with the oxidized
   carbohydrate groups of the enzyme, leading to a covalent immobilization
   of laccase. Contact angle measurements by the sessile drop technique and
   X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy followed the successive modifications
   of the membrane. Streaming potential measurements as a function of the
   pH led to determine the IEP of the grafted membrane at 4.1 +/- 0.5. This
   value is representative of the IEP of the laccase mixture produced by
   the white rot fungus Trametes versicolor. 2-HF removal experiments were
   performed in a microfiltration module. The performance of the laccase
   grafted membrane was evaluated for different enzyme loading rates. It
   was shown that laccase grafted membrane with a 60 cm(2) effective
   microfiltration area transformed 200 mi of a 2-HF 0.1 g/l solution
   within less than 5 min. The main transformation product, an insoluble
   dark purple precipitate, was retained by the membrane. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   assay commonly used for fingerprinting genomes, After optimizing the

   extracted from bacteria prestarved by an osmotic stress and resuscitated
   in rich medium was observed. Enrichment improved recovery of mutator
   cells and allowed them to be detected in samples, suggesting that DNA
   modifications, such as stress-induced alterations and supercoiling

Abstract = {{Dichloroethylene (DCE) is a hepatotoxin that undergoes cytochrome
   P450-catalyzed bioactivation in hepatocytes to form 2-chloroacetyl
   chloride and I,l-dichloroethylene oxide. 8-Chloroacetyl chloride reacts
   with nucleophilic residues and with N-terminal amines to produce
   2-chloroacetylated residues and with glutathione to form the reactive
   electrophile S-(2-chloroacetyl)glutathione (ClCH(2)COSG), which, in
   turn, is capable of sulfhydryl alkylation. 1,1-DCE oxide can bind to
   cysteine sulfhydryl groups and subsequently hydrolyze to form an
   S-carboxymethylated cysteine residue. S-Carboxymethylated,
   2-chloroacetylated, and GSCOCH(2-)S-Cys-peptide adducts of model
   cysteine-containing peptides were synthesized, and their fragmentation
   patterns were characterized by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.
   Synthesis of GSCOCH(2)-S-Cys-peptide adducts was achieved via a novel
   tert-butoxycarbonyl (tBOC) derivative of ClCH(2)COSG. CID of
   GSCOCH(2)-S-Cys-peptide adducts resulted in product ions and neutral
   losses indicative of the GSCOCH(2)-S-Cys moiety as well fragment ion
   pairs in the b- and y-ion series corresponding to the modified cysteine
   residue. S-Carboxymethylated peptides exhibited only a characteristic b-
   or y-series ion pair separated by 161 Da, corresponding to cysteine +
   CH2COOH. CID of 2-chloroacetylated peptides showed neutral losses of 36
   (HCl), 78 (HCOCH2Cl), 96 (HCOCH2Cl + H2O), and 114 Da (HCOCH2Cl +
   2H(2)O). Combinations of characteristic fragment, ions, neutral losses,
   and ion pairs thus are characteristic for DCE-derived adducts. These
   features can be used in an MS/MS data reduction algorithm for the
   selective identification of protein targets of DCE metabolites.}},

Abstract = {{Climate variability leads to economic and food security risks throughout
   the world because of its major influences on agriculture. Accurate
   forecasts of climate 3-6 months ahead of time can potentially allow
   farmers and others in agriculture to make decisions to reduce unwanted
   impacts or take advantage of expected favorable climate. However,
   potential benefits of climate forecasts vary considerably because of
   many physical, biological, economic, social, and political factors. The
   purpose of this study was to estimate the potential economic value of
   climate forecasts for farm scale management decisions in one location in
   the Southeast USA (Tifton, GA; 31 degrees 23'N; 83 degrees 31'W) for
   comparison with previously-derived results for the Pampas region of
   Argentina, The same crops are grown in both regions but at different
   times of the year. First, the expected value of tailoring crop mix to El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases for a typical farm in Tifton was
   estimated using crop models and historical daily weather data. Secondly,
   the potential values for adjusting management of maize (Zea maize L.) to
   different types of climate forecasts (perfect knowledge of (a) ENSO
   phase, (b) growing season rainfall categories, and (c) daily weather)
   were estimated for Tifton and Pergamino, Argentina (33 degrees 55'S; 60
   degrees 33'W). Predicted benefits to the farm of adjusting crop mix to
   ENSO phase averaged from US\$ 3 to 6 ha(-1) over all years, depending on
   the farmer's initial wealth and aversion to risk. Values calculated for
   Argentina were US\$ 9-15 for Pergamino and up to US\$ 35 for other
   locations in the Pampas. Varying maize management by ENSO phase resulted
   in predicted forecast values of US\$ 13 and 15 for Tifton and Pergamino,
   respectively The potential value of perfect seasonal forecasts of
   rainfall tercile on maize profit was higher than for ENSO-based
   forecasts in both regions (by 28\% in Tifton and 70\% in Pergamino).
   Perfect knowledge of daily weather over the next season provided an
   upper limit on expected value of about US\$ 190 ha(-1) for both regions.
   Considering the large areas of field crop production in these regions,
   the estimated economic potential is very high. However, there are a
   number of challenges to realize these benefits. These challenges are
   generally related to the uncertainty of climate forecasts and to the
   complexities of agricultural systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   manipulated gonadotropin concentrations by administering exogenous FSH,
   we aimed to investigate this hypothesis. Pre-vitellogenic females showed
   no response to exogenous ovine FSH. In early vitellogenic females, FSH
   induced follicular recruitment: follicles were enlarged and clutch size
   increased by recruitment of a second cohort of follicles; some females
   also ovulated. Females treated with FSH in mid-vitellogenesis had
   elevated mean plasma estradiol concentrations compared to controls; no
   follicular recruitment was observed, but most of these animals ovulated.
   Females treated with a range of doses of FSH in late vitellogenesis
   ovulated at least one month before natural ovulation, again without
   recruitment of extra follicles. It appears therefore that in
   Niveoscincus metallicus exogenous FSH can induce recruitment of
   additional follicles only if administered during early vitellogenesis.
   We conclude that in this species clutch size is determined by proximate
   environmental factors influencing gonadotropin levels early in
   follicular recruitment, and cannot be increased even if conditions
   become more favourable once vitellogenesis is established. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: This study examined the relationship between
   maternal weight and serum marker concentrations (alpha-fetoprotein
   {[}AFP] and human chorionic gonadotropin {[}hCG]) to develop a
   weight-correction formula for second-trimester Down syndrome screening
   in Taiwan.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study based on data
   from 18, Down syndrome 016 pregnant Taiwanese women who participated in
   a second-trimester Down second trimester syndrome screening program at
   Taiwan Adventist Hospital. The relationship between I maternal serum
   maternal weight and the multiple of median (MoM) concentrations of serum
   markers alpha-fetoprotein was analyzed using two methods; one involved
   all the observational data (all point human chorionic method), while the
   other involved only the median concentrations at various gestational
   ages (median regression method). In each method, several statistical
   approaches were used, including simple-linear, reciprocal, quadratic,
   and log-transformation linear regression.
   Results: The correlation between maternal body weight and serum marker
   concentrations using the all point regression method was very poor,
   while the median regression method achieved a good fit. The reciprocal
   regression analysis had the best fit between AFP MoM concentration and
   maternal weight, while the best fit between hCG MoM concentration and
   maternal weight was achieved with quadratic regression analysis.
   Conclusion: The present study has developed a race-specific
   weight-correction formula for Taiwanese women. This formula is expected
   to be helpful in second-trimester Down syndrome screening programs in
   Taiwan.}},

Abstract = {{In this work it is shown how fuzzy lattice neurocomputing (FLN) emerges
   as a connectionist paradigm in the framework of fuzzy lattices
   (FL-framework) whose advantages include the capacity to deal rigorously
   with: disparate types of data such as numeric and linguistic data,
   intervals of values, `missing' and `don't care' data. A novel notation
   for the FL-framework is introduced here in order to simplify
   mathematical expressions without losing content. Two concrete FLN models
   are presented, namely `sigma -FLN' for competitive clustering, and `FLN
   with tightest fits (FLNtf)' for supervised clustering. Learning by the
   sigma -FLN, is rapid as it requires a single pass through the data,
   whereas learning by the FLNtf, is incremental, data order independent,
   polynomial O(n(3)), and it guarantees maximization of the degree of
   inclusion of an input in a learned class as explained in the text.
   Convenient geometric interpretations are provided. The sigma -FLN is
   presented here as fuzzy-ART's extension in the FL-framework such that
   sigma -FLN widens fuzzy-ART's domain of application to (mathematical)
   lattices by augmenting the scope of both of fuzzy ART's choice (Weber)
   and match functions, and by enhancing fuzzy-ART's complement coding
   technique. The FLNtf neural model is applied to four benchmark data sets
   of various sizes for pattern recognition and rule extraction. The
   benchmark data sets in question involve jointly numeric and nominal data
   with `missing' and/or `don't care' attribute values, whereas the
   lattices involved include the unit-hypercube, a probability space, and a
   Boolean algebra. The potential of the FL-framework in computing is also
   delineated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Management of patients with congenital heart disease requires detailed

   the diagnosis and the treatment of congenital malformations has often

   catherization still remains the gold standard against which other
   modalities are measured. In the past decade, however, imaging
   methodologies have increasingly shifted toward the use of less invasive
   and noninvasive techniques. Currently, echocardiography is the initial
   method of choice in evaluating the anatomy, especially in younger
   patients. Meanwhile, several newer imaging techniques like magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) and spiral or multislice computed tomography
   (CT) are in use. They offer extremely useful information about
   abnormalities of the heart and great vessels as well as the assessment
   of cardiac anatomy and function. Echo, angiography, MRI and CT should be

Abstract = {{The toxicity of eight phenolic compounds characteristic to the oil-shale
   industry wastewaters was analyzed using a battery of seven microbiotests
   with species representing different trophic levels (photobacteria,
   protozoa, crustaceans, microalgae). Altogether five monobasic phenolic
   compounds (phenol, p-cresol, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,3-dimethylphenol,
   3,4-dimethylphenol) and three dibasic phenolic compounds (resorcinol,
   5-methylresorcinol, and 2,5-dimethylresorcinol) were studied. Phenol,
   2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,3-dimethylphenol, and 5-methylresorcinol were
   classified as ``toxic{''} (lowest 50\% lethal (effective) concentration
   L(E)C-50 of the battery 1-10 mg/L). P-cresol, 3,4-dimethylphenol,
   resorcinol, and 2,5-dimethylresorcinol were classified as ``very
   toxic{''} (lowest L(E)C-50 of the battery less than or equal to1 mg/L).
   The most sensitive test organisms were crustaceans and/or photobacteria.
   The toxicity of three different equitoxic mixtures (mixture of all eight
   phenols, mixture of five monobasic phenols, and mixture of three dibasic
   phenols) was studied using Vibrio fisheri, Daphnia magna, and
   Thamnocephalus platyurus. For all three test organisms the toxicities of
   individual phenols were proved additive. The efficiency of biotreatment
   on the toxicity reduction of the individual phenolic compounds (2.5 mM)
   as well as the equimolar mixtures of all eight phenols (1/8{*}2.5 mM
   each), five monobasic phenols (1/5{*}2.5 mM each), and three dibasic
   phenols (1/3{*}2.5 mM each) was studied using acclimated and
   nonacclimated activated sludges, in the case of both activated sludges
   phenol, p-cresol, resorcinol, and 5-methylresorcinol were most rapidly
   detoxified. Dimethylphenols and the mixtures had moderate detoxification
   times, while the slowest was the detoxification of
   2,5-dimethylresorcinol and the mixture of resorcinols. Thus, out of
   eight phenolic compounds studied 2,5-dimethylresorcinol was considered
   most environmentally hazardous as very toxic (LC50 for crustaceans 1-5
   mg/L) and slowly biodegradabable. (C) 2000 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   polystyrene (PS-H), alpha,omega -diamino-terminated PS (alpha,omega
   -PS(NH2)(2)) and alpha,omega -dicarboxy-terminated PS (alpha,omega
   -PS(COOH)(2)) films was studied by scanning viscoelasticity microscopy
   in conjunction with lateral force microscopy. The glass transition
   temperature T-g, at the surface, T-g(s), was found to be markedly lower
   than bulk T-g, T-g(b), and the number-average molecular weight, M-n,
   dependence of T-g(s) was more remarkable than that of T-g(b). Also, the
   magnitude of T-g(s) was strongly dependent on the chain end chemistry.
   Hence, the activation of surface molecular motion was explained in terms
   of an excess free volume induced by the preferential surface segregation
   of chain end groups. The chain end segregation at the film surface was
   confirmed by dynamic secondary ion mass spectroscopic measurement.
   However, the T-g(s) for the PS-H with quasi-infinite M-n was lower than
   the corresponding T-g(b), even though the number density of chain ends
   was almost negligible. In addition, T(g)(s)s for PS films with
   hydrophilic chain ends, which might be depleted at the film surface,
   were lower than the bulk values. The apparent activation energy for the
   surface micro-Brownian motion corresponding to the alpha (a)-relaxation
   process was approximately half of the bulk value. Finally, the
   depression of T-g(s) in comparison with T-g(b) is discussed on the basis
   of several factors, such as a decreased segment size of molecular motion
   for the surface alpha (a)-relaxation process due to the existence of the
   free space on the polymer surface and/or a reduced chain entanglement at
   the surface, in addition to the chain end effect.}},

Abstract = {{To test predictions derived from the emotional processing theory of fear
   reduction, claustrophobics (N = 58) were randomized to one of four
   exposure conditions: (a) exposure with guided threat reappraisal, (b)
   exposure with a cognitive load distracter task, (c) exposure with both
   guided threat reappraisal and cognitive load distracter task and (d)
   exposure without guided threat reappraisal or cognitive load distracter
   task. We hypothesized that self-guided in vivo exposure would lead to
   less fear reduction if performed simultaneously with a cognitive load
   distracter task that severely taxes information processing resources. In
   contrast, we hypothesized that focusing on core threats during exposure
   would enhance fear reduction. The main findings were largely consistent
   with predictions. The cognitive load task (regardless of focus of
   available attention) had a detrimental effect on fear reduction, while
   guided threat reappraisal (regardless of cognitive load) had a
   facilitative effect. The greatest level of fear reduction and the lowest
   level of return of fear were observed in the exposure condition
   involving guided threat reappraisal without cognitive load. Clinical
   implications and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2000

   Pharmacotheraphy 17(1) (1997) 10] benzazepine, is a new and well
   tolerated antidepressant. It blocks pre-synaptic alpha (2)-adrenergic
   receptors and postsynaptic serotonin type 2 and type 3 receptors. The
   drug is rapid and completely absorbed after oral administration.
   Mirtazapine was analyzed by HPLC and gas chromatography with
   nitrogen-sensitive detection. In this study, mirtazapine was analyzed by
   using UV spectrophotometry, first and second order derivative
   spectrophotometry. The type of solvent, the degree of derivation, range
   of wavelength and n value were chosen in order to optimize the
   conditions. The concentration of mirtazapine in its methanolic solutions
   were determined between the wavelength range of 225-360 nm in the
   linearity range of 1-100, 2-100 and 1-120 mug ml(-1) by using the values
   obtained from UV, first-order derivative (n = 5, Delta lambda = 17.5 nm)
   and second-order derivative (n = 9, Delta lambda = 31.5 nm) spectrum of
   the substance, respectively. The developed UV Spectrophotometric,
   first-order and second-order derivative spectrophotometric methods were
   applied to a pharmaceutical preparation as tablet form. Developed UV and
   derivative UV spectrophotometric method in this study are accurate,
   sensitive, precise, reproducible and can be directly and easily applied
   to the pharmaceutical preparations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {{A new look at the components of the petroleum system of the South

Abstract = {{Detailed knowledge of the petroleum systems of mature petroleum
   provinces is often lacking. This has often resulted from the early
   discovery of most of these provinces' reserves. The South Caspian basin
   represents one such province. The ``modern{''} era of petroleum
   exploration in the South Caspian began more than 100 years ago. Even
   with this long history several aspects of the petroleum system have
   remained largely speculation. Among the key questions are:
   What is the primary hydrocarbon source for the region?
   Where and when has hydrocarbon generation taken place?
   Can exploration be extended beyond known stratigraphic and areal limits?
   Recent integrated geologic and geochemical studies have attempted to
   answer these and other questions for the petroleum system of the South
   Caspian basin. These studies attempted to overcome prior problems
   associated with limited sample availability, severity of surface
   weathering, data quality and completeness. This study confirmed the
   Maykop Suite as the primary oil source, but restricted its stratigraphic
   distribution. Organic carbon content within the Maykop ranged upward to
   14.28 wt.\%, with hydrocarbon generation potentials (S-2) approaching 75
   mg HC/g rock. Source rock deposition was cyclic and included both oil-
   and gas-prone episodes. Geochemically, the region's oils are highly
   variable as a result of their complex and variable migration and
   alteration histories rather than their derivation from multiple source
   rock units. The oils display similar molecular and isotopic compositions
   to the extracted Maykop samples confirming their genetic relationship.
   The range in carbon isotope values reflects secular changes within the
   Maykop Suite source. Unlike some earlier studies, this study showed that
   all of the oils were generated within the conventional ``oil-window{''}
   (R-o approximate to 0.9-1.0\%). This places the source system at depths
   in excess of 5 km and emphasizes the role that vertical migration played
   in the development of the basin's hydrocarbon accumulations. There is
   evidence that migration was episodic, possibly related to punctuated
   generation or the opening of conduits through the activity of mud
   diapirs. Model results also suggest that the rapid Plio-Pleistocene
   subsidence and sedimentation were the primary controls on hydrocarbon
   generation.}},

Abstract = {{After the Fontan procedure, pulmonary artery (PA) flow is maintained
   without right ventricular pump function. We evaluated intraoperative PA
   flow velocity patterns using transesophageal Doppler echocardiography
   (TEE) immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients during
   Fontan or hemi-Fontan procedures. We studied 10 patients with
   single-ventricle physiology (age range, 5 mo to 3 yr 1 mo). Anesthesia
   was induced and maintained with fentanyl. After induction of anesthesia,
   a pediatric TEE probe was inserted into the esophagus. All patients had
   surgical repair involving direct anastomosis of the right atrium to the
   PA. Immediately after completion of CPB, adequacy of the atriopulmonary
   anastomosis was assessed and PA flow velocity was recorded. In all
   patients, the atriopulmonary anastomosis was dearly defined using a
   single-plane TEE probe, and PA flow recording was completed
   successfully. Intraoperative PA flow velocities showed two distinct
   patterns. Biphasic forward flows with peak velocities during systole and
   diastole were observed in six patients. The remaining four patients
   showed forward flows with flow reversals. The four patients
   demonstrating flow reversals showed significantly reduced fractional
   shortening (26.5 +/- 2.1\% vs 35.5 +/- 6.3\%) and larger pressure
   gradient between the right atrium and left atrium (10.8 +/- 1.3 mm Hg vs
   8.0 +/- 0.9 mm Hg) when compared to those without reverse flow. Two
   patients with reverse flow required reoperation because of hypotension.
   Because PA flow is influenced by pulmonary vascular resistance and left
   ventricular function, TEE assessed intraoperative PA flow should be
   further evaluated as a useful predictor of surgical outcome after a
   Fontan procedure.}},

Abstract = {{We report two cases with embolization (coil embolization) using
   Guglielumi detachable coils of residual aneurysms following incomplete
   neck clipping. The first case, a 75-year-old woman suffered from a
   subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the rupture of a left internal carotid
   posterior communicating aneurysm in June, 1997. Neck clipping of the
   aneurysm was performed at day 1. Follow-up angiogram at day 7 showed a
   residual aneurysm involving the dome of the initial aneurysm. Sire
   performed coil embolization of the residual aneurysm following the
   angiogram. Almost complete obliteration of the aneurysm lasted during
   the follow-up period of two and a half years. The second case, a
   71-year-old woman suffered from a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the
   rupture of a right internal carotid posterior communicating aneurysm in
   May, 1999. Neck clipping of the aneurysm was performed at day I.
   Follow-up angiogram at day 7 showed a residual aneurysm involving only a
   part of the initial aneurysm near the neck. Because no spontaneous
   thrombosis of the residual aneurysm was obtained after 2 months, we
   performed coil embolization of the residual aneurysm. Almost complete
   obliteration of the aneurysm lasted during the follow-up period of 7
   months. These patients were discharged with good performance status. We
   consider the morphologic feature of the residural aneurysm to be most
   important for determining when to perform coil embolization of such
   residual aneurysms.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine the efficiency of a dry-extrusion
   process to reduce or eliminate bacterial contamination of swine waste
   amended livestock feed. Separated swine waste solids were mixed with
   ground corn and soybean hulls and dry-extruded at temperatures of
   110-135 degrees C for no more than 30 s to produce animal feed. Swine
   waste, pre- and post-extrusion livestock feed, and commercial swine feed
   samples were collected aseptically and analysed for total coliform,
   Escherichia coli, fecal coliform, heterotrophic, and non-specific
   anaerobic/facultative bacteria using standard culturing techniques.
   Selected pre-extrusion feed samples were inoculated with liquid cultures
   of Bacillus stearothermophilus to test efficiency of the dry-extrusion
   process to eliminate heat-resistant spore-forming bacteria. Bacterial
   concentrations recovered from post-extrusion livestock feed were
   significantly reduced from other sample types analysed. Based on these
   data, it is apparent that a single-screw, dry-extrusion process can
   consistently disinfect animal feed. However, careful monitoring of the
   extrusion process may be necessary for consistent sterilization. (C)

   Crete have been studied for genetic variation at 19 enzymatic loci by
   electrophoresis. Three different levels of genetic divergence emerged:
   mean Nei's genetic distance was 0.025 among T spinulosus populations,
   0.347 between T spinulosus and T lagoi and 0.837-0.918 between D.
   paraskevi-T spinulosus and D. paraskevi-T lagoi respectively.
   Relationships among T spinulosus populations were studied by Principal
   Component Analysis in order to clarify their debated taxonomic position;
   relationships among all study populations were assessed by two different
   methods of tree reconstruction, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor-Joining.
   The low degree of genetic differentiation among T spinulosus populations
   and the different data analyses all indicate that this is the only
   Troglophilus species of Crete.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To explore the prescribing pattern and rationale of
   antihypertensive combination drug therapy at the level of primary health
   care centers; and to analyze the extent of physicians' adherence to
   dosage range of antihypertensives in combination regimens as recommended
   by Guidelines Subcommittee of WHO/ISH 1999. Subjects, material and
   methods: A prescribing survey of antihypertensive combination regimens
   among patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension was conducted
   in 7 out of a total of 18 health centers in Bahrain. The relevant data
   for our study was collected using cards designed for chronically ill
   patients. Results: A total of 2414 hypertensive patients (62.9\%), of a
   3838 study population, were on monotherapy, whereas 1414 (37.1\%) were
   on antihypertensive combination therapy. Among those who were treated
   with, drug combinations, 85.1\% (n = 1212) received two-drug, 14.2\% (n
   = 202) received three-drug and four- and five-drug regimens: were used
   by 0.6\% and 0.07\%, respectively. Prescription analysis revealed that
   17 different two- and three-antihypertensive drug combinations were
   prescribed for each category. The four major two-drug regimens were
   ranked in the following order: a beta -blocker with a diuretic (40.4\%)
   used more frequently in females than in males (p < 0.001), a
   <beta>-blocker with a calcium channel blocker (19.7\%), a beta -blocker
   with an ACE inhibitor (12.8\%) and a diuretic with an ACE inhibitor
   (7.3\%) - used more frequently in males than in females (p = 0.001,0.01,
   and 0.028, respectively). The most frequently prescribed three-drug
   regimens were diuretic and a beta -blocker plus either an ACE inhibitor
   (30.7\%) or a calcium channel blocker (22.3\%), beta -blocker plus an
   ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker (16.3\%), and a diuretic
   plus an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker (11.4\%). There was
   no gender-related difference among triple-drug regimens. There was a
   trend towards using, high doses of the P-blocker atenolol, ACE
   inhibitors and methyldopa. Conclusion: The pre-scribing patterns of some
   practising physicians were analyzed in terms of conformity with
   guidelines of combination of drugs and dosages. The use of
   antihypertensive combination therapy and the doses of individual drugs
   in combination regimens seem to be partly non-compliant with guidelines
   issued by WHO recommendations; this is illustrated by excessive
   prescription of some irrational combinations, as well as limited
   prescription of some rational combinations. In addition, a tendency to
   use high doses of certain classes of antihypertensive combinations was
   observed.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of nimodipine alone and in combination with diazepam or
   phenytoin was tested in the electroshock-induced mouse model of status
   epilepticus. Status epilepticus was induced by transauricular electrical
   stimulation with a stimulus of 15 mA at 0.5, 3, 10, 20 and 30 min,
   starting half an hour after intraperitoneal administration of
   vehicle/drug. The median effective doses of diazepam and phenytoin alone
   and in combination with a fixed dose of nimodipine (24 mg/kg) was
   calculated. The ED(50)s of diazepam and phenytoin were found to be 10.5
   and 9 mg/kg, respectively. When nimodipine was combined with diazepam or
   phenytoin, the ED50 values decreased to 3.77 mg/kg and 7.15 mg/kg,
   respectively. The severity of seizures was also decreased by combination
   with nimodipine as compared to diazepam and phenytoin given alone. To
   study the effect of nimodipine on psychomotor impairments produced by
   diazepam and phenytoin three tests were performed; rotarod, behavioral
   despair and hole bound. Nimodipine did not show protective effects on
   its own but potentiated the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam and
   phenytoin. Furthermore, the combination of nimodipine with diazepam and
   phenytoin produced lesser impairment of psychomotor functions. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{In the present work we examined nonhomologous integration of plasmid DNA

   integrated via Ty integrase without cointegrating Ty sequences, as
   inferred from 5-bp target site duplication and integration site
   preferences. Ty integrase-mediated integration of non-Ty DNA has never
   been observed in wild-type cells, although purified integrase is capable
   of using non-Ty DNA as a substrate in vitro. Hence our data implicate
   yKu70 as the cellular function preventing integrase from accepting

Title = {{Preoperative staging of rectal cancer with MRI: Accuracy and clinical
   usefulness}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{732-737}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Preoperative staging is essential for planning of optimal
   therapy for patients with rectal cancer. Recently, magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) is used frequently because of its benefits of clear pelvic
   image are better than other diagnostic methods. The purpose of this
   study was to determine accuracy rates and clinical usefulness of MRT in
   preoperative staging of rectal cancer.
   Methods: Between February, 1997, and December, 1999, 217 patients with
   histologically proven rectal cancer were staged preoperatively and had
   surgical resections performed. MRI criteria for depth of invasion was
   determined by the degree of disruption of the rectal wall. Metastatic
   perirectal lymph nodes were considered to be present if they showed
   heterogenous texture, irregular margin, and enlargement (>10 mm).
   Results: The accuracy of the MRI for determining depth of invasion was
   176/217 (81\%) and regional lymph node invasion was 110/217 (63\%). In
   the T stage, accuracy rate of T1 was 3/4 (75\%), T2 was 20/37 (54\%), T3
   was 141/162 (87\%), and T4 was 12/14 (86\%), respectively. The
   specificity of lymph node invasion was 45/110 (41\%) and the sensitivity
   was 91/107 (85\%). The accuracy rate of regional lymph node involvement
   was 136/217 (63\%). T1 and T2 were overstaged in 1/4 (25\%) and 17/37
   (46\%), respectively, and T3 was understaged in 15/162 (9.2\%). The
   accuracy rate to detect metastatic lateral pelvic lymph node was 4/14
   (29\%) after lateral pelvic lymph node dissection was done in 14
   patients under MRI. The accuracy rate in assessing levator ani muscle
   tumor involvement was 8/11 (72\%).
   Conclusions: MRI showed a good, comparable accuracy rate for determining
   depth of turner invasion, compared with transrectal ultrasonography,
   which still has a low accuracy rate for detecting metastatic lymph node.
   MRT with endorectal coil may increase the accuracy rate of T1 and T2
   lesions. In addition, clear sagittal and coronal sectional pelvic images
   can give a lot of information about adjacent organ invasion or any
   invasion of levator ani muscle. MRT can be useful for choosing an
   appropriate extent of lymph node dissection and type of surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Non-tolerant (CW) and Cd-tolerant (CCd1) carrot (Daucus carota L.) cells
   were compared for their response to cadmium (Cd). The CCd1 cells were
   induced by selection from the CW cells on a B5 medium containing 100 muM
   Cd. The CCd1 cells were more tolerant to Cd than the CW cells. In an 80
   muM Cd treatment, the growth rate (8 d/0 d) based on the fresh weight of
   the CCd1 cells and CW cells was 69 and 24\%, respectively, compared to
   the controls. Cd stress led to the decrease of the total glutathione
   content and to the increase of the contents of non-protein thiols (t-SH,
   phytochelatins) and Cd in both types of cells, Under Cd stress, the
   contents of t-SH and Cd of the CW cells were higher than those of the
   CCd1 cells. The CW cells in the 80 and 160 muM Cd treatments accumulated
   Cd with the increase in time. In contrast, the Cd content in the CCd1
   cells in all the treatments and in the CW cells in the 40 muM Cd
   treatment gradually decreased after 1 d. In an additional experiment,
   both types of cells pretreated with 20-80 muM Cd for id were transferred
   to a Cd-free medium, The CCd1 cells in all the pretreatments
   continuously excluded Cd over a 4-d period, unlike the CW cells.
   Therefore, a larger depletion of Cd was found in the CCd1 cells, which
   maybe partially attributed to Cd tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal analyses of in situ CO fluxes from forested and agricultural
   soils in Maine and Georgia, and more limited comparisons in Hawai'i
   indicated that agricultural land use consistently enhanced CO
   consumption. Soils at an agricultural site in Maine consumed
   approximately 1.9 g CO m(-2) yr(-1) while uptake ina nearby mixed forest
   was about 70\% lower, 0.6 g CO m(-2) yr(-1) A similar trend was observed
   for sites in Georgia, where annual uptake by agricultural sites was
   approximately 1.0 g CO m(-2) while net emission (about -0.5 g CO m(-2))
   was observed for neighboring pine stands. Net CO fluxes in Maine and
   Georgia were generally aseasonal. Accordingly, seasonal changes in
   temperature and water content played variable but often minimal roles as
   determinants of net fluxes and gross CO uptake and production. However,
   comparisons among sites suggested that soil organic matter contents were
   an important control of the magnitude of CO fluxes. In particular net CO
   consumption for a given soil type increased with decreasing organic
   matter content associated with forest to agriculture transitions in land
   use. Although interactions among soil organic matter and various
   microbiological, physical and chemical parameters in soils are complex,
   changes in organic matter at the sites described here appear to affect
   net CO fluxes primarily by reducing the relative rate of abiological CO
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Our objectives were to evaluate: 1) the efficacy of the Sperm Mobility
   Test on commercial turkey farms, and 2) the influence of sperm mobility
   phenotype on fertility when insemination parameters are varied. In
   research flocks, differences in sperm mobility among toms are predictive
   of fertility. We wanted to test the efficacy of this sire selection test
   in practical, real-world situations, evaluating its usefulness in terms
   of assessing large numbers of toms, different strains of turkeys, and
   variable management practices. Utilizing field study results, controlled
   studies were then conducted to improve test parameters. For the field
   trials, semen from each of 405 breeder toms (11 strains or lines) was
   evaluated either in duplicate (n = 285) or in triplicate (n = 120).
   Sperm mobility was normally distributed among all toms tested, except
   for one strain. Because the sperm mobility indices for toms evaluated in
   these field trials were higher than those observed in research flocks,
   the Sperm Mobility Test was modified to increase the separation between
   high and low sperm mobility phenotypes by increasing the concentration
   of Accudenz.(R) To determine the effects of sperm mobility and
   insemination dose on sustained fertility through time, hens from a
   research flock were inseminated twice before the onset of lay with sperm
   from toms classified as high-, average-, or low-mobility in
   concentrations of 25 to 400 million sperm per artificial insemination
   dose, and egg fertility was evaluated over a 5-wk period. Toms with the
   high-mobility sperm phenotype maintained higher fertility (P < 0.05)
   over the 5-wk period at all insemination doses compared with toms with
   low-mobility sperm. Toms with high-mobility sperm sired equal numbers of
   poults in a sperm competition study in which numbers favored
   low-mobility toms by 3:1. These results demonstrate that the Sperm
   Mobility Test can be used for on-farm evaluation of semen quality of
   toms in commercial flocks and that sperm mobility influences fertility
   and sire fitness.}},

Abstract = {{The administration of either Pentoxifylline (PTX), a methylxanthine

   (PDEs), or Rolipram, an inhibitor specific to type-4 PDE (PDE4) in

   analyzed by means of bone densitometry and histomorphometry, The results
   revealed that both PTX and Rolipram increased bone mass in normal mice
   mainly through the acceleration of bone formation. These findings
   suggest that both PTX and Rolipram can enhance physiological bone
   formation and thereby increase bone mass in normal mice. The possibility

   and humans from the Western US. The canine isolate from Spain was
   closely related to Babesin microti. These results suggest that there are
   multiple small piroplasm species in dogs. The isolates from the

Abstract = {{This paper discusses archaeobotanical remains from the settlement mound
   of Kursakata, Nigeria, comprising both charred and uncharred seeds and
   fruits as well as charcoal. In addition, impressions of plant tempering
   material in potsherds were analysed. The late Stone Age and Iron Age
   sequence at Kursakata is dated from 1000 cal. B.C. to cal. A.D. 100.
   Domesticated Pennisetum (pearl miller), wild Paniceae and wild rice are
   the most common taxa. Kernels from tree fruits were regularly found
   including large numbers of Vitex simplicifolia - a tree which is absent
   from the area today. A distinct change in plant spectra can be observed
   between the late Stone Age and the Iron Age. Although domesticated pearl
   millet was already known at the beginning of the settlement sequence of
   Kursakata, it only gained greater economic importance during the Iron
   Age. Besides farming, pastoralism and fishing, gathering of wild plants
   always played a major role in the subsistence strategy of the
   inhabitants of Kursakata. The charcoal results show that firewood was
   mainly collected from woodlands on the clay plains, which must have been
   mole diverse than today. The end of the late Stone Age in the Chad Basin
   was presumably accompanied by the onset of drier environmental
   conditions from ca. 800 cal. B.C. onwards.}},

Title = {{Combined use of fasting plasma glucose and HbA(1c) predicts the
   progression to diabetes in Chinese subjects}},
Journal = {{DIABETES CARE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1770-1773}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - We have previously suggested using the paired values of
   fasting fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA(1c) to identify potential
   diabetic subjects. In this article, we followed up on 208 nondiabetic
   subjects and examined their rates of progression to diabetes. We
   analyzed their likelihood of becoming diabetic according to their
   baseline FPG and HbA(1c) concentrations.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Between 1988 and 1995, 2,877 Chinese
   subjects with risk factors for diabetes underwent screening. Of these,
   2,250 had FPG <7.8 mmol/l and 2-h plasma glucose (PG) <11.1 mmol/l. Of
   these 2,250 subjects, 265 were randomly recruited for an annual oral
   glucose tolerance test (OGTT) until they progressed to develop diabetes.
   Of those 265 subjects, 57 had baseline FPG greater than or equal to7.0
   mmol/l and were excluded from the present analysis. Hence, the
   progression of glucose tolerance in 208 subjects who were nondiabetic
   according to the new American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria
   (FPG <7.0 mmol/l and 2-h PG <11.1 mmol/l) was examined
   RESULTS - Of the 208 nondiabetic subjects, 26 (12.5\%) were men and 182
   (87.5\%) were women. After a mean follow-up of 1.60 +/- 1.16 years
   (range 1-7, median 1), 44 (21.2\%) progressed to develop diabetes and
   164 (78.8\%) remained nondiabetic. Those who were diabetic at the end of
   the study had a high likelihood ratio (LR) of 9.3 to have baseline FPG
   greater than or equal to6.1 mmol/l and baseline HbA(1c) greater than or
   equal to6.1\%. This was compared with a low LR of 0.6-1.1 in diabetic
   subjects who had either FPG <6.1 mmol/l or HbA(1c) <6.1\% or both at
   baseline. The crude rate of progression to diabetes was more than five
   times higher (44.1 vs. 8.1\%) in those whose baseline FPG was greater
   than or equal to6.1 mmol/l and baseline HbA(1c) was greater than or
   equal to6.1\% compared with those whose baseline FPG was <6.1 mmol/l and
   baseline HbA(1c) was <6.1\%.
   CONCLUSIONS - For Chinese subjects with risk factors for glucose
   intolerance, the use of paired FPG and HbA(1c) values helped to identify
   potential diabetic subjects. Those with an FPG greater than or equal
   to6.1 mmol/l and HbA(1c) greater than or equal to6.1\% had a rate of
   progression to diabetes more than five times higher than those with an
   FPG <6.1 mmol/l and an HbA(1c) <6.1\% after a mean follow-up of 1.6
   years. Those with an FPG greater than or equal to6.1 but <7.0 mmol/l,
   especially if their HbA(1c) was <greater than or equal to>6.1\%, should
   undergo an OGTT to confirm diabetes. Subjects with an FPG <6.1 mmol/l
   and/or an HbA(1c) <6.1\% should have regular screening using the paired
   values of FPG and HbA(1c).}},

   depressed since they were only supported by surface tension. Circulatory
   convection patterns were generated by electromagnetic forces and surface

   velocity component produced by pool oscillation. The temperature
   distribution in and around the pool was influenced by pool convection.
   During pool formation and growth, the fully penetrated molten pool
   sagged dramatically when the bottom pool diameter approached the top
   diameter. The sagged pool oscillated with higher magnitude and lower
   frequency than partially penetrated or fully penetrated pools before
   sagging occurred. The dynamic behavior and the amount of material lost

Abstract = {{Background: Genomic imprinting significantly influences development,
   growth and behaviour in mammals. Systematic screening of imprinted genes
   has been extensively carried out to identify the genes responsible for
   imprinted phenotypes and to elucidate the biological significance of
   this phenomenon. In this study, we applied DNA chip technology for
   isolating paternally expressed imprinted genes (Pegs). We compared the
   resulting expression profiles of parthenogenetic and fertilized control
   embryos to identify novel imprinted genes.
   Results: A novel paternally expressed mouse imprinted gene, Peg9/Dlk1,
   was identified. Consistent with this finding, the paternal expression of
   its human homologue, PEG9/DLK1, was also confirmed. These two genes form
   imprinted gene clusters with the reciprocally imprinted mouse Meg3/Gtl2
   and human MEG3 genes that we first identified on distal chromosome 12
   and chromosome 14q32, respectively.
   Conclusions: As DNA chip technology allows us to quickly screen a large
   number of genes, using this technology to search for imprinted genes
   could accelerate the identification of genes responsible for human and
   mouse genetic diseases. Dlk1 and DLK1, which encode transmembrane
   proteins, have six EGF-like repeats and show homology to the Delta gene
   in Drosophila melanogaster. Because of its homology to mammalian Delta
   homologues, PEG9/DLK1 may contribute to the scoliosis phenotype observed
   in maternal uniparental disomy 14 (mUPD14) patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background, aims: The aim of the study was to assess the effect on
   existing plaque and gingivitis of an oral hygiene regimen which utilizes
   triclosan/copolymer and to compare it with a regimen which uses
   interdental cleaning devices to control the interdental inflammation.
   Method: For this investigation, 39 subjects were recruited. They were
   examined for plaque and gingivitis using the criteria of Turesky
   modification of the Quigley-Hein index and the papillary bleeding index.
   Plaque and gingivitis were only scored interdentally. Following the
   baseline examination, the subjects were randomly assigned into 2 groups.
   The control group used a dentifrice identical to the test dentifrice but
   without triclosan/copolymer; subjects in this group were taught to brush
   their teeth with the modified Bass technique and were instructed to
   additionally use appropriate interdental cleaning devices. The test
   group used a dentifrice containing triclosan/copolymer (Colgate Total).
   They were not instructed to use interdental cleaning devices.
   Results: Both groups were re-examined after 4 weeks, and 4 and 7 months.
   In both groups, plaque and gingivitis levels were modestly reduced, more
   pronounced in the anterior and less in the posterior teeth.
   Conclusions: This investigation demonstrated that a dentifrice
   containing triclosan in combination with a copolymer can reduce plaque
   and gingival inflammation to levels comparable to regular interdental
   cleaning.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently experience
   intrahepatic HCC recurrence even after complete ablation of primary
   lesions. Because the oncogenic process may be different for hepatitis B
   viral (B-viral) and hepatitis C viral (C-viral) HCC, the present study
   was conducted to elucidate the factors contributing to HCC recurrence
   with respect to the infected hepatitis virus. Two hundred thirty-six
   patients with a single HCC lesion who underwent complete ablation of the
   tumor by PEIT and/or PMCT dr surgical resection at Tokyo University and
   its affiliated hospitals from 1993 to 1997 were enrolled. The patients
   were classified into 3 groups: the B-viral group, C-viral group, and
   NBNC group. After complete removal of tumors, the patients were followed
   for a mean period of 39 months. The factors contributing to HCC
   recurrence were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis using
   the Cox proportional hazard model. The rate of intrahepatic recurrence
   in enrolled patients at 1, 3, and 5: years was 19\%, 50\%, and 64\%,
   respectively. The intrahepatic recurrence rate in C-viral and B-viral
   HCC was higher than that in the NBNC-related HCC. Fibrosis staging,
   pathological grading of HCC, and serum AFP levels were significantly
   linked to intrahepatic recurrence by univariate analysis, and fibrosis
   staging was strongest in the multivariate analysis for C-viral HCC (P
   =.004). In contrast, fibrosis staging did not affect the recurrence in
   B-viral (P =.51) and NBNC-related (P =.77) HCC. Risk factors for HCC
   recurrence differed according to the infected viral state.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in modulating blood flow in
   normal and in several pathological conditions, and its levels seem to
   change with ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester
   (CAPE), an active component of propolis, exhibits antioxidant
   properties. This experimental study was designed to determine the
   changes in NO levels and the effect of CAPE on NO levels after
   testicular torsion/ detorsion in rats. Thirty-five adult male albino
   rats were divided into four groups: sham operation (n = 8), torsion (n =
   9), saline/detorsion (n = 9), and CAPE/detorsion (n = 9). Rats in the
   sham operation group were killed after the testes were handled without
   torsion. Rats in the torsion group were killed after 720 degrees
   clockwise testicular torsion for 2 h. CAPE was administered 30 min
   before detorsion in the CAPE/detorsion group and saline was administered
   in the saline/detorsion group. After 4 h of testicular detorsion in both
   of these groups, the rats were killed and bilateral orchiectomy was
   performed to determine the tissue levels of NO. The level of NO in the
   torsion group (113.77 +/- 33.18 nmol/g protein) was significantly higher
   than that of the sham operation group (64.53 +/- 29.64 nmol/g protein).
   In the saline/detorsion group, the NO level (31.26 +/- 12.58 nmol/g
   protein) was significantly lower than in the torsion and sham operation
   groups. CAPE administration in the CAPE/detorsion group seemed to raise
   the NO level (72.63 +/- 23.87 nmol/g protein) above the level of the
   sham operation group. Contralateral testes were not affected by the
   torsion/detorsion processes performed on the ipsilateral testes. These
   results show that NO levels increase with torsion and decrease with
   detorsion. CAPE administration seems to increase tissue NO levels and
   this may be important for protecting the testes from torsion/detorsion
   injuries.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless local area networks and indoor communications, multipath
   propagation limits the performance of data communications systems. To
   overcome the multipath propagation problem, a spread spectrum system has
   to be used. The chaotic communications technique, where inherently
   wide-band chaotic basis functions are used, offers a cheap alternative
   to conventional spread spectrum communications. Unfortunately, analytic
   expressions for the noise performance of chaotic modulation schemes are
   not available in the literature. This has so far prevented a full
   exploitation of the features of chaotic modulation schemes. By
   generalizing the waveform communications concept, this paper develops
   exact expressions for the noise performance of the coherent antipodal
   chaos shift keying (CSK), coherent differential chaos shift keying
   (DCSK), and differentially coherent DCSK modulation schemes. We show
   that the properties of the basis functions have no effect on the noise
   performance of a modulation scheme, provided that the energy per bit is
   constant, In this sense, the concept of waveform communications is
   generalized in the paper. Finally, our theoretical results are verified
   by computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Silanol groups in protonated magadiite (H-magadiite) were characterized

   and deuterated (D) magadiite were synthesized by the treatment of
   Na-rich magadiite with 0.2 N HCl and 0.2 N DCl, respectively. In the H-1
   NMR spectrum measured at room temperature, silanol groups of H-magadiite
   showed two signals at 3.75 and 5.70 ppm, indicating that two types of
   silanol groups were present. The ratio of silanol groups associated with
   strong hydrogen bonding (5.70 ppm) to those with weaker hydrogen bending
   (3.75 ppm) was 2 to 1. The H-2 NMR spectra of deuterated magadiite were
   measured in the temperature range from 150 to 440 K. In the spectra
   measured at temperatures below 294 K, silanol groups showed Pake doublet
   patterns. These patterns were composed of two components corresponding
   to the two types of silanol groups shown in the H-1 NMR analysis. Both
   silanol groups produced wobbling motions with increasing temperature.
   Above 294 K, the profile of the Pake doublet pattern was transformed
   gradually to a near triangular pattern, indicating that the silanol
   groups underwent other motions also, such as a two-site jump.}},

Abstract = {{Several methods for dc voltage control of single-phase pulse width
   modulation ac/dc voltage-source converters are known. They differ in
   their performance and the complexity of the hardware and software they

   sinusoidal input current with unity power factor. However, global
   stability of the converter is not guaranteed by the methods proposed so
   far. This paper describes a new control method based on Lyapunov's
   direct method. It is shown that the converter can be stabilized globally
   to handle large signal disturbances. The closed-loop system not only
   ensures stability, but also exhibits excellent transient response for
   abrupt changes in the load. More importantly, the proposed control
   method can keep the advantages and remove the disadvantages of the
   existing methods. Computer simulations and experiments are presented to
   show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed control method

   solutions on distribution parameters of lanthanides(III) was determined.
   The extraction process can be described with taking into account the
   formation of {[}Ln(NO3)(3)(S)(j)] (j=3, 4) in organic phase. The
   extraction constants were estimated. It was established, that accounting
   tributylphosphate concentration in the phase of composite, extraction
   constants and isotherm shape for systems based on tributylphosphate are
   identical within the error of determination. In the case of
   trialkylmethylammonium nitrate those for composite are little greater

Abstract = {{Many complex chemical processes having a large number of process
   variables and poorly understood models can be controlled reasonably well
   by controlling only a small subset of process variables using an equally
   small number of manipulated variables. This is the central premise of
   this article and is referred to as partial control. Knowingly or
   unknowingly, this idea has been and continues to be applied to
   successfully control numerous complex industrial processes. Despite its
   widespread use, partial control has never been explicitly formulated.
   The partial control problem is defined A number of terms is introduced
   such as process variable dominance, modelable responses, practical
   degrees of freedom, and sufficiency of partial control. The new
   framework allows incorporation of both engineering-based decisions and
   more rigorous theoretical tools to achieve the goals of partial central.
   A number of practical examples illustrate the applicability of these

   Procedure. Five patients with GD2-positive LM tumors were injected with
   1-2 mCi intra-Ommaya (131)-l-3F8, a murine IgG3 antibody specific for
   GD2. Serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples and SPECT
   imagings (4, 24, and 48 hd were performed to predict radiation doses to
   the tumor and normal brain and blood prior to the administration of
   larger therapeutic doses. Results. Side effects included self-limited
   fever, headache, and vomiting. Focal (131)l-3F8 uptake consistent with
   tumors was seen along the craniospinal axis in four patients. Calculated
   radiation dose to the CSF was 14.9-56 cGy/mCi and to blood and other
   organs outside the CNS less than 2 cGy/ mCi. Conclusions.
   Intraventricular (131)l-3F8 successfully detected LM disease and

Abstract = {{The effect of a rising rigidity and surface hydrophobicity of the 11S
   storage protein from faba beans - legumin - induced by chemical
   modification with dimethylsuberimidate (DMS) on some surface functional
   properties was studied. Short-time adsorption kinetics using a
   droplet-volume tensiometer, pressure transformation and desorption
   behaviour of monolayer using a film balance, and emulsifying and foaming
   properties were determined to characterize surface activity and
   interfacial film forming behaviour. Tensio-active properties at the
   air-water interface, i.e. decay in surface tension and pressure
   transformation in monolayer, were improved by modification. However, a
   decrease in emulsifying activity, foam capacity and foam expansion after
   modification of the legumin points to an overall deterioration of
   energy-induced film forming behaviour. The results support the view that
   surface activity is generally governed more by molecular flexibility
   than by surface hydrophobicity.}},

Abstract = {{One explanation for discrepant results between epidemiologic studies and
   randomized trials of beta -carotene and cardiovascular disease may be a
   failure to consider inflammation as a confounder. To evaluate the
   potential for such confounding, the authors relate the serum
   concentrations of five carotenoids (alpha -carotene, beta -carotene,
   beta -cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin) to levels of three
   inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and white blood
   cell count) measured during the Third National Health and Nutrition
   Survey, 1988-1994. The analysis included 4,557 nonsmoking participants
   aged 25-55 years. Adjusted concentrations of all five carotenoids were
   significantly lower in those with C-reactive protein levels above 0.88
   mg/dl (p = 0.001). There was a trend toward lower adjusted beta
   -cryptoxanthin concentrations with increasing level of fibrinogen (p
   value test for trend = 0.01), but other carotenoids were not related.
   Many of the carotenoid concentrations were lower among participants with
   high white blood cell counts. After log transformation, only adjusted
   mean beta -carotene levers were significantly lower in those with white
   blood cell counts above 7.85 x 10(9)/liter (p < 0.01). These
   cross-sectional data do not clarify the biologic relation between
   carotenoids and C-reactive protein but, to the extent that the
   carotenoids are associated with C-reactive protein levels, a
   carotenoid-heart disease association may be, in part, an
   inflammation-heart disease association.}},

   are four symmetrically distinct Pb2+ cations in irregular coordination
   polyhedra due to the effect of stereoactive st lone-electron pairs. The
   structure is based upon double {[}O2Pb3] chains of {[}O(1)Pb-4] and
   {[}O(2)Pb-4] oxocentred tetrahedra and CO3 groups. The {[}O2Pb3] chains
   are parallel to the c axis, whereas the CO3 groups are parallel to the

   13.474(4) Angstrom, V= 324.8(1) Angstrom (3) Z = 2 and has been solved
   by direct methods. There are two symmetrically distinct Pb2+ cations in
   asymmetric coordination polyhedra due to the effect of stereoactive s(2)
   lone-electron pairs. The single symmetrically unique Na+ cation is in
   trigonal prismatic coordination. The structure is based on hexagonal
   sheets of Pb atoms. Within these sheets, Pb atoms are located at
   vertices of a 3(6) net, such that each Pb atom has six adjacent Pb atoms
   that are similar to5.3 Angstrom away. Two sheets are stacked in a
   close-packing arrangement, forming layers that contain the (CO3) groups.
   The layers are linked by OH groups that are linearly coordinated by two
   Pb2+ cations. Naf cations are located between the layers. The structure
   is closely related to the structures of other lead hydroxide carbonates
   (leadhillite, macphersonite, susannite, hydrocerussite,
   `plumbonacrite').}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the role of hydrogen trapping in steel. Trapping
   increases the solubility of hydrogen and decreases the diffusivity.
   Traps are characterized by their nature, i:e., reversible or
   irreversible, saturable or unsaturable. A dislocation core is a
   saturable, reversible trap, while voids and crack are unsaturable,
   reversible traps. A trap model based on saturable, reversible traps is
   developed, which is slightly different from the trap model of McNabb and
   Foster. In equilibrium, the trap model corresponds to Oriani's trap
   model. Kumnick and Johnson found experimentally that the trap density
   increases as the plastic strain increases. Using their trap data, it is
   shown that equilibrium between hydrogen in lattice sites and trap sites
   can be assumed when strain rates are used as in standard tensile tests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes results of the application of simple metabolic

   utilisation of a semi-synthetic medium simulating dairy waste (whey).
   The theoretical yield coefficients (maximum, true and real) of biomass
   on lactose and oxygen, available electrons and ATP were determined and
   compared with experimental data. The experimental runs were performed in
   a B Brown fermenter (15 dm(3) of operating capacity). The yeast K
   fragilis was cultured in semi-synthetic medium containing lactose (40 g
   dm(-3)) as a main carbon and energy source and ammonia salts as a main
   nitrogen source (C/N = 8.74). The yeast growth is closely related to the
   concentration of oxygen in the media. The experimental yields of biomass
   on lactose and oxygen reached 94\% and 88\% of real maximum theoretical
   values, respectively. Calculated true biomass yield coefficients were
   closely correlated with the values resulting from the balance analysis
   of stoichiometric equations. The specific maintenance requirement
   (m(ATP)) was 14.7 mmole ATP(g DM h)(-1). Determination of the elemental
   composition of the biomass during the course of fermentation resulted in
   observations of the cellular C/N ratio changes. The conversion of
   lactose carbon to biomass and CO2 was 74.3\%-81.2\%. The recovery of ATP
   reached 79\%, and the recovery of oxygen 96.2\%. (C) 2000 Society of

Abstract = {{The goal of the current study was to determine the effects of
   cAMP-mediated coronary reactivity in conscious pigs with stunned
   myocardium induced by 1.5 h coronary stenosis (CS) and 12 h coronary
   artery reperfusion (CAR). Domestic swine (n = 5) were chronically
   instrumented with a coronary artery blood flow (CBF) probe, hydraulic
   occluder, left ventricular pressure gauge, wall-thickening crystals in
   the ischemic and nonischemic zones, and a coronary sinus catheter. The
   hydraulic occluder was inflated to induce a CS with a stable 38 +/- 1\%
   reduction in CBF for 1.5 h. Before flow reduction and during CAR,
   cAMP-induced coronary vasodilation was investigated by forskolin (20
   nmol.kg(-1).min(-1)). Enhanced CBF responses {[}+62 +/- 9\%, P < 0.05,
   compared with pre-CS (+37 +/- 3\%)] were observed for forskolin at 12 h
   after CAR as well as for bradykinin and reactive hyperemia. With the use
   of a similar protocol during systemic nitric oxide (NO) synthase
   inhibition with N-<omega>-nitro-L-arginine (30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) for 3
   days), the enhanced CBF responses to forskolin, bradykinin, and reactive
   hyperemia were not observed after CS. Isolated microvessel preparations
   from pigs (n = 8) also demonstrated enhanced NO production to direct
   stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin (+71 +/- 12\%) or NKH-477
   (+60 +/- 10\%) and administration of 8-bromo-cAMP (+74 +/- 13\%), which
   were abolished by protein kinase A or NO synthase inhibition. These data
   indicate that cAMP stimulation elicits direct coronary vasodilation and
   that this action is amplified in the presence of sustained myocardial
   stunning after recovery from CS. This enhanced cAMP coronary
   vasodilation is mediated by an NO mechanism that may be involved in
   myocardial protection from ischemic injury.}},

   (endurance (n = 166), power speed (n = 235), ``other{''} (n = 834)) and
   controls healthy at the age of 20 years (n = 743).
   Main outcome measures-Data on the occurrence of coronary heart disease
   were obtained from death certificates, three nationwide registers, and
   questionnaire studies in 1985 and 1995, and data on later physical
   activity were obtained from the questionnaires.
   Results-In 1985 all groups of former athletes were more physically
   active than controls (p<0.001). Despite similar total volumes of
   physical activity, compared with power speed athletes, former endurance
   athletes participated more often in vigorous activity (p = 0.006) and
   had less coronary heart disease (adjusted odds ratio 0.34, 95\%
   confidence interval 0.17 to 0.73; p = 0.004). In 1985 and 1995, both
   endurance and other athletes had less coronary heart disease than
   controls. From 1986 to 1995, the incidence of new coronary heart disease
   was lower among those who participated in vigorous physical activity in
   1985.
   Conclusions-Both a previous aptitude for endurance athletic events and
   continuity of vigorous physical activity seem to be associated with
   protection against coronary heart disease, but an aptitude for power
   speed events does not give protection against coronary heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{We study a model where buyers and sellers meet randomly. The meeting
   probabilities are endogenous and are derived from the basics of the
   model. The agents can decide to either search or wait, and the searchers
   are distributed on the waiters. Prices are determined by bargaining if
   exactly two agents are matched. If more than one agent of one type are
   matched with an agent of another type an auction ensues. There exist at
   most three equilibria, and when the numbers of buyers and sellers differ
   greatly one can argue that the equilibrium where the agents on the short
   side wait is the plausible one. We also study the relation of the model
   to the Walrasian markets, as well as to random matching models with
   bargaining only or auction only. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{We characterized the interphase cell death of 9L gliosarcoma after
   high-dose-rate, low-energy photon irradiation using the Photon
   Radiosurgery System (PRS), a novel device for interstitial radiotherapy.
   Within 24 hours after irradiation with a dose of 18 Gray, 22.0\% of
   cells underwent metabolic cell death, whereas dead cells in controls
   stayed less than 5.0\% (p < 0.005). In the majority of sensitive cells,
   loss of membrane integrity preceded the lethal morphological changes.
   The response was dose-dependent over the range of 9-18 Gray, but
   saturation was obtained over 18 Gray. On the other hand, a significant
   (p < 0.01) increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells with apoptotic
   morphology was detected 6-24 hours after irradiation, but the fraction
   remained 1.9-2.1\% of the population and was independent of the doses
   between 9 and 25 Gray. Apoptotic cells were rarely observed in the
   control cells (0.3-0.6\%). Our data indicate that single high-dose
   irradiation induces both necrotic and apoptotic interphase cell death in
   9L gliosarcoma, but rapid cell death mostly occurs through the
   non-apoptotic pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The authors sought to determine whether subjects with the
   sole diagnosis of depressive personality disorder are at higher risk for
   developing dysthymia and major depression than are healthy comparison
   subjects.
   Method: Eighty-five women with depressive personality disorder who had
   no comorbid axis or axis II disorders and 85 age-matched healthy
   comparison women were initially recruited and reinterviewed 3 years
   later to evaluate the cumulative incidence rate of dysthymia and major
   depression.
   Results: At the 3-year follow-up assessment, the women with depressive
   personality disorder had a significantly greater odds ratio for
   developing dysthymia than did the healthy comparison women. The
   difference in odds ratios for the development of major depression
   between women with and without depressive personality disorder did not
   reach statistical significance.
   Conclusions: The present study, the first to determine the subsequent
   development of dysthymia and major depression in subjects with the sole
   diagnosis of depressive personality disorder, found that subjects with
   depressive personality disorder had a greater risk of developing
   dysthymia than did healthy comparison subjects at 3-year follow-up.
   Findings of the current study also suggest that depressive personality
   disorder may mediate the effects of a family history of axis I unipolar
   mood disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Circulation waters from paper mills and TMP production were treated by
   selective ozonation to remove lipophilic wood extractives (LWE's). In
   the reaction model, ozone was assumed to react with overall organic
   matter measured as COD with one global reaction rate coefficient. The
   target compounds, LWE's, are a part of the overall organic matter and
   they react with ozone with a specific reaction rate coefficient.
   Reaction selectivity, defined as the ratio of reaction rate coefficients
   of the reactions of ozone with the LWE's and COD, describes how
   efficiently ozone is used to remove the LWE's compared to removal of
   COD. The reaction selectivity was determined from experimental results
   and it was found to vary from 3 to 20 for different sets of water and
   for different fractions of LWE's. However, the ozone dose needed for
   removal of extractives was found to be rather high, about 100 - 300
   mg/dm(3) for 50 \% removal. The reason is the high concentration of
   organic matter in the waters leading to excessive usage of ozone despite
   the high selectivity of the reaction. A reactor model was developed to
   predict the behavior of industrial ozonation reactors. The reactor model
   takes into account the variation in the rate coefficient with respect to
   the reaction extent.}},

Abstract = {{Ewing's sarcoma is a primitive highly malignant tumor of bone and soft
   tissues usually metastasizing to bone, bone marrow, and lung. Growth
   factor receptors and their ligands may be involved in its growth and
   dissemination. We analyzed the expression of c-kit and its ligand stem
   cell factor (SCF) in a panel of six Ewing's sarcoma cell lines. All cell
   lines exhibited substantial levels of surface c-kit expression, and five
   of six displayed transmembrane SCP on the cell surface. Expression of
   c-kit was down-modulated in all lines by exposure to exogenous SCF. The
   SCF treatment was able to confer to cells a growth advantage in vitro,
   due both to an increase in cell proliferation and to a reduction in the
   apoptotic rate. When used in the lower compartment of a migration
   chamber, SCF acted as a strong chemoattractant for Ewing's sarcoma
   cells. The pretreatment of cells with SCF reduced their chemotactic
   response to SCF. in athymic nude mice, Ewing's sarcoma cells injected
   intravenously metastasized to the lung and to a variety of
   extrapulmonary sites, including bone and bone marrow. Metastatic sites
   resembled those observed in Ewing's sarcoma patients and corresponded to
   SCF-rich microenvironments. The in vitro pretreatment of cells with SCF
   strongly reduced the metastatic ability of Ewing's sarcoma cells, both
   to the lung and to extrapulmonary sites. This could be dependent on the
   down-modulation of c-kit expression observed in SCF-pretreated cells,
   leading to a reduced sensitivity to the chemotactic and proliferative
   actions of SCF. Our results indicate that the response to SCF mediated
   by c-kit may be involved in growth, migration, and metastatic ability of
   Ewing's sarcoma cells.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, surveys of DNA sequence variation in natural
   populations of several Drosophila species and other taxa have
   established that polymorphism is reduced in genomic regions
   characterized by low rates of crossing over per physical length.
   Parallel studies have also established that divergence between species
   is not reduced in these same genomic regions, thus eliminating
   explanations that rely on a correlation between the rates of mutation
   and crossing over. Several theoretical models (directional hitchhiking,
   background selection, and random environment) have been proposed as
   population genetic explanations. In this study samples from an African
   population (n = 50) and a European population (n = 51) were surveyed at
   the su(s) (1955 bp) and su(omega) (3213 bp) loci for DNA sequence
   polymorphism, utilizing a stratified SSCP/DNA sequencing protocol. These
   loci are located near the telomere of the X chromosome, in a region of
   reduced crossing over per physical length, and exhibit a significant
   reduction in DNA sequence polymorphism. Unlike most previously surveyed,
   these loci reveal substantial skews toward rare site frequencies,
   consistent with the predictions of directional hitchhiking and random
   environment models and inconsistent with the general predictions of the
   background selection model (or neutral theory). No evidence for excess
   geographic differentiation at these loci is observed. Although linkage
   disequilibrium is observed between closely linked sites within these
   loci, many recombination events in the genealogy of the sampled alleles
   can be inferred and the genomic scale of linkage disequilibrium,
   measured in base pairs between sites, is the same as that observed for
   loci in regions of normal crossing over. We conclude that gene
   conversion must be high in these regions of low crossing over.}},

Abstract = {{2'-Deoxyadenosine was reacted with malonaldehyde in the presence of
   formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. The reactions were carried out at 37
   degreesC in aqueous solution at acidic conditions. The reaction mixtures
   were analyzed by HPLC. In both reactions, two major products were
   formed. The reaction products were isolated and purified by C18
   chromatography, and their structures were characterized by UV
   absorbance, fluorescence emission, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and
   mass spectrometry. The reaction products isolated from the mixture
   containing formaldehyde, malonaldehyde, and deoxyadenosine were
   identified as beta-(2'-deoxy-beta -D-ribofuranosyl)-7H-8-formyl
   {[}2,1-i] pyrimidopurine (M(1)FA-dA) and 9-( 2'-deoxy-beta
   -D-ribofuranosyl)-6-(3,5-diformyl-1,4-dihydro-1-pyrid (M(2)FA-dA). In
   the reaction mixture consisting of acetaldehyde, malonaldehyde, and
   deoxyadenosine, the identities of the products were determined to be
   3-(2'-deoxy-beta
   -D-ribofuranosyl)-7-methyl-8formyl{[}2,1i]pyrimidopurine (M-1-AA-dA) and
   9-(2'-deoxy-beta -D-ribofuranosyl)-6-(3,5-di (M(2)AA-dA). The yields of
   the compounds were 1.8 and 0.7\% for M(1)FA-dA and M(2)FA-dA,
   respectiviely, and 6.8 and 10\% for M(1)AA-dA and M(2)AA-dA,
   respectively. AU compounds exhibited marked fluorescent properties.
   These findings show that in addition to direct reaction of a specific
   aldehyde with 2'-deoxyadenosine, aldehyde conjugates also may react with
   the base. Although three of the adducts (M(1)FA-dA, M(2)FA-dA, and
   M(1)AA-dA) could not be detected in reactions carried out under neutral
   conditions, the possibility that trace anlounts of the adducts may be
   formed under physiological conditions cannot be ruled out. Therefore,
   conjugate adducts must be considered in work that aims at clarifying the
   mechanism of aldehyde genotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Shape-adaptive block-based texture coding schemes such as the
   shape-adaptive discrete cosine transform (SA-DCT) raise the need for an
   architecture which performs efficiently the transform of variable length
   N. For an implementation requiring standard DCT and SA-DCT, it is
   advantageous to have a VLSI architecture which can be configured to
   compute both schemes. Existing fast algorithms usually consider only the
   standard DCT of fixed-size length and lack regular structure leading to
   complex routing. This paper discusses two different architectures
   satisfying the given requirement in terms of scalability, modularity,
   and regularity, The first proposed architecture represents a
   time-recursive fully modular, but nonefficient, structure regarding the
   number of operation counts. The second proposed feedforward architecture
   overcomes problems of numerical instability found in time-recursive
   structure, Both architectures are modeled in VHDL and synthesized using
   an 0.7-mum two metal-layers CMOS technology for comparison, The design
   in VHDL is kept generic so that new SA-DCT cores can be easily generated
   to produce application tailored circuits.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to maintain upright body posture depends on the
   biomechanical properties of a body and on the execution of control
   programs. The aim of this study was to determine how the structural
   growth of the human body, between ages 7-18, affects spontaneous sway
   parameters and to determine how the visual feedback positional task
   changes body sway parameters. The selected parameters of postural sway
   were evaluated in 57 children aged 7-18, while they stood with their
   feet together for 30 s. The experiment consisted of two different tasks:
   free standing with no feedback (No feedback), and free standing with
   additional Visual feedback (Feedback). No statistically significant
   correlation between sway parameters and developmental factors (body
   height, body mass, and age) in the No Feedback task was found.
   Statistically significant correlations were found between age and most
   of the sway parameters in the Feedback task. The execution of voluntary
   feedback resulted in an increase in the total sway (20\%), while the
   total area decreased nearly two-times. The invariance of sway amplitude
   supports the view that the same activation patterns can be utilized by
   children aged 7-18, despite the changes in body dimensions. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Highly monodisperse micron-sized polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles
   crosslinked with carboxylic group-containing urethane acrylates (CUA)
   were produced by simple dispersion polymerization in methanol. In proper
   condition, CUA employed as a crosslinker had an excellent ability to
   achieve the monodisperse PMMA particles to the concentration of about 10
   wt\%. This arose from the fact that CUA formed monomer-swellable primary
   particles due to its structurally long tetramethylene oxide groups in
   the molecule. The influence of the concentrations of the initiator and
   CUA on the particle diameter (D-n), particle number density (N-p), and
   polymerization rate (R-p) was found to obey the following approximate
   relationship, D-n proportional to {[}initiator](0.41){[}CUA](-0.06), N-p
   proportional to {[}initiator](-1.22) {[}CUA](0.21), and R-p proportional
   to {[}initiator](0.34 +/-0.03), respectively. The power law dependence
   of D-n and N-p on the initiator concentration coincided well with that
   of linear polymers in the literature. Especially, in this study, it was
   found that CUA did not have a serious influence on the nucleation.
   However, the dependence of R-p on the initiator concentration was
   observed to be higher than that of linear polymers, suggesting that
   uniquely, the solution polymerization process competed with the
   heterogeneous polymerization during polymerization, because of the
   crosslinked network structure of the primary particles. (C) 2000 Kluwer

Abstract = {{A new approach to the analysis of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)
   spectra, based on the least-squared fitting, is proposed for
   characterization of broad-band multilayer antireflection (AR) coatings
   and semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), The model formula for ASE
   spectra contains eight fitting parameters, representing the parabolic
   approximation of spontaneous emission and gain spectra, together with
   the linear approximation of refractive index dispersion, By zone fitting
   to the segmented experimental data after AR coating, a stepwise
   reflectivity estimate is obtained. Double-layer AR-coated 1.3 mum
   InGaAsP MQW SOAs were fabricated and evaluated. For the best samples,
   minimum reflectivities on the order of 10(-6) and bandwidths (for R < 1
   x 10(-4)) of about 50 nm were reproducibly obtained. Reliability of the
   analysis procedure was checked on the basis of relevance of various
   physical parameters, bias current dependance, and reproducibility of the
   extrapolation procedure, Being noise-resistant and applicable to wider
   spectral range, the new method is confirmed to be a significant
   improvement over the standard ASE analysis procedure (i.e., the
   conventional Hakki-Paoli (HP) method).}},

Abstract = {{In conventional video-on-demand systems, video data are stored in a
   video server for delivery to multiple receivers over a communications
   network. The video server's hardware limits the maximum storage capacity
   as well as the maximum number of video sessions that can concurrently be
   delivered. Clearly, these limits will eventually be exceeded by the
   growing need for better video quality and larger user population. This
   paper studies a parallel video server architecture that exploits server
   parallelism to achieve incremental scalability. First, unlike data
   partition and replication, the architecture employs data striping at the
   server level to achieve fine-grain load balancing across multiple
   servers. Second, a client-pull service model is employed to eliminate
   the need for interserver synchronization. Third, an admission-scheduling
   algorithm is proposed to further control the instantaneous load at each
   server so that linear scalability can be achieved. This paper analyzes
   the performance of the architecture by deriving bounds for server
   service delay, client buffer requirement, prefetch delay, and scheduling
   delay. These performance metrics and design tradeoffs are further
   evaluated using numerical examples. Our results show that the proposed
   parallel video server architecture can be linearly scaled up to more
   concurrent users simply by adding more servers and redistributing the
   video data among the servers.}},

Abstract = {{A nation-wide measles outbreak occurred in 1988 in Taiwan. A
   retrospective cohort study was conducted to define the protective titre
   of measles neutralising (NT) antibody. Paired sera collected in 1987 and
   1988 were available from 190 individuals born in 1984 who had
   participated in an annual hepatitis B immunisation follow-up from 1986
   to 1991. Measles NT titres were quantified using a standardised
   neutralisation enzyme immunoassay. Measles infection was defined as a
   greater than or equal to4-fold rise in NT titre or seroconversion
   between paired sera. Symptomatic measles infection was ascribed to
   individuals who had measles infection and who reported measles-like
   symptoms between 1987 and 1988. Results demonstrated a dose-response
   relationship between pre-exposure NT titres and protection against
   measles infection. 47 of 48 individuals with measles infection in 1988
   had preexposure NT titres less than or equal to1,017 mlU/ml; all 12
   symptomatic cases had pre-exposure NT titres less than or equal to 434
   mlU/ml. Eleven vaccinees had preexposure NT titres <50 mlU/ml, of whom
   nine developed asymptomatic infection. The study suggests that measles
   NT titres >1,000 mlU/ml may prevent measles infection and NT titres >500
   mlU/ml may prevent symptomatic infection but vaccinees with undetectable
   or low NT titres may not necessarily be susceptible to symptomatic
   infection. J. Med. Virol. 62:511-517, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Copper electrodeposits with the {[}111] orientation were obtained from a
   copper sulfate bath consisting of 280 g/l CuSO(4)5H(2)O and 80 g/l H2SO4
   at 30 degreesC. The cathode current density was 900 to 1300 A/m(2).
   Dislocations in the electrodeposits were characterized using
   transmission electron microscopy. Dislocations in each of the (111)
   grains could be classified into two groups. One group belonged to high
   density dislocation bundles radiating from one small area, and another
   group was located between the bundles. The dislocations in the first
   group were directed along the {[}112] directions parallel to the (111)
   plane and of the edge type. About 42 pct of the dislocations in the
   second group were also parallel to the (111) plane and of the mixed
   type. In summary, the majority of dislocations in the (111) grains was
   of edge type lying on the (111) plane. (C) 2000 Kluwer Academic

Abstract = {{Splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) is a B-cell chronic
   lymphoproliferative disorder. Splenectomy and/or chlorambucil (CLB) are
   usually regarded as the most effective treatment in SLVL patients.
   However, a few patients relapse and the second line therapy remains
   questionable. Although 2-Cda has been evaluated in patients with chronic
   lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL), it has been
   reported as the treatment of SLVL in only one case report. Therefore, we
   have evaluated its efficacy and toxicity in 7 SLVL patients. The median
   duration between diagnosis and treatment was 18 months (range, 1 to 59),
   The patients received 2-CdA (0.1 mg/kg/d) by venous infusion for 7 days
   with a median number of 1 cycle (range, 1 to 2) either as a first line
   therapy tone patient) or after a failure of other therapies
   (splenectomy, chemotherapy).
   Two patients achieved a complete response. The first one maintained his
   CR during a follow-up of 9 months and then relapsed; the second patient
   remained in CR after a follow-up of 20 months. Four patients achieved a
   partial response and relapsed after a median follow-up of 3.5 months
   (range, 1 to 4), One patient had no response. The treatment was not well
   tolerated with many infectious events. In the limits of our study, 2-Cda
   does not appear to be efficient therapy for SLVL and is not well
   tolerated for patients in relapse after splenectomy or resistant to CLB.}},

Abstract = {{Larvae of the nudibranch mollusc Phestilla sibogae metamorphose in
   response to a small organic compound released into seawater by their
   adult prey, the scleractinian coral Porites compressa. The
   transformations that occur during metamorphosis, including loss of the
   ciliated velum (swimming organ), evacuation of the shell, and bodily
   elongation, are thought to be controlled by a combination of neuronal
   and neuroendocrine activities. Activation of peripheral chemosensory
   neurons by the metamorphosis-inducing compound should therefore elicit
   changes within the central nervous system. We used extracellular
   recording techniques in an attempt to detect responses of neurons within
   the larval central ganglia to seawater conditioned by P. compressa, to
   seawater conditioned by the weakly inductive coral Pocillopora
   damicornis, and to non-inductive seawater controls. The activity
   patterns within the nervous systems of semi-intact larvae changed in
   response to both types of coral exudates. Changes took place in two size
   classes of action potentials, one of which is known to be associated
   with velar ciliary arrests.}},

Abstract = {{The Lassa virus glycoprotein consists of an amino-terminal and a
   carboxy-terminal cleavage fragment designated GP-1 and GP-2,
   respectively, that are derived by proteolysis from the precursor GP-C.
   The membrane-anchored GP-2 obtained from purified virions of the Josiah
   strain revealed the N-terminal tripeptide GTF(262) when analyzed by
   Edman degradation. Upstream of this site, GP-C contains the tetrapeptide
   sequence RRLL259, which is conserved in all Lassa virus isolates
   published to date. Systematic mutational analysis of vector-expressed
   GP-C revealed that the motif R-X (L/I/V)-L-259 (where X stands for L, I,
   or V) is essential for cleavage of the peptide bond between leucine(259)
   and glycine(260). This cleavage motif is homologous to the consensus
   sequence recognized by a novel class of cellular endoproteases which
   have so far not been implicated in the processing of viral

Abstract = {{Those afflicted with bipolar disorder often suffer from substantial
   functional impairment both when in episode and when in remission. This
   study examined the psychometric properties of a brief assessment of
   psychosocial functioning, the Range of Impaired Functioning Tool
   (LIFE-RIFT), among subjects with bipolar I disorder. The study sample
   consisted of 163 subjects who presented with bipolar I disorder at
   intake into the NIMH Collaborative Depression Study (CDS). All LIFE-RIFT
   items come from the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE).
   Follow-up data that were used to examine the reliability and validity of
   the scale come from assessments of psychosocial functioning that were
   conducted 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after intake into the CDS. The
   results of factor analyses indicate that the scale items are measures of
   one construct, psychosocial functioning. The interrater agreement on the
   scale score was very good with an intraclass correlation coefficient was
   0.94. The internal consistency reliability among the scale items was
   uniformly satisfactory over the four assessment periods, with
   coefficient alpha ranging from 0.78 to 0.84. Mixed-effect regression
   analyses showed that during mood episodes subjects were significantly
   more impaired than those in recovery. In conclusion, the psychometric
   properties of the LIFE-RIFT were examined in subjects with bipolar I
   disorder. The analyses from this longitudinal, observational study
   provide empirical support for the reliability and validity of the scale.
   The LIFE-RIFT provides a brief, inexpensive alternative to scales
   currently used to assess psychosocial functioning and can be easily
   added to semistructured assessments that are used in clinical and
   treatment outcome studies.}},

Abstract = {{The Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale was used to investigate

   Previous research had suggested that differences by gender and grade

   however, few studies reported subscale scores. In this population,
   gender was not a significant variable for global self-concept.
   Significant gender differences were observed on three subscales:
   Behavior, Intellectual and School Status, and Anxiety. Females rated
   themselves higher on the first two and males on the latter. School level
   was a significant variable for global self-concept: students in junior
   high school reported lower self-concept than did students in either
   elementary school or high school. Similar results were observed with the
   Behavior subscale. The present study supports the view that a global
   score for self-concept can mask underlying differences when subscale
   scores are summed.}},

   a modem perspective on this classical family of derivative-free

   are characterized by the absence of the construction of a model of the

   methods and discuss what research in the intervening years has uncovered
   about these algorithms. In particular, while the original direct search
   methods were consciously based on straightforward heuristics, more
   recent analysis has shown that in most - but not all - cases these
   heuristics actually suffice to ensure global convergence of at least one
   subsequence of the sequence of iterates to a first-order stationary

Abstract = {{Background: Changes in brain gene expression are thought to be
   responsible for the tolerance, dependence, and neurotoxicity produced by
   chronic alcohol abuse, but there has been no large scale study of gene
   expression in human alcoholism.
   Methods: RNA was extracted from postmortem samples of superior frontal
   cortex of alcoholics and nonalcoholics. Relative levels of RNA were
   determined by array techniques. We used both cDNA and oligonucleotide
   microarrays to provide coverage of a large number of genes and to allow
   cross-validation for those genes represented on both types of arrays.
   Results: Expression levels were determined for over 4000 genes and 163
   of these were found to differ by 40\% or more between alcoholics and
   nonalcoholics. Analysis of these changes revealed a selective
   reprogramming of gene expression in this brain region, particularly for
   myelin-related genes which were downregulated in the alcoholic samples.
   In addition, cell cycle genes and several neuronal genes were changed in
   expression.
   Conclusions: These gene expression changes suggest a mechanism for the
   loss of cerebral white matter in alcoholics as well as alterations that
   may lead to the neurotoxic actions of ethanol.}},

   burning demonstrated that the surface settlement was riot only related
   to the temperature variation, but also related to the water migration.
   When reducing the permeability coefficient of the rock mass greatly, the
   settlement increases only slightly due to the decrease of the pore water
   drainage. When increasing the conductivity slightly, the settlement

Abstract = {{The mid to outer neritic carbonates of the Gambier Limestone (Upper
   Eocene to lower Middle Miocene) can be divided into seven units by using
   criteria of sequence stratigraphy and foraminiferal biofacies. The
   boundaries fall mainly on erosional surfaces, even though the temporal
   duration of these surfaces appears to be largely beyond the resolution
   of foraminiferal biostratigraphy. The Eocene/Oligocene contact is
   distinctively unconformable in several sections, with at least part of
   the Upper Eocene sediments missing. Chert nodules, common to abundant in
   most sections, are associated with deep- or cool-water benthic
   assemblages (> 100-200 m and < 15 degreesC), indicating cool,
   nutrient-rich bottom conditions probably influenced by the Antarctic
   Circumpolar Current beginning during the Early Oligocene. The
   mid-Oligocene fall in sea-level was probably coupled with a major local
   uplift that removed at least part of the Lower Oligocene, an event
   widely recorded in the Australian-New Zealand region. In areas weakly
   affected, this glacioeustatic lowstand is represented by chert-free
   limestone and grey to pink dolomites in some sections, with a poorly
   preserved assemblage comprising few planktonic and deep-water benthic
   species. Local unconformities separate regional unconformity-bounded or
   allostratigraphic packages of strata to represent third-order sequences.
   Although variations in local subsidence might have influenced
   accumulation space and sediment thickness, glacioeustatic influence on
   the packaging of the sequences and units of the Gambier Limestone was
   easily the more effective and concordant with the global patterns.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory well-mixed, constant supersaturation, semi-batch gibbsite
   precipitator, with clear liquor advance, was modelled using a
   discretized population balance (DPB). This experimental configuration is
   inherently non-stationary (i.e. does not reach steady state). The model
   predictions of the transient crystal size distribution (CSD) were found
   to give good agreement to the experimental CSDs initially but deviated
   apart with time. The cause of this deviation was identified as error
   propagated in the computation of the DPB model. The source of the
   propagated error was investigated. The error contributions from the
   growth and agglomeration term discretizations were found to be small
   compared to the magnitude of the observed deviation. Monte Carlo
   simulation demonstrated that the main contribution to the observed error
   is from uncertainty in the estimates of the agglomeration kernel and
   growth rate parameters, which are estimated from experimental data and
   used in the simulation. The findings highlight the need for more precise
   kinetics estimation procedures and advocate care when simulating the CSD
   of non-stationary precipitators over longer time scales, which may have
   implications for precipitator start-up simulations. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The vertebrate brain develops from a bilaterally symmetric neural tube
   but later displays profound anatomical and functional asymmetries.
   Despite considerable progress in deciphering mechanisms of visceral
   organ laterality, the genetic pathways regulating brain asymmetries are
   unknown. In zebrafish, genes implicated in laterality of the viscera
   (cyclops/nodal, antivin/lefty and pitx2) are coexpressed on the left
   side of the embryonic dorsal diencephalon, within a region corresponding
   to the presumptive epiphysis or pineal organ. Asymmetric gene expression
   in the brain requires an intact midline and Nodal-related factors.
   RNA-mediated rescue of mutants defective in Nodal signaling corrects
   tissue patterning at gastrulation, but fails to restore left-sided gene
   expression in the diencephalon. Such embryos develop into viable adults
   with seemingly normal brain morphology. However, the pineal organ, which
   typically emanates at a left-to-medial site from the dorsal diencephalic
   roof, becomes displaced in position. Thus, a conserved signaling pathway
   regulating visceral laterality also underlies an anatomical asymmetry of
   the zebrafish forebrain.}},

   in March 1999. More than 20 industry sectors are affected including the
   entire coating industry. The key features of this new directive like
   timetable, limits, control, etc. will be presented. The example of the
   vehicle refinishing sector shows how legislation process and product
   development strategy can fit together in order to achieve ecologically
   and economically sound solutions for the market. The product portfolio,
   designed for the years after 2000, is already available today. Bodyshops
   already working with the new technology demonstrate that the vehicle
   refinishing sector is well prepared to comply economically with the new
   directive. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the large-buffer asymptotics for a multiplexer which
   serves N types of heterogeneous sessions which have long-tailed session
   lengths. Specifically, the model considered is that sessions of type i
   is an element of \{1, ..., N\} arrive as a Poisson process with rate
   lambda (i) Each type of session (independently) remains active for a
   random duration, say tau (i), where P(tau (i) > x) similar to alpha
   (i)x(-(1+betai)) for positive numbers alpha (i) and beta (i). While
   active, a session transmits at a rate ri. Under the assumption that the
   average load rho = Sigma (N)(i=l) r(i)lambda E-i{[}tau (i)] < C, where C
   denotes the server capacity, we show that both the tail distribution of
   the stationary buffer content and the loss asymptotics in finite buffers
   of size z behave approximately as z(-kJ0), where k(J0) depends not only
   on the <beta>(i) but also on the transmission rates r(i): it is the
   ratio of beta (i) to r(i) which determines K-J0 When specialized to the
   homogeneous case, i.e., when r(i) = r and beta (i) = beta for all i, the
   result coincides with results reported in the literature which have been
   shown under more restrictive hypotheses. Finally, it is a simple
   observation that light-tailed sessions only have the effect of reducing
   the available capacity for long-tailed sessions, but do not contribute
   otherwise to the definition of K-J0.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1599-1606}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To establish the dose-response relationship for the induction
   of chromosomal instability in GM10115 cells exposed to high-energy iron
   ions (1 GeV/nucleon, mean LET 146keV/mum) and gold ions (11GeV/nucleon,
   mean LET 1450keV/mum). Past work has established that sparsely ionizing
   X-rays can induce a long-lived destabilization of chromosomes in a
   dose-dependent manner at an incidence of similar to3\% per gray. The
   present investigation assesses the capacity of High-Z and High-energy
   (HZE) particles to elicit this same endpoint.
   Materials and methods: Clonal populations derived from single progenitor
   cells surviving heavy-ion irradiation were analyzed cytogenetically to
   identify those clones showing a persistent destablization of
   chromosomes.
   Results: Dose-response data, with a particular emphasis at low dose
   (<1.0 Gy), indicate a frequency of <similar to>4\% per gray for the
   induction of chromosomal instability in clones derived, from single
   progenitor cells surviving exposure to iron ions. The induction of
   chromosomal instability by gold ions was, however, less responsive to
   applied dose, as the observed incidence of this phenotype varied from 0
   to 10\% over 1-8 Gy. Both iron and gold ions gave dose-dependent
   increases in the yield of chromosomal aberrations (both chromosome- and
   chromatid-type) measured at the first mitosis following irradiation, as
   well as shoulderless survival curves having D-0 = 0.87 and 1.1 Gy
   respectively.
   Conclusions: Based on the present dose-response data, the relative
   biological effectiveness of iron ions is 1.3 for the induction of
   chromosomal instability, and this indicates that heavy ions are only
   slightly more efficient than X-rays at eliciting this delayed phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic approach to quantifying the
   effectiveness of compliant grasps and fixtures of an object. The
   approach is physically motivated and applies to the grasping of two- and
   three-dimensional objects by any number of fingers. The approach is
   based on a characterization of the frame-invariant features of a grasp
   or fixture stiffness matrix. In particular, we define a set of
   frame-invariant characteristic stiffness parameters, and provide
   physical and geometric interpretation for these parameters. Using a
   physically meaningful scheme to make the rotational and translational
   stiffness parameters comparable, we define a frame-invariant quality
   measure, which we call the stiffness quality measure, An example of a
   frictional grasp illustrates the effectiveness of the quality measure.
   We then consider the optimal grasping of frictionless polygonal objects
   by three and four fingers, Such frictionless grasps are useful in
   high-load fixturing applications, and their relative simplicity allows
   an efficient computation of the globally optimal finger arrangement. We
   compute the optimal finger arrangement in several examples, and use
   these examples to discuss properties that characterize the stiffness
   quality measure.}},

   curl-type and wave-type. A large depth of cut contributes to the
   formation of the wave-type burr. With high feed rate, the cutting edge
   of the tool is chipped, with a built-up edge. At high cutting speeds,
   small masses of material from the rake face of the tool can come off.
   With large depth of cut, large cavities can be created in the rake face

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Diabetic subjects have a 3- to 6-fold increased
   risk for stroke compared with nondiabetic subjects, and hyperinsulinemia
   shows strong and consistent associations with a cluster of
   cardiovascular risk factors. Methods separating proinsulin from (true)
   insulin have demonstrated proinsulin to be more strongly associated with
   cardiovascular disease than insulin. The present study evaluates the
   associations between first-ever stroke, proinsulin, and insulin.
   Methods-In this incident case-referent study of a nondiabetic
   population, 94 cases of first-ever stroke (59 men and 35 women) were
   individually age- and sex-matched to 178 referents. Blood sampling was
   collected before the stroke event. Proinsulin and insulin were measured
   with highly sensitive 2-site sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assays.
   Results-In the study population, high proinsulin concentration more than
   tripled the risk for first-ever stroke after adjustments for total
   cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking, body mass index, and
   insulin, with an odds ratio of 3.4 (95\% CI, 1.4 to 8.4). In women the
   risk was even more pronounced, with an odds ratio of 13.7 (95\% CI, 1.3
   to 146). Synergy was found between proinsulin and systolic blood
   pressure. In women, synergy was also found between proinsulin and
   diastolic blood pressure as well as between insulin and both blood
   pressures.
   Conclusions-High levels of proinsulin may predict later occurrence of
   first-ever stroke in a nondiabetic population.}},

Title = {{A surgical technique for administering laser irradiation to rat incisor
   dentin}},
Journal = {{ANATOMICAL RECORD}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{260}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{359-365}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{With the advent of lasers in the field of dentistry, various methods
   have been used to expose dentin to laser irradiation. This was done
   indirectly through the alveolar bone, as well as directly on dentin
   wafers and on extracted human teeth. However, dentin is a vital tissue
   and the only way to show the ramifications of laser irradiation is by
   directly exposing the dentin to this energy source under in vivo
   conditions. In the present study we describe a highly reproducible
   method for accomplishing this. Male Sprague Dawley rats were
   anesthetized and an incision was made at the junction of the attached
   palatal mucosa and the unattached buccal mucosa parallel to the
   maxillary bones on both sides. This procedure exposed the underlying
   bone where a 2 mm square window, at a point 3 mm caudal and parallel to
   the gingival attachment, was cut out to the depth of the periodontal
   ligament. The site was flushed with a 0.9\% sterile sodium chloride
   solution and gently dried with gauze. The beam of the laser was focused
   in the middle of the 2 mm square window and a pre-determined energy
   level and pulse duration (2 W 50 ms or 10 W 50 ms) were selected. The
   focal length guide was held at right angles to the dentin surface and in
   contact with the maxilla at all times. The energy densities of either
   52.6 or 263.2 J/cm(2) were delivered to the `root' dentin by a single
   pulse. The survival rate was 92\%. The animals that died did so while
   under anesthesia and not after exposure to laser irradiation. The
   animals that survived tolerated the surgery and the laser irradition
   very well, regaining (and eventually surpassing) their initial weight 3
   days after the procedures were performed. The thickness of the dentin
   that was exposed to laser irradiation was not completely penetrated by
   the energy levels used. At both energy levels some dentinal tubules
   appeared blocked and evidence of melted dentin was apparent. However, at
   the higher energy level two distinct zones were observed in the
   funnel-shaped lesion. In the inner zone distinct dentinal tubules were
   not readily visible, while in the outer zone the tubules were opened and
   completely free of debris. This technique is highly reproducible and
   yields consistent results with little or no stress to the animals.
   Although the energy levels used did not penetrate the entire thickness
   of the dentin, the depth of penetration of the laser beam appears to be
   related to the energy level used and the thickness of the dentin layer
   present. Anat Rec 260:359-365, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   late-responding, tissue of a schwannoma. it is axiomatic that
   complication avoidance requires precise three-dimensional conformality
   between treatment and tumor volumes. This degree of conformality can
   only be achieved through complex multiisocenter planning. Alternative
   radiosurgery devices are generally limited to delivering one to four
   isocenters in a single treatment session. Although they can reproduce
   dose plans similar in conformality to early gamma knife dose plans by
   using a similar number of isocenters, they cannot reproduce the
   conformality of modern gamma knife plans based on magnetic resonance
   image-targeted localization and five to 30 isocenters.
   A disturbing trend is developing in which institutions without nongamma
   knife radiosurgery (GKS) centers are championing and/or shifting to
   hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for vestibular schwannomas.
   This trend appears to be driven by a desire to reduce complication rates
   to compete with modem GKS results by using complex multiisocenter
   planning. Aggressive advertising and marketing from some of these
   centers even paradoxically suggests biological superiority of
   hypofractionation approaches over single-dose radiosurgery for
   vestibular schwannomas. At the same time these centers continue to use
   the term radiosurgery to describe their hypofractionated radiotherapy
   approach in an apparent effort to benefit from a GKS ``halo effect.{''}
   It must be reemphasized that as neurosurgeons our primary duty is to
   achieve permanent tumor control for our patients and not to eliminate
   complications at the expense of potential late recurrence. The answer to
   minimizing complications while maintaining maximum tumor control is
   improved conformality of radiosurgery dose planning and not resorting to
   homeopathic radiosurgery doses or hypofractionation radiotherapy
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium in which keratinocytes
   progressively undergo terminal differentiation towards the skin surface
   leading to programmed cell death. In this respect we studied the role of
   caspases. Here, we show that caspase-14 synthesis in the skin is
   restricted to differentiating keratinocytes and that caspase-14
   processing is associated with terminal epidermal differentiation, The
   pro-apoptotic executioner caspases-3, -6, and -7 are not activated
   during epidermal differentiation. Caspase-14 does not participate in
   apoptotic pathways elicited by treatment of differentiated keratinocytes
   with various death-inducing stimuli, in contrast to caspase-3. In
   addition, we show that non-cornifying oral keratinocyte epithelium does
   not express caspase-14 and that the parakeratotic regions of psoriatic
   skin lesions contain very low levels of caspase-14 as compared to normal
   stratum corneum. These observations strongly suggest that caspase-14 is
   involved in the keratinocyte terminal differentiation program leading to
   normal skin cornification, while the executioner caspases are not
   implicated.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the Box family of homeoproteins and their cofactors play a
   central role in pattern formation of all germ layers, During
   postembryonic development of C. elegans, non-gonadal mesoderm arises
   from a single mesoblast cell M. Starting in the first larval stage, M
   divides to produce 14 striated muscles, 16 non-striated muscles, and two
   non-muscle cells (coelomocytes). We investigated the role of the C,
   elegans Hox cluster and of the exd ortholog ceh-20 in patterning of the
   postembryonic mesoderm, By examining the M lineage and its
   differentiation products in different Hox mutant combinations, we found
   an essential but overlapping role for two of the Hox cluster genes,
   lin-39 and mab-5, in diversification of the postembryonic mesoderm, This
   role of the two Hox gene products required the CEH-20 cofactor. One
   target of these two Hox genes is the C, elegans twist ortholog hlh-8,
   Using both in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that twist is a
   direct target of Hox activation, We present evidence from mutant
   phenotypes that twist is not the only target for Hox genes in the M
   lineage: in particular we show that lin-39 mab-5 double mutants exhibit
   a more severe M lineage defect than the hlh-8 null mutant.}},

Abstract = {{The current status of stroke rehabilitation in Japan was reviewed from
   the perspectives of epidemiology, structures, outcomes and research.
   Japan is the fastest aging society in the world, facing a rapid increase
   in its disabled population and ensuing healthcare costs, Although its
   mortality is decreasing, stroke is the most frequent cause of
   disability. Traditionally, stroke patients acutely admitted to general
   hospitals remained bed-ridden for months, hindering maximal functional
   gain. With more attention to the importance of rehabilitation, improved
   outcomes such as shorter length of stay, more functional gain and
   increased community discharge have resulted. Japan's healthcare system,
   characterized by universal coverage, equity and a mandatory fee
   schedule, has contributed to the world's longest life expectancy and the
   lowest infant mortality rate, but it has also lacked quality assurance,
   Under stringent economic conditions, drastic healthcare and welfare
   reform plans are being debated and pressure is mounting for more
   efficient stroke rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a kind of on-line wear condition monitoring system
   for marine diesel engines. The system consists of three functions i.e.
   particle detecting, lubricant quality detecting and shaft torque moment

   particles in lubricant with an on-line ferrograph so as to judge wear
   condition of tribe-pairs of the diesel engine. A vertical detector fixed
   is used for environment of the marine diesel engine in this system, and
   the rule of distribution of particles in the vertical detector fixed and
   the horizontal detector fixed are alike in substance. The system detects
   the relative variation of lubricant quality by the grid capacitance
   sensors in an on-line way, which consists of an upper capacitance and a
   lower capacitance and can distinguish the relative variation of the
   dielectric constant of lubricant caused by pollutants such as water,
   metal particles etc. The system detects the shaft torque moment and the
   instantaneous rotation velocity of the diesel engine with photoelectric
   sensors, and corresponds the wear condition with the power condition by
   the change of instantaneous rotation velocity due to burning pressure
   change, which is helpful to judge cylinder wear. (C) 2000 Published by

Abstract = {{Neuroblastoma is a solid tumor occurring usually in children less than 5
   years old. It has been difficult to distinguish neuroblastoma from other
   childhood tumors through morphological diagnosis. Urine homovanillic
   acid (HVA), which is a metabolite of dopamine, has been proposed as a
   diagnostic index. Although increased levels of a serotonin metabolite,
   5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (HIAA), have also been observed in urine
   samples of the patients, they were largely attributed to dietary amines.
   By using an HPLC system with electrochemical detection, which can
   simultaneously assay 12 monoamines and metabolites, we showed that HVA
   and HIAA are two of the most prominent monoamine metabolites in the
   medium after a neuroblastoma cell line (IMR-32) was cultured for 3 days.
   Moreover, we found that the levels of HVA and HIAA in the media are
   proportional to the cell densities. These results suggest that the
   levels of HVA and HIAA in tissue culture media, or in urine from
   patients whose dietary amines are well controlled, may provide a
   valuable diagnostic index for neuroblastoma. Copyright (C) 2000 John

   Detailed structural analyses reveal that whereas the intermolecular
   pi-pi stacking interactions connect NiL21 molecules into a

   interactions and the C-H . . . pi interactions link NiL22 molecules into
   a dimer. The pi-pi stacking interactions and the C-H . . . pi

   form a closed hydrophobic brick. In NiL21 one of the two phenyl rings

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Multiple platelet transfusions may induce
   alloimmunization. Platelet alloimmunization involves human leukocyte
   antigen (HLA) antibodies and platelet-specific antibodies, which
   recognize platelet glycoproteins. No data are available about the
   frequency and characteristics of platelet-specific antibodies in
   patients who have received multiple platelet transfusions in Taiwan.
   Methods: From June through December 1998, blood samples from 103
   patients who had received multiple platelet transfusions were submitted
   to our laboratory for examination of platelet antibodies. The samples
   were first screened for HLA antibodies or platelet-specific antibodies
   using a solid phase method. Positive sera were further tested using an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to identify the specificities
   of the alloantibodies.
   Results: Forty of the 103 patients who had received multiple platelet
   transfusions were positive for platelet-reactive antibodies. Further
   study using ELISA showed that 22 patients had both HLA and
   platelet-specific antibodies, 12 patients had HLA antibodies alone, and
   five patients produced platelet-specific antibodies in the absence of
   HLA antibodies. Most platelet-specific antibodies were found among
   patients who had HLA. antibodies: 81\% of platelet-specific antibodies
   were found in HLA-immunized patients. The most frequently involved
   platelet glycoprotein antigens were Ia/IIa and IIb/IIIa.
   Conclusions: HLA antibodies were the most frequently found
   platelet-reactive antibodies in Taiwanese patients who had received
   multiple transfusions, although platelet-specific antibodies were also
   common. The frequency of platelet-specific antibodies was not as low as
   previously reported.}},

Abstract = {{The prime aim of rhinosinusal surgical endoscopy is to safeguard the
   nasal mucosa and thereby maintain intact rhinosinusal physiology and
   complex functions. The endoscopic approach to the sellar region offers
   the best view of intrasellar structures and allows appropriate
   functioning of the ventilation system of the paranasal sinuses.
   The limitations of endoscopy depend on the type of lesion and local
   anatomy and are basically the same as those of the microscopic approach.
   Relative limitations are those of surgical endoscopy in general and
   include the need for a blood-free field the lack of a three-dimensional
   view and the need for specific training
   Trans-sphenoidal surgical endoscopy is only mildly invasive and
   well-tolerated by patients It has a low complication rate comprising
   major and minor complications. Major complications are generally
   intra-operative or arise in the immediate postoperative period and are
   caused by lesions to adjacent organs. Minor complications generally
   underestimated in neurosurgical literature on the classic microscopic
   approach, are markedly reduced when the two techniques are assessed by
   comparable criteria. In our experience of around a hundred patients
   treated at the Neurosurgical and Otorhinolaryngology Clinic, San Matteo
   Hospital, University of Pavia, there were no major complications,
   whereas the incidence of minor complications was around 5.4\%. Minor
   complications comprised lesions of the lamina papyracea (0.9\%),
   synechiae (3.6\%) and infections (0.9\%) all of which resolved with
   medical treatment
   Refinements to new technologies with monitored systems for both lavage
   and tissue removal and the possible evolution of a 3D view combined with
   specific training with an improvement in surgical dexterity have
   enhanced the mildly invasive features of this technique, making it the
   best approach to the sellar cavity safeguarding the viral functions of
   the paranasal sinuses such as mucociliary transport and rhinosinusal
   ventilation.}},

Abstract = {{A concept in frequency selective surface (FSS) technology that stems
   from Babinet's principle, whereby a hybrid of two closely coupled FSS, a
   layer of conducting elements and a layer of aperture elements are etched
   either side of a dielectric substrate,acronymed as complementary FSS
   (CFSS) is introduced. There are two narrow passbands separated by a
   distinct null. The CFSS creates electrically large elements from
   physically small ones to such an extent that a conventional lambda /2
   resonator in free space at the lower passband resonant frequency would
   be over three times longer than the dipole length employed in the CFSS.
   This passband is highly stable for normal and oblique TE and TM
   incidences, with less than 2\% frequency shift. A full wave modal
   analysis is developed and two integral equations (IEs), an electric
   field IE and a magnetic field IE, are derived. These IEs are coupled and
   this renders them suitable for the solution of the CFSS problem. The
   interlayer dielectric region is critical to the location of the
   passbands as well as the in-band loss. Results are presented for dipole
   and ring CFSS and compared with measured data up to 40GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates the immune system and
   induces increases in peripheral cytokines, which, in turn, affect the
   endocrine system. In particular, LPS-induced cytokines stimulate the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to increase levels of
   antiinflammatory-acting glucocorticoids. In the present work, we show
   that LPS directly stimulates interleukin (IL)-6 release by mouse
   pituitary folliculostellate (FS) TtT/GF tumor cells and FS cells of
   mouse pituitary cell cultures. The stimulatory effect of LPS was
   strongly enhanced in the presence of serum, suggesting that LPS is only
   fully active as a complex with LPS-binding protein (LBP). Both TtT/GF
   cells and mouse pituitaries expressed CD14, which binds the LPS/LBP
   complex, and Toll-like receptor type 4, which induces LPS signals. LPS
   increased phospoinositol turnover in TtT/GF cells and induced
   phosphorylation of p38 alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase and the
   inhibitor (I kappaB) of nuclear factor-kappa B. Nuclear factor-kappa B
   was activated by LPS in TtT/GF cells. Functional studies demonstrated
   that My4 (an antibody blocking the interaction between LPS/LBP and
   CD14), SB203580, (a specific inhibitor of p38 alpha mitogen-activated
   protein kinase phosphorylation), dexamethasone, and the messenger RNA
   translation inhibitor cycloheximide all inhibited LPS-induced IL-6
   production by TtT/GF cells and mouse pituitary FS cells. LPS-induced
   intrapituitary IL-6 may modulate the function of anterior pituitary
   cells during bacterial infection/inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{The soil nitrogen cycle was investigated in a pre-established Lolium
   perenne sward on a loamy soil and exposed to ambient and elevated
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations (350 and 700 muL L-1) and, at elevated
   {[}CO2], to a 3 degreesC temperature increase. At two levels of mineral
   nitrogen supply, N-(150 kgN ha(-1) y(-1)) and N+(533 kgN ha(-1) y(-1)),
   N-15- labelled ammonium nitrate was supplied in split applications over
   a 2.5-y period. The recovery of the labelled fertilizer N was measured
   in the harvests, in the stubble and roots, in the macro-organic matter
   fractions above 200 mum in size (MOM) and in the aggregated organic
   matter below 200 muM (AOM). Elevated {[}CO2] reduced the total amount of
   N harvested in the clipped parts of the sward. The harvested N derived
   from soil was reduced to a greater extent than that derived from
   fertilizer. At both N supplies, elevated {[}CO2] modified the allocation
   of the fertilizer N in the sward, in favour of the stubble and roots and
   significantly increased the recovery of fertilizer N in the soil
   macro-organic matter fractions. The increase of fertilizer N
   immobilization in the MOM was associated with a decline of fertilizer N
   uptake by the grass sward, which supported the hypothesis of a negative
   feedback of elevated {[}CO2] on the sward N yield and uptake. Similar
   and even more pronounced effects were observed for the native N
   mineralized in the soil. At N-, a greater part of the fertilizer N
   organized in the root phytomass resulted in an underestimation of N
   immobilized in dead roots and, in turn, an underestimation of N
   immobilization in the MOM. The 3 degreesC temperature increase
   alleviated the {[}CO2] effect throughout much of the N cycle,
   increasing; soil N mineralization, N derived from soil in the harvests,
   and the partitioning of the assimilated fertilizer N to shoots. In
   conclusion, at ambient temperature, the N cycle was slowed down under
   elevated {[}CO2], which restricted the increase in the aboveground
   production of the grass sward, and apparently contributed to the
   sequestration of carbon belowground. In contrast, a temperature increase
   under elevated {[}CO2] stimulated the soil nitrogen cycle, improved the
   N nutrition of the sward and restricted the magnitude of the soil C
   sequestration.}},

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesized that nitrogen-replete diatoms, but not
   flagellates, may release NO2-, NH4+ or dissolved organic nitrogen (DON)
   following rapid increases in irradiance (and consequently an increase in
   cellular electron energy), as might be expected to occur in a vertically
   well mixed estuarine system. Just as the increase in irradiance leads to
   an increase in cellular energy, so too would a decrease in temperature,
   due to the temperature dependency of biosynthetic enzymes. This
   hypothesis was tested by comparing the response of nitrogen-replete
   diatoms (Skeletomena costatum, Thalassiosira weissflogii and Chaetoceros
   sp.) and flagellates (Dunaliella tertiolecta, Pavlova lutheri and
   Prorocentrum minimum) to rapid increases in irradiance and decreases in
   temperature. Short-term (<3 h) changes in extracellular NO2- and NH4+
   concentrations were measured in cultures following these experimental
   shifts, as well as in cultures retained at the growth irradiance. Net
   rates of NO2- and NH4+ release were calculated from the time course of
   extracellular nitrogen concentrations. As a fraction of NOS uptake, NO2-
   release rates under the increased irradiance increased marginally
   relative to NO2- release rates under the growth irradiance. Release
   rates of NH4+ under the increased irradiance increased nearly fivefold
   over release rates at the growth irradiance, and accounted for 84\% of
   the NO3- uptake rate. In direct contrast to the diatom species, the
   flagellate species released NO2- under the higher experimental
   irradiance at rates one half those of the release rates under the growth
   irradiance, and continued to take up NH4+ under both irradiance
   conditions. Within the experimental boundaries, these findings have
   important physiological and ecological implications. The magnitude of
   the observed nitrogen release represents a significant physiological
   sink for electrons and, in fact, calculations suggest that up to 62\% of
   the total electrons harvested could be consumed. From an ecological
   perspective, these findings add to the body of literature which suggests
   that a significant fraction of the nitrogen that is taken up is
   ultimately released in dissolved form. More importantly, these data
   suggest that DON is not the only compound that phytoplankton may release
   in the aquatic environment.}},

Abstract = {{An Aristotelian conception of practical ethics can be derived from the
   account of practical reasoning that Aristotle articulates in his
   Rhetoric and this has important implications for the way we understand
   the nature and limits of practical ethics. An important feature of this
   conception of practical ethics is its responsiveness to the complex ways
   in which agents form and maintain moral commitments, and this has
   important implications for the debate concerning methods of ethics in
   applied ethics. In particular, this feature enables us to understand
   casuistry, narrative, and principlism as mutually supportive modes of
   moral inquiry, rather than divergent and mutually exclusive methods of
   ethics. As a result, an Aristotelian conception of practical ethics
   clears the conceptual common ground upon which practical ethicists can
   forge a stable and realistic self-understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Cooking pots made by craft specialists in a neighborhood in a small city
   in the Philippines are hand made, using the paddle and anvil technique,
   and then slipped with an iron-rich clay and polished with a marine
   shell. They are fired in an open fire, removed while very hot, and
   immersed in a bed of rice chaff. The result is a shiny black pot that is
   easily recognized in the market as being the product of this
   neighborhood. Such pots are valued by consumers as more beautiful and
   durable compared with pots made elsewhere. To see if the iron and carbon
   surface treatments improve the performance of the cooking pots, 50 pots
   were commissioned, with surfaces that varied from no treatment to slip
   only or carbon only as well as both carbon and slip. This collection was
   tested at the University of Arizona, and results clearly indicate that
   heating effectiveness is improved with both slip and carbon present. The
   surface treatments of red slip and smudge also affect the performance of
   pots for water permeability. However, our tests show no obvious
   relationships between strength and different surface treatments. The
   project illustrates the power of combining ethnoarchaeology with
   experimental studies in understanding artifact design.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a single-tube rapid method for the detection and
   differentiation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine and wild-type
   strains that combines rapid-cycle PCR with wild-type-specific
   fluorescent probe melting profiles for product genotyping. A region
   including the polymorphic site in VZV open reading frame (ORF) 62 was
   amplified in the presence of two fluorescence-labeled hybridization
   probes. During the annealing step of the thermal cycling, both probes
   bound to their complementary sequences in the amplicon, resulting in
   resonance energy transfer, thus providing real-time fluorescence
   monitoring of PCR. Continuous acquisition of fluorescence data during a
   melting curve analysis at the completion of PCR revealed that loss of
   fluorescence occurred in a strain-specific manner as the detection
   probe, which was fully complementary to the wild-type VZV ORF 62 region,
   melted off the template. Use of this method allowed genotyping of
   samples within minutes after the completion of PCR, eliminating the need
   for post-PCR sample manipulation. In addition to reducing the time
   required to produce a result, this method substantially reduces the risk
   of contamination of the final product as well as the risk of sample
   tracking errors. The genotypes of 79 VZV-positive samples determined by
   this fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) method were identical
   to the genotypes obtained by conventional PCR and restriction fragment
   length polymorphism analysis. The genotyping of VZV strains by the FRET
   method is a rapid and reliable method that is suitable fbr typing and
   that is also practical for use for the processing of large numbers of
   specimens.}},

Abstract = {{With its long history of colonization, eastern Amazonia has the highest
   population density in Brazilian Amazonia and represents the typical
   pattern of recent human occupation. Between 1991 and 1995, we surveyed
   the mammalian fauna at five sites, representing different degrees of
   human disturbance. We used line transects (1511 km surveyed) to describe
   differences in diversity and abundance at each site and to evaluate the
   effects of environmental factors. Twenty-two of the expected 44 species
   were recorded during surveys, but no more than 18 were recorded at any
   one site, and only 3 species were observed at all five sites. Despite a
   minimum transect length of 202 km, most species were recorded relatively
   infrequently at all sites, although overall sighting rates at different
   sites varied by more than 100\%. Between-site differences were even more
   pronounced when we compared specific groups (e.g., arboreal,
   terrestrial, game, nongame), reflecting the differential effects of
   factors such as hunting, logging and forest clearing. In general terms,
   species diversity abundance, total biomass, and mean biomass, all tended
   to decrease with increasing human disturbance. Two more specific
   patterns were also distinguished: decreasing abundance and biomass of
   game species with increasing hunting pressure and increasing abundance
   of nongame species with increasing forest disturbance. Intense hunting
   pressure alone may have deleterious short-term effects on abundance, but
   not necessarily an diversity, whereas prolonged hunting pressure,
   combined with forest clearing, results in marked distortions in the
   mammalian community. Overall, the study emphasizes the relative paucity
   of the mammalian fauna of eastern Amazonia, in terms of both species
   diversity and abundance, and its vulnerability to the on-going process
   of human colonization in the region.}},

   trousers}},
Journal = {{CHEST}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Study objective: We hypothesized that a dynamic left ventricular (LV)
   evaluation during a lending challenge might enhance diagnostic
   capabilities of routine transesophageal echocardiography in critically
   ill patients and selection of therapeutic options against circulatory
   failure, particularly the choice between volume expansion and vasoactive
   agent infusion.
   Design: Prospective clinical study in a group of 26 patients requiring
   hemodynamic support by vasoactive infusion because of low systemic
   arterial pressure (< 90 mm Hg by invasive monitoring) during mechanical
   ventilation.
   Setting: University hospital ICU.
   Patients: Patients required respiratory support for an episode of acute
   respiratory failure of various causes or for an episode of coma. They
   were studied by transesophageal echocardiography during mechanical
   ventilation in the controlled mode, before and during a lending
   challenge made using the legs compartment of medical antishock trousers
   inflated at 80 mm Hg.
   Measurements: A short-axis view of the left ventricle was obtained by a
   transgastric approach, and end-diastolic and end-systolic areas were
   measured. LV stroke area (LVSA) and LV fractional area contraction
   (LVFAC) were calculated.
   Results: Changes in LV echocardiographic measurements permitted
   separation of the patients into two groups. In nine patients (group 1),
   LVSA, used as an index of stroke output, was significantly increased
   during the challenge, together with a significant increase in LV
   end-diastolic area, suggesting preload improvement by the challenge.
   Conversely, in 17 patients (group 2), LVSA was significantly reduced by
   the challenge, together with a significant decrease in LVFAC, suggesting
   a negative effect of increased afterload by the challenge.
   Conclusion: Study of the changes in LV dimensions during loading
   challenge in hemodynamically unstable patients was used to evaluate the
   balance between the adequacy of preload and the ability of the heart to
   pump against an increased load, and might thus guide hemodynamic
   support.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted over an intermittent period of 2.5 years to

   mitigation device. The data also showed that above radon levels of 6
   pCi/L there was a strong positive linear correlation to moisture
   content. Below 6 pCi/L there was essentially no correlation. Radon
   concentrations were determined using EPA approved commercial test kits
   that were occasionally run in duplicate. In these cases it was found

Abstract = {{The content of the potentially health-defensive and disease-preventive
   flavonoids quercetin. kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin and luteolin of 31
   vegetables were determined by RP-HPLC with UV detection. Vegetables were
   purchased at the local markets in Budapest at a period of their most
   frequent consumption. Quercetin levels in the edible parts of most
   vegetables were generally below 10 mg kg(-1), except for onions
   (67-121.5 mg kg(-1)), lettuce (13.5-35.0 mg kg(-1)), dill (74.5 mg
   kg(-1)), broccoli (15.5 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (272.2 mg kg(-1)).
   Kaempferol was below 30 mg kg(-1) except for parsnip (66.4 mg kg(-1))
   and leek (45.8 mg kg(-1)). Myricetin could only be detected in lettuce,
   Swedish turnip, parsley and celery leaves, and dill. Detectable amount
   of luteolin was in radishes, some representatives of Brassica, sweet
   peppers, celery leaves and spinach while apigenin was only in Swedish
   turnip, celery root and celery leaves. These data provide a basis for
   the evaluation of the average daily intake of Hungarian population and

Abstract = {{Recent studies of the spine in adolescents who have sustained trauma
   have shown injuries to the growth zone, whereas injuries to the
   vertebral body have been described in other studies bf only adults.
   There are also reports on different clinical signs and radiological
   findings in adolescents with lumbar disc herniation when compared to
   adults. In order to find an explanation for these differences between
   adolescents and adults, this experimental study was performed. Six
   cadaveric lumbar motion segments (vertebral body-disc-vertebral body)
   obtained from three young male pigs and six lumbar motion segments
   obtained from three mature male pigs were tested in axial compression to
   failure. All units were examined with plain radiography and magnetic
   resonance imaging before and after compression. After the compression,
   histological samples were taken from the injury site, In the
   adolescents, a fracture was consistently found in the endplate through
   the posterior part of the growth zone, displacing the anulus fibrosus
   with a bony fragment at the point of insertion to the vertebra. This
   type of injury could not be detected in any of the adults; instead,
   there was a fracture of the vertebra in four cases, and in two cases, a
   rupture of the anulus fibrosus without a bony fragment was seen. This
   study showed that, when compressed to failure, the weakest part of the
   lumbar spine of the adolescent pig differs from that of the mature pig
   in the same way that studies on human spinal units have shown.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption losses to glass surfaces of five polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)
   congeners in aqueous solutions were investigated. Adsorption/desorption
   experiments were conducted under conditions that simulated actual sample
   handling procedures for environmental samples. It was found that the
   adsorption loss is related to the degree of chlorination. PCB congener
   180 lost the most onto glass surfaces, followed by congeners 138,
   101/28, and 52, in decreasing order. More PCB adsorption occurred onto
   glass under conditions of agitation and higher temperature (22 degrees
   C) during the five-day experimental period. The salinity effect
   ({''}salting out effect{''}) was also observed in this work. The
   efficiency of desorption (rinsing three times with solvent) was found to
   be ineffective in extracting adsorbed PCBs. It was necessary to use
   mechanical shaking for extraction. Storage of samples up to five days
   resulted in sorption losses as much as 30\%, 17\%, 30\%, 40\%, and 55\%
   of PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, and 180, respectively. Sorption losses need to
   be considered when conducting water sampling or toxicological studies to
   avoid underestimation of the actual PCB concentrations and their toxic
   effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study characterizes the assembly and organization of
   Photosystem I (PSI) complex, and its individual subunits into the
   thylakoid membranes of the thermophilic cyanobacterium, Mastigocladus
   laminosus. PSI is a multiprotein complex that contains peripheral as
   well as integral subunits. Hence, it serves as a suitable model system
   for understanding the formation and organization of membrane protein
   complexes. In the present study, two peripheral cytosol facing subunits
   of PSI, namely, PsaD and PsaE were overexpressed in E. coli and used for
   assembly studies. The gene encoding PsaK, an integral membrane spanning
   subunit of PSI, was cloned and the deduced amino acid sequence revealed
   PsaK to have two transmembrane alpha -helices. The characterization of
   the in vitro assembly of the peripheral subunits, PsaD and PsaE, as well
   as of the integral subunit, PsaK, was performed by incubating each
   subunit with thylakoids isolated from Mastigocladus laminosus. All three
   subunits studied were found to assemble into the thylakoids in a
   spontaneous mechanism, showing no requirement for cytosolic factors or
   NTP's (nucleotide 5'-triphosphate). Nevertheless, further
   characterization of the assembly of PsaK revealed its membrane
   integration to be most efficient at 55 degreesC.
   The associations and protein-protein interactions between different
   subunits within the assembled PSI complex were directly quantified by
   measurements performed using the BIACORE technology. The preliminary
   results indicated the existence of specific interaction between PsaD and
   PsaE, and revealed a very high binding affinity between PsaD and the PSI
   electron acceptor ferridoxin (Kd= 5.8 x 10(-11)M). PsaE has exhibited a
   much lower binding affinity for ferridoxin (Kd = 3.1 x 10(-5) M),
   thereby supporting the possibility of PsaE being one of the subunits
   responsible for the dissociation of ferridoxin from the PSI complex.}},

Abstract = {{Sixteen pigs of two genotypes (CC21, improved and Cuban Creole) were
   used to determine the nutritive value of sun-dried and ground royal palm
   nut meal (fruit of the royal palm, Roystonea regia, B.H.K. Cook).
   Consumption level was of 0.1 kg DM/kg metabolic weight (LW0.75) at a
   range of 45 to 60 kg and a basal diet of soybean meal and wheat meal
   partially substituted by 20\% royal palm nut (N 1.07, crude fiber 30.4,
   NDF 58.5, ether extract 23.1\% in dry basis). No significant effect of
   interaction or genotype on organic matter digestibility and N were
   found. Creole pigs tended (P <0.10) to retain less N than those
   improved. A significant effect of genotype (P <less than>0.01) was found
   in favour of Creole pigs on the digestibility of ether extract. The
   effect of the diet was significant (P <0.001) on organic matter
   digestibility and N. The organic matter digestibility and N of the royal
   palm nut calculated by difference was 58.5 and 25.0\%. The value of
   digestible energy was 14.14 KJ/g DM for royal palm nut. It is suggested
   that royal palm nut showed better values as an energy source than as a
   protein source in diets for pigs, probably through a high digestive
   utilization of ether extract.}},

Abstract = {{Refrigerated vacuum-packaged storage has been shown to increase
   significantly the shelf life of fresh fish and seafood products, but the
   effect, if any, on the outgrowth and toxin production of Clostridium
   botulinum type E on cooked crawfish is unknown. Microflora associated
   with live crawfish reflect the microbial populations of the harvest
   water and sediments in which they are living. The presence or absence of
   specific pathogens in either vacuum-packaged or air-permeable bags of
   cooked crawfish have not been thoroughly evaluated. This study evaluates
   the potential survival and outgrowth of biological hazards in both
   vacuum-packaged and air-permeable-packaged cooked crawfish held at 4 and
   10 degreesC for 30 days. During shelf-life studies of vacuum-packaged
   and ah-permeable-bagged cooked crawfish, a total of 31 bacterial species
   were isolated and identified from crawfish samples using both selective
   and nonselective media. The only pathogens isolated from both
   vacuum-packed and air-permeable bags of processed crawfish samples
   during shelf-life studies were strains of Aeromonas hydrophila and
   Staphylococcus aureus. C. botulinum type E and Clostridium perfringens
   species were not isolated from any of the uninoculated crawfish samples.
   Cooked crawfish were inoculated with 10(3) C. botulinum type E spores
   per g of crawfish tail meat to determine whether cooked crawfish tails
   would support the growth of C. botulinum type E strains and produce
   toxin at refrigerated temperatures. Spore-inoculated crawfish tails were
   vacuum packaged in both a high barrier film and an air-permeable bag and
   stored at 4 degreesC and 10 degreesC for 30 days. C. botulinum toxin E
   was not detected in any of the spore-inoculated packages throughout the
   shelf-life study until day 30. Microbiological data from this study
   should be useful in the development and implementation of the hazard
   analysis and critical control point plans for processed crawfish tails.}},

Abstract = {{Scytalidium thermophilum plays an important role in determining
   selectivity of compost produced for growing Agaricus bisporus. The
   objective of this study was to characterise S. thermophilum isolates by
   random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and sequence analysis
   of internally transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the rDNA, to assess
   the genetic variation exhibited by this species complex and to compare
   this with existing morphological and thermogravimetric data. RAPD
   analysis of 34 isolates from various parts of the world revealed two
   distinct groups, which could be separated on the basis of the
   differences in the banding patterns produced with five random primers.
   Nucleotide sequence analysis of the ITS region, which was ca 536 bp in
   length, revealed only very minor variation among S. thermophilum
   isolates examined. Several nucleotide base changes within this region
   demonstrated variation. Genetic distance values among type 1 and 2 S.
   thermophilum isolates, as determined by ITS sequence analysis, varied by
   a value of 0.005 \%. Molecular analyses carried out in the present study
   would suggest that isolates within this species complex exhibit genetic
   differences which correlate well with morphological variation and
   thermogravimetric data previously determined.}},

   breaks the isotropy of the bulk phase-separating process, leading to the
   formation of orientational structure due to the interplay between phase
   separation and wetting particle ordering under a modulated pinning
   potential at the late stage. Simulations suggest that the
   phase-separation morphology can be changed through the adjustment of the

Abstract = {{This study estimated the prevalence of dementia in 2,285 new admissions
   age 65+ to a statewide sample of 59 nursing homes in Maryland,
   1992-1995. Dementia was ascertained according to DSM-III-R criteria by
   an expert panel of geriatric psychiatrists, neurologists, and a
   geriatrician using detailed information collected by trained lay
   evaluators from residents, family, staff, and medical records.
   Admissions to Maryland nursing homes are similar to admissions to
   nursing homes elsewhere in the United States. The prevalence of dementia
   was 48.2\% (CI: 43.6-52.8) with an upper bound estimated at 54.5\% (CI:
   49.9-59.1). Prevalence is highest in facilities with <50 beds versus
   200+ beds (65.5\% vs 39.6\%) and those in urban versus rural areas
   (50.0\% vs 39.1\%). Those-who are non-White, married, and with fewer
   years of education are more likely to be demented. Prevalence is highest
   among those with 4+ physical impairments versus 0-1 (60.3\% vs 27.7\%)
   and lowest in those with 4+ comorbidities versus 0-1 (44.8\% vs 52.0\%).
   There was considerable overlap in the comorbid status of demented and
   nondemented admissions, and both groups contained members with only a
   few functional limitations. Results suggest that the level of medical
   supervision provided in nursing homes may not be required for some
   residents with dementia.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) exerts its
   action through CRF receptors 1 and 2 (CRF-R1 and CRF-R2). CRF has
   preferential affinity for CRF-R1, whereas urocortin displays high
   affinity for both. We investigated changes in colonic motor function
   after intraperitoneal (IP) injection of CRF-related peptides. Methods:
   Colonic motility was recorded in vivo in conscious vats equipped with
   electrodes chronically implanted in the cecum and proximal colon or in
   vitro in distal colon; fecal output was monitored in naive rats.
   Results: Rat CRF, rat urocortin, and amphibian sauvagine (10 mug/kg, IP)
   induced a new pattern of cecocolonic myoelectric activity characterized
   by clustered spike bursts of long duration; the percentage of occurrence
   was highest after CRF. The rank order of potency tb increase fecal
   pellet output after IP peptide injection (0.3-10 mug/kg, IF) was CRF >
   urocortin = sauvagine. The CRF-R1/R2 antagonist astressin (33 mug/kg,
   IF) and the CRF-R1 antagonist CP-154,526 (20 mg/kg, subcutaneously)
   inhibited IP CRF-induced changes in cecocolonic myoelectric activity and
   IP CRF and water avoidance stress-induced fecal output. In vitro, CRF
   injected into the inferior mesenteric artery increased distal colonic
   myoelectric activity compared with saline injection. Conclusions: These
   results demonstrate that CRF acts peripherally to stimulate colonic
   motility and that CRF-RI is primarily involved in mediating IP
   CRF/urocortin- and water avoidance stress-induced colonic motor
   response.}},

Abstract = {{Catasetum fimbriatum is an epiphytic orchid from South America that has
   been used for 15 years as a model plant for metabolic and developmental
   studies in our laboratory. In this work, C. fimbriatum plants were
   aseptically grown with 6 mol m(-3) of either glutamine or inorganic
   nitrogen forms (NO3-:NH4+ ratios). The highest biomass accumulation was
   found in plants supplied with glutamine; no significant difference was
   observed in plants incubated in the presence of inorganic nitrogen
   sources. Nitrogen assimilation was limited in the presence NO3- as a
   sole nitrogen source. C. fimbriatum did not accumulate NO3- and very low
   rates of in vivo nitrate reductase activity were observed. Most nitrate
   reductase activity (70\%) was detected in the 2 cm apical roots.
   Nitrate-treated plants exhibited relatively lower amounts of free
   amino-N, chlorophyll and free NH4+ contents and higher soluble sugar
   contents than the NH4+-treated plants. While shoot glutamine synthetase
   activity was only slightly affected by nitrogen sources, root glutamine
   synthetase activity was not modified by any nitrogen form. Glutamate
   dehydrogenase-NADH activity in shoot tissues was not influenced by any
   nitrogen source. However, the glutamate dehydrogenase-NADH activity in
   roots was enhanced when NH4+ tissue contents was augmented by increasing
   NH4+ in the medium and by the presence of glutamine. Our results
   strongly suggest that organic nitrogen and NH: are probably the most
   important nitrogen sources to C. fimbriatum plants. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We investigate the statistics of extremal path(s) (both the shortest and
   the longest) from the root to the bottom of a Cayley tree. The lengths
   of the edges are assumed to be independent identically distributed
   random variables drawn from a distribution rho (I). Besides, the number
   of branches from any node is also random. Exact results are derived for
   arbitrary distribution rho (l). Ln particular, for the binary \{0,1\}
   distribution rho (l) = p delta (l,1) + (1-p)delta (l,0), we show that as
   p increases, the minimal length undergoes an unbinding transition from a
   ``localized'' phase to a `'moving'' phase at the critical value, p =
   p(c) = 1 - b(-1), where b is the average branch number of the tree. As
   the height n of the tree increases, the minimal length saturates to a
   finite constant in the localized phase (p<p(c)), but increases linearly
   as v(min)(p)n in the moving phase (p>p(c)) where the velocity v(min)(p)
   is determined via a front selection mechanism. At p = p(c), the minimal
   length grows with II in an extremely slow double-logarithmic fashion.
   The length of the maximal path, on the other hand, increases linearly as
   v(max)(p)n for all p. The maximal and minimal velocities satisfy a
   general duality relation, v(min)(p) + v(max)(1-p) = 1, Which is also
   valid for directed paths on finite-dimensional lattices.}},

Abstract = {{The study describes the performances of three-year-old children tapping
   the pulse of a musical fragment in moderate tempo. Tapping
   synchronically to musical stimuli was assessed in terms of beat
   correspondence, sustaining correspondence, tempo accuracy and
   regularity. The test consisted of tapping the pulse on a digital drum
   according to the beats of Prokofieff's `March 10' (from Music for
   children, op.65). Computer software was used to record the musical
   example, to present the stimuli during the administration of the test,
   and to record and measure the children's responses. Results illustrate
   some characteristics related to the relevance of the selected variables
   and provide some empirical evidence about rhythmic performance at this
   age. Delayed performance was the most common trait, and discontinuity in
   tapping and fluctuating in accuracy and regularity were also frequently
   observed. Anticipation and strict accuracy of the onset were rare. Some
   theoretical and practical questions are posed. Future developments are

Abstract = {{Mobile code presents a number of threats to machines that execute ii. We
   introduce an approach for protecting machines and the resources they
   hold from mobile code and describe a system based on our approach for
   protecting host machines from Java 1.1 applets. In our approach, each
   Java applet downloaded to the protected domain is rerouted to a
   dedicated machine (or set of machines), the playground, at which it is
   executed. Prior to execution, the applet is transformed to use the
   downloading user's web browser as a graphics terminal for its input and
   output and so the user has the illusion that the applet is running on
   her own machine. In reality, however, mobile code runs only in the
   sanitized environment of the playground, where user files cannot be
   mounted and from which only limited network connections are accepted by
   machines in the protected domain. Our playground thus provides a second
   level of defense against mobile code that circumvents language-based
   defenses. The paper presents the design and implementation of a
   playground for Java 1.1 applets and discusses extensions of it for other
   forms of mobile code, including Java 1.2.}},

Abstract = {{The region was divided into 33 elementary floristic areas for a cluster

   convergent (or agglomerative) floristic divisions : the static and
   florogenetic. The static division was based on species similarity
   measured by the index of SOKAL \& SNEATH (1963 : formula 5). In the
   dendrogram, the region is divided into the S Boreal, Hemiboreal and
   Central Asiatic subregions, comprising the provinces: Baikal, Dauria-E
   Mongolia, NW Mongolia, W Mongolia, and S Mongolia. The florogenetic
   division, basing on genus/species spectra, includes five provinces:
   Baikal, Patom, Dauria-Mongolian, Middle Mongolia, and S Mongolia. The
   evolutionary trends in the floristic genesis of different areas was
   revealed in retrospect by the indices of taxonomic originality (MALYSHEV
   1991). Presumably, the generic originality was related to the genesis of
   floras mainly in the Neogene, and the species originality was due to the
   floristic genesis in the Pleistocene.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine if the efficacy of pain treatment assessed by the
   patient is a valid indicator to evaluate pain management.
   Methods: Three hundred and ninety one adult patients were investigated
   on the day of surgery and on the two following days after
   intraperitoneal or orthopedic surgery. Pain scores and efficacy of pain
   treatment were evaluated using ungraduated visual analog scales (VAS).
   According to the evolution of pain between two consecutive days,
   patients were classified as having ``worse pain{''}, ``same pain{''} or
   ``lower pain{''}.
   Results: During the first time interval, pain treatment was considered
   effective by 42\% of patients with worse pain, compared with 55\% with
   less pain (OR = 1.9, 95\%CI = 1.1 - 3.7) and to 58\% of patients with
   the same pain (OR = 2.0, 95\%CI = 1.2-3.0). During the second time
   interval, these proportions were: 46\% (worse pain), 63\% (lower pain vs
   worse: OR = 1.8, 95\%CI = 1.0-3.2) and 66\% (same pain vs worse: OR =
   2.1, 95\%CI = 1.1-4.1 ). Using pain evolution as a ``gold standard{''},
   patient assessment of pain treatment efficacy had sensitivity of 0.55
   and specificity 0.5 during the first time interval, and of 0.63 and 0.43
   during the second time interval.
   Conclusion: Patient evaluation of the efficacy of pain treatment can
   mislead the clinician about the severity of pain. Patients tend to be
   satisfied with pain treatment, even when pain is not relieved, The
   relation of intensity of pain to patient perception of treatment
   efficacy is weak.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Public Land Survey (PLS) notebooks are one of the best records
   of the pre-European settlement landscape and are widely used to recreate
   presettlement vegetation maps. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
   the relative ability of several interpolation techniques to map this
   vegetation, as sampled by the PLS surveyors, at the landscape level.
   Field data from Sylvania Wilderness Area, MI (U.S.A.), sampled at the
   same scale as the PLS data, were used for this test. Sylvania is
   comprised of a forested landscape similar to that present during
   presettlement times. Data were analyzed using two Arc/Info interpolation
   processes and indicator kriging. The resulting maps were compared to a
   `correct' map of Sylvania, which was classified from aerial photographs.
   We found that while the interpolation methods used accurately estimated
   the relative forest composition of the landscape and the order of
   dominance of different vegetation types, they were unable to accurately
   estimate the actual area occupied by each vegetation type. Nor were any
   of the methods we tested able to recreate the landscape patterns found
   in the natural landscape. The most likely cause for these inabilities is
   the scale at which the field data (and hence the PLS data) were
   recorded. Therefore, these interpolation methods should not be used with
   the PLS data to recreate pre-European settlement vegetation at small
   scales (e.g., less than several townships or areas < 10(4) ha).
   Recommendations are given for ways to increase the accuracy of these
   vegetation maps.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to identify components of accidents
   that cause the most disability and to discover the principal sources of
   injuries treated in the fracture clinics. Patients attending fracture
   clinics of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital were interviewed
   using a portable computer-based questionnaire, the Merseyside Accident
   Information Model (MAIM). Patients were followed up by telephone
   interview or letter to enquire about disability continuing after
   discharge. Disability was measured by the pre-accident to postdischarge
   changes in scores for 11 normal functions. Of the 1326 patients
   interviewed, 900 (68\%) were successfully followed up and 37\% reported
   disability after discharge. First events `tripping' `slipping' and
   `other underfoot events' accounted for 433 patients (194 reporting
   disability), and `collapsed/fainted - no other event' for 66 patients
   (27 reporting disability). Activities at the time of accident most
   frequently associated with disability involved moving about on foot.
   Among first event objects, ground surfaces and underfoot hazards were
   reported in 35\%. Sources of injuries included underfoot accidents
   (48\%), sport (13\%), and transport accidents (12\%.). Underfoot
   accidents contributed to 58\% of patients reporting disability, sport
   6\% and transport accidents 11\%. Underfoot accidents together with
   `collapsed/fainted - no other event' accounted for 79\% of female
   patients reporting disability and 50\% of men. Such data could be used
   for cost-effective targeting of preventative measures, and to study the
   effectiveness of accident prevention initiatives. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Present computations of the gap of color superconductivity in weak
   coupling assume that the quarks which participate in the condensation
   process are infinitely long lived. However, the quasiparticles in a
   plasma are characterized by having a finite lifetime. In this article we
   take into account this fact to evaluate its effect in the computation of
   the color gap. By first considering the Schwinger-Dyson equations in
   weak coupling, when one-loop self-energy corrections are included, a
   general gap equation is written in terms of the spectral densities of
   the quasiparticles. To evaluate lifetime effects, we then model the
   spectral density by a Lorentzian function. We argue that the decay of
   the quasiparticles limits their efficiency to condense. The value of the
   gap at the Fermi surface is then reduced. To leading order, these
   lifetime effects can be taken into account by replacing the couplings
   constant of the gap equation by a reduced effective one.}},

Abstract = {{Protein kinase C (PKC) zeta is a phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine
   kinase that appears to perform important cell signaling functions. Two
   forms of PKC zeta RNA, with different 5' ends, have been reported. The
   major form (zeta) is expressed in most, if not all tissues, while the
   minor form (zeta'), which encodes the catalytic domain of the enzyme
   without most of its regulatory domain, is predominant in normal brain
   and certain rat prostate tumors, We report here the structure of the 5'
   end of the rat PKC zeta gene, demonstrating that both forms of RNA can
   be transcribed from the same gene through the use of alternative
   promoters and splicing, In luciferase reporter constructs, progressive
   deletions of the PBC zeta and zeta' 5' flanking sequences yielded
   activities that were higher in the cell lines expressing endogenous PKC
   zeta and zeta' RNAs, respectively. Also, multiple PCRs across different
   introns of the PKC zeta gene indicate that recent duplication of the

Abstract = {{Detailed inventories of the benthos and field studies of the settlement
   and recruitment processes of marine benthic invertebrates require
   accurate identification of newly settled larvae and early juvenile
   stages. We provide morphological criteria, visible under a good quality
   dissecting stereomicroscope, by which to discriminate between species of
   the settling larval and early postlarval stages (similar to 250 to 700
   mum shell length) of mussels of the genus Mytilus on the west coast of
   Vancouver Island and Southern California. Compared to the bay mussel (M.
   trossulus), the sea mussel (M. californianus) has: (i) a shallower and
   flatter umbo, the latter corresponding to a significantly less
   pronounced prodissoconch I (PI) curvature and (ii) a greater PI length
   as well as (iii) a wider separation between the provincular lateral
   teeth (PLT). The PLT distance is a new term denoting the separation
   between the midpoint of two reddish pigment spots of the provinculum
   (larval hinge apparatus) region of settling larvae and early postlarvae
   of Mytilus spp. from the East Pacific Coast. These spots mark the larger
   provincular lateral teeth, situated at either end of the provinculum. We
   confirmed the validity of morphological criteria by comparing PCR
   products of genomic DNA of provisionally identified postlarvae.
   Furthermore, measurements of PI lengths and PLT distance from
   well-preserved postlarvae of sea mussels (M. californianus) and of bay
   mussels (hl. galloprovincialis) from Southern California indicate that
   the PI morphology and morphometry, and PLT distance criterion apply for
   that region as well. The criteria presented here can also apply to the
   advanced (competent) veliger stages, as the latter may settle (i.e.
   become the ``settling{''} stage) upon encountering a suitable substrate.
   Our present and previously published work provide economical and
   effective identification methods that can be used to discriminate among
   early life history stages (similar to 250 mum to 5.0 mm shell length) of
   Mytilus spp. along the west coast of North America.}},

Abstract = {{Recommendations for implementation and evaluation of Geographical
   Information Systems (GIS) can benefit from a broader theoretical
   foundation to support investigation, understanding and improvement. This
   paper discusses Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as a framework to delineate
   and evaluate the social and technical interactions involved in GIS
   implementation. The proposed process traces actor-network interactions
   through texts, technical objects, people, money and control. Actor
   alignment, actor-network stability and obligatory points of passage are
   evaluated to compare actor-networks. Case study research on conservation
   GIS implementation in Ecuador illustrates these methods. The strength of
   these actor-networks is examined through analysis of actors'
   interactions and the presence and function of an obligatory point of
   passage. Stronger actor-networks exhibit alignment among actors,
   co-location of an obligatory point of passage with the center of
   calculation and credit sharing.}},

Abstract = {{The preparation of halohydrin beta -blocker precursors using

   cerevisiae can be changed to (R)-enantioselectivity using methyl vinyl
   ketone as selective inhibitor (25 mM). Using resting fresh cells better
   yields and e.e.s are observed than using growing cells. Yarrowia
   lipolytica 1240 resting cells gave 87\% yield of
   (S)-1-chloro-3(1-naphthyloxy)propan-2-ol (99\% e.e.). Pichia mexicana
   11105 resting cells gave 85\% yield of
   (R)-1-chloro-3(1-naphthyloxy)propan-2-ol (precursor of propranolol)
   (95\% e.e). The reduction process is applied to other alpha

Abstract = {{Objective-Echocardiographic and Doppler analysis of myocardial mass and
   diastolic function in patients infected with HIV.
   Design-Case-control study.
   Setting-Tertiary referral centre, Huelva, Spain.
   Patients-61 asymptomatic patients with HIV infection and 32 healthy
   controls.
   Main outcome measures-Time motion, cross sectional, and Doppler
   echocardiographic studies were performed, and left ventricular mass and
   diastolic function variables determined (peak velocity of early and late
   mitral outflow and isovolumic relaxation time).
   Results-Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was decreased in patients
   compared with healthy controls (mean (SD): 76.7 (23.6) v 118.8 (23.5)
   g/m(2), p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed a correlation
   between LVMI and brachial fat and muscle areas. The ratio of peak
   velocities of early and late mitral outflow was decreased in HIV
   infected patients compared with controls (1.19 (0.44) v 1.58 (0.38), p <
   0.001). This ratio was exclusively related to haemodynamic variables
   (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures). HIV infected
   patients had a prolonged isovolumic relaxation time (103.0 (10.5) v 72.9
   (12.9) ms, p < 0.001). Isovolumic relaxation time was correlated only
   with brachial muscle area on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions-HIV infected patients had a reduced left ventricular mass
   index and diastolic functional abnormalities. These cardiac
   abnormalities are predominantly related to nutritional status.}},

Abstract = {{We have reported that simultaneous activation of glycoprotein (gp) 130

   and stem cell factor (SCF) promotes proliferation of human hematopoietic
   progenitor cells and their differentiation into erythroid, myelocytic,
   and megakaryocytic cells. We recently found that erythropoietin produced
   by erythroid progenitors stimulates erythropoiesis via gp130 and c-kit
   signals. Here we examined thrombopoietin (TPO) production by
   hematopoietic cells cultured with IL-6, sIL-6R, and SCE Reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that
   hematopoietic cells generated from cord blood CD34(+) cells with the 3
   factors expressed a minor splice variant of TPO messenger RNA, P1 Delta
   E2, which can be translated to TPO protein more efficiently than
   regularly spliced isoforms. The reduction in c-mpl, receptors for TPO,
   by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides suppressed the generation of
   erythroid, myelocytic, and pluripotent progenitors in suspension
   culture, plus colony formation of megakaryocytic progenitors in addition
   to these progenitors in clonal culture of cord blood CD34(+) cells with
   IL-6, sIL-6R, and SCE The addition of anti-human TPO antibody to the
   clonal culture also suppressed colony formation. These findings indicate
   that TPO production by hematopoietic cells stimulated by IL-6, sIL-6R,
   and SCF is involved in promoting their own growth. Int J Hematol.

Abstract = {{Background. Many individuals pray during times of illness, but the
   clinical effects of prayer are not well-understood.
   Methods. We prospectively studied a cohort of 40 patients (mean age, 62
   years; 100\% white; 82\% women) at a private rheumatology practice. All
   had class II or III rheumatoid arthritis and took stable doses of
   antirheumatic medications. All received a 3-day intervention, including
   6 hours of education and 6 hours of direct-contact intercessory prayer.
   Nineteen randomly selected sample patients had 6 months of daily,
   supplemental intercessory prayer by individuals located elsewhere. Ten
   arthritis-specific outcome variables were measured at baseline and at
   S-month intervals for 1 year.
   Results. Patients receiving in-person intercessory prayer showed
   significant overall improvement during 1-year follow-up. No additional
   effects from supplemental, distant intercessory prayer were found.
   Conclusions. In-person intercessory prayer may be a useful adjunct to
   standard medical care for certain patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
   Supplemental, distant intercessory prayer offers no additional benefits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses geometry to evaluate major road proposals in cities with

   relationship between route speeds, junction access and service areas,
   New urban patterns are presented using optimal space-filling techniques
   in which the aim is to maximise drive-time coverage with the minimum
   number of junctions. The method is then refined to allow for effects
   such as congestion and interstitial access. The results are then used in
   a case study to evaluate a well-known strategic road plan for London
   first proposed in the 1940s, There follows a general discussion about
   the policy and planning implications for London and further possible

Journal = {{ANATOMICAL RECORD}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{260}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This anatomical investigation in the rat was designed to illustrate the
   detailed organization of the tongue's muscles and their innervation in
   order to elucidate the actions of the muscles of the higher mammalian
   tongue and thereby clarify the protrusor subdivision of the
   hypoglossal-tongue complex. The hypoglossal innervated, extrinsic
   styloglossus, hyoglossus, and genioglossus and the intrinsic
   transversus, verticalis and longitudinalis linguae muscles were observed
   by microdissection and analysis of serial transverse-sections of the
   tongue. Sihler's staining technique was applied to whole rat tongues to
   demonstrate the hypoglossal nerve branching patterns. Dissections of the
   tongue demonstrate the angles at which the extrinsic muscles act on the
   base of the tongue. The Sihler stained hypoglossal nerves demonstrate
   branches to the styloglossus and hyoglossus emanating from its lateral
   division while branches to the genioglossus muscle exit from its medial
   division. The largest portions of both XIIth nerve divisions can be seen
   to enter the body of the tongue to innervate the intrinsic muscles.
   Transverse sections of the tongue demonstrate the organization of the
   intrinsic muscle fibers of the tongue. Longitudinal muscle fibers run
   along the entire circumference of the tongue. Alternating sheets of
   transverse lingual and vertical lingual muscles can be observed to
   insert into the circumference of the tongue. Most importantly in
   clarifying tongue protrusion, we demonstrate the transversus muscle
   fibers enveloping the most superior and inferior portions of the
   longitudinalis muscles. Longitudinal muscle fascicles are completely
   encircled and thus are likely to be compressed by transverse muscle
   fascicles resulting in elongation of the tongue. We discuss our findings
   in relation to biomechanical studies, that describe the tongue as a
   muscular hydrostat and thereby define the ``elongation-protrusion
   apparatus{''} of the mammalian tongue. In so doing, we clarify the
   functional organization of the hypoglossal-tongue complex. Anat Rec

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The mechanism for the initiation of human labor remains
   unknown and is under extensive investigation. Myometrium from patients
   in labor and not in labor is the ideal tissue to study structural,
   cellular, and molecular changes that occur during parturition. This
   study was designed to determine whether myometrial sampling at the time
   of cesarean delivery increases maternal morbidity.
   STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study including 118 study and
   236 control patients. A full-thickness myometrial sample was obtained
   from the superior edge of a transverse uterine incision at the time of
   cesarean delivery. Demographics and standard surgical morbidity data
   were collected. Statistical methods used included univariate and
   multivariate analysis.
   RESULTS: The study and control groups did not differ significantly with
   respect to age, gravidity, parity, birth weight, and Apgar scores. The
   estimated intraoperative blood loss was greater in the control group (P
   < .02); however, the change in hematocrit level (preoperative vs
   postoperative values) was not different. There were no significant
   differences in the rates of endometritis, wound infection, and venous
   thrombosis up to 6 weeks post partum. When study and control patients
   were stratified into term in labor, term not in labor, preterm in labor,
   and preterm not in labor categories and compared for maternal morbidity,
   there were still no significant differences for any of the outcome
   measures evaluated.
   CONCLUSION: On the basis of our data, human myometrial sampling at
   cesarean delivery does not increase overall maternal morbidity,
   irrespective of gestational age and the presence or absence of labor.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{164}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a stromally derived growth
   factor important in mediating androgen induced activities in benign
   prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. We assessed whether
   serum KGF could be used as a molecular marker in patients with prostate
   cancer.
   Materials and Methods: Using a modified double sandwich enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay, we measured serum KGF in 56 men with prostate
   cancer and 81 men with BPH. Comparative analyses were made with total
   serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), disease stage and clinical grade.
   Results: Following optimization, a sensitive and reproducible assay for
   serum KGF measurement was developed. Serum KGF levels tend to be higher
   in men with BPH compared to those with prostate cancer (1,242 and 828
   pg./ml., respectively). A weak but significant linear relationship
   between PSA and KGF (p = 0.034) was found in patients with BPH. There
   was no association between KGF and tumor grade or stage but there was a
   strong positive linear relationship between PSA and KGF (p = 0.006, R-2
   = 68.3\%) in low grade tumors. In those men with serum PSA less than 10
   ng./ml. KGF levels were significantly higher in BPH compared to prostate
   cancer cases (965 +/- 245 and 133 +/- 61.3 pg./ml., respectively, p =
   0.0058). Using a KGF threshold range of 500 to 900 pg./ml., specificity
   for detecting BPH was 88\% to 100\% and the positive predictive value
   was 92\% to 100\%.
   Conclusions: We have optimized a reproducible and sensitive
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for the measurement of serum
   KGF. Overall KGF levels tend to be lower in patients with prostate
   cancer than with BPH. In patients with serum PSA less than 10 ng./ml.
   serum KGF levels were significantly higher in the BPH compared to the
   prostate cancer group. A large prospective study is indicated to assess
   the role of serum KGF measurement in patients with prostate cancer.}},

   education program held stronger self-perceptions of instrumentality (or
   stereotypically masculine personality attributes), evidenced higher
   achievement motivation, were less traditional in their career
   aspirations, and were more liberal toward the rights and roles of women
   than their peers in general education. The two groups did not differ

Abstract = {{Background: We designed a prospective controlled animal study to compare
   the stress response induced after laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy.
   Methods: Twelve female pigs (20-25 kg body weight) were anesthetized
   with ketamine, pentobarbital, and fentanyl. The animals were randomized
   into the following four groups: control (C), pneumoperitoneum with CO2
   at 14-15 mmHg (P), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), and open
   cholecystectomy (OC). The average duration of the procedure in each
   group was 35 min.
   Results: Central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulmonary
   capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac output were monitored.
   Measurements were recorded when animals were anesthetized (baseline),
   immediately before and after surgery, and thereafter every 30 min for a
   maximum of 3 h. White blood cell count (WBC) was determined from blood
   samples taken before and after 3 h of surgery. Ultrasound-guided liver
   biopsies were done preoperatively and after 3 h of surgery. Total RNA
   was isolated from the liver biopsy specimens. Steady-state mRNA levels
   of beta -fibrinogen (beta -fib), alpha 1-chymotrypsin inhibitor
   (alpha1-CTI), metallothionein (MT), heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and
   polyubiquitin (Ub) were detected by Northern blot/hybridization. There
   were no statistical differences in the hemodynamic parameters among the
   groups. The number of circulating neutrophils and monocytes decreased
   only after LC. Expression of Hsp70 was not induced after any surgical
   procedure, and the mRNA levels of Ub did not change after surgery. The
   expression of alpha1-CTI and beta -fib (acute phase genes) were
   similarly increased after LC and OC. Steady-state mRNA levels of MT were
   slightly increased after P and LC but not after OC.
   Conclusion: These data indicate that there are no significant
   differences between LC and OC in terms of induction of the stress
   response.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the sleep quality and quality of life for
   individuals with degenerative spinal disease or failed back surgery
   syndrome.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey design utilizing standardized
   instruments. Data were analyzed with use of hierarchical stepwise
   multiple regression analyses.
   Patients: One hundred sixty-seven individuals with degenerative spinal
   disease or postlaminectomy syndrome who presented to a tertiary care
   outpatient patient pain center.
   Outcome Measures: The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression
   Index measured depressive symptomatology. A modified Pittsburgh Sleep
   Quality Index (PSQI) measured sleep quality. The arithmetic average of
   least and usual VAS ratings of pain measured everyday pain. A visual
   analog scale rating of highest pain during the past 2 weeks measured
   highest pain. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale measured daytime sleepiness.
   The Medical Outcome Study-Short Form-Health Survey (SF-36) measured the
   mental health and general health components of quality of life.
   Results: Higher overall sleep quality and lower sleep latency primarily
   were related to higher ratings of physical functioning and shorter
   duration of pain. Ratings of the highest pain, but not everyday pain,
   were independent predictors of overall sleep quality and sleep latency.
   Daytime sleepiness was associated with younger age and depressed mood.
   Pain was not associated independently with daytime sleepiness. The
   quality of Life related to mental functioning was associated positively
   with depressed mood and with the interaction of pain and depressed mood.
   None of the variables in the model (i.e., pain intensity, sleep quality,
   depression, and demographic variables) predicted quality of life related
   to overall general health.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that physical functioning, duration of
   pain, and age may be more important than pain intensity and depressed
   mood in contributing to decreased overall sleep quality and sleep
   latency. The contribution of physical functioning was particularly
   strong and should be included in subsequent studies of sleep, pain, and
   mood. The SF-36 should be compared to pain-specific quality-of-lift
   measures to further evaluate the usefulness of this instrument with
   outpatients with chronic nonmalignant pain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{It is still a controversial issue whether the human sentence processor
   computes syntactic representations serially or in parallel. We address
   this question by comparing the processing of different types of
   ambiguous garden path sentences with the processing of corresponding
   ungrammatical sentences. The ungrammatical sentences lead to the same
   type of syntactic mismatch that arises in the garden path sentences at
   the point of disambiguation, but they cannot be reanalysed. Using the
   speeded-grammaticality judgement task it is shown that factors which
   regulate garden path strength in ambiguous sentences also have an
   influence on the processing of corresponding ungrammatical sentences in
   that they determine how reliably the ungrammaticality is detected. We
   argue that this processing correlation provides evidence for serial
   parsing models because only serial models lead us to expect that the
   parser attempts reanalysis in ambiguous and ungrammatical sentences
   alike.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated how the use of a spatial decision support
   system (SDSS)-a type of geographic information system (GIS)-influenced
   the accuracy and efficiency of different types of problem solvers (i.e.,
   professionals versus students) completing problems of varied complexity.
   This research-the first to simultaneously study these variables-examined
   subjects who completed a problem involving spatially-referenced
   information. The experiment was guided by a research model synthesized
   from various perspectives, including the theory of cognitive fit, prior
   research on map reading and interpretation, and research examining
   subject expertise and experience. The results are largely supportive of
   the research model and demonstrate that SDSS, an increasingly important
   class of management decision-making technology, increased the efficiency
   of users working on more complex problems. Professionals were found to
   be more accurate but less efficient then students; however,
   professionals who used the SDSS were no more accurate than professionals
   using paper maps. Need for cognition, a construct that focuses on an
   individual's willingness to engage in problem solving tasks, was found
   to be marginally related to accuracy. The implications of these findings
   for researchers and practitioners are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of the red microalga it Porphyridium sp was studied in three
   bench-scale bioreactors of 13 dm(3) volume: a bubble column, an airlift
   reactor and a modified airlift reactor with helical flow promoters in
   the top of the downcomer. Most of the experiments reported were run with
   a photon flux density of 250 muE m(-2) s(-1), but other illuminances
   were studied as well. Superficial gas velocities were in the range of
   5.4 x 10(-4) to 82 x 10(-4)ms(-1) (0.033-0.5vvm). Algal growth in the
   airlift reactor with helical flow promoters had lower gas requirements
   than in the other reactor configurations. This implies lower costs in
   air compression and in air and CO2 requirements. It was concluded that
   the advantages found are related to the particular fluid dynamic
   characteristics of the reactor. (C) 2000 Society of Chemical Industry.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine maternal and fetal lipoprotein
   profiles in type 1 diabetic pregnancies differing in glycemic control.
   Serum lipid, apolipoprotein, and lipoprotein lipid concentrations were
   investigated in mothers with poorly controlled or well-controlled type 1
   diabetes as reflected by hemoglobin A(1c)(HbA(1c)) concentrations
   performed by isolab column chromatography and in their macrosomic (body
   wt = 4650 +/- 90 g) or appropriate-for-gestational-age newborns (body wt
   = 3616 +/- 68 g), and these levels were compared with those in healthy
   mothers and in their control newborns (body wt = 3290 +/- 45 g). In
   mothers with well-controlled diabetes and in their infants, serum lipid,
   apolipoprotein, and lipoprotein lipid concentrations were comparable to
   those in control mothers and in their control newborns. Mothers with
   poorly controlled diabetes presented higher serum triglyceride and
   apoprotein B-100 (apo B-100) levels but lower apo A-I and HDL3
   cholesterol and phospholipid levels as compared with control values. In
   their macrosomic newborns, all serum lipid, apolipoprotein, and
   lipoprotein lipid levels were higher than those in control newborns.
   Maternal HbA(1c) and triglyceride levels in late gestation were
   significant predictors of fetal lipids and lipoproteins in the poorly
   controlled diabetes group. In conclusion, when under good metabolic
   control, type 1 diabetes did not affect maternal and fetal lipid levels.
   However, when under poor metabolic control, type 1 diabetes is
   associated with maternal and fetal lipoprotein abnormalities.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is proposed that the Bentong-Raub Suture Zone represents a segment of
   the main Devonian to Middle Triassic Palaeo-Tethys ocean, and forms the
   boundary between the Gondwana-derived Sibumasu and Indochina terranes.
   Palaeo-Tethyan oceanic ribbon-bedded cherts preserved in the suture zone
   range in age from Middle Devonian to Middle Permian, and melange
   includes chert and limestone clasts that range in age from Lower
   Carboniferous to Lower Permian. This indicates that the Palaeo-Tethys
   opened in the Devonian, when Indochina and other Chinese blocks
   separated from Gondwana, and closed in the Late Triassic (Peninsular
   Malaysia segment). The suture zone is the result of northwards
   subduction of the Palaeo-Tethys ocean beneath Indochina in the Late
   Palaeozoic and the Triassic collision of the Sibumasu terrane with, and
   the underthrusting of, Indochina. Tectonostratigraphic,
   palaeobiogeographic and palaeomagnetic data indicate that the Sibumasu
   Terrane separated from Gondwana in the late Sakmarian, and then drifted
   rapidly northwards during the Permian-Triassic, During the Permian
   subduction phase, the East Malaya volcano-plutonic are, with I-Type
   granitoids and intermediate to acidic volcanism, was developed on the
   margin of Indochina. The main structural discontinuity in Peninsular
   Malaysia occurs between Palaeozoic and Triassic rocks, and orogenic
   deformation appears to have been initiated in the Upper Permian to Lower
   Triassic, when Sibumasu began to collide with Indochina. During the
   Early to Middle Triassic, A-Type subduction and crustal thickening
   generated the Main Range syn- to post-orogenic granites, which were
   emplaced in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. A foredeep basin developed
   on the depressed margin of Sibumasu in front of the uplifted
   accretionary complex in which the Semanggol ``Formation{''} rocks
   accumulated. The suture zone is covered by a latest Triassic, Jurassic
   and Cretaceous, mainly continental, red bed overlap sequence. (C) 2000

   concludes that the Court's interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment and

Abstract = {{Background: Cancer registries provide a basis for many epidemiological
   studies in cancer. Electronic data provide for prompt, economical data
   capture for disease registries; doubts, however, exist about their data
   quality.
   Materials and methods: We examined the accuracy for cancer registration
   of a subset of 7043 electronically captured hospital discharge data.
   Results: Note availability was 82\%. Of the notes available for
   examination demographic data accuracy was high; however, 7.4\% of cases
   coded on discharge as cancer had no malignancy recorded in case notes
   while 4.1\% had in-situ or benign tumors. Almost a third had some
   inaccuracy in coding tumor site. Prevalent cases accounted for 17.2\% of
   cases examined reflecting a new registry. Electronic data capture
   reduces time spent examining notes; only 40\% of cases notified from PAS
   required a quick validation check. It enhances data completeness;
   without electronic discharge data 11.5\% of the final database would
   have been missed. The validation check prevented over-inflation of the
   cancer registration database by 7.5\%. Measures of accuracy in the final
   database were high.
   Conclusion: This study shows that discharge data are a valuable data
   source for cancer registries but require a targeted note review aimed at
   cases without corroborating data.}},

Abstract = {{To date, pregnancy rates from oocytes matured in-vitro (IVM) have been
   much lower than those with in-vivo stimulated maturation. In order to
   improve the developmental potential of IVM oocytes, we studied the
   effect of three possible factors on pregnancy rates: (i) priming in vivo
   with FSH before aspiration; (ii) the time interval of maturation in
   vitro, and (iii) timing the aspiration by monitoring the serum
   concentrations of oestradiol and inhibin A. In all experiments, oocyte
   retrieval was performed transvaginally and oocytes were matured
   individually in culture medium (TCM 199) under oil. Intracytoplasmic
   sperm injection (ICSI) was carried out on all metaphase II. oocytes.
   Suitable embryos (maximum of two) were replaced after culturing for 2-3
   days in IVF medium. Endometrial priming consisted of 2 mg 17 beta
   -oestradiol, taken orally three times a day from the day of oocyte
   retrieval, and intravaginal progesterone suppositories initiated 2 days
   later. In the first experiment, 20 women were randomly allocated to two
   groups: group I(n = 10 cycles) received no stimulation, while group II(n
   = 10 cycles) received recombinant FSH 150 IU/day for 3 days, initiated
   on day 3. FSH priming. did not affect the rates of maturation,
   fertilization or cleavage, and no effect was seen on embryo development.
   The second experiment included 48 patients undergoing 55 unstimulated
   cycles. The effects of IVM periods of 28 and 36 h were compared.
   Shortening the IVM period did not compromise subsequent embryo
   development. The third study analysed the results of maturation of
   oocytes obtained in 87 cycles in 75 unstimulated normal women, after a
   leading follicle of 10 mm in diameter and an endometrial thickness of at
   least 5 mm were observed. A pregnancy rate of 12.6\% (11/87) per
   aspiration and 17.4\% (11/63) per transfer was obtained. Serum
   concentrations of oestradiol and inhibin A were evaluated
   retrospectively. Significantly more pregnancies were obtained in cycles
   with a detected increase in the concentration of oestradiol from day 3
   to the day of aspiration (19 \% per aspiration) compared with cycles
   without such an increase (0\% per aspiration). A higher pregnancy rate
   was observed after an increase in inhibin A concentration (24 versus
   0\%). In conclusion, monitoring the timing of aspiration may potentially
   improve the developmental potential of immature oocytes. FSH priming did
   not affect either cleavage rate or embryo development. Shortening the
   maturation period from 36 to 28 h did not compromise subsequent
   embryonic development.}},

   CASE: A 24-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 0, with three previous

   gestation. Her second and third abortions were complicated by incomplete
   evacuation of uterine contents, and uterine sacculation teas diagnosed.
   Preterm delivery and a retained placenta complicated the present
   pregnancy. At laparotomy, recurrence of uterine sacculation was noted in
   the left fundal region of a bicornuate uterus. A hysterotomy was
   performed to remove the placenta from the sacculation.
   CONCLUSION: In a patient with multiple uterine procedures and retained
   placenta, uterine sacculation can develop.}},

Journal = {{CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. In situ hybridization done using a S-35-cRNA probe was carried out to
   obtain information on the expressions of the SA gene in brains and
   kidneys of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) strain obtained from
   the Izumo colony (/Izm) and from Charles River Laboratories (/Crj).
   2. In the brain, SA mRNA expression was most abundantly observed in
   epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. High to moderate levels was
   present on neurons of the CA1-CA4 pyramidal cell layer and the dentate
   gyrus of the hippocampus and the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. The
   solitary tract nucleus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus
   expressed the SA gene at very low levels. An increase in the expression
   was noted in the choroid plexus of WKY/Crj; there was no difference,
   however, in expression levels of other brain areas between WKY/Izm,
   SHR/Izm, and SHRSP/Izm, and between WKY/Crj and SHR/Crj.
   3. In the kidney, expression signals of SA mRNA were observed in renal
   medullary rays and focal cortex of WKY/Izm, SHR/Izm, SHRSP/Izm, and
   SHR/Crj, whereas mRNA expression in the WKY/Crj kidney was observed in
   medullary rays and outer strips of the outer medulla. Microscopically,
   hybridization signals were predominant in the proximal tubules.
   4. Expression densities decreased only in the kidney of WKY/Crj in 4-and
   8-week-old rats, but not in the WKY/Izm kidney, compared with findings
   in SHR and SHRSP kidneys. These observations are in good agreement with
   data from Northern blot analysis.
   5. The SA gene expressions in the brain and the kidney seem not to
   relate to states of elevated blood pressure, but rather to strain
   differences. Abundant expressions in the brain and the: kidney may mean
   that the SA gene plays a role in the water-electrolyte transport system.
   It is noteworthy that there are neuronal expressions of the SA gene in
   hippocampal pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a micro-injection technique to deliver recombinant
   adenovirus and AAV to mouse fetuses at day 15 after conception. Several
   routes of delivery, including injections to the amniotic fluid, the
   front limb, the placenta, the liver, and the retro-orbital venus plexus,
   were tested using an E1-deleted recombinant adenovirus (Ad.CBlacZ) or a
   recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV.CMVlacZ) carrying a beta
   -galactosidase (lacZ) gene. Injection of Ad.CBlacZ into the amniotic
   cavity led to transgene expression in the skin and in the digestive
   tract of the fetuses. injection of Ad.CBlacZ in the front limb resulted
   in LacZ expression in all major muscle groups around the injection site
   and at low levels in the liver. The other three routes of delivery, ie
   intraplacental, intra-hepatic and retro-orbital injections of Ad.CBlacZ,
   all led to lacZ expression predominantly in the liver. Further studies
   revealed a maximal tolerant dose (defined as the highest viral dose with
   less than or equal to 20\% mortality in the injected fetuses) of 1 x
   10(9) particles per fetus for intrahepatic injections, 3 x 10(9)
   particles per fetus for intra-placental injection, 1 x 10(10) particles
   per fetus for retro-orbital and intra-amniotic injections, and 2 x
   10(10) particle per fetus for intra-muscular injection. The
   adenovirus-mediated lacZ expression in liver and muscle persisted for at
   least 6 weeks. Intra-muscular injection of AAV.CMVlacZ also resulted in
   lacZ expression in the muscle rip to 3 months after birth with no
   indication of cellular immune response at the injection site. Taken
   together our results demonstrated that pro longed transgene expression
   can be achieved by in utero gene transfer using either adenoviral or AAV
   vectors. The distribution of virus-mediated gene transfer appeared to
   determined mostly by the route of viral administration.}},

Abstract = {{The zonula adherens (ZA) in adult chicken retinal pigment epithelium was
   examined with cryo-electron microscopic methods. Deep-etching of the
   cross-fractured ZA showed globules in the intercellular space. These
   globules apparently correspond to the electron-dense structure seen in
   thin sections. Deep-etching of obliquely fractured ZA further revealed
   rod-like structures extending from the extracellular surface into the
   intercellular space. These rods (mean similar to9 nm thick, similar to
   20 nm long) were straight and sometimes divided into two or three
   segments. The rods typically canted at similar to 60 degrees with
   respect to the plasma membrane, and they were often connected to the
   intercellular globules at their distal ends. When the rods are compared
   with the isolated cadherins reported previously, it is suggested that a
   combination of a rod and a globule may represent an extracellular part
   of cadherin. Membrane particles were observed on the P-face of the ZA
   plasma membrane, and their distribution density was approximately seven
   times that of the rods. The freeze-etching also revealed a
   characteristic particle complex on the ZA cytoplasmic surface, which may
   represent the cytosolic proteins linking cadherins to actin bundles, (C)

   center-of-mass energy of 1.5-7.0 MeV, by using a new-type gas counter,
   multiple-sampling and tracking proportional chamber (MSTPC), and neutron
   counters. This experiment was performed in the condition of inverse
   kinematics. The Li-8 beam was produced by the RIKEN projectile-fragment
   separator, and injected into the MSTPC filled with He-4 gas, which
   worked as a detector gas and served as a target. The reaction cross
   section obtained in the present exclusive measurement is about half of
   the one obtained in previous inclusive measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out to examine whether endogenous angiotensin
   II (A-II) is involved in the regulation of release of norepinephrine
   (NE) elicited by the stimulation of spinal sympathetic nerves in pithed
   rats. It was assessed in terms of the alterations in concentrations of
   arterial blood plasma A-II and NE elicited by nerve stimulation (5 Hz,
   50 V, 1 msec for 45 s) in pithed rats under vehicle or captopril (3
   mg/kg, i.v.) treatment. Comparative study with pentobarbital
   anesthetized rats showed that pithing rats have the characteristics of
   lower basal blood pressure and lower NE level, whereas they have higher
   basal A-II level. In pithed rats treated with vehicle, presser response
   to nerve stimulation was accompanied by increases in both A-II and NE
   level. In rats treated with captopril, the nerve stimulation caused
   about 40\% lower increases in presser response and NE level than those
   observed in rats treated with vehicle. These results suggest that the
   sympathetic nerve-induced NE release is facilitated by endogenous A-II
   in pithed rats, and that captopril exerts its inhibitory effect on the
   presser response to nerve stimulation through the suppression of this
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advances in radiography in the form of image
   intensification has not only made internal fixation of femoral neck
   fracture much easier but these high resolution films can be saved as
   hard copies and can also be reversed into `positives' at a later date.
   However, requesting routine post-operative check radiographs for these
   fractures are still a common practice, A retrospective study was carried
   out to compare the quality of image intensifier films with conventional
   post-operative radiographs. 79 sets of films were reviewed with
   particular reference to adequacy of fixation and possible joint
   penetration by the screws, No significant difference was noted between
   the two sets of films. We suggest that routine post-operative
   radiographs after femoral neck fracture fixation are unnecessary unless
   there is some clinical indication. This has significant implications in
   relation to patient discomfort, radiation exposure and
   cost-effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality and is responsible
   for considerable medical expenditures. Vaccination is the most effective
   public health measure to combat this illness. Amantadine and rimantadine
   are older antiviral agents that have been important adjuncts in the
   prevention and treatment of influenza A outbreaks. Zanamivir and
   oseltamivir are newer agents indicated for the treatment of both
   influenza A and B. For antiviral agents to be effective, they must be
   used within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms. Antiviral
   agents reduce the duration of fever and illness by one to two and
   one-half days and also reduce the severity of some symptoms. Use of
   amantadine or rimantadine is appropriate if influenza virus A is known
   to be the predominant agent in a particular year or location. Data need
   to be evaluated on the development of resistance and use of the newer
   antiviral agents in geriatric patients, high-risk patients and children.
   For optimal use of antiviral agents, patients with influenza symptoms
   must present early, and family physicians must accurately and rapidly

Abstract = {{Since proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA interact with PR3 on the surface of
   apoptotic polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and ingestion of apoptotic
   PMN is known to modulate macrophage inflammatory reactions, we raised
   the question whether PR3-ANCA-opsonized apoptotic PMN influence the
   uptake by macrophages and their state of activation. We therefor
   analysed the effects of PR3-ANCA-opsonized apoptotic PMN on the uptake
   process by enzymatic assay. We further investigated the production of
   TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-12 and the secretion of lipid inflammatory
   mediators (TxB(2), leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E-2
   (PGE(2))) by human monocyte-derived macrophages using FACS and ELISA
   methods. We show that PMN-opsonization by PR3-ANCA substantially
   enhances phagocytosis by macrophages and thereby triggers the production
   of TNF-alpha and TxB(2). These in vitro findings indicate that PR3-ANCA
   opsonization of apoptotic PMN might be an important mechanism in the
   pathogenesis of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), prompting macrophages to
   produce proinflammatory mediators. These mediators, mainly TNF-alpha,
   might prime further PMN leading to perpetuation of the known
   priming-dependent mechanisms of ANCA action.}},

Abstract = {{A cDNA encoding a GABA(A) receptor subunit was isolated from rat brain.
   The predicted protein is 70\% identical to the human epsilon -subunit.
   It was recently reported {[}Sinkkonen et al. (2000), J. Neurosci., 20,
   3588-3595] that the rodent epsilon -subunit mRNA encoded an additional
   sequence (approximate to 400 residues). We provide evidence that human
   and rat epsilon -subunit are similar in size. The distribution of cells
   expressing the GABA(A) epsilon -subunit was examined in the rat brain.
   in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that epsilon -subunit mRNA
   is expressed by neurons located in septal and preoptic areas, as well as
   in various hypothalamic nuclei, including paraventricular, arcuate,
   dorsomedial and medial tuberal nuclei. The mRNA was also detected in
   major neuronal groups with broad-range influence, such as the
   cholinergic (basal nucleus), dopaminergic (substantia nigra compacta),
   serotonergic (raphe nuclei), and noradrenergic (locus coeruleus)
   systems. Immunohistochemistry using an affinity-purified antiserum
   directed towards the N-terminal sequence unique to the rat epsilon
   -subunit revealed the presence of epsilon -subunit immunoreactivity over
   the somatodendritic domain of neurons with a distribution closely
   matching that of mRNA-expressing cells. Moreover, using in situ
   hybridization, alpha3, theta and epsilon GABA(A) subunit mRNAs were all
   detected with an overlapping distribution in neurons of the dorsal raphe
   and the locus coeruleus. Our results suggest that novel GABA(A)
   receptors may regulate, neuroendocrine and modulatory systems in the
   brain.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of ammonia on the cough response to citric acid and on
   substance P release from C-fibers involved in this reflex was assessed.
   For a period from one to four days, piglets were exposed, in an
   inhalation chamber, to ammonia at a concentration of 15 or 30 ppm.
   During exposure, cough induction tests were done every two days.
   Recovery of the cough reflex after ammonia exposure was also determined.
   In a separate group of piglets exposed for 2 days to 30 ppm ammonia,
   substance P content was determined in bronchial and tracheal lavage
   fluids and in the tracheal and bronchial mucosa. Ammonia (30 ppm) was
   found to inhibit coughing significantly (the cough frequency was reduced
   by 64\%) after a two-day exposure. In animals exposed for 4 days to this
   ammonia concentration, the recovery ranged from 3 to 7 days (mean: 5
   days). The same ammonia concentration also caused the substance P
   content to increase significantly in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (to
   432\% of its initial value) and tracheal lavage fluid (to 149\%) and to
   decrease significantly in the tracheal mucose (-58\%), however the
   content in bronchial mucosa was not significantly affected (-43\%).
   Exposure to 15 ppm ammonia had no effect on the frequency of citric
   acid-induced coughing. In conclusion, ammonia inhibits citric
   acid-induced coughing in pigs at concentrations that can be detected in
   piggeries. This inhibitory effect may be related to substance-P
   depletion in C-fiber endings.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperadrenergic states of various etiologies can contribute to
   tachycardias. Systemic beta -adrenergic blockade suppresses sinus
   tachycardia but may adversely affect arterial blood pressure and
   contractility, because the drug gains access to myocardial cells as well
   as to the sinoatrial node. We examined whether intrapericardial beta
   -adrenergic blockade with esmolol could suppress tachycardia without
   reducing contractility as a result of limited drug diffusion, which
   would be sufficient to penetrate the superficial sinoatrial node but not
   the deeper myocardial layers. In five anesthetized pigs, we provoked a
   reflex heart rate increase of 50 beats/min with hemorrhage. The rapidly
   acting beta -adrenergic blocking agent esmolol (1 mg/kg) was
   administered intrapericardially using a new percutaneous transatrial
   access method and a catheter system that can be rapidly and safely
   introduced. Esmolol equivalently suppressed hemorrhage-induced sinus
   tachycardia when administered intrapericardially (from 192 to 158
   beats/min at 5 min, p < 0.05) or intravenously (from 177 to 151
   beats/min at 1 min, p < 0.05). The antitachycardic effect of
   intrapericardial esmolol was prolonged compared with intravenous esmolol
   (10 min vs. 3 min, p < 0.05). Intrapericardial esmolol did not affect
   blood pressure or left ventricular dP/dt max, an index of contractility,
   whereas intravenous esmolol decreased blood pressure at 1 min for 2 min
   (p < 0.05) and simultaneously decreased left ventricular dP/dt max at 1
   min for < 2 min (p < 0.05). Intrapericardial esmolol suppresses
   adrenergically induced sinus tachycardia without decreasing
   contractility or blood pressure. The transatrial approach for
   intrapericardial delivery of certain beta -adrenergic blocking agents
   could be employed to control tachycardias in emergency care and surgical
   settings in patients with impaired cardiac contractility and propensity
   to hypotension.}},

Abstract = {{Two chromosomal races (2n = 17 and 2n 15, XO) of the weta Hemideina
   thoracica meet at the centre of a volcanic region in North Island, New
   Zealand. Five independent polymorphic genetic markers showed broadly
   coinciding, steep frequency dines from north to south across this zone
   beside the flooded crater, Lake Taupo. Three unlinked nuclear gene
   markers provide estimates of zone width that are at least twice the
   width of the chromosomal and mitochondrial dines, with dine centres
   displaced at least 2.5 km. The different zone widths and centres suggest
   that this hybrid zone is a semipermeable barrier reducing the
   introgression of the chromosomal markers mole than genic markers, We
   estimate that this species of weta must have a dispersal rate of at
   least 100 m per generation using the time since the last Taupo eruption
   (1850 years ago), which covered an area of about 20 000 km(2) with

Abstract = {{The pathogenesis of cancer-associated hypercalcemia is not yet
   completely understood. This syndrome appears to be a consequence of the
   tumor production of humoral factors, mainly parathyroid hormone related
   protein (PTHrP). However, patients with humoral hypercalcemia of
   malignancy have features suggesting that factors other than PTHrP might
   play a role in this syndrome. We performed a case-control study in
   cancer patients with and without hypercalcemia. A total of 105 patients
   with a variety of tumors, 60 of them with hypercalcemia (corrected serum
   calcium over 2.6 mmol/l), and 45 without hypercalcemia. In a previous
   study, we demonstrated that plasma PTHrP was highly associated with
   hypercalcemia in these patients. In the present study, we measured the
   plasma levels of various bone cytokines: interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta),
   interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha, and tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, in these cancer patients. We also
   determined C-terminal type I procollagen (PICP) and C-terminal
   telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), bone formation and bone
   resorption markers, respectively, in serum in these patients. We found
   that these osteolytic cytokines do not increase in plasma by the
   presence of hypercalcemia. In fact, using a logistic regression
   analysis, a significant (P < 0.02) association was found between the low
   plasma levels of IL-1<beta> and TGF alpha and hypercalcemia, independent
   of plasma PTHrP and the presence of bone metastasis, in these patients.
   No significant association between the plasma levels of IL-6 or TNF
   alpha and hypercalcemia was found in these cancer patients. Serum ICTP
   correlated (r - 0.35; P = 0.008) with hypercalcemia in these patients,
   but none of the cytokines studied in plasma correlated with either ICTP
   or PICP in these hypercalcemic patients. Our data indicate that the
   circulating levels of several bone cytokines are not enhanced by PTHrP
   in hypercalcemic cancer patients. The mechanism responsible for the
   association between the low plasma levels of some of these cytokines and
   hypercalcemia in these patients remains obscure. However, this finding
   does not rule out the possible local bone effects of these cytokines,

Abstract = {{The human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) agent, which replicates in
   neutrophils, was found not to induce superoxide anion (O-2(-))
   generation or extracellular release by human peripheral blood
   neutrophils, as measured by a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay
   or a cytochrome c reduction assay, respectively. Furthermore, the HGE
   agent completely prevented O-2(-) release by neutrophils upon
   stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA),
   formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, or Escherichia coli. The
   inhibition was HGE agent dose dependent, required ehrlichial contact
   with the host cells, and was reversible upon removal of the
   extracellular HGE agent bound to the host cells prior to PMA
   stimulation. Structural integrity of or new protein synthesis by the HGE
   agent was not required for the inhibition; carbohydrate but not surface
   protein of the HGE agent was required. The HGE agent did not prevent
   O-2(-) generation in human peripheral blood monocytes derived from the
   same individual. This neutrophil-specific prevention of O-2(-)
   generation by the HGE agent would be critical in survival of the HGE
   agent. This is the first demonstration of the rapid inhibition of
   preexisting NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils by the HGE agent.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, respondents who agreed to participate in a

   whether to participate in public interest groups. Less sophisticated
   reasoners showed the opposite pattern. Morally central considerations
   also had a much greater impact on the probability that sophisticated
   respondents would attempt to participate in public interest groups after
   completing the interview. The analysis included controls for potential
   confounding variables such as cognitive ability, education, prior
   political participation, and gender. The findings imply motivational
   differences between advantaged and disadvantaged population groups. Such
   differences may help to account for the differing strategies and

   within a few microns from surface level and damage was formed up to this
   depth. The damage structure was observed as a function of the depth
   utilizing a focused ion beam (FIB) device. Below 300 degreesC
   irradiation with a single beam produced a high density of stacking fault
   tetrahedra (SFT) but void formation was not observed. Large voids were
   observed with single beam irradiation at 500 degreesC. In specimen
   irradiated with a dual beam of helium and Ni ions, the number density of
   voids was increased significantly. In copper irradiated with hydrogen
   and Ni ions, the number density of voids was not so large. Experimental
   results show that helium atoms promote void formation. Hydrogen atoms
   have less effect on void formation than helium atoms in pure copper. (C)

   analysis of the pattern of shared posts on a newsgroup to reveal the
   structure of the group. Clear and striking differences between the
   networks from the different types of group are demonstrated. Further,
   multi-social support group is revealed to be more complex, as predicted.
   This finding is supported by an examination of some of the messages that
   are posted to it. We argue, as others have previously done, that social
   network analysis is a very useful method when researching the nature of

Abstract = {{The siliconization of pharmaceutical glass containers is an industrially
   frequently applied procedure. It is done by spreading an aqueous
   silicone oil emulsion film on the inner surface and successive heat
   curing treatment at temperatures above 300 degreesC for 10-30 min. It
   was often proposed that a covalent bonding of PDMS to the glass or
   branching of the linear PDMS occurs during heat treatment. The present
   study was performed for a detailed investigation of the glass and
   silicone (polydimethylsiloxane = PDMS) chemical state before and after
   heat-curing treatment and analysis of the bond nature. Combined X-ray
   excited photoelectron (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy as well as
   angle resolved XPS-measurements were used for analysis of the glass
   samples. The silicon surface atoms of the borosilicate container glass
   were transformed to a quartz-like compound whereas the former linear
   PDMS had a branched, two-dimensional structure after the heat curing
   treatment. It was concluded that the branching indicates the formation
   of new siloxane bonds to the glass surface via hydroxyl groups. Further
   evidence for the presence of bonded PDMS at the glass surface can be
   found in the valence band spectra of the siliconized and untreated
   samples. However, this bond could not be detected directly due to its
   very similar nature to the siloxane bonds of the glass matrix and the
   organosilicon backbone of PDMS. Due to the high variation of data from
   the siliconized samples it was concluded, that the silicone film is not
   homogeneous. Previously raised theories of reactions during heat-curing
   glass siliconization are supported by the XPS data of this
   investigation. Yet, the postulation of fixing or baking the silicone on
   the glass surface is only partially true since the bonded layer is very
   thin and most of the silicone originally on the surface after heat
   curing can be removed by suitable solvents. This fraction can therefore
   still interact with drug products being in contact to the siliconized
   container wall.}},

Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) uses a coreceptor together
   with CD 1 to enter CD4(+) target cells. The chemokine receptors CXCR4
   and CCR5 have been found to be the major coreceptors for T-cell
   line-tropic and macrophagetropic HIV-1 strains, respectively, although
   many other chemokine and orphan receptors have also been identified as
   potential coreceptors for HIV-1. Genetic analyses has revealed the
   importance of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes in disease
   progression. The discovery of coreceptors provides a more defined scheme
   for virus entry in which the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein sequentially
   binds CD4 and coreceptor, leading to a membrane fusion reaction between
   the viral envelope and the plasma membrane of the target cell. It also
   provides the basis for HIV-1 cell tropism. The identification of HN
   coreceptors provides new opportunities for the development of anti-HIV
   therapy. Many coreceptor-based therapeutic approaches have been
   developed, some of which are currently in clinical trials. Int J

Abstract = {{A new bioassay using phage is described for the assay of antioxidative
   activity. The assay is based on: (1) in vitro in aqueous solution oxygen
   radicals being produced during oxidation of ascorbic acid and related
   substances, (2) phage being inactivated by the oxygen radicals, and (3)
   substances having antioxidative activity inhibiting the inactivation of
   phage. Samples were ground with a pestle, then diluted with water. The
   assay method is as follows. Phage T2 (4 x 10(7) PFU/mL) was incubated
   with iron (II)-erythorbate complex (1 x 10(-6) M) and each sample in
   0.02 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 min at 37 degreesC. The phage
   inactivation of a control (sample-free) is 90\%. Unit activity is
   defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that shows 50\%
   inhibition of the phage inactivation.
   The effectiveness of the assay method was confirmed using known
   antioxidants. Then the activity was effectively assayed for many
   vegetables and fruits.}},

   When the dark-grown prothalli were irradiated with continuous white
   light, marginal cells of the elongation zone divided asymmetrically, and
   the resulting smaller cells developed into rhizoids, The asymmetric
   division was also induced by brief irradiation of red light. The effect
   of red light was cancelled by subsequent irradiation of far-red light,
   indicating that the asymmetric division was regulated by phytochrome,
   Since the response to red light was not observed at 10(1) J m(-2) and
   saturated at 10(2) J m(-2) and the response is photoreversible by
   far-red light, the photoresponse was classified as a low-fluence
   response of phytochrome, Although the asymmetric division was induced by
   brief irradiation of red light, continuous irradiation of white, blue or

Abstract = {{Six Holstein cows in early lactation were used in a double 3 x 3 Latin

   determine ruminal nutrient degradability for pea silage relative to
   barley and alfalfa silages. Pea silage contained lower neutral detergent
   fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber, and starch concentrations but higher
   crude protein than barley silage. Compared with alfalfa silage, pea
   silage had higher starch and NDF but lower crude protein content. Pea
   and alfalfa silage had similar effective ruminal degradability of dry
   matter, which was higher than that of barley silage. The rate of
   degradation and effective ruminal degradability of NDF was highest for
   alfalfa silage, intermediate for pea silage and lowest for barley
   silage. Results of the lactation trial showed that dry matter intake and
   milk yield were not affected by forage source. Milk composition was
   similar for cows fed pea or barley silage; however, cows fed pea silage
   produced milk with a higher fat and a lower protein percentage than

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association
   between the promoter region of the prostacyclin synthase gene and
   cerebral infarction (CI). Using the polymerase chain reaction-single
   strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method, we found a
   variable-number tandem repeat polymorphism in the 5'-upstream promoter
   region of the prostacyclin synthase gene. This region contains
   transcriptional factors-binding sites of Sp1 (CCCGCC) and AP-2
   (CCGCCAGCCCC). The alleles varied in size from three to seven repeats of
   nine base pairs (bp). We performed an association study using the
   polymorphism in 111 patients and 152 control subjects. The
   transcriptional activity of the abnormal promoter region allele was
   determined by luciferase assay, The overall distribution of alleles
   differed significantly between both groups. Logistic linear regression
   analysis revealed the small number repeat allele to be found more
   frequently with CI. Transcriptional activity increased with increasing
   numbers of repeats. This study provides consistent support for the
   association between CI and the PGIS gene. Am J Hypertens

Abstract = {{Background: Intraepithelial cancers (m1 cancer) and cancers that
   penetrate the basement membrane but do not approach the muscularis
   mucosae (m2 cancer) do not have lymph node metastasis and thus can be
   removed completely with mucosal resection. Therefore, in this study, the
   effectiveness of endoscopic mucosal resection with submucosal saline
   injection for removal of superficial esophageal cancers was investigated
   prospectively.
   Methods: Twenty-five superficial esophageal cancers in 21 patients were
   removed with submucosal saline injection. When it was thought that a
   tumor had not been completely resected en bloc, it was removed
   completely in piecemeal fashion. Endoscopy was repeated 1, 3, 6, 12
   months or more after endoscopic resection.
   Results: All superficial esophageal cancers were completely removed: 18
   (72\%) en bloc and 7 (28\%) by piecemeal resection. No recurrence was
   found during a mean observation period of 2.0 years (range 0.8 to 3.6)
   after resection. Bleeding occurred in 5 cases (24\%) during or after
   resection but was successfully treated with the endoscopic alginate or
   thrombin spray technique. There was no perforation.
   Conclusion: Endoscopic mucosal resection with submucosal saline
   injection is effective for removal of superficial cancers of the
   esophagus.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) has been a promising
   new technique in breast carcinoma staging, but could be unreliable in
   certain patient subsets. The current study assessed whether age,
   preoperative chemotherapy, tumor size, and/or previous excisional biopsy
   influenced the identification of sentinel nodes (SLNs) or the
   reliability of a node-negative SLND in predicting a node negative
   axilla.
   METHODS, Eighty-two patients who had clinically negative axillae
   underwent SLND followed by Level I/II axillary lymph node dissection
   (ALND). SLNDs were performed using both technetium-99m (Tc-99m) labeled
   colloid and isosulfan blue dye. SLNs were analyzed by hematoxlyin and
   eosin and immunocytochemical techniques.
   RESULTS, SLNs were successfully identified in 80\% of patients. Mapping
   success was decreased among postmenopausal women but was not influenced
   by preoperative chemotherapy, large tumor size, or previous excisional
   biopsy. Of the 31 successfully mapped, node positive patients, 5 had
   false negative (FN) SLNDs (overall FN rate = 16\%). Of the 9
   successfully mapped patients who had received preoperative chemotherapy
   and had positive axillary nodes, 3 had FN SLND (FN rate = 33\%). The
   presence of clinically positive lymph nodes before chemotherapy did not
   predict which patients would have a subsequent FN SLND. T3 tumor size,
   but not previous excision, was associated significantly with increased
   FN rate, although the FN rate for previous excision was 11\%. No FN SLND
   occurred with T1/T2 tumors that were not excised previously and had not
   received preoperative chemotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS, Preoperative chemotherapy was associated with an
   unacceptably high FN rate for SLND. While larger tumor size also was
   associated with FN SLND, this effect might have been due to preoperative
   chemotherapy use in these patients. Small sample size precluded
   determining whether excisional biopsy before mapping increased FN SLND
   rates independently. Cancer 2000;89:2187-94. (C) 2000 American Cancer

   harrisii, dry weight (mug) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from 228.8
   +/- 38.2 <mu>g (n = 9) in the controls to 131.8 +/- 10.1 mug (n = 4) in
   animals exposed throughout larval development to 100 mug/l. A
   significant (P < 0.05) reduction was found between total lipid content
   in the controls and first crabs reared at concentrations greater than 50
   <mu>g/l. In relative terms (\% dry weight), different lipid classes
   predominated in the controls and the various fenoxycarb exposure
   concentrations. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences among
   the treatment groups in phospholipid level, while the triglyceride
   content was significantly lower in crabs exposed to 10 and 100 mug/l. No
   significant differences in the percent of free fatty acids were found in
   crabs exposed to 1-10 mug/l and the controls. Free sterols in crabs
   exposed to concentrations higher than 10 mug/l were below the detection
   limit. Control animal fatty acid profiles were dominated by palmitic,
   stearic, and oleic acid, accounting for 48\% of total fatty acids (TFA).
   The fatty acid composition of crabs exposed to 100 mug/l significantly
   (P < 0.05) differed from the controls. The results suggest that

Abstract = {{High-resolution Y chromosome haplotype analysis was performed in 143
   paternally unrelated Israeli and Palestinian Moslem Arabs (I\&P Arabs)
   by screening for 11 binary polymorphisms and six microsatellite loci.
   Two frequent haplotypes were found among the 83 detected: the modal
   haplotype of the I\&P Arabs (similar to 14\%) was spread throughout the
   region, while its one-step microsatellite neighbor, the modal haplotype
   of the Galilee sample (similar to8\%), was mainly restricted to the
   north. Geographic substructuring within the Arabs was observed in the
   highlands of Samaria and Judea. Y chromosome variation in the I\&P Arabs
   was compared to that of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews, and to that of
   North Welsh individuals. At the haplogroup level, defined by the binary
   polymorphisms only, the Y chromosome distribution in Arabs and Jews was
   similar but not identical. At the haplotype level, determined by both
   binary and microsatellite markers, a more detailed pattern was observed.
   Single-step micro-satellite networks of Arab and Jewish haplotypes
   revealed a common pool for a large portion of Y chromosomes, suggesting
   a relatively recent common ancestry. The two modal haplotypes in the
   I\&P Arabs were closely related to the most frequent haplotype of Jews
   (the Cohen modal haplotype). However, the I\&P Arab clade that includes
   the two Arab modal haplotypes (and makes up 32\% of Arab chromosomes) is
   found at only very low frequency among Jews, reflecting divergence
   and/or admixture from other populations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Refeeding patients with anorexia nervosa can be one of the
   more challenging aspects of their treatment, and particularly if all
   food and fluids are adamantly and persistently refused. Method: If the
   decision is made to augment or replace oral feeds, the most common
   intervention is nasogastric feeding. Results: Although this is often
   successful, a subset of patients manage to sabotage feeding via this
   route. Other means of delivering nutrition such as intravenous feeds are
   often impractical for long-term use. Another alternative in such
   life-threatening situations is the use of enteric feeds via gastrostomy
   or jejunostomy. This paper presents the successful use of such enteric
   feeding in four cases of severe adolescent anorexia nervosa. Discussion:
   The psychological, legal, and ethical issues involved are discussed,
   concluding that gastrostomy and jejunostomy are valid lifesaving methods
   to feed highly resistant anorectic patients. (C) 2000 by John Wiley \&

   between the posttreatment worm burden, hepatic granuloma volume, and
   serum immunoglobulin profile (immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M, IgG
   and IgM), was also investigated. Two main groups of Swiss albino mice
   infected with Schistosoma mansoni cercariae were used in the experiment.
   Group I consisted of infected untreated control mice. The mice of group
   II were submitted to treatment with flubendazole 100 mg/kg body weight
   as single oral dose at different time intervals: Group IIa received
   treatment 24 h before infection. Group IIb received treatment 4 h after
   infection. Group IIc received treatment 25 days after infection. Mice
   treated 25 days after infection, compared to those treated in other time
   intervals, revealed a significant reduction in the recovery of adult
   schistosomes after portal perfusion (79.5 \%), a lower immunoglobulin
   level (IgG and IgM), and the smallest granuloma mean diameter (220.0 +/-
   10.3 mum). These data were less salient in mice treated 4 h after, and
   24 h before infection.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to test the clinical hypothesis that the
   magnitude and temporal characteristics of rearfoot complex motion are
   closely correlated with those of the transverse plane motion at the knee
   and hip. Twenty subjects underwent kinematic assessment during walking
   at 108 steps/minute. The transverse plane rotation of the leg relative
   to the foot was used to indicate rearfoot complex pronation and
   supination. Taking into account errors inherent in kinematic assessment
   involving skin mounted markers, it is unlikely that a correlation exists
   between the range of internal leg rotation during the contact phase and
   the total range of transverse plane leg rotation during gait and the
   corresponding values for the transverse plane motion at the knee and
   hip. Correlation tests were performed to assess the temporal
   characteristics of the motions at the joints that showed that there was
   no correlation between the transverse plane motion in the rearfoot
   complex, knee and hip. Thus the hypothesis that the magnitude and
   temporal characteristics of rearfoot complex motion are closely
   correlated with the transverse plane motion at the knee and hip was
   rejected. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) acquire a UV-absorbing

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{255}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesised that Antarctic krill acquire UV-absorbing
   mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from dietary algae, which produce
   MAAs in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. To test this
   hypothesis, we grew cultures of Phaeocystis antarctica that had been
   grown under either photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-750 nm)
   plus UV irradiation (UVR, 280-400 nm), or else PAR-only. Algae grown
   under PAR-only produced high concentrations of porphyra-334, whereas
   additional UVR caused formation of high concentrations of
   mycosporine-glycine:valine and lower concentrations of porphyra-334.
   Krill were fed with either of these two cultures on eight occasions over
   63 days. A third group was starved for the duration of the experiment.
   Animals were analysed after 36 and 63 days for MAA content. Remaining
   animals from all treatments were starved for a further 35 days and
   analysed to examine MAA retention characteristics. Our findings are that
   krill acquired different MAAs from dietary algae depending on the light
   conditions under which the algae were grown. Specifically, krill fed
   algae grown under PAR-only had higher concentrations of porphyra-334
   than starved krill. Conversely, krill fed algae grown under PAR with
   additional WR had high body concentrations of mycosporine-glycine
   :valine. MAA concentrations in starved krill remained static throughout
   the experiment. However, long term starvation (35 days) caused levels of
   certain acquired MAAs to decline. From this we can infer that MAA
   concentrations in krill are dependent on the MAA content of
   phytoplankton, and therefore the algae's response to UV exposure. This
   has implications for transfer of MAAs through marine trophic webs. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of topiramate
   (TPM) as an add-on regimen in reducing seizure rate in a population
   sample of patients diagnosed with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy
   (SME). Eighteen patients were evaluated. The mean observation time was
   10.5 months (range, 6-18 months). Seizure frequency and type were
   recorded. Topiramate was administered as an add-on regimen at a starting
   dose of 1 mg kg(-1) and titrated to a maximum of 6-8 mg per kg per day.
   Different escalation rates were used, mainly weekly or fortnightly
   increments of dose. Three patients (16.6\%) became seizure free, and 10
   (55.6\%) had a >50\% reduction in seizure frequency: six of them
   (22.2\%) achieved a reduction greater than 75\%. Side-effects were
   observed in nine patients, eight with a weekly titration schedule and
   one with a fortnightly schedule. TPM is effective as adjunctive therapy
   for SME. Side-effects were mild and transient, generally related to
   rapid dosage titration. (C) 2000 BEA Trading Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Defect formation in (100) GaSb by 60 keV Sn+ ion-implantation at 150-153
   K is investigated using cross-sectional TEM, SEM and EDX. An anomalous
   structure consisting of many cells, which Looks like a honey comb, was
   formed on the surface implanted with 8 x 10(18) ions/m(2). The diameter
   and the depth of a cell were about 50 nm and 220-250 nm respectively,
   and the thickness of the walls partitioning the cells was about 10 mm.
   The upper part of the partitioning wall is amorphous and rich in Ga,
   while the lower part shows crystalline structure. A heavy strain region
   with 50 nm thickness, corresponding to the maximum depth of the
   projected Sn ions, was observed under the cells. This defect structure
   is compared with similar defects which have been observed by other
   researchers. The defect formation mechanism is discussed, and an
   explanation based on movement of the implantation induced point defects
   is proposed. It is assumed that hills and hollows are formed in the
   early stage of implantation. The point defects created on the hills do
   not contribute to the development of the defect structure, because they
   annihilate almost completely by the recombination of vacancy and
   interstitial and by the movement to the near surface sink. However,
   under the hollows, vacancies remain which escaped recombination, and the
   Interstitial atoms, which are highly mobile at low temperatures, migrate
   far from there to aggregate under the hills. The hollows become deeper
   by the movement of the remaining vacancies to the surface, and the hills
   develop into the walls by the migration of the interstitial atoms from
   the surrounding hollows.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Acute gastritis, caused by an initial infection of
   Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), may resolve spontaneously, but the
   infection sometimes becomes chronic. We examined the efficacy of a
   short-term H. pylori eradication therapy on acute gastritis.
   Methods: Among the 15 patients with hemorrhagic acute gastritis who were
   randomly allocated to group A (eradication therapy) or group B
   (Lansoprazole, LPZ), 10 of them started to receive treatment within 1
   day after the disease onset. The other five patients began the
   eradication therapy 4-6 days after disease onset (group C). Eradication
   therapy consisted of a daily oral administration of each of 30 mg
   lansoprazole (LPZ), once a day; 400 mg clarithromycin, twice a day; 1000
   mg amoxicillin, twice a day; and 300 mg rebamipide, three times a day,
   for one week. If the endoscopy was normal, medication was stopped for
   the following 4 weeks before gastric endoscopy was performed again in
   order to assess H. pylori eradication.
   Results: All group A patients were cured after the 1-week treatment and
   therefore, they became H. pylori negative. Group B and C patients had
   erosions or ulcers after the 1-week treatment and so received an
   additional 3-week administration of LPZ. Four weeks later, their
   gastritis was cured and except for one group B patient, they became H.
   pylori-negative.
   Conclusion: In patients with acute gastritis, caused by an initial H.
   pylori infection, eradication therapy was efficacious in achieving early
   healing. This therapy should be started as soon as possible after
   disease onset. (C) 2000 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Penguins share incubation duties between the male and female of a pair.
   The one left on the nest must fast while its partner is foraging at sea.
   Nest attendance patterns during the incubation period reflect the way
   time is allocated between the conflicting demands of incubation and
   foraging. We conducted daily nest checks for little penguins (Eudyptula
   minor) at two localities in New Zealand (Motuara Island in the
   Marlborough Sounds and Oamaru, Otago) in the 1998/99 breeding season and
   found significant variation in nest attendance between the two areas.
   Penguins breeding at Motuara Island made significantly longer foraging
   trips and were in poorer body condition than those breeding at Oamaru.
   Foraging trip durations were significantly correlated with the body
   condition of birds at both areas: the poorer the condition, the longer
   the foraging trip durations. The increased risk of egg desertion
   observed at Motuara Island is probably a consequence of the prolonged
   foraging trips that limit the time available for incubation.}},

Abstract = {{Infections of animals with parasitic worms, such as Schistosoma mansoni,
   induce humoral immune responses to carbohydrate antigens, raising the
   possibility that such antigens might be useful targets for the
   development of vaccines and new diagnostic approaches. Here we describe
   the identification of fucosylated LacdiNAc (LDNF) {[}GalNAc alpha1-4(Fuc
   alpha1-3)GlcNAc-R] as a new carbohydrate antigen in S. mansoni that
   induces humoral immune responses in infected mice. The presence of
   antibodies was determined by ELISA using a neoglycoconjugate synthesized
   to express LDNF sequences. Sera from S. mansoni-infected, but not
   uninfected, mice contain IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies to LDNF. The
   IgG antibodies are primarily of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, with no
   detectable levels of the complement-fixing IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes. An
   IgM monoclonal antibody, designated SMLDNF1 was generated from the
   spleens of S. mansoni-infected mice, and the antibody exhibits specific
   recognition of LDNF sequences, but not other fucosylated glycans tested.
   Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrates that LDNF antigens are
   localized on the tegumental surface of adult S. mansoni. Western blot
   analysis indicates that LDNF sequences are expressed on numerous
   high-molecular weight glycoproteins from the three major human
   schistosome species, as well as the bird schistosome Trichobilharzia
   ocellata. The identification of LDNF antigen on the tegumental
   glycoproteins of schistosomes and the ability to synthesize LDNF
   conjugates should aid in the development of glycan-based vaccines and
   immunodiagnostic tests for schistosomiasis and in determining the
   role(s) of the glycans in worm development and pathogenesis. (C) 2000

Title = {{Design and methodology of the ESPRIT trial: Evaluating a novel dosing

Abstract = {{Background Clinical trials of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors
   have shown that these potent antiplatelet agents ore effective in
   reducing the ischemic complications of percutaneous coronary
   interventions. However, even though stents ore now implanted in >75\% of
   percutaneous interventional procedures, only one study, a trial of the
   monoclonal antibody abciximab, has formally evaluated adjunctive GP
   IIb/IIIa inhibition in this setting.
   Methods and Results Eptifibatide, a nonimmunogenic and rapidly
   reversible inhibitor of the platelet receptor integrin IIb/IIIa, has
   also undergone evaluation as an adjunct to coronary intervention. In
   clinical trials performed heretofore, however, it has appeared to have
   less relative clinical efficacy than the monoclonal antibody abciximab.
   Since the early seminal trials, ii has been recognized that the doses of
   eptifibatide previously used achieved only 30\% to 50\% of maximal
   platelet GP IIb/IIIa integrin inhibition. This is considerably less than
   the 80\% level of receptor inhibition that has been proposed to prevent
   coronary thrombus formation in animal models and that has been achieved
   in clinical trials with abciximab.
   Conclusions The Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb/IIIa Receptor
   with Integrilin Therapy (ESPRIT) trial was designed to test the safety
   and efficacy of a high-dose, ``180/2.0/180{''} double-bolus regimen of
   eptifibatide (a 180-mug/kg bolus followed 10 minutes later by a second
   180-mug/kg bolus of eptifibatide combined with a 2.0-mug/kg per minute
   infusion) as an adjunct to nonacute percutaneous coronary intervention
   with stent implantation. In this report, we review the rationale,
   design, and methods of this clinical investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of the energy and mass budgets have been made at the
   equilibrium line of Breidamerkurjokull, a southern outlet glacier of
   Vatnajokull, Iceland. The glacier`s surface was melting for most of the
   measurement period, which allowed for a reliable closure of the energy
   budget. Sensitivity studies focussed mainly on potential effects of
   measurement errors, site-specific micrometeorological conditions,
   surface development and different parameterization of the turbulent
   fluxes. Although the high stability and a roughness disturbance imposed
   certain restrictions, these studies confirmed the applicability of the
   Monin-Obukhov framework for the evaluation of turbulent fluxes.
   The characteristics of the energy and mass budgets are discussed with
   respect to various time scales and significant weather conditions. Due
   to the masking glacial boundary layer, warm fronts appeared
   comparatively weak compared to the more vigorous cold fronts. The latter
   were often associated with lee effects and give striking signals in the
   turbulent fluxes. Transition from snow to ice induced a distinct change
   in the regime because of related albedo and roughness effects. A
   compilation of the major energy budget components at glaciers all over
   the world confirms the maritime regime at Vatnajokull.}},

Abstract = {{A panel of thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSHR) monoclonal antibodies
   (mAbs), produced using highly purified Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
   cell-produced TSHR, has been used to study TSHR structure. All 41 mAbs
   recognized full-length TSHR containing complex carbohydrate (120 kDa),
   and 40 mAbs recognized full-length precursor-containing high mannose
   sugars (100 kDa). The mAbs also recognized TSHR cleavage products with
   three types of reactivity: type I mAbs reacting with bands at 70 kDa and
   58 kDa, type 2 with bands at 70 kDa and 52 kDa, and type 3 with bands at
   52 kDa and 40 kDa. Deglycosylation studies showed that the 70-kDa and
   58-kDa bands contained complex carbohydrate, whereas the 52-kDa and
   40-kDa bands were unglycosylated. These results are consistent with TSHR
   cleavage occurring at two sites. Cleavage at both sites gives rise to
   glycosylated A subunit (58 kDa) corresponding to the extracellular
   domain of the receptor and nonglycosylated B subunit (40 kDa)
   corresponding to the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Cleavage only at
   site 1 gives rise to the 58-kDa A subunit and a large B subunit (52
   kDa). Cleavage only at site 2 gives rise to a large A subunit (70 kDa)
   and the B subunit (40 kDa). Four of the mAbs inhibited I-125-labeled TSH
   binding to solubilized full-length TSHR. TSH binding was inhibited by
   (a) two type 3 mAbs reactive with the N-terminal region of the B subunit
   (epitopes between amino acids 381 and 385 and between 380 and 418,
   respectively) and (b) two type 2 mAbs reactive with epitopes on the A
   subunit (between amino acids 246 and 260). These results together with
   previous studies on the direct binding of TSH to the TSHR A subunit
   suggest that at least two distinct regions of the TSHR sequence,
   including one region on the A subunit and one region on the B subunit,
   fold together to form part of a complex TSH binding site.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This pilot study was conducted to estimate the use of the
   thoracoscopic surgery as a new approach for the internal mammary nodes
   (IMN) in breast cancer. Patients and methods: For this study, 21 women
   with breast cancer who underwent the approach for nodes IMN were
   enrolled. All the women had suspicious IMN metastasis and no distant
   metastasis.
   Results: Thoracoscopic IMN dissection was performed safely for 20 of the
   women, with an average operative time of 44 min. One woman was excluded
   from the procedure because of pleural adhesion. The patients were
   restricted from walking for 1.3 days because of chest drainage, but no
   patients had severe complication or chest wall deformity after the
   operation. Six patients had positive IMN outcomes. After surgery, 10 of
   the 20 patients had a lower tumor node metastases (TNM) staging. Two
   patients who tested positive for IMN and three who tested negative
   experienced a relapse, but none had pleural dissemination in a median
   follow-up period of 24 months.
   Conclusion: Thoracoscopic surgery may be useful in managing patients

   period. On the other hand, delta C-13(org) showed distinct depletion
   from ca. 14 to 12 C-14 kyr BP (17.5 to 13.2 cal kyr BP). The depletion
   relates to the large supply of terrestrial org. C from the ECS shelf

Abstract = {{This study details the development of a homogeneous time-resolved
   fluorescence (HTRF) high throughput screening assay to identify
   inhibitors of Lck, HTRF was compared with scintillation proximity and
   streptavidin-coated plate assays, Because of the differences in the
   sensitivity of detection of phosphotyrosine among the three assays,
   different amounts of enzyme were used. However, the concentrations of
   the other assay components were standardized. When using similar assay
   conditions, the calculated IC50 values of inhibitory compounds were
   independent of assay format. Furthermore, filtration experiments
   revealed that phosphorylation of a biotinyl poly-Glu,Ala, Tyr peptide
   substrate was less than autophosphorylation of the Lck enzyme; this was
   due to the low K-m value for biotinyl poly-Glu,Ala,Tyr. In the HTRF
   assay, small amounts of enzyme and high concentrations of ATP could be
   used, thereby minimizing the effects of autophosphorylation, Higher ATP
   concentration would also minimize the effect of ATP competitors. Using
   this technology, it may be possible to find novel kinase inhibitors that
   do not act at the ATP binding site of protein tyrosine kinases.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To report a case of congenital superior oblique palsy with an
   unusually large Bielschowsky head-tilt phenomenon (BHP) and
   disproportional inconspicuous vertical deviation.
   METHODS: Case report.
   RESULTS: An 18-year-old woman presented with slight compensatory head
   tilting and a Bielschowsky head-tilt phenomenon of 50 Delta on left
   tilting, Magnetic resonance imaging revealed atrophy of the left
   superior oblique muscle, A Hess screen test showed a slight underaction
   of the left superior oblique muscle, but neither an obvious overaction
   of the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle nor inhibitory palsy of the
   contralateral superior rectus muscle was found. With a 3-mm recession of
   the ipsilateral superior rectus muscle, Bielschowsky head-tilt
   phenomenon decreased to 25 Delta.
   CONCLUSION: A large Bielschowsky head-tilt phenomenon was possibly
   caused by an increased gain of the otolith ocular reflex affecting the
   vertical rectus muscle. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Hereditary combined deficiency of the vitamin K dependent coagulation
   factors is a rare bleeding disorder. To date, only eleven families have
   been reported in the literature. The phenotype varies considerably with
   respect to bleeding tendency, response to vitamin K substitution and the
   presence of skeletal abnormalities, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. In
   only two of the reported families the cause of the disease has been
   elucidated as either a defect in the gamma -carboxylase enzyme (1) or in
   a protein of the vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR) complex (2).
   Here we present a detailed phenotypic description of two new families
   with an autosomal recessive deficiency of all vitamin K dependent
   coagulation factors. In both families offspring had experienced severe
   or even fatal perinatal intracerebral haemorrhage. The affected children
   exhibit a mild deficiency of the vitamin K dependent coagulation factors
   that could be completely corrected by oral substitution of vitamin K.
   Sequencing and haplotype analysis excluded a defect within the gamma
   -carboxylase gene. The finding of highly increased amounts of vitamin K
   epoxide in all affected members of both families indicated a defect in a
   protein of the VKOR-multienzyme-complex. Further genetic analysis of
   such families will provide the basis for a more detailed understanding
   of the structure-function relation of the enzymes involved in vitamin K
   metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium antagonists are used in interventional cardiology to prevent
   coronary vasoconstriction or to overcome the no-reflow phenomenon. The
   aim of the current study was to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of
   intracoronary verapamil on systemic and coronary hemodynamics. In 20
   patients scheduled for routine coronary angiography, heart rate, blood
   pressure, and ECG recordings mere recorded continuously and
   intracoronary flow velocity was obtained by intracoronary Doppler
   measurements in angiographically normal vessels. The cross-sectional
   area, measured by quantitative coronary angiography, allowed the
   calculation of coronary blood flow (CBF) and the coronary vascular
   resistance index (CVRI). Without premedication, increasing dosages of
   verapamil (0.01 mg, 0.1 mg, 1.0 mg, and 2.0 mg) were injected into the
   left coronary artery. Intracoronary verapamil administration led to a
   decrease in systemic blood pressure only after administration of 1.0 mg
   or 2.0 mg (change in mean arterial pressure: from 87.6 +/- 14.6 mmHg to
   80.1 +/- 14.9 mmHg and 78.5 +/- 13.9 mmHg, respectively; both P < 0.05)
   without a change in heart rate. Epicardial diameters of the left
   coronary artery increased only at dosages of 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg (from
   2.14 +/- 0.4 mm to 2.22 +/- 0.3 mm, P < 0.01), whereas the coronary
   blood flow velocity increased significantly at the smallest dosage of
   0.01 mg (from 19.9 +/- 8.7 cm/s to 33.2 +/- 14.9 cm/s, P < 0.001) and
   was further enhanced with increasing dosages. CBF increased and CVRI
   decreased at every dosage of verapamil compared with baseline values.
   CBF increased also after 0.1 mg (from 13.5 +/- 6.5 mL/min to 19.5 +/-
   9.3 mL/min; P < 0.05), reaching a maximal effect after administration of
   1.0 mg verapamil (26.3 +/- 16.1 mL/min, P < 0.05). Application of 2.0 mg
   did not further increase CBF compared with 1.0 mg. Intracoronary
   application of verapamil leads to a decrease in systemic blood pressure
   at higher dosages, whereas heart rate remains unchanged at any dosage.
   The maximal increase in coronary blood flow and decrease in vascular
   resistance can be reached by administration of 1.0 mg verapamil into the
   left; coronary artery.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To identify the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms mediating the
   N-dealkylation of the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in vitro and
   estimate the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved.
   Methods cDNA-expressed CYP isoforms were used to identify the isoforms
   that are able to mediate the N-dealkylation of perphenazine, which is
   considered a major metabolic pathway for the drug. Using human liver
   microsomal preparations (HLM), inhibition studies were carried out to
   establish the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved in the
   N-dealkylation reaction.
   Results CYP isoforms 1A2, 3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19 and 2D6 were able to
   mediate the N-dealkylation of perphenazine. Reaction velocities and
   their relative abundance in HLM suggested that CYP1A2, 3A4, 2C19 and 2D6
   were the most important contributors to N-dealkylation. Apparent K-m
   values of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 were in the range 1-2 muM and K-m values of
   CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 were 14 muM and 7.9 muM, respectively. Ketoconazole
   inhibition of N-dealkylation mediated by a mixed HLM indicated that
   CYP3A4 accounted for about 40\% of perphenazine N-dealkylation at
   therapeutically relevant concentrations. The contribution of the CYP
   isoforms 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 amounted to 20-25\% each as measured by the
   percentage inhibition obtained by addition of furafylline, fluvoxamine
   or quinidine, respectively. HLM-mediated N-dealkylation of perphenazine
   accounted for 57\% of the total amount of substrate consumed during
   incubation.
   Conclusions The present in vitro study suggests that CYP isoforms 1A2,
   3A4, 2C19 and 2CD6 are primarily involved in the N-dealkylation of
   perphenazine. The relatively modest role of CYP2D6 is at variance with
   in viva studies, which indicate a greater contribution of this isoform.
   Alternative metabolic pathways, corresponding to 43\% of the
   HLM-mediated metabolism of the drug, may depend more strongly on CYP2D6.}},

Abstract = {{Bcl-2 and Bax immunohistochemistry was examined in the skeletal muscle
   of rats after cutting the sciatic nerve, as a model of denervation and
   reinnervation, and in the anterior tibialis muscle of rats after an
   intramuscular injection of metoclopramide, as a model of necrosis and
   regeneration of muscle fibers, to better understand the role of these
   proteins in muscle disorders. An increase in Bax immunoreactivity was
   seen in long-standing denervated and reinnervated muscle fibers. Bcl-2
   and Bax immunoreactivity was limited to macrophages in necrotic muscle
   fibers at 24 h after the intramuscular injection of metoclopramide.
   However, increased Bax immunoreactivity was observed in regenerating
   muscle fibers by the fourth day after the injection. Muscle fiber nuclei
   with the morphological features of apoptosis were not observed in rat
   muscles after the intramuscular injection of metoclopramide or after the
   severing of the sciatic nerve. Furthermore, using the Tunel method, no
   stained nuclei were observed in the two groups of animals. Our
   observations in the experimental models of skeletal muscle
   denervation-reinnervation and necrosis-regeneration here described
   suggest that modification in the intensity of the Bax protein is not
   related to the process of cell death but rather that increased Bax
   expression is associated with muscle fiber regeneration. (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Background. Desmopressin (DDAVP) has been evaluated in many randomized
   clinical trials as a means to reduce blood loss and transfusion of
   allogeneic blood in cardiac operation requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.
   Desmopressin reduces blood loss in adult patients with excessive
   bleeding after cardiac operation. Its usefulness in patients undergoing
   complex congenital heart repair with cardiopulmonary bypass is unproved.
   Methods. Sixty patients younger than 40 years of age scheduled for
   complex congenital heart operation (44 redo, 16 primary) were enrolled
   in this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. Desmopressin 0.3
   mug/kg or placebo was administered 10 minutes after protamine
   administration. Transfusion requirements and postoperative blood loss
   were recorded. Differences were analyzed using analysis of variance with
   a p value of 0.05 or less used to denote statistical significance.
   Results. There were no differences in demographic or surgical
   characteristics between the DDAVP or placebo groups. There was no
   difference in blood loss and transfusion requirements between the DDAVP
   and placebo groups. During the intraoperative postinfusion time period,
   the median blood loss for redo patients was 343 versus 357 mL/m(2) for
   placebo versus DDAVP, respectively, and for primary patients, the median
   blood loss was 277 versus 228 mL/m2.
   Conclusions. The prophylactic use of DDAVP to reduce excessive bleeding
   or transfusion requirements in patients undergoing complex congenital
   heart operations is not warranted. (Ann Thorac Surg 2000;70:1923-30) (C)

   Furthermore, low-level intraspecific variation was detected. Sequence
   analyses of ITS2 products of T. ovis and T. globulosa demonstrated no

Abstract = {{A minor stabilization effect was found for the content of total lipids,
   total fatty acids and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) when Artemia
   franciscana was maintained at high concentrations of Isochrysis galbana
   for 72 h at 12 degreesC, both in 3- and 4-day-old individuals. The
   eicosapentaenoic (EPA) level was only stabilized at higher algal
   concentrations in the 4-day-old A. franciscana. In the 3-day-old A.
   franciscana, the EPA content increased at all algal concentrations
   during the first 24 h of post enrichment, presumably as an effect of DHA
   catabolism. Apparently, the 4-day-old A. franciscana metabolized DHA,
   and other lipids, faster than the 3-day-old A. franciscana did. During
   the 72 h incubation with I. galbana, the content of ascorbic acid (AA)
   in A. franciscana increased approximately to 1000-1200 mug g(-1) dry
   weight (DW) at algal concentrations above 3 mg C L-1, close to AA
   content of the algae. The vitamin B-6 content in A. franciscana
   decreased from approximately 20 to 4-11 mug g(-1) DW, with highest loss
   rates at the higher algal concentrations. The thiamin content of A.
   franciscana was independent of algal concentration and remained at 20-30
   mug g(-1) DW. The nutritional effects of the algal incubation on the 3-
   and 4-day-old A. franciscana at algal concentrations which can be used
   during the cultivation of Atlantic-halibut larvae (<2 mg C L-1) was
   insignificant, except for the small enrichment effect of AA already at 1
   mg C L-1. Other beneficial effects of the algae should not be ruled out,
   like possible effects on the microflora of A. franciscana even at algal
   concentrations less than 2 mg C L-1.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the subject of pre-eclampsia has revolved around placental
   growth and angiogenesis, as both are central to the aetiology of the
   disease. Vascular angiogenic growth factor (VEGF) is elevated in
   pre-eclampsia and correlates with the severity of disease. Its actions
   in vitro mimic the actions of plasma from women with pre-eclampsia. This
   chapter examines the available evidence that implicates VEGF in the
   maternal systemic effects seen in preeclampsia, and discusses how an
   understanding of this growth factor could lead to diagnostic and
   therapeutic options. Oxygenation status is the unifying concept that
   surrounds the discussion of placental growth and angiogenesis. The
   concept that `hypoxia' is too simplistic a notion to describe
   pre-eclampsia is discussed. Maldevelopment of the angiogenic process can
   be assessed by Doppler ultrasound. The future may see a role for
   magnetic resonance imaging in the identification of poorly perfused
   placenta.}},

Abstract = {{The Saccharomyces cerevisiae inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases
   (Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p) each contain an N-terminal Sad domain,
   followed by a 5-phosphatase domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain,
   Disruption of any two of these 5-phosphatases results in abnormal
   vacuolar and plasma membrane morphology, We have cloned and
   characterized the Sad-containing 5-phosphatases Inp52p and Inp53p,
   Purified recombinant Inp52p lacking the Sad domain hydrolyzed
   phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate {[}PtdIns(4,5)P-2] and
   PtdIns(3,5)P-2. Inp52p and Inp53p were expressed in yeast as N-terminal
   fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein (GFP), In resting cells
   recombinant GFP-tagged 5-phosphatases we re expressed diffusely
   throughout the cell but were excluded from the nucleus, Following
   hyperosmotic stress the GFP-tagged 5-phosphatases rapidly and
   transiently associated viith actin patches, independent of actin, in
   both the mother and daughter cells of budding yeast as demonstrated by
   colocalization with rhodamine phalloidin. Both the Sad domain and
   proline-rich domains were able to independently mediate translocation of
   Inp52p to actin patches, following hyperosmotic stress, while the Inp53p
   proline-rich domain alone was sufficient for stress-mediated
   localization, Overexpression of Inp52p or Inp53p, but not catalytically
   inactive Inp52p, which lacked PtdIns(4,5)P-2 5-phosphatase activity,
   resulted in a dramatic reduction in the repolarization time of actin
   patches following hyperosmotic stress, We propose that the
   osmotic-stress-induced translocation of Inp52p and Inp53p results in the
   localized regulation of PtdIns(3,5)P-2 and PtdIns(4,5)P-2 at actin
   patches and associated plasma membrane invaginations, This may provide a
   mechanism for regulating actin polymerization and cell growth as an
   acute adaptive response to hyperosmotic stress.}},

Abstract = {{Recent retrospective, observational studies describe an association
   between maternal administration of magnesium and a reduction in cerebral
   palsy in low birthweight infants. Cerebral palsy is thought to result
   mainly from hypoxia-induced brain injury, and its incidence is
   increasing due to recent advances in obstetric and newborn intensive
   care. The findings of the observational studies raise the promising
   possibility that magnesium treatment may protect the immature brain from
   hypoxia-induced injury and thus decrease the incidence of cerebral
   palsy. Despite this promise, a critique of clinical studies indicates
   that a definitive answer is dependent on the outcome of prospective
   clinical trials. A critique of experimental animal studies indicates
   that a neuroprotective role for magnesium prior to, or after, immature
   hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is currently not supported by the avail
   able evidence. Most clinical and animal studies in this field have used
   magnesium sulphate as a possible therapeutic agent. Based on evidence
   that magnesium chloride is a preferable salt to use, the inclusion of
   magnesium chloride in future clinical and experimental studies is worthy
   of consideration.}},

Abstract = {{In early 19th-century Moravia, breeders of animals and plants joined
   with other interested citizens in the Moravian and Silesian Agricultural
   Society to debate economic priorities. Several of the senior members had
   a profound influence upon breeding theory: J.K. Nestler, Professor of
   Natural History and Agriculture at the University of Olomouc, left a
   collection of influential writings. In the context of sheep breeding he
   defined `inheritance capacity' (Vererbungsfahigkeit), `hereditary
   history' (Vererbungsgeschichte) and `developmental history'
   (Entwicklungsgeschichte). His linking of the last two terms, as two
   sides of the same coin, puts Mendel's use of the second one in context.
   Professor F. Diebl taught the same topics as Nestler at the
   Philosophical Institute in Brno, with a bias towards plants. Diebl's
   lectures were attended by Mendel who gained top marks in three
   examinations. Diebl stressed the importance of artificial pollination to
   produce new varieties and recognised peas and beans as suitable subjects
   for the procedure. Prelate Cyrill Napp, abbot before Mendel, had a deep
   interest in heredity and how it was transmitted through both sexes. He
   generously supported Mendel's research. A happy blend of economic and
   academic influences, together with original talent and inner drive, led
   to Mendel's great discovery. (C) 2000 Academie des sciences/Editions

Title = {{Topical dorzolamide 2\%/Timolol 0.5\% - A review of its use in the
   treatment of open-angle glaucoma}},
Journal = {{DRUGS \& AGING}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{477-496}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The nonselective beta -blocker timolol and the carbonic anhydrase
   inhibitor dorzolamide both lower intraocular pressure (IOP), Timolol and
   dorzolamide have different mechanisms of action and their effects are
   additive when administered together. Therefore, the 2 drugs are
   frequently used concomitantly to treat patients with open-angle glaucoma
   who have not adequately responded to first-line therapy. A barrier to
   good compliance with concomitant therapy is the need to administer 5 or
   6 drops of medication on 2 or 4 occasions during the day. Timolol 0.5\%
   and dorzolamide 2.0\% have therefore been combined in a single
   formulation, reducing the number of administrations required to 2 per
   day.
   Clinical trials in patients with glaucoma have demonstrated that
   dorzolamide 2\%/timolol 0.5\% (dorzolamide/timolol) is superior to
   monotherapy with the individual components. When dorzolamide/timolol
   administered twice daily was compared with concomitant treatment with
   dorzolamide 2\% and timolol 0.5\%, each administered twice daily for 90
   days, both regimens resulted in marked lowering of trough IOP (measured
   just before the morning dose) compared with baseline (reduction in IOP =
   4.2mm Hg). The effect of the 2 regimens on IOP at all time points, both
   before treatment and at peak effect (2 hours after treatment), were
   virtually indistinguishable. When the combined formulation was compared
   with a concomitant regimen that included dorzolamide 2\% 3 times daily
   and timolol 0.5\% twice daily the concomitant regimen was slightly more
   efficacious than the combined regimen at trough after 90 days: IOP was
   lowered by 3.6mm Hg in the combined group versus 4,lmm Hg in the
   concomitant group.
   Dorzolamide/timolol has been compared with concomitant administration of
   timolol 0.5\% and the IOP lowering miotic drug, pilocarpine 2.0\%. This
   non-blind patient-preference study found that both regimens reduced IOP.
   However, the dorzolamide/timolol combination was preferred by the
   patients because of reduced frequency and severity of adverse effects
   and less frequent administration.
   Dorzolamide/timolol was well tolerated in clinical trials, the adverse
   effects reflected those of the individual components, and no additional
   tolerability issues were identified. However, the potential for timolol
   to cause cardiorespiratory effects must be considered when prescribing
   this combination. Furthermore, dorzolamide is a sulfonamide and can
   cause allergic reactions in those who are hypersensitive to this class
   of drug.
   Conclusions: Dorzolamide/timolol is a well tolerated and effective fixed
   combination for lowering IOP in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and
   is likely to be useful in those patients who do not respond adequately
   to first-line monotherapy. Compared with concomitant therapy with the
   same 2 drugs the primary advantage is convenience, which may lead to
   improved compliance. Studies of compliance and comparisons with other
   currently available combination therapies would be useful to fully
   define the value of the formulation. Nonetheless, dorzolamide combined
   with timolol in a single applicator system will be a useful addition to
   the treatment options for glaucoma, a leading cause of preventable
   blindness.
   Dorzolamide is a sulfonamide and a carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor
   while timolol is a nonselective beta -blocker. As there is no direct
   interaction between the 2 drugs, their pharmacodynamics will be
   considered independently.
   Timolol is a nonselective beta -blocker which has no local anaesthetic,
   membrane stabilising or sympathomimetic properties. However, the precise
   mechanism by which timolol lowers intraocular pressure (IOP) is not
   known. Timolol lowers IOP by inhibiting aqueous humour production rather
   than by increasing outflow of aqueous humour and it has been suggested
   that timolol down-regulates adenylate cyclase by inhibiting beta
   (2)-adrenoceptor sites at the ciliary process. Dose-response studies in
   volunteers showed that timolol 0.5 to 1.5\% significantly reduced IOP by
   up to 28\% 2 to 5 hours after drug administration.
   Topically instilled timolol is absorbed systemically and statistically
   significant decreases in resting heart rate have been reported after a
   year or more of treatment with timolol. Slight decreases in blood
   pressure have also been noted.
   Dorzolamide is a highly selective inhibitor of CA-II, an isoenzyme
   present on the ciliary process in the eye. Inhibition of CA-II slows
   local bicarbonate production, decreases sodium and fluid transport and,
   consequently, decreases aqueous humour production and lowers IOP.
   Reduction of IOP has been demonstrated after topical administration of
   dorzolamide to the eyes of healthy volunteers and patients with
   open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
   Topically applied dorzolamide can enter the systemic circulation: CA-II
   activity in erythrocytes of patients with glaucoma was reduced to 12\%
   of baseline after treatment with dorzolamide 2\% for 12 months. However,
   research suggests that <1\% of CA-II activity is required to maintain
   physiological function.
   There is emerging evidence that, in addition to inhibiting production of
   aqueous humour, dorzolamide may also improve intraocular blood flow.
   Timolol is absorbed systemically after topical ocular administration. In
   6 patients, the mean peak plasma concentration of timolol after twice
   daily topical administration of a 0.5\% solution was 0.46 <mu>g/L after
   the morning dose, and 0.35 mg/L after the afternoon dose. In rabbits,
   peak concentrations after topical ocular administration of timolol 0.5\%
   were 13-fold higher in aqueous humour than in plasma. After oral (0.1 to
   0.4 mg/kg) or intravenous (0.02 mg/kg) administration of timolol to
   healthy volunteers, the apparent volume of distribution of the drug was
   1.3 to 1.7 L/kg.
   After topical ocular administration of timolol 0.5\% (2 drops in each
   eye) in 11 volunteers, 5 to 46\% of the calculated absorbed dose was
   excreted renally over 24 hours. After an oral dose in volunteers,
   elimination was primarily renal (73\% in 3 days); only 6.4\% was
   excreted in faeces.
   Dorzolamide is absorbed systemically after topical ocular
   administration. However, in healthy volunteers, plasma concentrations of
   dorzolamide remained below detection levels (5 mug/L) after either a
   single dose of 3 drops of dorzolamide 2\% or after instillation 4 times
   daily of 1 drop of dorzolamide 3\% for 14 days; both treatments to both
   eyes. However, in another study a mean plasma concentration of 11 mug/L
   was reported after 6-month therapy of dorzolamide 2\% 1 drop 3 times
   daily in 4 patients with glaucoma. After systemic absorption,
   dorzolamide is preferentially taken up by erythrocytes as a result of
   binding to CA-II. The mean erythrocyte concentration of the drug in 56
   patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were 20.5 mu mol/L after
   12 months' treatment with dorzolamide 2\% eye drops 3 times daily.
   Approximately 24 to 32\% of systemically absorbed dorzolamide is bound
   to plasma proteins.
   In rat liver microsomes dorzolamide is hepatically metabolised to
   N-desethyl-dorzolamide by the cytochrome P450 system.
   N-desethyldorzolamide inhibits CA-II less effectively than the parent
   drug, but also inhibits CA-I (also present on erythrocytes).
   Systemically absorbed dorzolamide is primarily excreted in the urine.
   Both dorzolamide and its metabolite were identified in the urine of
   patients who had received topical ocular dorzolamide 2\% 3 times daily
   for 28 days (mean 140 and 18 mug, respectively, over 8 hours).
   The terminal elimination half-life of dorzolamide in erythrocytes is
   greater than or equal to 120 days, so there is potential for systemic
   accumulation during long term administration. However, in patients with
   glaucoma treated with dorzolamide 2\% 3 times daily, plasma
   concentrations after 12 months were similar to those after 6 months
   (approximate to 20 mu mol/L).
   Large, double-blind, randomised multicentre trials in patients with
   open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension have shown that dorzolamide
   2\%/timolol 0.5\% (dorzolamide/timolol) is superior to monotherapy with
   the individual components, and equivalent to therapy with dorzolamide
   2\% and timolol 0.5\% given concomitantly.
   When dorzolamide/timolol administered twice daily was compared with
   concomitant timolol 0.5\% and dorzolamide 2.0\%, each administered twice
   daily, both regimens resulted in marked lowering of trough IOP (measured
   just before the morning dose) compared with baseline after 90 days of
   treatment (change in IOP = 4.2mm Hg). The effect of the 2 regimens on
   IOP at all time points, both before and 2 hours after treatment (peak
   effect), were virtually indistinguishable. When the combined formulation
   was compared with a concomitant regimen of twice daily timolol and 3
   times daily dorzolamide, the concomitant regimen was slightly more
   efficacious than the combined regimen at the trough measurement after 90
   days: IOP was lowered by 3.6mm Hg in the combined group versus 4.1mm Hg
   in the concomitant group. A 9-month open-label extension of this study,
   where all patients received combined dorzolamide/timolol therapy showed
   that reductions in IOP seen with dorzolamide/timolol at the end of the
   double-blind phase were maintained for up to 1 year.
   Although no direct comparisons of combined ocular hypotensive
   medications have been carried out, the dorzolamide/timolol combination
   has been compared with concomitant timolol 0.5\% and pilocarpine 2.0\%.
   This non-blind patient-preference study found that both regimens
   resulted in a similar lowering of IOP. However, the dorzolamide/timolol
   combination was better tolerated and preferred by the patients because
   of reduced frequency and severity of adverse effects and the need for
   less frequent administration.
   Dorzolamide/timolol was well tolerated in clinical trials and adverse
   effects were generally localised. However, both drugs are absorbed
   systemically, and systemic effects can also occur.
   The tolerability profile of dorzolamide/timolol reflects that of the
   individual components. In clinical trials, the most common adverse
   effects were those relating to the eye and taste. In 1 study burning
   and/or stinging in the eye was the most frequently reported ocular
   adverse effect in patients using dorzolamide/timolol and eyelid pain or
   discomfort occurred in 6\% of dorzolamide/timolol-treated patients
   Versus 1\% of those on concomitant therapy. Taste perversion was a
   common local adverse effect in patients receiving combined therapy.
   A number of instances of irreversible corneal decompensation have been
   reported in dorzolamide-treated patients with pre-existing corneal
   abnormalities or those who have undergone corneal transplant, and
   caution is advised when dorzolamide is prescribed to patients with
   compromised corneas.
   No systemic adverse effects that might have been associated with the
   beta -blocking properties of timolol were reported in clinical trials of
   dorzolamide/timolol. However, patients with cardiorespiratory disease
   were excluded from these trials and shortness of breath and respiratory
   failure have been reported in patients using dorzolamide and timolol
   concomitantly. Therefore, physicians and patients need to be alert to
   the possibility of systemic adverse effects developing during therapy
   with this preparation.
   Headache and nausea reported in patients receiving combined therapy are
   likely to have been associated with dorzolamide. Also, dorzolamide is a
   sulfonamide derivative and, in common with most carbonic anhydrase
   inhibitors, has the potential to cause hypersensitivity.
   For the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the dose of
   dorzolamide/timolol is 1 drop twice daily in the affected eye. If
   additional topical ophthalmic formulations are being used, they should
   be administered 10 minutes apart. Dorzolamide/timolol should be used
   with caution in those with hepatic insufficiency and is not recommended
   in patients with severe renal impairment. Dorzolamide/timolol is
   contraindicated in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, severe
   obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac failure, sinus bradycardia,
   atrioventricular block or cardiogenic shock. The formulation should not
   be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to either of the
   components (e.g. sensitivity to sulfonamide).}},

Abstract = {{Soybean protein isolates were hydrolyzed with papain, bromelain,
   cucurbita, hieronymin, and pomiferin. The highest hydrolysis rate for
   cucurbita and the lowest for papain was detected at 720 min. Gel
   filtration, reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and electrophoresis
   showed that the action of each protease was different. Pomiferin acted
   on the native structure of beta -conglycinin and glycinin, generating a
   large number of small hydrolysis products with hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic characteristics. The hydrolysates obtained with cucurbita
   showed residual structures that were almost intact and very similar to
   the substrate and contained a low number of small peptides. The
   hydrolyzates obtained with papain, bromelain, and hieronymin had
   hydrolysis products with structures similar to the partially hydrolyzed
   native isolate. The molecular masses of these products were similar to
   or lower than the controls. Polypeptides of low molecular mass were also
   detected. The prevalence of one-by-one and zipper mechanisms was
   suggested for cucurbita and pomiferin, respectively. For the other
   proteases both mechanisms were likely to coexist. The solubility of
   hydrolysates and their ability to form and stabilize foams correlated
   well with the structural properties and with the suggested mechanisms of
   hydrolysis. The best properties were presented by the hydrolysates
   prepared with cucurbita. Foaming ability for pomiferin hydrolysates was
   as high as that for unhydrolyzed soy isolate, but the foams were
   extremely unstable.}},

   against the VEGF121 or VEGF165 isoforms. The V189Rz was introduced into
   the human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line (OZ-6/VR). The
   expression level of VEGF189 mRNA was decreased in the OZ-6/VR cells,
   while VEGF121 and 165 expression was unaltered. The OZ-6/VR cells
   xenotransplanted into nude mice showed markedly reduced vascularisation
   :Ind growth, whereas the cell line did not show any decreased growth
   under tissue culture conditions. The OZ-6/VR cells (1 x 10(5)
   cells/mouse) formed no tumours, whereas the parental OZ-6 cells formed
   large tumours within 8 weeks. The specific suppression of VEGF189 by the
   ribozyme decreased vascularity and xenotransplantability of the lung
   cancer cell line. Thus, the cell-associated isoform of VEGF, VEGF189,
   might have a key role in stromal vascularisation and the growth of NSCLC
   xenografts in vivo. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing the flux through central carbon metabolism is difficult
   because of rigidity in regulatory structures, at both the genetic and
   the enzymatic levels. Here we describe metabolic engineering of a
   regulatory network to obtain a balanced increase in the activity of all
   the enzymes in the pathway, and ultimately, increasing metabolic flux
   through the pathway of interest, By manipulating the GAL gene regulatory
   network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a tightly regulated
   system, we produced prototroph mutant strains, which increased the flux
   through the galactose utilization pathway by eliminating three known
   negative regulators of the GAL system: Gale, Gal80, and Mig1. This led
   to a 41\% increase in flux through the galactose utilization pathway
   compared with the wild-type strain. This is of significant interest
   within the field of biotechnology since galactose is present in many
   industrial media. The improved galactose consumption of the gal mutants
   did not favor biomass formation, but rather caused excessive
   respiro-fermentative metabolism, with the ethanol production rate
   increasing linearly with glycolytic flux.}},

Abstract = {{STAT4 and STAT6 are essential for the development of CD4(+) Th1 and Th2
   development, respectively, Tumor immunologists have hypothesized that
   Th1 cells are critical in tumor immunity because they facilitate
   differentiation of CD8(+) T cells, which are potent anti-tumor
   effectors. We have used STAT4(-/-) and STAT6(-/-) mice to test this
   hypothesis. BALB/c and knockout mice were challenged in the mammary
   gland with the highly malignant and spontaneously metastatic
   BALB/c-derived 4T1 mammary carcinoma. Primary tumor growth and
   metastatic disease are reduced in STAT6(-/-) mice relative to BALB/c and
   STAT4(-/-) mice. Ab depletions demonstrate that the effect is mediated
   by CD8(+) T cells, and immunized STAT6(-/-) mice have higher levels of
   4T1-specific CTL than BALB/c or STAT4(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, Th1 or
   Th2 cells are not involved, because CD4 depletion does not diminish the
   anti-tumor effect. Therefore, deletion of the STAT6 gene facilitates
   development of potent anti-tumor immunity via a CD4(+)-independent
   pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC) undergoing hepatectomy depends mostly on tumor
   recurrence. Portal vein invasion (Vp) and intrahepatic metastasis (LM)
   might strongly reflect the invasiveness of HCC, but the number of
   patients in the present series in whom either of these factors were
   detected was small. In this study, we defined Vp and IM as the
   extratumor spread, and we focused on the relationship between recurrence
   in patients after hepatectomy and the extratumor spread and the mitotic
   activities of cancer cells, in the hope that careful monitoring of
   recurrence might be possible by simply analyzing histology of the
   resected specimens.
   Methods: Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the
   factors potentially related to recurrence in 50 patients who underwent
   hepatectomy for HCC.
   Results: The cumulative recurrence rate at 5 years was 81.0\%. In
   univariate analysis, absence of the extratumor spread, mitotic index of
   four or less, and curative resection were significantly correlated with
   low incidence of recurrence. In multivariate analysis, the extratumor
   spread was the only significant variable influencing recurrence. The
   mitotic index in HCCs with the extratumor spread was significantly
   higher than the mitotic index in HCCs without the extratumor spread.
   Conclusions: As a predictive factor for recurrence after resection of
   HCC, the extratumor spread that reflects the malignant potential of
   cancer cells was found to be more accurate than is any single
   invasiveness parameter such as Vp or IM. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Based on social identity theory, the authors predicted that in ongoing

   have a positive impact on their behavioral efforts on behalf of an

   case when its current status is high. In a first experiment, male
   participants showed the expected pattern of behavior Female
   participants, however tended to display opposite reactions. As a
   possible explanation, it was argued that the experimental procedure may
   have inadvertently evoked a gender-based stereotype threat for female
   participants. In an attempt to obtain more consistent support for their
   hypothesis, the authors therefore replicated the experiment with
   modifications to avoid such a threat. These changes Proved to be
   effective in the sense that this time the predicted interaction effect

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a contemporary relational interpretation of the
   Rorschach that is consistent with the empirical features of the
   Comprehensive System. The specific focus is on color determinants and
   the FC:CF+C ratio. The approach follows that of Schachtel ( 1959), who
   argued that how one perceives others reveals the quality of relatedness
   between oneself and others. Schachtel identified a developmental
   sequence of relatedness (perceptual-relatedness modes) and linked these
   levels of perceiving and relating to the Rorschach color determinants. I
   suggest that this developmental sequence, elaborated in a contemporary
   context, defines the expected or normative course of relatedness,
   whether across a lifetime, a particular relationship, or an
   interpersonal encounter. I further propose that relationships emerge and
   develop through organized trial-and-error activity, in the sense of
   Piaget's (1952) trying out (assimilating) and simultaneously modifying
   (accommodating) one's understanding within a relationship. Relatedness
   levels and the developmental transitions between them are described in
   terms of the underlying assimilation and accommodation processes. Within
   this general approach, the FC: CF+C ratio is defined as reflecting
   styles of relating to one's interpersonal environment, with each
   relational style based on normative or on variant relational
   development. Four fundamental relational styles-healthy, egocentric,
   veneered egocentric, and defensive-are described and coordinated with
   the Comprehensive System FC:CF+C potential findings.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted during winter season of 1995-97 at
   Ranchi on sandy-loam soil in randomized block design to study the effect
   of irrigation on dry-matter partitioning and yield of late sown wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori \& Paol.). Treatment consisted of 11
   irrigation schedules based on frequency and critical growth stages, viz
   4 irrigations at (i) crown root initiation + maximum tillering + boot +
   milk; 3 irrigations at (ii) crown-root initiation + maximum tillering +
   boot; (iii) crown-root initiation + boot + milk; (iv) crown-root
   initiation + maximum tillering + milk; (v) maximum tillering + boot +
   milk and 2 irrigations at (vi) crown-root initiation + maximum
   tillering; (vii) crown-root initiation + boot; (viii) crown-root
   initiation + milk; (ix) maximum tillering + boot; (x) maximum tillering
   + milk and (xi) boot + milk. Wheat with 4 irrigations gave 27.2 and 64.5
   \% more grain yield than the crop with 3 (2 128 kg/ha) and 2 (1 646
   kg/ha) irrigations respectively. Water-stress at maximum tillering and
   milk stages drastically reduced the grain yield by 34.7 and 25.9 \%
   respectively compared with the crop with 4 irrigations (2 707 kg/ha).
   Similarly crop with 4 irrigations accumulated 60.2 \% of total
   dry-matter (1 089 g/m(2))in spike, 34.9\% in stem and only 5\% in the
   leaves at maturity.. Moisture stress at maximum tillering caused maximum
   reduction in total dry-matter production (23.8 \%) as well as spike
   dry-matter partitioning by approximately 4\%.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetic muscle infarction is a rare complication of diabetes mellitus.
   However, idiopathic compartment syndrome in the diabetic patient is even
   a rarer disease, which has been reported only in three cases up to date.
   The disease seems to occur in patients affected by type 1 diabetes
   mellitus with a history of poorly controlled glucose levels. MRI aids in
   the diagnosis by delineating the edema of the muscle. However,
   definitive diagnosis is made using the Stryker needle unit. Treatment is
   accomplished by immediate two-incision fasciotomy.
   We present a case where a 34 yr-old female with a long standing history
   of poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus presented with a painful
   right lower extremity and was diagnosed with compartment syndrome. In
   our patient, a single incision fasciotomy to release the pressure was
   sufficient and might be considered as an alternative and less morbid
   procedure in the diabetic patient with already poorly healing tissues.
   We conclude that the muscle infarction in these patients is from diffuse
   microangiopathic disease leading to muscular infarction and fluid
   accumulation in the cells causing a decrease in the space in the
   compartment in question causing compartment syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{From a Bayesian point of view, in this paper we discuss the influence of
   a subset of observations on the posterior distributions of parameters in
   a growth curve model with unstructured covariance. The measure used to
   assess the influence is based on a Bayesian entropy, namely
   Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Several new properties of the
   Bayesian entropy are studied, and analytically closed forms of the KLD
   measurement both for the matrix-variate normal distribution and the
   Wishart distribution are established. In the growth curve model, the KLD
   measurements for all combinations of the parameters are also studied.
   For illustration, a practical data set is analyzed using the proposed
   approach, which shows that the diagnostics measurements are useful in
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The aim of this study was to show, whether a certain
   prophylacting applicable radiation affects the cognition, particularly,
   the specific cognitive components P50, N100, P300 and N400 of auditory
   event related potentials (ERPs) during a short memory test.
   Methods and materials. Eleven patients with small cell lung cancer
   (SCLC), who had presented complete response of disease after
   chemotherapy and radical radiotherapy in the lung, were prescribed to
   receive a prophylacting cranial irradiation (PCI) with a 6 MeV linear
   accelerator. The dose schedule was consisting of a total dose up to 30
   Gy in 10 fractions, within 12 days (5 days a week). The
   psychophysiological approach before and after PCI was assessed by
   measurements of the auditory ERPs during a short memory performance
   using the digit-span Wechsler test. Components of ERP were recorded from
   15 scalp electrodes. Additionally, symptomatology of depression and
   anxiety were assessed using Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and
   Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, respectively, for pre- and post-PCI.
   Results. No significant difference was noticed pre- and
   post-radiotherapy of all particular level of psychophysiological
   analysis concerning both the latencies and the amplitudes of ERPs
   auditory components P50, N100, P300 and N400 (P > 0.05, Wilcoxon signed
   test). Additionally, no changes were found with regard to behavioral
   performance (memory recall), depression symptomatology and state
   anxiety, according to pre- and post-radiation measurements. However, the
   self-reported depression symptomatology showed that the patients
   presented moderate depression.
   Conclusion. No short-term psychophysiological neurotoxicity was detected
   with this PCI schedule using these instruments, lending additional
   support to evidence suggesting the benefit of this certain PCI schedule
   for patients with SCLC.}},

   hardware/software codesign project. The results from this tool show that
   profiling must be performed on dedicated hardware which is as close as
   possible to the final implementation, as opposed to a workstation.
   Further, in this paper a formula is derived for the number of times a

Abstract = {{We present two cases of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) with unusual
   histopathological findings. The main histopathological feature of PG is
   usually massive neutrophilic infiltration; the neutrophil is thus the
   cytologic hallmark of PG. The occurrence of vasculitis is controversial.
   In our patients, in contrast, biopsy specimens revealed extensive
   granulomatous inflammation with massive tissue necrosis throughout the
   entire dermis and subcutaneous tissue and vascular involvement

Abstract = {{We present a systematic formalism to derive a path-integral formulation
   for hard-core particle systems far from equilibrium. Writing the master
   equation for a stochastic process of the system in terms of the
   annihilation and creation operators with mixed commutation relations, we
   find the Kramers-Moyal coefficients for the corresponding Fokker-Planck
   equation (FPE), and the stochastic differential equation (SDE) is
   derived by connecting these coefficients in the FPE to those in the SDE.
   Finally, the SDE is mapped onto field theory using the path integral,
   giving the held-theoretic action, which may be analyzed by the
   renormalization group method. We apply this formalism to a two-species
   reaction-diffusion system with drift, finding a universal decay exponent
   for the long-time behavior of the average concentration of particles in
   arbitrary dimension.}},

Abstract = {{The Maryland Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998 (WQIA) seeks to
   create environmental and other benefits to the Chesapoake Bay through
   reductions in nonpoint source nutrient pollution. This paper analyzes
   the economic impacts of the WQIA on agricultural users of nutrients
   (commercial fertilizers or animal manures) and on poultry growers in the
   state of Maryland. The net economic impacts to each of these groups are
   estimated along with some discussion of the distribution of the impacts.
   Recognition of the distribution of the impacts allows for the assessment
   of potential policies to address negative impacts. Additional sections
   of the WQIA are discussed in terms of their ability to shift the
   distribution of the impacts or to provide partial compensation to those
   most affected. The WQIA is the most restrictive agricultural nonpoint
   pollution control law in the US. While the WQIA only regulates nutrient
   use in the state of Maryland, other states, as well as the federal
   government. are watching how this law is implemented. Many states are
   considering similar laws. At the national level, the United States
   Department of Agriculture and the United States Environmental Protection
   Agency have issued draft guidelines that will control nutrients from
   animal operations in much the same way as the WQIA. Therefore, analyses
   of the economic impacts of the WQIA may be important in shaping policies
   in other states and at the national level. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Oil palm is an important economic crop for Malaysia. Genetic engineering
   could be applied to produce transgenic oil palms with high value-added
   fatty acids and novel products to ensure the sustainability of the palm
   oil industry. Establishment of a reliable transformation and
   regeneration system is essential for genetic engineering. Biolistic was
   initially chosen as the method for oil palm transformation as it has
   been the most successful method for monocotyledons to date. Optimization
   of physical and biological parameters, including testing of promoters
   and selective agents, was carried out as a prerequisite for stable
   transformation. This has resulted in the successful transfer of reporter
   genes into oil palm and the regeneration of transgenic oil palm, thus
   making it possible to improve the oil palm through genetic engineering.
   Besides application of the Biolistics method, studies on transformation
   mediated by Agrobacterium and utilization of the green fluorescent
   protein gene as a selectable marker gene have been initiated. Upon the
   development of a reliable transformation system, a number of useful
   targets are being projected for oil palm improvement. Among these
   targets are high-oleate and high-stearate oils, and the production of
   industrial feedstock such as biodegradable plastics. The efforts in oil
   palm genetic engineering are thus not targeted as commodity palm oil.
   Due to the long life cycle of the palm and the time taken to regenerate
   plants in tissue culture, it is envisaged that commercial planting of
   transgenic palms will not occur any earlier than the year 2020.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Acoustic rhinometry measurements are influenced by factors related to
   subject posture, breathing, inclination and positioning of the wavetube,
   leaks and distortion at the nostril - nose adapter connection and
   ambient noise. We present simple techniques to control these errors.
   Thus, gel on contoured nose adapters, shadow tracing to maintain
   posture, laser homing for wavetube alignment, are all integrated into a
   practical scheme that is easy to implement and causes minimum discomfort
   to subjects. Repeatability improved to Below 3\% coefficient of
   variation (CV) in non decongested subjects when trained operators used
   all the techniques together viz. gel on nose adaptors, shadow tracing,
   laser homing. In a factorial experiment, repeated measurements were made
   on subjects over two consecutive days with operator training and
   standardization tools as variables. An analysis of variance identified
   the most important factors to be gel on contoured nose adapters,
   operator training and control of breathing. With gel, the mean CV
   between readings was 5.8\%, measurement time 30.3 seconds. The tools,
   especially gel and shadow tracing, helped untrained operators achieve
   performance levels that were more comparable with trained operators.
   Reproducible curves could be taken rapidly. Thus a significant
   difference of 31.2 seconds between untrained and trained operators
   reduced to 12.6 seconds using tools. These techniques significantly
   improve the reliability, speed and ease of doing repeated acoustic
   rhinometry measurements and thus the quality of data generated in nasal
   studies.}},

Journal = {{EMBO JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{6392-6400}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Tim8 and Tim13 are non-essential, conserved proteins of the
   mitochondrial intermembrane space, which are organized in a
   hetero-oligomeric complex. They are structurally related to Tim9 and
   Tim10, essential components of the import machinery for mitochondrial
   carrier proteins. Here me show that the TIM8-13 complex interacts with
   translocation intermediates of Tim23, which are partially translocated
   across the outer membrane but not,vith fully imported or assembled
   Tim23. The TIM8-13 complex binds to the N-terminal or intermediate
   domain of Tim23. It traps the incoming precursor in the intermembrane
   space thereby preventing retrograde translocation. The TIM18-13 complex
   is strictly required for import of Tim23 under conditions when a low
   membrane potential exists in the mitochondria. The human homologue of
   Tim8 is encoded by the DDP1 (deafness/dystonia peptide 1) gene, which is
   associated with the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (MTS), a progressive
   neurodegenerative disorder leading to deafness. It is demonstrated that
   import of human Tim23 is dependent on a high membrane potential. A
   mechanism to explain the pathology of MTS is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Myosin mutants and their suppressors can provide information about
   conformational states of the myosin motor and their biochemical
   properties. Appropriate mutations can give rise to motors that arrest or
   overoccupy otherwise inaccessible states in the motor cycle. Intragenic
   (in the same gene) suppresser mutations that counteract mutations of
   known properties represent ``fixes{''} or counters to the defect of the
   starting mutation and thus contain information about driving transitions
   or stabilizing states of the motor. Due to its variety of
   myosin-dependent phenotypes, Dictyostelium is a powerful tool for the
   identification of conditional mutants as well as selection of large
   numbers of intragenic revertants of a mutant of interest. Techniques are
   presented that allow isolation and identification of cold-sensitive
   myosin mutants in Dictyostelium as well as facile selection of
   revertants and identification of their suppressing mutation. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Metabolic adaptations to environmental changes were studied in
   Caenorhabditis elegans. To assess adjustments in enzyme function,
   maximum activities of key enzymes of main metabolic pathways were
   determined. After a 12 h incubation at varying temperatures (10, 20
   degreesC) and oxygen supplies (normoxia or anoxia), the activities of
   the following enzymes were determined at two measuring temperatures in
   tissue extracts: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; anaerobic glycolysis),
   3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (HCDH; fatty acid oxidation), isocitrate
   dehydrogenases (NAD-IDH, NADP-IDH; tricarboxylic acid cycle) and
   isocitrate lyase (ICL; glyoxylate cycle). Incubation at 20 degreesC
   induced a strong increase in maximum LDH activity. Anoxic incubation
   caused maximum HCDH and NADP-IDH activities and, at 10 degreesC
   incubation, LDH activity to increase. Maximum NAD-IDH and ICL activities
   were not influenced by any type of incubation. In order to study the
   time course of metabolic adaptations to varying oxygen supplies,
   relative quantities of free and protein-bound NADH were determined in
   living C. elegans using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. During
   several hours of anoxia, free and protein-bound NADH showed different
   time courses. One main result was that just at the moment when the
   protein-bound NADH had reached a constant level, and the free NADH
   started to increase rapidly, the worms fell into a rigor state. The data
   on enzyme activity and NADH fluorescence can be interpreted on the basis
   of a two-stage model of anaerobiosis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine the long-term effects of treatment in children
   receiving radiotherapy for head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma.
   Methods: From 1967 to 1994, a total of 30 children with head and neck
   rhabdomyosarcoma received megavoltage radiotherapy at one institution.
   Seventeen patients (57\%) have survived and have at least a 5-year
   follow-up. There were 11 males and 6 females, with a median age of 5.7
   years (range 2.2-11.6) at the time of radiotherapy. Tumor location was
   orbit in 6 patients, infratemporal fossa in 4, paranasal sinuses in 2,
   and supraglottic larynx in 2; the nasopharynx, pterygopalatine fossa,
   and parotid gland were sites for the remaining children. All but 2
   patients had tumors of embryonal histology. The Intergroup
   Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) Group was I in 2, II in 3, and III in 11
   children; 1 patient had a recurrent tumor after surgery alone.
   Radiotherapy volume was the primary tumor or tumor bed in 13, tumor and
   whole brain in 3, and tumor and craniospinal axis in 1. Median
   radiotherapy dose to the primary site was 5,040 cGy (range 4,140-6,500)
   and to the whole brain was 3,000 cGy. All but 1 were treated with
   150-200-cGy fractions; 1 patient received 250-cGy fractions for a tumor
   in the larynx. Chemotherapy was vincristine (V), actinomycin-D (A), and
   cyclophosphamide (C) in 10 patients, VAC + adriamycin in 2, VA in 1, VA
   + ifosfamide in 1, VC + adriamycin in 1, and none in 2. One patient had
   salvage chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide. Median
   follow-up time was 20 years (range 7.5-33).
   Results: Late effects of treatment were seen in all patients and
   included facial growth retardation in 11, neuroendocrine dysfunction in
   9, visual/orbital problems in 9, dental abnormalities in 7, hearing loss
   in 6, and hypothyroidism in 3. Intellectual and academic delays were
   documented in 3 patients who had received whole brain radiotherapy.
   While neuroendocrine, thyroid, dental, and cognitive sequelae were
   primarily attributed to radiotherapy, hearing loss was thought to be a
   direct result of tumor destruction and, in 1 case, cisplatin
   chemotherapy. Late effects at or beyond 10 years from radiotherapy were
   few, but severe, and included chondronecrosis, esophageal stenosis,
   second malignancy, and brain hemorrhage.
   Conclusion: Late effects of treatment in children receiving radiotherapy
   for head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma are frequent. Although radiotherapy
   is a significant contributor of neuroendocrine, dental, thyroid, and
   cognitive toxicity, it is not usually implicated with hearing loss. Late
   toxicity of treatment beyond 10 years is not as frequent as those
   occurring within 10 years of therapy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) is widely distributed in the
   myenteric neurons along GI tract. Biological effects of CGRP on
   gastrointestinal tract include increase in the intestinal blood now,
   relaxation of the smoth muscle and slight increase in the slow wave
   amplitude (SWA) with no effect on frequency (SWF) of intestinal
   myoelectric activity (IMA). The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   possible protective effects of endo- and exogenous CORP against
   ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced bowel injury in rats. Experiments
   were performed on 30 fasted anesthetized Wistar rats. Systemic arterial
   blood pressure (AP), mesenteric blood flow (MBF) and microcirculatory
   intestinal blood flow (LDBF) were measured. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was
   estimated from MBF and mesenteric AVO(2) difference. IMA was recorded by
   4 monopolar electrodes in proximal jejunum and analyzed using computer
   program with Fourrier analysis of SWF. Control ischemia induced by 30
   min total occlusion of anterior mesenteric artery (AMA) reduced SWA by
   25+/-5\% and SWF by 24+/-4\%. At the end of 60 minute reperfusion period
   SWA and SWF values were restored to control values but SWF showed
   Instability. At the 15(th) minute of reperfusion period MBF, LDBF and
   VO2 increased to 109+/-6, 119+/-11 and 120+/-7\% of control values
   respectively. Infusion of exogenous CGRP (0,16 mug/kg/min i.a.)
   increased MBF, LDBF and VO2 by 26+/-6, 31+/-9 and 20+/-4\% respectively
   in comparison to control values. In the same experimental group SWA
   increase of 14\% was observed with not significant changes in SWF. In
   the group where CGRP was administrated before and during 30 min period
   of intestinal ischemia MBF, LDBF and VO2 values at 15(th) minute of
   reperfusion were significantly higher by 24+/-6, 32+/-7 and 17+/-5\%
   respectively in comparison to the values observed in the control
   reperfusion. In that group SWA values were restored to preocclusion
   values at 15(th) minute of reperfusion yet and SWF showed much more
   stability. Infusion of CORP receptor antagonist (CGRP 8-37) reduced MBF,
   LDBF and VO2 by 12+/-7, 14+/-8 and 11+/-6\% respectively (differences
   not significant versus control). In I/R group when CGRP 8-37 was given
   hemodynamic parameters (during reperfusion) were significantly lower and
   IMA parameters were not restored to preocclusion values. We conclude,
   that endogenous and exogenous CGRP attenuate circulatory parameters of
   the small intestine during ischemia and reperfusion. A direct
   correlation exists between hemodynamic, metabolic and myoelectric
   effects of CGRP.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Recent reports have shown that the autosomal dominant retinitis
   pigmentosa (adRP) phenotype linked to the pericentric region of
   chromosome 8 is associated with mutations in a gene designated RP1.
   Screening of the whole gene in a large cohort of patients has not been
   undertaken to date. To assess the involvement and character of RP1
   mutations in adRP, the gene was screened in a panel of 266 unrelated
   patients of British origin and a Pakistani family linked to this locus.
   METHODS. Patients exhibiting the adRP phenotype were screened for
   mutations in the four exons of the RP1 gene by heteroduplex analysis and
   direct sequencing. Linkage of the Pakistani family was achieved using
   microsatellite markers. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were
   separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Alleles
   were assigned to individuals, which allowed calculation of LOD scores.
   Microsatellite marker haplotyping was used to determine ancestry of
   patients carrying the same mutation.
   RESULTS. In the 266 British patients and 1 Pakistani family analyzed, 21
   loss-of-function mutations and 7 amino acid substitutions were
   identified, some of which may also be disease-causing. The mutations,
   many of which were deletion or insertion events, were clustered in the
   5' end of exon 4. Most mutations resulted in a premature termination
   codon in the mRNA. Haplotype analysis of nine patients carrying an R677X
   mutation suggested that these patients are not ancestrally related.
   CONCLUSIONS. RP1 mutations account for 8\% to 10\% of the mutations in
   our cohort of British patients. The most common disease-causing
   mechanism is deduced to be one involving the presence of a truncated
   protein. Mutations in RP1 have now been described in adRP patients of
   four ethnically diverse populations. The different disease haplotype
   seen in the nine patients carrying the same mutation suggests that this
   mutation has arisen independently many times, possibly due to a mutation
   hot spot in this part of the gene.}},

Abstract = {{The Australian elapids inject venom which is characteristic of each
   species; and which cause characteristic and specific envenomation
   syndromes in human victims of snakebite. Because many of the medically
   significant Australian elapids look similar, when glimpsed in the field
   by snakebite victims, defining human envenomation syndromes with secure
   species identification has been a slow process. Correlations between
   securely identified species and the human envenomation syndromes which
   they produce are still evolving. The genus Pseudechis is the most
   widespread in Australia of the dangerous Australian elapid genera; and
   P. porphyriacus, the Red-bellied Black Snake, was the first terrestrial
   Australian elapid to be described and illustrated and the first to be
   the subject of experimental study. We present here five previously
   unreported cases of human envenomation in which the species diagnosis is
   secure. From these and with the perspective of a selected literature
   review, we describe the full envenomation syndrome of this species.
   Until the development of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories' Venom
   Detection Kit in 1979 and the occasional case report of victims of
   securely identified species, envenomation syndromes for most Australian
   snake species have remained indeterminate, because of the lack of
   professional expertise in the identification of the species involved.
   Symptoms of the P. porphyriacus envenomation syndrome include those of
   bite-site pain, nausea and vomiting, generalised pruritis. chest pain,
   prostration and abnormalities of taste and smell. Signs include local
   necrosis and scarring of tissue at the bite-site, gross inflammation of
   surrounding tissues and, at least in one case, epilepsy. Although
   envenomation by the Red-bellied Black Snake is not lethal in adults, the
   correct therapy is Tiger Snake antivenom, administered with judgement,
   taking into account knowledge of the specific envenomation syndrome of
   this species and the clinical status of the victim. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: The rubber hand illusion is a tactile sensation referred to
   as an alien limb, The illusion has been explained by a spurious
   reconciliation of visual and tactile inputs reflecting functional
   connectivity in the bl ain and was used to explore alterations of
   functional connectivity in schizophrenia.
   Methods: The rubber hand illusion was achieved when two paintbrushes
   simultaneously stroke the hand of the subject hidden from vision by a
   screen, as well as an artificial hand placed in view of the subject. The
   rubber hand illusion was assessed with a questionnaire affirming or
   denying the occurrence of the illusion.
   Results: Schizophrenic subjects felt the illusion stronger and faster
   then did normal control subjects. Some rubber hand illusion effects
   col-related with positive symptoms of schizophrenia but not with
   negative symptoms,
   Conclusions: Altered functional integration of environ mental inputs
   could constitute the basis for erroneous interpretations of reality,
   such as delusions and hallucinations. (C) 2000 Society of Biological

   exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption were assessed by
   questionnaire, together with measures of risk awareness, beliefs about
   the importance of each behaviour for health, health status, health locus
   and health value. The sample included 793 Black University students from
   non-health courses chosen at random from the University of the North,
   South Africa. The students were 370 (46.7\%) males and 423 (53.3\%)
   females in the age range of 18 to 25 years (M age 21.0 years, SD=3.48).
   The following prevalences for healthy behaviour was found: almost half
   (44.7\%) avoided fat and cholesterol and likewise 48\% had exercised in
   the past 14 days. More than 90\% were non-smokers and 84\% were
   non-drinkers or drank alcohol only very occasionally. Sex emerged as an
   independent predictor for smoking and drinking. Men smoked and drank
   more than women did. The level of risk awareness about healthy behaviour
   seemed to be low in this sample. Risk awareness and prevalence of health
   behaviour was only found to have significant effects for non-smoking and
   not for the other health behaviours (exercise, fat intake, alcohol
   consumption). Beliefs were more important independent predictors of
   dietary fat intake and exercises than was risk awareness.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of cholesteryl esters (CEs) is a key event in the formation
   of aeherosclerotic plaques. More recent work suggests a role for CEs in
   plaque rupture leading to thrombosis, which can result in an acute event
   such as myocardial infarction or stroke. In this study, we present
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)protocols for quantification of CEs in
   plaques in situ. Total CEs quantified by C-13 magic-angle spinning
   (NIAS) NMR in excised plaques from human carotid arteries and rabbit
   aortic arteries were in good agreement with the amounts determined by
   subsequent standard chemical assays. The latter analysis is
   disadvantageous because it requires that plaque lipids be extracted from
   the tissue, resulting in the loss of all phase:information of CEs as
   well as other major plaque components. With our MAS-NMR protocol, the
   plaque components are preserved in their native phases. Combining MAS
   and off-MAS NMR, we were able to quantitatively distinguish isotropic
   (liquid) CEs from anisotropic (liquid-crystalline) CEs in plaque
   tissues. In a recent study, we applied a different C-13 MAS-NMR protocol
   to quantify crystalline cholesterol monohydrate in plaques; Together,
   these 2 studies describe a new, noninvasive MAS-NMR strategy for the
   identification and quantification of the major lipid components in
   plaques in situ. This approach will be useful for investigation of the
   relationship between plaque rupture and specific lipids in their
   biologically relevant phases.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of low ligand/Zr mole ratios (rho = 0-0.1) on the
   hydrolysis and growth of oligomers from Zr((OPr)-Pr-n)(4) modified with
   a series of beta -diketones (trifluoroacetylacetone,
   hexafluoroacetylacetone, benzoylacetone, dibenzoylmethane and
   dipivaloylmethane), and their subsequent aggregation to form uniform,
   dense spheres, has been investigated by light scattering and
   turbidometry. The addition of beta -diketones results in a large
   increase in the induction time, t(i) (reduction in
   hydrolysis/condensation rates). A remarkable feature of the data is the
   dramatic reductions in rate observed even when a maximum of one in forty
   Zr-OR bonds have been replaced by the beta -diketone and are no longer
   available for hydrolysis or further condensation. The largest effect is
   observed with dibenzoylmethane, which increases t(i) by a factor of 26
   relative to acetylacetone.
   A mechanism rationalising the origin of the effect is discussed, which
   involves segregation of the beta -diketone ligands on the surface of the
   growing particle, with subsequent particle growth restricted to those
   sites not occupied by the chelating ligands.}},

Abstract = {{The surface enhancement of the Raman scattering (SERS) is based on two
   major mechanisms. First, the optical resonance of the incident light
   with the metallic surface leads to the excitation of localized surface
   plasmons and the enhancement of the local electromagnetic field. Second,
   optical resonances of the energy levels between the adsorbate orbitals
   and the metal electrons may result in a resonant charge transfer, which
   causes the resonance Raman or charge transfer enhancement. For dyes at
   aggregated colloids, the total differential cross sections can reach
   values of about (d sigma /d Omega) similar to 10(-16) cm(2) sr(-1),
   which are comparable with cross sections for the fluorescence of laser
   dyes in solution. In contrast, Raman spectroscopy at surfaces that do
   not support surface plasmon excitation (smooth surfaces or transition
   metal surfaces) is based solely on chemical or resonance Raman
   enhancement, yielding only weak signals. After reviewing recent results
   on SERS, we present an approach that combines the Raman spectroscopy at
   smooth surfaces with the local electromagnetic field enhancement by an
   optically active Ag STM tip. The high local enhancement of the Raman
   scattering cross section in the vicinity of the tip opens promising
   avenues towards single molecule Raman spectroscopy.}},

   health care decision makers who increasingly require such analyses prior

   Previous health economic models of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

   within specific health care delivery systems using medical information

   Arthritis Cost Consequence Evaluation System (ACCES)-a pharmacoeconomic

   cuniculi and E. hellem) were compared by analysis of DNA amplified from
   a gene region encoding the repeat domain of a polar tube protein (PTP1).
   Sequence data obtained for 11 E. cuniculi isolates from 5 different
   mammalian hosts well support the existence of 3 previously designated
   strains. Strain type III was characterized by a lack of a 78 bp repeat,
   producing an amplicon of reduced size. Strain type II differed from
   strain type I by 3 nucleotide substitutions so that AvaII digestion of
   the corresponding PCR products provided distinct restriction patterns.
   Surprisingly, the comparison of 2 human isolates of E. hellem belonging
   to the same rDNA ITS genotype shows a high level of heterogeneity
   through numerous point mutations and variation in PTP1 repeat number.
   Further characterization of additional E. hellem isolates based on PTP1
   sequence polymorphisms should be of interest for tracing sources of

Abstract = {{Thermionic electron emission from 2000-4000 Angstrom thick films of
   K+(cryptand{[}2.2.2])e(-) and Rb+(cryptand{[}2.2.2])e(-) was studied as
   a function of temperature and time. The total charge collected was
   generally several hundred nanocoulombs with peak currents in the range
   of 5-100 pA. Although electron emission was not a direct result of
   thermal decomposition of the films, the peak current correlated with the
   decomposition rate. At a given temperature, the current increased
   gradually to a peak value and then decreased to near zero. Interrupting
   the process by cooling before complete decay, followed by a return to
   the same temperature, restored the previous current-time behavior. Once
   the current had decayed to near zero, the only way to restore emission
   was to raise the temperature above the previous value. The process of
   growth and decay was then repeated. The origin of emission is unknown,
   but the behavior suggests the presence of surface defect sites at grain
   boundaries that are initially empty. Sample decomposition fills these
   sites, which lie only a few tenths of an electronvolt below the vacuum
   level. Continued decomposition destroys the sites, but new defect sites
   can be produced by raising the temperature, probably by forming
   additional grain boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To understand better the effectiveness of routine treatment
   for emotional and behavioral problems experienced by adolescents,
   methods are needed to control for between-provider differences in the
   distribution of factors that adversely affect treatment success. Such
   methods are necessary to fairly compare providers' outcomes and to aid
   clinicians in identifying adolescents for whom routine care may need to
   be altered. As a preliminary step toward developing a model to adjust
   treatment outcomes to account for predictive factors, findings from
   studies of treated samples of adolescents were reviewed to identify the
   factors that influence the likelihood of treatment success for this
   population. Method: Medline and PSYCInfo databases were searched for
   studies of treated adolescents that reported the association between
   expert-nominated predictive factors and outcomes. Thirty-four studies
   met inclusion criteria. Results: Significant predictors identified in
   these studies include diagnosis, baseline severity of symptoms and
   functional impairment, family dysfunction, and previous treatment.
   Several expert-nominated factors have not been adequately studied in
   treated samples. Conclusions: Much basic work is needed before a
   convincing body of empirical evidence can explain predictive factors for
   adolescent mental health treatment outcomes. Future efforts should
   determine a reduced set of predictive factors that can be measured with
   minimal burden to providers.}},

Abstract = {{Thorium phosphate diphosphate (TPD) has been proposed as a host matrix
   for the long-term storage of tetravalent actinides such as U(IV), Np(IV)
   and Pu(IV), which form solid solutions with TPD. Small amounts of di- or
   trivalent cations can also be immobilized in this matrix. Another method
   of loading of TPD, using the ion-exchange properties of thorium
   phosphate hydrogenphosphate (TPHP), a precursor of TPD, was applied to
   Cs-137(+), Sr-85(2+) and Am-241(3+). The adsorption of these cations on
   TPHP was studied in terms of pH in NaClO4 and NaNO3 media. The
   ion-exchange process on TPHP was found to be reversible for Sr-85(2+)
   and Am-241(3+). Doped TPHP obtained in this way was heated at 1050
   degreesC until TPD was formed. Several leaching tests were performed in
   acidic media on TPD doped with radionuclides with ionic strength equal
   to 0.1 M. The average partial order related to the proton was found to
   be equal to 0.24 +/- 0.10 and the normalized leaching rate constant was
   in the range of 3 x 10(-6) to 2 x 10(-5) g m(-2) d(-1). These results
   are similar to those obtained for thorium plutonium(IV) phosphate
   diphosphate solid solutions. On the basis of the results obtained from
   the adsorption and leaching studies, this adsorption-immobilization
   process, based on the TPHP matrix, can be proposed for the
   decontamination of low level radioactive liquid wastes.}},

Abstract = {{We report on observations of the candidate supernova remnant (SNR)
   G106.3 +2.7 with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory's
   Synthesis Telescope in the continuum at both 408 and 1420 MHz and in the
   21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. The general morphology of the object and
   its spectral index (alpha approximate to 0.57 +/- 0.04, where S-nu
   proportional to nu (-alpha)) confirm it as an SNR. The object consists
   of two distinct components, the head and the tail. The tail component is
   of lower surface brightness and has a marginally steeper spectral index
   than the head component. A deficiency of neutral hydrogen at an LSR
   velocity of about -105 km s(-1) is most likely due to the effect of the
   SNR, suggesting that the SNR is expanding at a velocity of about 15 km
   s(-1), it is at a kinematic distance of 12 kpc, and its largest angular
   extent is of the order of 200 pc. These parameters are shown to be
   consistent with a dynamical model in which the SNR is in a very late
   stage of its isothermal evolution, where the pressure inside the SNR is
   approaching the pressure of the ambient interstellar medium. We also
   describe the H II region Sh 141, which is about 20' north of G106.3 +

Abstract = {{Purpose: Conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans for
   9 patients were compared based on characterization of plan quality and
   effects on the oncology department.
   Methods and Materials: These clinical cases, treated originally with
   conformal radiotherapy (CRT), required extraordinary effort to produce
   conformal treatment plans using nonmodulated, shaped noncoplanar fields
   with multileaf collimators (MLCs). IMRT plans created for comparison
   included rotational treatments with slit collimator, and fixed-field MLC
   treatments using equispaced coplanar, and noncoplanar fields. Plans were
   compared based upon target coverage, target conformality, dose
   homogeneity, monitor units (MU), user-interactive planning time, and
   treatment delivery time. The results were subjected to a statistical
   analysis.
   Results: IMRT increased target coverage an average of 36\% and
   conformality by 10\%. Where dose escalation was a goal, IMRT increased
   mean dose by 4-6 Gy and target coverage by 19\% with the same degree of
   conformality. Rotational IMRT was slightly superior to fixed-field IMRT.
   All IMRT techniques increased integral dose and target dose
   heterogeneity. IMRT planning times were significantly less, whereas MU
   increased significantly; estimated delivery times were similar.
   Conclusion: IMRT techniques increase dose and target coverage while
   continuing to spare organs-at-risk, and can be delivered in a time frame
   comparable to other sophisticated techniques. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Interest in materials made from molecular components, driven by the
   promise of new systems with precisely tailored properties, is
   accelerating at a rapid pace. The last decade has witnessed tremendous
   advances in the sophistication of molecular materials based on
   supramolecular building blocks that can be interchanged at will to
   generate materials with properties and function that can be finely tuned
   in a systematic manner. This is exemplified here by examples that
   illustrate the role of hydrogen bonding in generating low-density
   `porous' frameworks capable of forming lamellar host-guest inclusion
   compounds with tunable inclusion cavities and solid-state architectures,
   topologically related tube-like structures and two-dimensional porous
   molecular monolayers with structures mimicking layered motifs in
   molecular crystals. These systems demonstrate that low-density molecular
   frameworks can be systematically engineered to generate rather
   predictable and robust structures, particularly if they possess an
   intrinsic softness that enables the frameworks to self-optimize the
   non-covalent interactions governing their supramolecular architectures.

Abstract = {{The human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 is a
   multihost pathogen that can infect Arabidopsis. We found that PA14
   pathogenesis in Arabidopsis involves the following steps: attachment to

   disruption of plant cell wall and membrane structures, basipetal
   movement along the vascular parenchyma, and maceration and rotting of
   the petiole and central bud. Distinctive features of P. aeruginosa
   pathogenesis are that the surface of mesophyll. cell walls adopt an
   unusual convoluted or undulated appearance, that PA14 cells orient
   themselves perpendicularly to the outer surface of mesophyll cell walls,
   and that PA14 cells make circular perforations, approximately equal to
   the diameter of P. aeruginosa, in mesophyll cell walls. Taken together,
   our data show that P, aeruginosa strain PA14 is a facultative pathogen
   of Arabidopsis that is capable of causing local and systemic infection,
   which can result in the death of the infected plant.}},

Title = {{Stereotactic radiosurgery for cavernous malformations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{987-991}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Object. The use of stereotactic radiosurgery to treat cerebral cavernous
   malformations (CMs) is controversial. To evaluate the efficacy and
   safety of CM radiosurgery, the authors reviewed the experience at the
   Mayo Clinic during the past 10 years.
   Methods. Seventeen patients underwent radiosurgery for
   high-surgical-risk CMs in the following sites: thalamus/basal ganglia
   (four patients), brainstem (12 patients), and corpus callosum (one
   patient). All patients had experienced at least two documented
   hemorrhages before undergoing radiosurgery. Stereotactic magnetic
   resonance (MR) imaging was used for target localization in all cases.
   The median margin radiation dose was 18 Gy and the median maximum dose
   was 32 Gy. The median length of follow-up review following radiosurgery
   was 51 months.
   The annual hemorrhage rate during the 51 months preceding radiosurgery
   was 40.1\%, compared with 8.8\% in the first 2 years following
   radiosurgery and 2.9\% thereafter. In 10 patients (59\%) new
   neurological deficits developed that were associated with regions of
   increased signal on long-repetition time MR imaging performed a median
   of 8 months (range 5-16 months) after radiosurgery. Three patients
   recovered, giving the group a permanent radiation-related morbidity rate
   of 41\%. Compared with 31 patients harboring arteriovenous malformations
   (AVMs) of sizes and in locations similar to those of the aforementioned
   CMs, who underwent radiosurgery during the same time period, the
   patients with CMs were more likely to experience radiation-related
   complications (any complication, 59\% compared with 10\%; p < 0.001;
   permanent complication, 41\% compared with 10\%; p = 0.02).
   Conclusions. It is impossible to conclude that radiosurgery protects
   patients with CMs against future hemorrhage risk based on the available
   data, although it appears that some reduction in the bleeding rate
   occurs after a latency interval of several years. The risk of
   radiation-related complications after radiosurgery to treat CMs is
   greater than that found after radiosurgery in AVMs, even when adjusting
   for lesion size and location and for radiation dose.}},

Abstract = {{. We analysed vegetation dynamics in Tierra del Fuego steppes using
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data provided by advanced
   very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) on board the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar satellite. Our objective, at
   a regional scale, was to analyse the spatial variability of NDVI
   dynamics in relation to parent material and geographic location,
   representing the fertility and climate gradients respectively; at a
   local scale, it was to analyse the inter-annual variability associated
   with climate and its relation with sheep production indices. The general
   pattern of NDVI dynamics was analysed with Principal Component Analysis.
   We found that the geographic location was more important than landscape
   type in explaining NDVI dynamics despite the fact that the variation in
   landscape type reflects a fertility gradient strongly associated with
   floristic composition and secondary productivity. Discriminant Analysis
   was performed to identify the variables that better distinguish
   geographic units. The Northern region (with the lowest precipitation and
   the highest temperatures) had lower NDVI values over the year. In the
   Central region, NDVI reached the highest value of the season, surpassing
   both other regions. The Southern region (the coldest and moistest) had
   its growth pattern displaced towards the summer. For the Central region
   we analysed 10 years of monthly NDVI data with PCA. We found that
   precipitation from August to December and winter temperature are the
   most important determinants of overall NDVI values. Lamb production was
   correlated with spring and early summer NDVI values. Sheep mortality is
   affected by low NDVI values in late summer and high annual amplitude.
   Satellite information allowed us to characterize the vegetation dynamics
   of three ecological areas across the Fuegian steppe.}},

Abstract = {{Although the natural interleukin-l receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) has been

   nothing was known about the ability of these cells in primary culture to

   confirmed that mixed glial cell cultures from newborn rats respond to
   the cytokine inducer, lipopolysaccharide, by synthesizing IL-1Ra mRNA,
   Using double immunostaining,we showed that IL-1Ra was detected in
   microglia but not in astrocytes. Using Western blotting, me finally
   demonstrated that the IL-1Ra1 isoform nas secreted in the supernatant of
   mixed glial cell cultures, and its production increased in response to
   lipopolysaccharide, The three different IL-1Ra isoforms were
   constitutively expressed in cell lysates and their levels increased

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted during winter (rabi) season of 1996-97
   and 1997-98 to study the effect of herbicides (fluchloralin,
   oxyfluorfen, pendimethalin and alachlor) alone and In combination with
   hand-weeding (45 days after transplanting) on woods and onion (Allium
   cepa L.). Season-long crop-weed competition reduced the bulb yield by
   81.2\% compared to weed-free condition. All the weed-control treatments
   significantly reduced the population and dry weight of woods and In turn
   Increased the bulb yield significantly except oxyfluorfen 0.15 kg/ha
   compared to weedy check. Alachlor 2.0 kg/ha + hand-weeding 45 days after
   transplanting being at par with pendimethalin 1.5 kg/ha + hand-weeding
   at 45 days and weed-free proved to be the superior Integrated
   weed-control approach to control weeds and Increased the plant height,
   bulb diameter, bulb weight, weed-control efficiency. These treatments
   also registered higher additional net returns. But highest additional
   returns/rupee Invested were, obtained with alachlor 2.0 kg/ha.}},

Abstract = {{Prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension were
   assessed in 1032 (90\%) of 1147 elderly (greater than or equal to 65
   years) inhabitants of three Italian villages. Blood pressure (BP) was
   measured at home on two separate occasions following a standardised
   protocol. Persons taking antihypertensive drugs or with BP values
   greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg were considered as affected by
   hypertension. Prevalence of hypertension was 64.8\%, with higher rates
   in women than men, and in those aged 75-84 than in those aged 65-74,
   Diabetes, strokes and hypercholesterolaemia were more frequent in
   hypertensive than normotensive people, whereas cardiac diseases,
   overweight and smoking did not differ significantly between hypertensive
   and normotensive people. Of the 669 hypertensive patients, 439 (65.6\%)
   were aware of their hypertension, 398 (59.5\%) were being treated, and
   70 (10.5\%) had their hypertension con-trolled. Of the 230 unaware
   patients, 201 (87.4\%) had had their BP measured in the previous year.
   Of these, 174 (86.6\%) had stage 1 hypertension, while 27 had stage 2
   hypertension with SEP values <170 mm Hg, Overall, the patients with
   stage 1 hypertension accounted for 68.3\% of the untreated and 50.5\% of
   the treated patients. The use of a single drug was more frequent in
   patients with controlled (97.1\%) or stage 1 (97.0\%) than with stages
   2-3 (18.9\%) hypertension, The drugs prescribed most were
   angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (45\%), followed by
   diuretics (43\%), As our findings suggest that BP values can be
   effectively reduced by treating or increasing drug treatment in stage 1
   hypertensive patients, data on safety and effectiveness of this policy
   are urgently needed.}},

Abstract = {{The sexual behaviour of a diurnally active cricket in the genus Nisitrus
   is described from observations made in its natural habitat. Courtship
   consists of both auditory and visual elements. The male transfers up to
   five spermatophores to an individual female during a single reproductive
   sequence lasting more than 3 h. Males guard females during the intervals
   between successive production of spermatophores. The visual signal-one
   or more hind-leg waves-given by the male to indicate to the female that
   she can eat the old spermatophore, and that a new one is now ready,
   appears to be unique among gryllids studied so far. Females are very
   co-operative, as they stand to receive and then eat as many as five
   spermatophores in relatively quick succession. Inter-male rivalry does
   not occur in the absence of females, but possible `spoiling' behaviour
   may occasionally interrupt mating sequences.}},

Abstract = {{The continual threat of chemical and biological warfare has prompted the
   need for unambiguous analytical methods for the confirmation of agent
   exposure. In this paper, we have investigated the use of matrix-assisted
   laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (MALDI-ToF/MS) as a diagnostic tool for this purpose. Mass spectral
   studies of the interaction of sulfur mustard (bis-(2-chloroethyl)
   sulfide, HD) with hemoglobin and metallothioneine were conducted. In
   vitro experiments with purified proteins were performed, using both HD
   and chloroethylethyl sulfide (CEES), in an effort to determine the
   extent of alkylation and occurrence of HD cross-linking using the
   MALDI-ToF/MS technique.
   In a typical experiment, 50 ml of 5 mM HD in acetonitrile was added to
   an equal volume of 0.5 mM hemoglobin in deionized water followed by
   vortexing and incubation at room temperature. After 24 h, the samples
   were analyzed by MALDI-ToF/MS. Mass spectral results indicated the
   presence of at least two distinct alkylation adducts for both HD and
   GEES experiments. These results demonstrate that MALDI-ToF/MS is a
   useful analytical technique to investigate the interaction of HD with
   biomolecules and may be employed potentially as a diagnostic tool for
   the confirmation of exposure to chemical warfare agents. Published in

Title = {{Neopterin: A prognostic variable in operations for lung cancer}},

Abstract = {{Background. We studied the prognostic value of preoperatively measured
   neopterin to predict survival of lung cancer patients. Neopterin is
   produced and secreted by interferon-gamma -stimulated monocytic cells.
   High urinary neopterin concentrations are found in patients with viral
   infections, allograft rejection episodes, and some malignant diseases.
   In various tumor types high urinary neopterin concentrations are
   associated with a worse prognosis.
   Methods. Preoperative neopterin levels of 110 patients (29 women, 81
   men) with lung cancer including 7 patients with small cell lung cancer
   were measured and related to the time of survival after operation.
   Patients with clinically suspected stage IIIB lung cancer were not
   operated and therefore not enrolled in this study. Infectious diseases
   were not apparent at the time of preoperative urine sampling. Median
   postoperative follow-up period was 17.4 months.
   Results. In a univariate analysis, patients with a preoperative
   neopterin concentration of more than 212 mu mol/mol creatinine (4th
   quartile) were determined to have a significantly lower survival
   probability. In a multivariate analysis, a neopterin concentration of
   more than 212 mu mol/mol creatinine (p < 0.01) and T-stage status (p <
   0.005) were determined to be significantly predictive variables for
   worse survival prognosis.
   Conclusions. Preoperative neopterin proved to be a reliable prognostic
   factor for survival. Immunology may provide an accurate assessment of
   tumor aggression and its clinical behavior. In this sense, neopterin can
   serve as an immunologically based estimation of malignant outgrowth. In
   patients who are operable by clinical tumor stage but have a high risk
   for operation, elevated preoperative neopterin may help in the decision
   for a nonoperative treatment. (Ann Thorac Surg 2000;70:1861-4) (C) 2000

Abstract = {{During the 1990s public service industrial relations in South Australia
   have followed the state's long-standing practice of being moderate and

   privatisation that had commenced under the Bannon Labor government were
   continued and extended under the new Liberal government, in part as a
   response to financial pressures arising fi om the State Bank collapse
   and in part as a reflection of the same trends that were widespread
   elsewhere. Where possible the government avoided direct confrontation
   with unions. There were various contests where the parties explored
   options in the changing environment, but the most prominent trend,was
   that government policies of financial restraint and outsourcing tended
   to reduce most unions' bargaining power. Those policies were initially
   conjoined with agency-specific enterprise bargaining, but the resulting
   variations in outcomes finally led to a Wages Parity Agreement to
   restore consistency.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{123}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Experiments were aimed to test the crossreactivity of immune
   Th1 cells that mediate contact hypersensitivity (CHS) or inflammatory
   bowel disease (IBD) to TNP in the mouse. Methods: CBA/J mice were
   immunized either epicutaneously or intrarectally with TNP and after
   appropriate time intervals were challenged with antigen in a crossed
   manner. The CHS reaction was measured by the ear swelling test. IBD was
   quantified by increase of colon weight and myeloperoxidase level. Both
   reactions were confirmed histologically. In passive-transfer
   experiments, mesenteric lymph node cells of animals sensitized
   intrarectally and peripheral lymph node and spleen cells of mice
   immunized epicutaneously were used. In some experiments, before being
   immunized mice were made either unresponsive to the TNP hapten by
   induction of suppressor T cells, or resistant to suppression after
   induction of upregulatory T cells. Results: Irrespective of the mode of
   sensitization upon appropriate challenge with antigen all mice developed
   a good CHS reaction as well as significant IBD. This cross-reactivity
   could be passively transferred by immune cells. In mice in which
   antigen-specific down- or upregulatory cells were induced before
   sensitization both CHS and IBD to TNP were modulated accordingly.
   Conclusion: TNP hapten deposited on skin or on mucosal surfaces induces
   effector cells that recognize antigen independent of its tissue
   localization, and produce a local inflammatory reaction. TNP-specific
   up- and downregulatory cells, shown before to regulate the CHS reaction,
   similarly modulate the generation and development of hapten-induced IBD,

Abstract = {{Background: Accurate diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis is difficult on
   the basis of clinical examination only because the signs and symptoms of
   sinusitis are nonspecific. A simple, rapid, and readily available method
   for diagnosing maxillary sinusitis in primary care would increase the
   accuracy of the diagnoses and thus reduce unnecessary antibiotic
   treatment.
   Objective: To investigate the validity of ultrasonography compared with
   radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detection of
   maxillary sinusitis.
   Design: Ultrasonography and plain-film radiography of the paranasal
   sinuses were performed on all patients and MRI was performed on 40
   randomly selected patients on day 7 of the study.
   Setting: Study office at the Department of Pediatrics of Turku
   University Hospital, Turku, Finland.
   Patients: One hundred ninety-seven young adults who contacted the study
   office within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms of the common cold.
   Main Outcome Measures: Detection rates of maxillary sinusitis by
   ultrasonography, radiography, and MRI.
   Results: Acute maxillary sinusitis was diagnosed in 24\% of the sinuses
   by radiography and in 28\% by MRI. Compared with MRI findings, the
   sensitivity of ultrasonography for detection of maxillary sinusitis was
   64\% (specificity, 95\%). Using a 2-step diagnostic approach in which
   radiological findings were additionally considered in cases of negative
   ultrasound findings, a sensitivity of 86\% (specificity, 95\%) was
   observed.
   Conclusions: The high specificity of ultrasonography indicates that a
   positive ultrasound finding can be regarded as evidence of maxillary
   sinusitis. The addition of plain-film radiography in cases of negative
   ultrasound findings increases the diagnostic sensitivity to clinically
   acceptable levels without loss in specificity. Active use of
   ultrasonography would substantially decrease the need for radiological
   imaging of the sinuses and also help reduce unnecessary antibiotic
   treatment in primary care.}},

Abstract = {{The systematic treatment of Orobanche cumana Wallr. and O. cernua L. is
   controversial. Whereas some authors consider O. cumana as an
   infraspecific taxon of O. cernua, others Ir eat it a?: a separate
   species. Furthermore, the nomenclature of the sunflower broomrape is
   unclear, and Loth names are found without qualification in the
   literature. The objective of the present study has been to evaluate the
   distribution, morphology, and ecology of O. cernua and O. cumana in the
   Iberian Peninsula, as well as their seed oil fatty acid profile, which
   is a trait of gear chemotaxonomic value. O. cernua was found
   parasitizing wild Compositae, mainly Artemisia spp., whereas O. cumana
   was exclusively found on cultivated sunflower. Both species clearly
   differ in morphological traits, especially plant height and build,
   length and structure of the inflorescence, corolla length and colour.
   Both species are characterized by contrasting seed oil fatty acid
   profits, with high oleic acid concentration in O. cernua and high
   linoleic acid concentration in O. cumana. The evaluation of both taxa in
   the Iberian Peninsula gives additional support to those authors that
   treat them as separate species. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{To define the role of somatostatin and dopamine in TSH suppression
   induced by L-thyroxine, 16 children (12 F, 4 M) on suppressive doses of

   conventional TRH test was performed in all subjects, in order to
   evaluate TSH, PRL and GH (basal study). A week later a second TRH test
   was carried out; one hour before the test, however, group A (9 patients)
   was given 60 mg pyridostigmine bromide po (pyridostigmine study) and
   group B (7 patients)10 mg metoclopramide po (metoclopramide study). In
   the basal study, TSH was suppressed in both groups and levels did not
   increase following TRH administration, while PRL increased significantly
   and GH levels remained stable. In the pyridostigmine study, TSH levels
   did not increase following TRH administration, while PRL and GH levels
   were both significantly raised. In the metoclopramide study, TSH and GH
   levels were not raised following TRH administration, while a
   significantly greater increase of PRL was observed. In conclusion,
   suppressive doses of L-thyroxine inhibit the TSH response to TRH, while
   they do not seem to affect GH and PRL secretion. Somatostatin and/or
   dopamine do not seem to play a significant role in the
   L-thyroxine-induced ISH suppression. (C) 2000, Editrice Kurtis.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of a driving static shear stress on the liquefaction
   resistance of medium dense granular soils is investigated. A laboratory
   study of the behavior of five sands (percentage of silt varying between
   2 and 42\%, and D-50 varying between 0.55 and 0.09 mm) was undertaken.
   These five sands were sampled from the foundations of two dams in Quebec
   (Canada). Sixty cyclic direct simple shear (DSS) tests were performed
   with and without a driving static shear stress. Relative densities D-r
   varied between 60 and 70\%, and static shear stress ratios alpha = tau
   (st)/sigma (vc)' varied between 0.2 and 0.6. The presence of static
   shear stress increased the cyclic strength of these soils. A relation
   between alpha and K(alpha) factor giving the effect of preshearing on

Abstract = {{The survivability of Nosema locustae (Canning) spores, a microsporidian
   pathogen of locusts and grasshoppers was verified when stored at

   The survivability of spores stored in water was 15.1\% under sunlight,
   27.6\% at 40 degreesC under the shade and 33.8\% inside at room
   temperature after 12 days. whereas at 25,10 and - 10 degreesC, it was
   80.5, 97.0 and 99.4\%, respectively. In the field during monsoon, the
   survivability of spores sprayed on the plants was 90\% after 60 h at
   temperature between 25 and 31.1 degreesC and relative humidity ranging
   from 70 to 95\%, while in summer, it was 56.4\% at temperature between
   42.6 and 43.8 degreesC and relative humidity from 18 to 21\%. The

   selected in order to maintain a good representation of dough properties.
   The correlations between the endosperm structure and the theological
   quality were examined using variance analysis with one and two factors.
   The difference between the hardness index of hard and soft varieties was
   strongly significant (P <0.001). Hard wheat varieties had significantly

Abstract = {{On-line shopping is expected to experience exponential growth in the
   coming decades, but few researchers have examined consumers' motivations
   for using on-line channels. The current study investigates the
   determinants of consumer use of on-line channels to purchase financial
   products. There are three key findings. First, consumers who experience
   conflict with their Financial agents are more likely to use the on-line
   channel. This suggests that conflicting relationships can make the two
   channels competitive rather than complementary. Second, consumer
   willingness is an important predictor of on-line information search.
   Third, consumers who use the on-line channel for information search are
   more likely to use it for transactions. The last two findings indicate
   that consumer adoption of the on-line channel is a stagewise process.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 568 new simple sequence repeat (SSR)-based markers for barley
   have been developed from a combination of database sequences and small
   insert genomic libraries enriched for a range of short simple sequence
   repeats. Analysis of the SSRs on 16 barley cultivars revealed variable
   levels of informativeness but no obvious correlation was found with SSR
   repeat length, motif type, or map position. Of the 568 SSRs developed,
   242 were genetically mapped, 216 with 37 previously published SSRs in a
   single doubled-haploid population derived from the Fl of an
   interspecific cross between the cultivar Lina and Hordeum spontaneum
   Canada Park and 26 SSRs in two other mapping populations. A total of 27
   SSRs amplified multiple loci. Centromeric clustering of markers was
   observed in the main mapping population; however, the clustering
   severity was reduced in intraspecific crosses, supporting the notion
   that the observed marker distribution was largely a genetical effect.
   The mapped SSRs provide a framework for rapidly assigning chromosomal
   designations and polarity in future mapping programs in barley and a
   convenient alternative to RFLP for aligning information derived from
   different populations. A list of the 242 primer pairs that amplify
   mapped SSRs from total barley genomic DNA is presented.}},

   8,9-dihydroacenaphtho {[}1,2-b] benzo {[}d] thiophene (1) and
   7-methoxynaphtho {[}1,2-b] thiophene (12), respectively. Compound I was
   converted to the cis-diol (il) (via treatment with OsO4/pyridine);or to
   trans-diol (3) {[}via Prevost reaction (PhCOOAg/I-2) followed by
   hydrolysis] in 95-98\% yield, respectively. Subsequent dehydration
   (PTS/benzene) of the diol followed by aromatization of the resulting
   ketone (5) produced the phenolic compound 6 in 97\% yield. Oxidation of
   the phenol with phenyl iododiacetate followed by hydrolysis of the
   o-quinone monoketal 7 gave the o-quinone (8) in 86\% yield.
   Stereoselective reduction of 8 with NaBH4/EtOH under oxygen afforded
   trans-10,11-dihydroxy-10, 11-dihydroacenaphtho {[}1,2-b] benzo
   {[}d]thiophene(9) (orange yellow solid) in 55\% yield. Compound 16 was

   the o-quinone 15 (with NaBH4), which in turn was prepared from 12
   following the protocol of functional group transformation of methoxy -->
   phenol --> o-quinone monoketal --> o-quinone, as used in the previous
   case. The yields for all the steps are very good. The mutagenicity assay
   of compound 9 and 16 as well as their parent thiaarenes have been
   performed. The results showed that 9 may not be the proximate carcinogen

   Nd:YAG laser to weld sheet materials of V-Cr-Ti alloys and to
   characterize the microstructural and mechanical properties of the
   resulting joints. Deep penetration, defect-free, and oxygen
   contamination free welds were achieved under an optimum combination of
   laser parameters including focal length of lens, pulse energy, pulse
   repetition rate, beam travel speed, and an innovative shielding gas
   arrangement. The key for defect-free welds was found to be the
   stabilization of the keyhole and providing an escape path for the gas
   trapped in the molten weld pool. Oxygen and nitrogen uptakes were
   reduced to levels only a few ppm higher than the starting material by
   design and development of an environmental control box (ECB).
   Laser-applied post-weld heat treatments showed that five-passes of a
   diffuse laser beam over the welded region softened the weld material,
   especially in the root region. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   different analytic strategies based on Magnusson's (1985) ``person{''}
   approach to studying developmental phenomena. In the first study
   correspondence analysis was employed not only to visualize connections
   between persons and the measures used to describe them, but also to
   identify the underlying dimensions that organize a common map of persons
   and measures. In the second study configural frequency analysis was
   employed to identify groups (within the overall sample) that were
   special (statistically speaking) by containing either more or fewer
   members than expected. Findings of the two studies are discussed by
   highlighting differences between the ``variable approach{''} and the
   ``person approach{''} and by pointing to the important role of

Abstract = {{Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to stems of Scots
   pine (Pinus sylvestris L,) in a provenance field trial during frost
   hardening to find an EIS parameter for assessing frost hardiness (FH)
   without a controlled freezing test. The FH of stems and needles assessed
   by controlled freezing tests was compared with the equivalent circuit
   EIS parameters of a distributed model of stems (not exposed to
   controlled freezing treatment) and with dry matter (DM) content of
   stems. Significant differences in the equivalent circuit parameters, FH
   and DM content were found between provenances, The relaxation time (tau
   (1)), describing the peak of the high frequency are of the impedance
   spectrum, and the intracellular resistance (r(i)) of stems increased
   with increasing FH, According to the linear regression, the coefficient
   of determination (R-2) between the FH of stems and needles with tau (1)
   of the stem was 0.87 and 0.89, and with r(i) of the stem 0.74 and 0.85,
   respectively, The relation between FH and tau (1) changed with the
   degree of hardiness, The highest coefficient of determination was 0.95
   in September when the FH of needles, ranging from -10 degreesC to -25
   degreesC, was predicted with an accuracy of +/- 2.0 degreesC, The
   resistance parameter r(2), describing the width of the low frequency are
   of the impedance spectrum, decreased prior to and during the initial
   hardening: significant differences were found between provenances, This
   indicates that r(2) was not related to frost hardening per se. It is
   concluded that it is possible to distinguish the hardening patterns of
   different provenances by tau (1) in the rapid phase of hardening without
   controlled freezing tests.}},

Abstract = {{The tobacco cyst nematode (Globodera tabacum solanacearum) continues to
   pose a serious threat to flue-cured tobacco production in Virginia and
   nearby states. Soils were sampled from five uninfested and two infested
   flue-cured tobacco-producing locations. Twenty-three edaphic factors
   were characterized to determine if any were correlated with G. t.
   solanacearum reproduction. Comparisons were also made between
   pasteurized and natural soils to determine if biological suppression of
   G. t. solanacearum reproduction might be occurring in currently
   uninfested areas. Differences in G. t. solanacearum reproduction were
   noted among the soils, but results were inconsistent across the three
   trials conducted in this study. Only soil pH correlated significantly
   with nematode reproduction, and then only in one of three trials.
   Globodera tabacum solanacearum reproduced with similar efficiency in
   natural and pasteurized soils.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and efficacy of two interventions
   for improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy regimens in
   HIV-infected subjects compared with a control intervention.
   DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, pilot study.
   SETTING: Department of Veterans Affairs HIV clinic and community-based
   HIV clinical trials site.
   PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five HIV-infected subjects on stable antiretroviral
   therapy regimens. Subjects were predominantly male (89\%) and African
   American (69\%), and had histories of heroin or cocaine use (80\%).
   INTERVENTIONS: Four weekly sessions of either nondirective inquiries
   about adherence (control group, C], cue-dose training, which consisted
   of the use of personalized cues for remembering particular dose times,
   and feedback about medication taking using Medication Event Monitoring
   System (MEMS) pill bottle caps, which record time of bottle opening (CI)
   group), or cue-dose training combined with cash reinforcement for
   correctly timed bottle opening (CD+CR).
   MEASUREMENTS: Opening of the pill bottle within 2 hours before or after
   a predetermined time was measured by MEMS.
   RESULTS: Adherence to the medication as documented by MEMS was
   significantly enhanced during the 4-week training period in the CD+CR
   group, but not in the CD group, compared with the control group.
   Improvement was also seen in adherence to antiretroviral drugs that were
   not the object of training and reinforcement. Eight weeks after training
   and reinforcement were discontinued, adherence in the cash-reinforced
   group returned to near-baseline levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cue-dose training with cash reinforcement led to transient
   improvement in adherence to antiretroviral therapy in a population
   including mostly African Americans and subjects with histories of drug
   abuse. However, we were not able to detect any sustained improvement
   beyond the active training period, and questions concerning the timing
   and duration of such an intervention require further study. Randomized,
   controlled clinical studies with objective measures of adherence can be
   conducted in HIV-infected subjects and should be employed for further
   evaluation of this and other adherence interventions.}},

Abstract = {{P-selectin is an adhesion molecule found in the alpha granules of
   platelets, Activation occurs in response to a range of inflammatory and
   thrombotic agents resulting in rapid up-regulation. Flow cytometry
   methods have recently been described for the analysis of platelet
   P-selectin expression in whole blood. While introducing these methods
   into our laboratory it was noted that expression could be stimulated, in
   vitro, in a number of ways. This study shows that red cell lysis, the
   anticoagulant K-3 EDTA and the time elapse between blood collection and
   antibody labelling had statistically significant effects on P-selectin
   expression, Post-labelling fixation, with CellFIX, caused no significant
   effect. We conclude that blood for P-selectin analysis should be
   collected in sodium citrate and that red cell lysis and centrifugation
   should be avoided. When comparing samples, the time between collection
   and labelling should be standardized. The relatively high CV for the
   assay indicates that all samples should be labelled and analysed in
   duplicate with the mean level reported.}},

Abstract = {{We have evaluated rat LH receptor self-association and lateral dynamics
   for functional and nonfunctional receptors after binding of hormone. We
   demonstrate, for the first time, that grouped receptors observed in
   electron or light microscopy represent actual receptor dimers or
   oligomers rather than simply the concentration of receptors within
   membrane microdomains. Fringe fluorescence photobleaching recovery
   methods showed that, after binding of either LH or human CG (hCG),
   functional wild-type LH receptors, expressed on 293 cells (LHR-wt
   cells), have mobilities that are 25\% lower than those of nonfunctional
   LH receptors containing an arginine substitution for lysine at position
   583 (LHR-K583R cells). Because lateral diffusion coefficients in two
   dimensions depend only on the logarithm of the molecular size of the
   diffusing species, this result implies that functional receptors exist
   in substantially larger membrane complexes than do nonfunctional
   receptors. In single-cell measurements of fluorescence energy transfer
   after hormone binding, functional LH receptors were also characterized
   by receptor self-aggregation, Values for fluorescence resonant energy
   transfer efficiency were 13 +/- 2\% and 17 +/- 3\% between
   fluorophore-conjugated LH or hCG, respectively bound to receptors on
   LHR-wt cells. However, there was little or no energy transfer between
   receptors on LHR-K583R cells. These results suggest that receptor
   functionality invalues receptor-receptor interactions and that the
   extent of such receptor self-association depends on whether LH or hCG
   binds the receptor.}},

   (AA) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-induced mouse ear
   oedema, respectively. Phycocyanin (50-200 mg/kg p.o.) inhibited in a
   dose-dependent manner PGE2 levels in mouse ear treated with AA. Also,
   phycocyanin (100-400 mg/kg p.o.) moderately reduced PLA(2) activity in
   TPA-induced mouse ear inflammation test. In this model triamcinolone (10
   mg/kg p.o.) used as reference drug exerted a remarkable inhibitory
   effect on PLA(2) activity. These results provide the first evidence that
   the anti-inflammatory effects of phycocyanin may result, at least
   partially, from inhibition of PGE(2) production and a moderate
   inhibition of PLA(2) activity.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study investigated associations between exposure to
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and the incidence of lung,
   bladder, kidney, and pancreatic cancer among Norwegian aluminum plant
   workers.
   Methods Cancer incidence was investigated from 1953 to 1996 among 11 103
   men employed for more than 3 years in the industry, giving 272 554
   person-years during follow-up. A job exposure matrix was constructed to
   estimate exposure to particulate PAH and fluorides. The observed cases
   of cancer were compared with expected figures calculated from national
   rates. Dose-response relations were investigated by internal comparisons
   using Poisson regression and stratified analyses for standardized
   incidence ratio. Potential confounding by smoking was investigated in
   subanalyses restricted to 3 of the plants.
   Results The study showed an overall excess for bladder cancer,
   standardized incidence ratio 1.3 (95\% confidence interval 1.1-1.5),
   which increased with increasing cumulative exposure to PAH and reached a
   relative risk of about 2 for the upper exposure category in the analysis
   with 30 years of lag time. There was no association between cumulative
   PAH exposure and lung cancer, but there were indications of an elevated
   risk of kidney cancer among the most heavily PAM-exposed persons in the
   analyses with a lag time of 30 years. For pancreatic cancer we found a
   higher incidence among the PAM-exposed persons than among the unexposed
   ones, but no clear dose-response association was found.
   Conclusions The study showed an association between bladder cancer and
   exposure to PAH, but gave no support to an association between PAH
   exposure and lung cancer in the primary aluminum industry.}},

   adults were statistically significant, for example, pelvic

   adults. Nevertheless, a number of questions about the development of the
   ovarian dysfunction remain to be answered, For example, we are unable to

Abstract = {{Burrow systems of the fossorial rodent Ctenomys mendocinus Philippi,
   1869 were studied in the Andean Precordillera. These burrows were
   linear, with laterals and branches forked off the main tunnel. Their
   size and architecture did not differ between sexes. Burrows showed a
   constant heading along the main tunnel, with a mean directional angle
   close to 0 degrees. Most forks of the main tunnel were originated more
   than expected at plants, indicating a change of search pattern where
   plants were encountered. This behaviour suggests a tactic consistent
   with area-restricted search. These systems were compared with others of
   the same species located in a habitat with higher cover and structural
   complexity of vegetation, at the Mendoza Piedmont. Female burrows were
   larger and male burrows more bifurcated in the Precordillera. These
   burrows were more complex than those from the Piedmont, owing to the
   presence of secondary tunnels. The mean directional angle close to 0
   degrees, orthogonal branches and angles of ascent of laterals close to
   40 degrees were attributes shared by the systems of both habitats. C.
   mendocinus maintains a basic search pattern as an optimal forager, and
   increases the systems size and complexity probably as an adaptive
   strategy to optimize the foraging efficiency and minimize the predation
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns forming spontaneously in extended, three-dimensional,
   dissipative systems are likely to excite several homogeneous soft modes
   (approximate to hydrodynamic modes) of the underlying physical system,
   much more than quasi-one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) patterns are.
   The reason is the lack of damping boundaries. This paper compares two
   analytic techniques to derive the pattern dynamics from hydrodynamics,
   which are usually equivalent but lead to different results when applied
   to multiple homogeneous soft modes. Dielectric electroconvection in
   nematic liquid crystals is introduced as a model for 3D pattern
   formation. The 3D pattern dynamics including soft modes are derived. For
   slabs of large but finite thickness the description is reduced further
   to a 2D one. It is argued that the range of validity of 2D descriptions
   is limited to a very small region above threshold. The transition from
   2D to 3D pattern dynamics is discussed. Experimentally testable
   predictions for the stable range of ideal patterns and the electric
   Nusselt numbers are made. For most results analytic approximations in
   terms of material parameters are given. {[}S1063-651X(00)09512-X].}},

Abstract = {{The prognosis of locally advanced or recurrent carcinomas of the penis
   (PE) and of the anal canal (AC) after conventional treatment is dismal.
   We report 16 patients (eight with AC carcinomas and eight with PE
   cancers) treated by intra-arterial (IA) chemotherapy. Fifteen of them
   were treated for locally advanced or recurrent disease and one in an
   adjuvant setting. The chemotherapy was administered via a femoral IA
   catheter with its tip located above the aortic bifurcation, under the
   inferior mesenteric artery. It consisted of eight push injections, given
   over a 48-h period, of the following drug combination: cisplatin 8.5 mg
   m(-2), 5-FU 275 mg m(-2), methotrexate 27.5 mg m-2, mitomycin C 1.2 mg
   m(-2), and bleomycin 4 mg m(-2). Leucovorin was given pc, 4 x 15 mg
   day(-1), during the chemotherapy and for 3 days thereafter. A total of
   52 cycles of treatment were administered. Of the 15 patients evaluable
   for response, six obtained a CR (three PE, three AC) and eight a PR.
   Among the complete responders, four are alive and disease-free 2-15
   years after treatment. The other patients enjoyed an objective response
   lasting 3-25 months (median 7 months). Four patients developed grade
   III/IV haematological toxicity with three episodes of febrile
   neutropenia, one of them with a fatal outcome due to patient's failure
   to obtain medical attention at the onset of his fever, one a grade III
   mucositis of the glans, and four a grade III/IV cutaneous toxicity, the
   latter caused by the IA administration of bleomycin. In conclusion, IA
   chemotherapy is effective and potentially curative in locoregionally
   advanced or recurrent carcinomas of the penis and of the anus. Its
   contribution in the primary management of advanced penile or anal
   carcinoma should be prospectively investigated. (C) 2000 Cancer Research

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of reduced responsiveness of the skeletal muscle arterial
   vasculature to sympathetic activation during exercise (sympatholysis)
   remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to examine the
   vascular effects of sympathoactivation in dynamically exercising
   skeletal muscle. Mongrel dogs (19-24 kg) were instrumented chronically
   with transit-time ultrasonic flow probes on the external iliac arteries.
   After pretreatment with atropine (0.2 mg/kg), an intravenous bolus (4
   mug/kg) of a nicotinic ganglion stimulant
   {[}1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP)] was given at rest
   and during treadmill exercise at graded intensities. Administration of
   DMPP was associated with prompt reductions in iliac blood flow and
   increases in arterial pressure under all conditions. There were
   significant reductions (P < 0.05) in iliac vascular conductance of 58
   +/- 4 (SE), 48 +/- 3, 36 +/- 5, and 16 +/- 3\% at rest, 3 miles/h and
   0\% grade, 6 miles/h and 0\% grade, and 6 miles/h and 15\% grade,
   respectively. These data demonstrate that activation of postganglionic
   sympathetic nerves with DMPP caused vasoconstriction in the skeletal
   muscle vasculature at rest and during exercise. Additionally, the
   magnitude of vasoconstriction was inversely related to exercise
   intensity. These results support the concept of exercise sympatholysis.}},

Abstract = {{The sequencing of the human genome was only made possible by the
   massively parallel use of automated high-throughput technologies. These
   technologies have required the development and interfacing of new
   hardware and software in a wa which would have been hardly conceivable
   only ten years ago. As a consequence, an unbroken trend to more
   `industrialized science' is apparent. The wealth of information
   generated by intensive sequencing efforts is now being further exploited
   by using complex tools to comprehensively analyze complex systems at the
   DNA, RNA and protein level. A landmark innovation was the introduction
   of the biochip principle, best exemplified with the development of the
   DNA chip, mainly used for RNA expression profiling. The chip principle,
   together with miniaturization, has now become the dominating theme for a
   number of new genomics and proteomics technologies, culminating in the
   lab-on-a-chip concept which, in the next five to ten years, could
   advance at a comparable rate to that of computers over the last 50
   years. Some of the new technologies are already used for comprehensive
   analysis of clinical samples in a attempt to describe disease and
   disease risk at the molecular level. However, all of these technologies
   are far from routine in clinical use and it is also too early to decide
   whether molecular fingerprints or signature profiles will have the
   diagnostic and prognostic power currently predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Between April 1994 and April 1998, triceps to biceps transfers were done
   for three men with posttraumatic lesions of the brachial plexus and

   accidents was 33 years (range 19-41) and at the time of muscle transfer
   40 years (28-46), with a mean observation period of 21 months (12-31).
   The transfer resulted in active elbow flexion in all patients with a
   mean of 113 degrees (90 degrees -130 degrees) and a degree of strength
   4-5 (contraction against resistance) with no remaining deficit of
   passive extension. Two patients were satisfied with the result of the
   operation and the other was content. No complications were noted. The
   transfer of the triceps muscle to the tendon of the biceps muscle on
   loss of elbow flexion resulted in adequate movement and degree of
   strength. The triceps to biceps transfer involves operating close to the
   elbow joint and minimal complications, is cosmetically satisfactory, and
   is particularly suitable for co-contraction of triceps and biceps.}},

Abstract = {{Despite tho established anatomical relationship between the periodontal
   and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and
   periodontium is still under discussion. The objective of this study was
   an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and
   periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16S rRNA gene
   directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 31 intact teeth with both pulp
   and marginal infections were investigated. The diagnosis tvas based on
   clinical and radiological examination. Samples were taken from the
   gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper
   points before trepanation of the teeth. After trepanation sterile paper
   points and Hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root
   canal. Specific PCR methods were used to detect the presence of the
   following pathogens: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroidex
   forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas
   gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Treponema denticola. In addition,
   quantitative competitive PCR was used to determine the total bacterial
   count of the samples. The investigated pathogens were proven to be
   present in the endodontium in all disease categories. Particularly in
   endodontic samples of ``chronic apical periodontitis{''} and ``chronic
   adult periodontitis{''} profiles of the periodontal pathogens were
   found. The results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany
   endodontic infections and supported the idea that the
   periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as
   critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of
   endodontic or periodontal diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Background: As women receiving hemodialysis are evaluated frequently by
   the nephrologist, we hypothesized that women's health issues are better
   addressed in the dialysis patient than in the general population.
   Patients and methods: We surveyed the female patients in our dialysis
   population. 97\% of the women approached agreed to participate. We found
   that 55.4\% of our cohort had received routine gynecologic care. 50\% of
   the women had undergone a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear in the last year. Of
   the women aged 40 - 50, 55\% had undergone a mammogram in the last 2
   years. In women over age 50, 71\% received an annual mammogram. Results:
   We found that 57\% of the women were amenorrheic before starting renal
   replacement therapy while 16\% had become amenorrheic after dialysis was
   started. 27\% were still menstruating at the time of the survey. Only
   4\% of the amenorrheic women interviewed were currently on hormone
   replacement therapy (HRT) as compared with 20\% of women in our general
   medical clinics. While 67\% stated that they would take hormone
   replacement if offered, 89\% had never been offered HRT. Variables that
   positively correlated with willingness to take HRT were a history of a
   hysterectomy and more skilled work history. Although nephrologists
   surveyed at our academic facility agreed that amenorrheic women with
   renal disease benefited from HRT, many believed that it is not the role
   of the nephrologist to prescribe it. Conclusion: Despite frequent
   contacts with medical providers, women's health issues for patients on
   dialysis may not receive the same attention as women in the general
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Smoking is an important risk factor for respiratory and cardiovascular
   diseases. The role of numerous chemical, partly uncharacterised
   compounds existing in tobacco smoke is not known. (-)-Nicotine, its
   stereoisomer (+)-nicotine and main metabolite cotinine are biologically
   active compounds influencing e.g. catecholamine and eicosanoid systems.
   The precise mechanisms are not well known. The purpose of the present
   study consisting of a PhD thesis (11) and five original papers was to
   investigate the in vitro effects of nicotine isomers and cotinine on
   eicosanoid production in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, platelets and
   whole blood in vitro, and to clarify the effects of smoking without and
   with nicotine substitution on eicosanoid production in vivo and ex vivo.
   It was found that all the tested compounds modulated blood cell
   eicosanoid synthesis. Nicotine isomers and cotinine increased PGE(2) but
   decreased TXB2, LTB4 and LTE4 synthesis in vitro. Eicosanoid synthesis
   in vivo and ex vivo was higher in smokers (n = 60) than in non-smoking
   controls (n = 20). This may contribute to the harmful cardiovascular
   effects of smoking. Cessation of smoking without, but not with, nicotine
   substitution reduced eicosanoid synthesis measured ex vivo as whole
   blood production or in vivo as urinary excretion of eicosanoid
   metabolites after 3, 7 and 14 days. Thus long-term nicotine substitution
   diminishes the beneficial effects of smoking cessation.}},

Abstract = {{A number of diffusion processes have been proposed as a continuous
   analog of Stein's model for the subthreshold membrane potential of a
   neuron. Interspike intervals are then described as the
   first-passage-time of the corresponding diffusion model through a
   suitable threshold. Various biological considerations suggest the use of
   more sophisticated models in lieu of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.
   However, the advantages of the additional complexity are not always
   clear. Comparisons among different models generally use numerical
   methods in specific examples without a general sensitivity analysis on
   the role of the model parameters. Here, we compare the distribution of
   interspike intervals from different models using-the method of
   stochastic ordering. The qualitative comparison of the role of each
   parameter extends the results obtained from numerical simulations. One
   result on neurons with high positive net excitation is that the reversal
   potential models considered do not greatly differ from the
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. For neurons with increased inhibition, the
   models give greater differences among the interspike interval
   distributions. In particular, when the mean trajectories are matched,
   the Feller model gives shorter times than the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model
   but longer times than our double reversal potential model.}},

Abstract = {{Glutaredoxins are glutathione disulphide oxidoreductases catalysing
   disulphide reductions via a redox active disulphide. We have examined
   the presence of glutaredoxin in the human cervix, and its differential
   expression during cervical remodelling in term pregnancy and immediately
   post-partum as compared to the non-pregnant state. Cervical biopsies
   were obtained from 24 term-pregnant and 24 post-partal women, of which
   10 were taken after spontaneous delivery, 10 after prostaglandin-induced
   delivery and four after mifepristone-induced delivery, all obtained
   within 15 min after delivery. Six non-pregnant women served as controls.
   The tissues were analysed for the glutaredoxin mRNA levels using a
   solution hybridization method. Glutaredoxin mRNA was expressed in the
   human cervix, the level increased greater than or equal to2-fold at term
   pregnancy and immediately postpartum. The level of cervical glutaredoxin
   mRNA from prostaglandin E-2-treated women was 3-fold higher than after
   spontaneous ripening and delivery. Localization of glutaredoxin was
   visualized with immunohistochemistry in cervices from two post-partal
   women, and was compared to that of thioredoxin. We conclude that
   glutaredoxin may be involved in the regulation of cervical ripening in
   humans, particularly in the inflammatory reaction seen during this
   process. Glutaredoxin mRNA levels are up-regulated after prostaglandin
   treatment, which is effective and the most commonly used substance for
   cervical priming and induction of labour.}},

Abstract = {{Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings' successful coup d'etat in 1981 and his
   subsequent rise to the presidency of Ghana in January 1993 has had both
   a demonstration and contagion effect. In the former British West Africa
   colonies of Nigeria, Gambia, and Sierra Leone, military leaders either
   tried or have replicated Rawlings' tactics to obtain and stay in power.
   In fact, of the 15 countries in West Africa,
   ``soldier-turned-civilian{''} presidents hold ``elected{''} office in 6.
   The soldier-turned-civilian transition model (STC) involves the use of
   controlled multiparty elections by ex-military, presidential candidates,
   who once in office continue to use force to maintain power. This is a
   new and growing political phenomenon in former British West Africa that
   deserves careful scrutiny. The 1992 and 1996 presidential elections in
   Ghana and Gambia, respectively, were emblematic of this process, a
   process in which incumbent military leaders engineered their countries'
   transition and tilted an already uneven playing field in their favor.
   These transitions did not necessarily result in a more democratic
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Assuming fission reaction as a dominant energy source for a long-term
   perspective, the goal of transmutation of fission products is to cut
   their increasing accumulation and to keep their inventories at easily
   manageable level. Opposite to relatively short-lived Cs-137 (T-1/2=30yr)
   whose natural decay converge equilibrium mass to the level of order of 1
   t per GW of fission energy, an approach to similar equilibrium inventory
   for long lived Cs-135 (T-1/2=2.3x10(6) yr) requires artificial
   transmutation that preassumes its isotopic separation in the most
   studies. The present paper addresses cesium transmutation without
   preliminary isotope separation that means an approach to equilibrium for
   all the isotopes including stable Cs-133. A high-flux blanket driven by
   Fusion Neutron Source with ITER-like parameters is proposed to transmute
   cesium in the elemental form. Transmutation efficiency is estimated in
   terms of equilibrium inventory and characteristic time to reach
   equilibrium both governed by the mean life-time of nuclides in
   transmuter. The analytical results show that the mean life-time of the
   target isotope Cs-135 is as Short as 21 yr which is in more than order
   of magnitude shorter than achieved in advanced fission reactors. It
   reveals that one Fusion Neutron Source with ITER-like parameters could
   transmute elemental cesium from 23 PWRs, the fraction of power
   associated with transmutation being as small as 3\%.}},

Abstract = {{Electroconvulsive therapy provokes abrupt changes in both systemic and
   cerebral hemodynamics. An anesthetic that has a minor effect on cerebral
   hemodynamics might be more suitable for patients with intracranial
   complications, such as cerebral aneurysm. The purpose of our present
   study was to compare the effects of thiopental and propofol on cerebral
   blood flow velocity. We continuously compared cerebral blood flow
   velocity at the middle cerebral artery (MCA) during electroconvulsive
   therapy, using propofol (1 mg/kg, n = 20) versus thiopental (2 mg/kg, rt
   = 20) anesthesia. Systemic hemodynamic variables and flow velocity at
   the MCA were measured until 10 min after the electrical shock. Heart
   rate and arterial blood pressure increased in the thiopental group until
   5 min after the electrical shock. In the propofol group, an increase in
   mean blood pressure was observed to 1 min after the electrical shock.
   Mean flow velocity at the MCA decreased after anesthesia in both groups,
   and increased at 0.5-3 min after the electrical shock in the thiopental
   group and at 0.5 and 1 min after the shock in the propofol group. The
   flow velocities at 0.5-5 min after the electrical shock were
   significantly more rapid in the thiopental group compared with the
   propofol group.}},

Abstract = {{We report a unique case of gallbladder adenocarcinoma associated with
   florid neuroendocrine cell nests and extensive Paneth cell metaplasia
   that has not been described previously. The patient was a 79-yr-old
   woman with a pedunculated, polypoid mass in the gallbladder.
   Microscopically, the mass was composed of tumor cells showing tubular
   and papillary growth patterns, consistent with well-differentiated
   adenocarcinoma. One-third or more of the tumor cells showed Paneth cell
   appearance. Goblet cell-type tumor cells were also intermingled. In
   addition, neuroendocrine cell nests, that were connected to the
   neoplastic glands, were scattered throughout the stroma.
   Immunohistochemically, the labeling index of MIB-1 in adenocarcinoma
   cells including Paneth cell-type carcinoma cells was approx 40\%.
   Neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin were positive
   in the neuroendocrine cells forming solid nests and intermingled within
   neoplastic glands. They were immunopositive for serotonin but negative
   for insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP).
   Although MIB-1-positive neuroendocrine cell nests were very few with
   weak staining, we th ink that the neuroendocrine cell nests were
   neoplastic in nature. The formation of the multifocal neuroendocrine
   nests may be a consequence of the trophic effects of unknown
   substance(s), which can promote serotonin-producing neuroendocrine cells
   to proliferate. We postulate that Paneth cell-type carcinoma cells may
   be intimately related to such substance(s) in our case.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Coffee consumption has been associated with an excess
   bladder cancer risk, but results from epidemiological studies are
   inconsistent. This association has been long debated, in part due to the
   potential confounding by smoking. We examined the risk associated with
   coffee consumption in nonsmokers in a pooled analysis of ten European
   bladder cancer case-control studies.
   Methods: The pooled data set comprises 564 cases and 2929 hospital or
   population controls who had never smoked. They were enrolled in ten
   studies conducted in Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, Italy and Spain.
   Information on coffee consumption and occupation was re-coded following
   standard criteria. Unconditional logistic regression was applied
   adjusting for age, study center, occupation and gender.
   Results: Seventy-nine percent of the study population reported having
   drunk coffee, and 2.4\% were heavy drinkers, reporting having drunk on
   average ten or more cups per day. There was no excess risk in ever
   coffee drinkers (OR = 1.0, 95\% CI 0.8-1.3) compared to never drinkers.
   The risk did not increase monotonically with dose but a statistically
   significant excess risk was seen for subjects having drunk ten or more
   cups per day (OR = 1.8, 95\% CI 1.0-3.3). This excess was seen in both
   men and women. There was no evidence of an association of the risk with
   duration or type of coffee consumption. The pooled results were not
   dependent on the findings of any specific study, but they depended on
   the type of controls with an overall excess risk observed only for
   studies using hospital controls.
   Conclusion: Nonsmokers who are heavy coffee drinkers may have a small
   excess risk of bladder cancer. Although these results cannot be
   attributed to confounding by smoking, the possibility of bias in control
   selection cannot be discarded. On the basis of these results, only a
   very small proportion of cancers of the bladder among nonsmokers could
   be attributed to coffee drinking.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. The prognosis of lung carcinoma patients is better when the
   diagnosis is made early, the disease is localized, and radical surgery
   is possible. Screening for lung carcinoma with mass radiography or
   sputum cytology should contribute to a more favorable prognosis. To the
   author's knowledge to dale, large-scale screening studies have shown
   improved survival but no reduction in mortality.
   METHODS, The histologic tumor type, disease stage, treatment, and
   survival rates were studied in 93 men who were found to have lung
   carcinoma during a single chest X-ray screening of > 33,000 smoking men
   ages 50-69 years and in 239 men of the same age range whose lung
   carcinoma was detected either through symptomatic presentation or
   through chest X-ray obtained for other purposes.
   RESULTS. The histologic distribution was similar in the two groups but
   screening detected more early stage tumors that more often were
   resectable (37\% vs. 19\%). The 5-year survival rate for the patients
   detected by screening was 19\% and that of the other patients was 10\%,
   with a relative risk 0.65 (95\% confidence interval, 0.50-0.84).
   CONCLUSIONS. The results of the current study demonstrate that chest
   X-ray screening might improve the prognosis of patients with lung
   carcinoma. However, these results are subject to many factors that were
   only partially controlled and should be interpreted cautiously. Cancer

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to analyze the lactate dehydrogenase (LD)
   pattern in tissues and serum of calves (Bohemian pied hybrids, with a
   substantial component of the Holstein breed) and compared with data of
   similar studies. LD isoenzyme patterns were determined by polyacrylamide
   gel electrophoresis, data were evaluated by current process and by a sum
   of vectors method (SV).
   In the basic model SV5,LD(1-5), an evaluation of LD patterns as
   resultant vectors enabled an easy detection of outlying data obtained in
   this study and those by others. It was found that calf tissues under
   study differ substantially in their LD patterns. Comparing the angles
   SV{[}alpha] of resultant vectors for our samples, we can state the
   following order: kidney < left atrium <approximate to> right atrium <
   serum < lung, spleen, liver << diaphragm. Calf tissues (lung, spleen,
   liver) differed in SV{[}c] variable of resultant vector in the following
   order: lung < spleen < liver. No significant differences between summer
   and winter serum LD patterns were found in contrast to literature data
   obtained from cows kept under range conditions. This is necessary to
   consider when evaluating the results of similar studies.}},

Abstract = {{The disease known as pecan fungal leaf scorch has been reported to be
   either caused by or associated with several fungi since it was first
   recognized in 1972. Data are presented that indicate the disease is
   initiated by the fastidious xylem-limited bacterium Xylella fastidiosa.
   X. fastidiosa was found consistently associated with fungal leaf scorch
   disease of pecan (Carya illinoinensis) in commercial orchards in
   Louisiana. It was generally not detected in symptomless trees. The
   disease was reproduced by inoculation of greenhouse seedlings and
   grafted trees with cultures of the bacterium obtained from leaves with
   fungal leaf scorch. The bacterium was reisolated from symptomatic tissue
   of inoculated pecan seedlings, but not from symptomless plants
   inoculated with water to complete Koch's postulates. It is proposed that
   the name of the disease be changed to pecan bacterial leaf scorch
   because fungi do not appear to be necessary for symptom development.}},

Abstract = {{Previous governments and other commentators have emphasized the
   relationship between a teacher's knowledge of the subject material being
   taught and the quality of learning outcomes. This has been reflected in
   the entry requirements to Initial Teacher Training (ITT) (primary) of
   public examination performance in the core subjects. However, disquiet
   has been expressed as to the efficacy of such qualifications as
   indicators of knowledge and skills at the entry point. Recent changes to
   ITT (primary) regulations require students' actual knowledge of the
   content of the three core subjects to be audited. This paper reports and
   reflects on the effects that re-examining their knowledge and skills in
   mathematics has had on the confidence of primary trainee teachers. It
   presents some key questions that must be addressed if the current audit
   regulations are indeed to benefit our future teachers and to enhance the
   learning of our pupils.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Magnetohydrodynamics is discussed within the framework of irreversible
   thermodynamics. The nonrelativistic version is reviewed by introducing
   the electromagnetic held as an external force. Results are discussed and
   emphasis is placed on the fact that the transport equations, being of a
   parabolic type, violate causality. The relativistic version is next
   considered using Kaluza's ideas about unifying fields in terms of the
   corresponding space-time curvature for a given metric. The outcome of
   this approach is rewarding. The conservation equations follow in a
   direct way as well as the entropy balance equation with an entropy
   production whose form suggests the type of constitutive equations that
   are consistent with its semipositive character. Further, the resulting
   transport equations are of a hyperbolic type in agreement with
   causality. Therefore, relativistic magnetohydrodynamics is placed within
   a thermodynamic framework consistent with the second law. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We evaluated the effects of dietary fat type on fat metabolism and

   g dietary saturated (beef tallow) or polyunsaturated fat (sunflower
   oil)/100 g for 32 d, The abdominal fat deposition of chickens fed the
   sunflower oil-enriched diet was significantly lower than that of
   chickens fed the tallow-enriched diet (2.63 +/- 0.47 versus 3.03 +/-
   0.44 g/100 g live wt.; P = 0.033). The specific activities of heart
   carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
   were higher (P less than or equal to 0.03) in chickens fed the sunflower
   oil-enriched diets, indicating a greater rate of beta -oxidation, Liver
   fatty acid synthetase activity was lower (P = 0.01) in chickens fed the
   sunflower oil-enriched diet, suggesting reduced hepatic lipogenesis in
   this group. Postprandial plasma triglyceride levels were significantly
   lower (P < 0.05) in birds fed the sunflower oil-enriched diet,
   indicating a higher rate of dietary lipid clearance from the bloodstream
   to tissues. In conclusion, the lower fat deposition observed in broilers
   fed sunflower oil-enriched diets appears to be the net result of an
   increased rate of lipid catabolism and lower rate of fatty acid
   synthesis despite higher dietary fat absorption.}},

   enzymes in the mouse intranasal test}},

Abstract = {{The mouse intranasal test (MINT) was developed to assess the immunogenic
   potential of detergent enzymes. The BDF1 mouse (H-2(b/d)), a cross of
   C57B1/6 (H-2(b)) x DBA/2 (H-2(d)) has been used for most of the
   development work. Preliminary data in the CB6F1(H-2(d/b)), a cross of
   Balb/c (H-2(d)) x C57Bl/6 showed that this strain was similar to the
   BDF1 in its response to enzymes, These data also showed that the
   parental strains responded differently to the enzymes. To understand
   better the influence the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
   background has on immune responses to enzymes, 3 different enzymes were
   tested in 4 inbred strains (C57Bl/6, DBA/2, Balb/c, and C57Bl/10), 2
   hybrid strains (BDF1 and CB6F1), and 2 congenic strains (Balb.B10 and
   B10.D2). BDF1 mice rank enzymes the same as the guinea pig, which in
   turn correlates with sensitization in occupationally exposed humans. The
   ranking is based upon the dose of enzyme needed to give one-half maximal
   IgG1 antibody response (ED,,) where Termamyl is more potent than
   Alcalase, which is equipotent to Savinase, The H-2(d) strains ranked the
   enzymes the same as the BDF1 but generated ED(50)s for the proteases
   that were one order of magnitude greater than the BDF1 ED(50)s. The
   response to Termamyl was the same in the two F1 strains and the H-2(d)
   strains. The H-2b strains did not rank the enzymes the same as BDF1 but
   the ED(50)s for the proteases were similar to the ED(50)s in the F1
   strains. The response to Termamyl in the H-2b strains was lower than the
   response in the F1 and H-2d strains. Initial data show that the inbred
   strains will make enzyme-specific IgE antibody to high doses of enzyme
   with DBA/2 > Balb/c > C57Bl/6 in terms of the robustness of the
   response, The IgG1 responses in the congenic strains were similar to the
   responses in the H-2 matched strains. In addition, the antibody response
   to enzymes was consistent regardless of the source of BDF1 mice. The
   responses to these enzymes are clearly MHC linked with a role for Class
   II I-E molecules indicated. The current data strongly support the use of
   the F1 hybrid as an appropriate strain for evaluating allergic responses
   to enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{Transport of system x(c)(-) is an exchange agency with high specificity
   for anionic form of cystine and The protein mediating this transport is
   a disulfide-linked heterodimer of a light chain named xCT and a heavy
   chain previously known as 4F2hc. W e have isolated two cDNAs encoding
   xCT from the human cDNA library. One clone coded for a protein of 501
   amino acids with 12 putative transmembrane domains. When functionally
   expressed in Xenopus oocytes together with the human 4F2hc, human xCT
   induced the transport activity whose characteristics are similar to
   those of system x(c)(-). Another clone seemed to contain a partial human
   xCT and a long 3' untranslated region. The human xCT gene was localized
   at chromosome 4q28-31. Analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the human
   xCT gene revealed several sites for potentially binding of
   transcriptional factors, including NF-E2 and AP-1. Transport of cystine
   via system x(c)(-) has been known as a regulatory factor for the
   intracellular glutathione level, and its transport activity is induced
   in response to the oxygen tension in culture. Northern blot analysis
   demonstrated that the expression of both xCT and 4F2hc was significantly
   enhanced by oxygen. The results suggest that oxygen regulates the
   activity of system x(c)(-) by modulating the expression of both xCT and
   4F2hc mRNAs. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2, 665-671.}},

Abstract = {{Using time domain reflectometry, we carried out dielectric relaxation
   measurements on 1-propanol-water mixtures for the entire concentration
   range in the frequency range 100 MHz-25 GHz at 20, 25, and 30 degreesC.
   We have calculated the excess partial molar activation free energy,
   enthalpy, and entropy for 1-propanol, DeltaG(1PA)(E) DeltaH(1PA)(E), and
   Delta (S)(1PA), and those for water, DeltaG(W)(E), DeltaH(W)(E), and
   DeltaS(W)(E) from the relaxation times. In the region of X (molar
   fraction of 1-propanol) greater than or equal to0.14, DeltaH(1PA)(E) and
   DeltaS(1PA)(E) take nearly zero. This means that I propanol molecules in
   the mixtures find themselves in not a very different environment from
   that in pure liquid. In the water-rich region, DeltaH(1PA)(E) and
   DeltaS(1PA)(E), exhibit two maxima at X similar to 0.03 and X similar to
   0.06, corresponding roughly to 0.9 and 0.78 g/cm(3) of water content,
   respectively. This fact, together with the results of the molecular
   dynamics studies of Sciortino et al. suggest the formation of two kinds
   of saturated hydration structures: the clathrate hydration shells with
   tetrahedral local arrangements of water molecules around X similar to
   0.03 and nonclathrate shells with large cavities with three-coordinated
   local arrangements around X similar to 0.06. Hydrophobic hydration seems
   to partly share the same mechanism with structural enhancement in pure
   water by lowering local density. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The action of tides on density-driven circulation, internal gravity
   waves, and mixing was investigated in the St. Lawrence Estuary between
   Rimouski and Quebec City. Time-varying fields of water level, currents
   and density were computed under typical summer conditions using a
   three-dimensional hydrostatic coastal ocean model that incorporates a
   second order turbulence closure submodel. These results are compared
   with current meter records and other observations The model and the
   observations reveal buoyancy effects produced by tidal forcing. The
   semi-diurnal tide raises the isopycnals over the sills at the head of
   the Laurentian Trough and English Bank, producing internal tides
   radiating seaward. Relatively dense intermediate waters rise from below
   75-m depth to the near surface over the sills setting rip gravity
   currents on the inner slopes. Internal hydraulic controls develop over
   the outer sills; during flood, surface flow separation occurs at the
   entrances of the Saguenay Fjord and the upper estuary west of Ilet Rouge
   Bank. Early during ebb flow (restratification), the surface layer.
   deepens to encompass the tops of the sills. As the ebb current
   intensifies, the model predicts the formation of seaward internal jumps
   over the outer sills, which were confirmed from acoustic reflection
   observations. As the internal Froude number increases further; flow
   separation migrates up to sill height As a result of these transitions
   internal bores emanate from the head region one to two hours before low
   water We find that the mixing of oceanic and surface,waters near the
   sills is driven by the vertical shear produced during ebb in the channel
   south of Ilet Rouge, the shear produced in the bottom gravity flood
   currents, and, to a lesser extent the processes over the sills.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: Ionizing radiation therapy by way of various
   beams such as electron, photon and neutron is an established method in
   tumor treatment. The side effects caused by this treatment such as
   ulcer, painful mastitis and delay of wound healing are well known, too.
   Biomodulation by low level laser therapy (LLLT) has become popular as a
   therapeutic modality for the acceleration of wound healing and the
   treatment of inflammation. Evidence for this kind of application,
   however, is not fully understood yet. This study intends to demonstrate
   the response of biomodulative laser treatment on the side effects caused
   by ionizing radiation by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Study design/patients and methods: Six female patients suffering from
   painful mastitis after breast ionizing irradiation and one man suffering
   from radiogenic ulcer were treated with lambda = 780 nm diode laser
   irradiation at a fluence rate of 5 J/cm(2). LLLT was performed for a
   period of 4-6 weeks (mean sessions: 25 per patient, range 19-35). The
   tissue response was determined by means of MRI after laser treatment in
   comparison to MRI prior to the beginning of the LLLT. Results: All
   patients showed complete clinical remission. The time-dependent contrast
   enhancement curve obtained by the evaluation of MR images demonstrated a
   significant decrease of enhancement features typical for inflammation in
   the affected area. Conclusion: Biomodulation by LLLT seems to be a
   promising treatment modality for side effects induced by ionizing
   radiation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ligand binding to estrogen receptor (ER) is presumed to regulate the
   type and timing of ER interactions with different cofactors. Using
   fluorescence microscopy in living coils, we characterized the
   recruitment of five different green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled
   ER-interacting peptides to the distinct subnuclear compartment occupied
   by blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-labeled ER alpha. Different ligands
   promoted the recruitment of different peptides. One peptide was
   recruited in response to estradiol (E-2), tamoxifen, raloxifene, or ICI
   182,780 incubation whereas other peptides were recruited specifically by
   E-2 or tamoxifen. Peptides containing different sequences surrounding
   the ER-interacting motif LXXLL were recruited with different time
   courses after E-2 addition. Complex temporal kinetics also were observed
   for recruitment of the full-length, ER cofactor glucocorticoid
   receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1); rapid, E-2-dependent recruitment
   of GRIP1 was blocked by mutation of the GRIP1 LXXLL motifs to LXXAA
   whereas slower E-2 recruitment persisted for the GRIP1 LXXAA mutant.
   This suggested the presence of multiple, temporally distinct GRIP 1
   recruitment mechanisms. E-2 recruitment of GRIP1 and LXXLL peptides was
   blocked by coincubation with excess ICI 182,780. In contrast, preformed
   E-2/ER/GRIP1 and E-2/ER/LXXLL complexes were resistant to subsequent ICI
   182,780 addition whereas ICI 182,780 dispersed preformed complexes
   containing the GRIP1 LXXAA mutant. This suggested that E-2-induced LXXLL
   binding altered subsequent ligand/ER interactions. Thus, alternative,
   ligand-selective recruitment and dissociation mechanisms with distinct
   temporal sequences are available for ERa action in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{With recent advances in genetics, many new strategies for pest control
   have become feasible. This is the second article in which we model new
   techniques for pest control based on the mass release of genetically
   modified insects. In this article we model the release of insects
   carrying a dominant and redundant female killing or sterilizing (FK)
   allele on multiple genetic loci. If such insects are released into a
   target population, the FK allele can become widely spread in the
   population through the males while reducing the population each
   generation by killing females. We allow the number of loci used to vary
   from 1 to 20. We also allow the FK allele to carry a fitness cost in
   males due to the gene insertions. Using a model, we explore the
   effectiveness and optimal strategies for such releases. En the mast
   ideal circumstances (no density-dependence and released insects equal in
   fitness to wild ones), FR releases are several orders of magnitude more
   effective than equal sized sterile male releases. For example, a single
   release of 19 FK-bearing males for every two wild males, with the
   released males carrying the FK allele on 10 loci, reduces the target
   population to 0.002\% of no-release size. An equal sized sterile release
   reduces the target population to 5\% of no-release size. We also show
   how the effectiveness of the technique decreases as the fitness cost of
   the FK alleles in males increases. For example, the above mentioned
   release reduces the target population to 0.7\% of no-release size if
   each FK allele carries a fitness cost in males of 5\%. ridding a simple
   model for density-dependence and assuming that each of the released
   males carries the FK allele on six loci, we show that the release size
   necessary to reduce the target population to 1/100 of no-release size in
   10 generations of releases varies from 0.44:1 to 4:1 (depending on
   parameter values). We also calculate the optimal number of loci on which
   to put the FK allele under various circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Due to ecological advantages, wood is a promising source of energy to
   cover a part of the given heat demand. Against this background, the aim
   of this paper is to give a detailed analysis of the heat provision costs
   of woody biomass. For different case studies it is shown which part of
   the heat provision chain dominates the overall costs and within which
   range the costs can vary. As the heat provision from wood is only one
   possibility to cover a given energy demand, these costs are compared to
   costs for the use of other renewable energy sources and for fossil
   energy carriers. The use of renewable energies is often promoted by
   various governmental measures. Therefore, the influence of such
   governmental incentives that could he applied to promote woody biofuels
   are discussed and their impact on the heat provision costs are analysed.
   Based on this, recommendations are given concerning measures to he
   applied to make wood an energy source that is competitive with fossil

Abstract = {{Polymeric wear debris produced by articulation of the femoral head
   against the ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene socket of a total
   hip replacement has been implicated as me main cause of osteolysis and
   subsequent failure of these implants. Potential solutions to this
   problem are to employ hard bearing surface combinations such as
   metal-on-metal or ceramic-on-ceramic prostheses. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the difference in lubrication modes and friction of a
   range of material combinations using synthetic and biological fluids as
   the lubricants. The experimental results were compared with theoretical
   predictions of film thicknesses and lubrication modes. A strong
   correlation was observed between experiment and theory when employing
   carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) fluids as the lubricant. Under these
   conditions the ceramic-on-ceramic joints showed full fluid film
   lubrication while the metal-on-metal, metal-on-plastic, diamond-like
   carbon-coated stainless steel (DLC)-on-plastic and ceramic-on-plastic
   prostheses operated under a mixed lubrication regime. With bovine serum
   as the lubricant in the all ceramic joints, however, the full fluid film
   lubrication was inhibited due to adsorbed proteins. In the
   metal-on-metal joints this adsorbed protein layer acted to reduce the
   friction while in the ceramic coupling the friction was increased. The
   use of bovine serum as the lubricant also significantly increased the
   friction in both the metal-on-plastic and ceramic-on-plastic joints. The
   friction produced by the DLC-on-plastic joints depended on the quality
   of the coating. Those joints with a less consistent coating and
   therefore a higher surface roughness gave significantly higher friction
   than the smoother, more consistently coated heads.}},

   the rate and extent of hyphal development up to 5 h were normal.
   Therefore, we provide evidence that Cpp1p represses hyphal gene
   expression by acting through a Cek1p-independent mechanism. SAP4-6 and

Abstract = {{A model was established in 39 dogs to investigate the growth factor
   modulation of regenerate bone in distraction osteogenesis. A segment of
   the diaphysis of the radius was resected unilaterally, An osteotomy was
   made proximal to the segmental defect to create a transport segment. A
   monolateral external fixator was applied. After a latency period, the
   segment was transported across the defect. One week after the transport
   assembly contacted the distal pin clamp, an ipsilateral osteotomy of the
   proximal ulna was performed. In 20 dogs, transforming growth factor-beta
   was injected into the regenerate bone halfway through the transport
   period. Four dogs were sacrificed before docking, when the regenerate
   bone was still immature. In specimens harvested halfway through the
   transport period, evidence was found of intramembranous ossification
   during distraction. In specimens harvested after the transport assembly
   contacted the distal pin clamp, evidence was found that the mature
   regenerate formed by endochondral ossification. Therefore, a combined
   mechanism of ossification is proposed for this segmental defect model
   that includes mechanical stimulus for bone differentiation. The onetime
   administration of transforming growth factor-beta retarded the formation
   of a stable, united regenerate. It is concluded that transforming growth
   factor-beta caused an effect opposite to that which was desired.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their good resistance at high temperature, good thermal
   conductivity and swelling resistance, molybdenum alloys are amongst the
   candidates for divertor structural materials. However, little is known
   about their tensile and fracture toughness behaviour, in particular
   after irradiation-induced embrittlement. This paper aims to investigate
   the tensile and fracture toughness properties of two molybdenum alloys,
   namely TZM and Mo-5\%Re. Tensile and compact tension specimens were
   irradiated in the BR2 reactor at 40 degreesC and 450 degreesC up to a
   fast neutron fluence of 3.5 x 10(20) n/cm(2) (0.2 dpa). Tests were
   performed on both precracked and notched specimens. Results show a
   drastic decrease of the ductility due to irradiation, but only a slight
   decrease of the fracture toughness in the lower shelf domain. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Although evidence for land vegetation comes from the Silurian, and maybe
   even earlier, the first record of fossil charcoal (fusain) is from the
   late Devonian. For this period there are only one or two isolated
   records. Not until the Early Carboniferous is there a record of
   extensive charcoal deposits, mainly preserved in near-shore elastic
   sediments, which provide evidence of significant and widespread
   wildfires. By the late Carboniferous charcoal was common or abundant in
   a wide range of facies, including tropical wetland peats. Wildfire
   played an important role in shaping the environment at this time. The
   latest Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic records of charcoal are fewer,
   whereas important deposits of late Mesozoic age are found worldwide. The
   occurrence of charcoal at the Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary has been
   highlighted as evidence for a global fire following a meteorite impact,
   but this interpretation is questionable. Charcoal has been widely
   reported from Tertiary sediments and its appearance in the Quaternary
   and Recent is not solely as a result of human impact. Through the past
   400 million years there have been major changes in atmospheric oxygen
   levels that affected fire intensity and frequency. Fire systems thus
   have a long history and their impact on shaping the environment is
   assessed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The primary mineral and whole-rock chemistry of 46 core samples from the
   host rocks of the Tongonan Geothermal Field (the Philippines) have been
   used to infer the likely composition of the heat source for the system.
   The host rocks consist of andesite lavas (with intercalated
   fossiliferous early to mid-Miocene shales and limestone), and a plutonic
   rock basement ranging in composition from gabbro to granite. The whole
   rock TiO2, Fe2O3 (total iron), MgO, P2O5 and V data for volcanic and
   plutonic rocks are colinear on conventional Harker diagrams. This, along
   with similar hornblende chemistry, age and close spatial relationship
   suggests that the basement and cover rocks are cogenetic and evolved by
   low-pressure crystal fractionation. Crystal fractionation models
   indicate that separation of 60\% plagioclase and 30\% hornblende from
   original magma controlled the chemistry of the host rocks. The original
   Miocene magma chambers beneath the Tongonan field crystallized inwards
   from the walls at approximately 750 degreesC and 1 kb pressure (3-4 km
   depth) thus forming a series of plutons or a batholith at drilled
   depths. A supercritical hydrothermal fluid trapped in the crystallizing,
   hornblende-granite-pegmatite core of a crystallized Miocene diorite
   batholith was gradually being released to shallower levels through
   antithetic cross fractures during creep and uplift along the main
   branches of the Philippine Fault from the Pliocene. This ascending fluid
   is now thought to be responsible for the present thermal activity of the
   field.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The electroolfactogram (EOG) previously has been used to demonstrate the
   regional distribution of rat olfactory epithelial odorant responses.
   Here, we evaluated the effects of airflow parameters on EOGs in two
   preparations: one where odorants were directly applied to the epithelium
   (opened preparation) and one where odorants were drawn through the nasal
   passages by an artificial sniff(closed preparation). EOG rise times
   served as one measure of odorant access. For isoamyl acetate (but not
   for limonene), rise times were slower in the lateral recesses of the
   closed (but not the opened) preparation. Polar odorants (amyl acetate,
   carvone and benzaldehyde) evoked smaller responses in the closed
   preparation than in the opened preparation, and these responses were
   particularly depressed in the lateral regions of the closed preparation.
   Responses to nonpolar hydrocarbon odorants (limonene and benzene) were
   equal in the lateral regions of both preparations, but were somewhat
   depressed in the medial region of the closed preparation. The responses
   to some polar odorants in the closed preparation were sensitive to
   changes in airflow para meters. These data suggest that the sorptive
   properties of the nose contribute substantially to determining the
   response of the epithelium and act to increase differences produced by
   inherent receptor mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Tissue factor (TF) is the major intrinsic initiator of
   clotting. TF expression on monocytes has been associated with high
   titers of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in patients with
   antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with thrombosis. We investigated the
   influence of clinical factors on TF activity in blood from patients with
   systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and examined the relationship between
   aCL and TF.
   Methods. In this cross sectional study, consecutive patients with SLE
   from one rheumatology clinic gave blood samples for measurement of TF
   activity, aCL, and Russell viper venom time. We assessed disease
   activity by measuring sedimentation rate, anti-dsDNA, and complement
   components C3 and C4, and measured clinical indices. Associations were
   investigated with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and linear regression.
   Results. Sixty-nine patients contributed blood samples. The median age
   was 38 years, and 10 of the SLE patients had a history of thrombosis.
   Patients with active arthritis had TF activity 1.3 times that in
   patients without arthritis (p = 0.028). Users of nonsteroidal
   antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) had TF activity significantly lower than
   nonusers (p = 0.010). Patients with previous thrombosis had TF activity
   significantly lower than patients without thrombosis (p < 0.001).
   Overall, aCL and TF activity were not associated when we adjusted fur
   these clinical factors.
   Conclusion, Arthritis, previous thrombosis, and use of NSAID
   significantly modified TF activity in patients with SLE. Unlike previous
   reports, we found no association between aCL titer and TF activity,
   which may be due to our adjusting for other important clinical Factors.}},

Abstract = {{Spermatogenesis is a complex and very well organized process lasting
   from 30 to 75 days in mammals. The spermatogenic process has been
   described mainly in laboratory mammals, such as the rat, while
   correspondent studies in wild animals are scarce. The gerbil (Meriones
   unguiculatus) is a small rodent native of the arid regions of Mongolia
   and China. Few reports are available on reproduction in the male
   Mongolian gerbil. The present study provides the first description of
   the ultrastructural alterations in spermatid cytoplasm and nucleus, with
   particular reference to acrosome formation in gerbils. The testes were
   processed by conventional transmission electron microscopy technique.
   Based on the development of the acrosomal system and changes in nuclear
   morphology, the transformation of spermatids in spermatozoon was divided
   into 15 steps. There were four phases in the spermiogenesis process in
   the gerbil: Golgi, cap, acrosomal and maturation phases. This provides
   the foundation for a variety of future studies of the spermiogenesis of
   this animal. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the effects of aprotinin on blood product use and
   postoperative complications in patients undergoing thoracic aortic
   surgery requiring deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
   Design: A retrospective study.
   Setting: A university hospital.
   Participants: Nineteen patients who underwent elective or urgent
   thoracic aortic surgery.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results:The total number of units of packed red
   blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets was significantly less
   in the group that received aprotinin (p = 0.01, 0.04, and 0.01), The
   intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells and platelets,
   collection and retransfusion of cell saver, and postoperative
   transfusion of fresh frozen plasma were also significantly less in the
   aprotinin group (p = 0.01, 0.02, 0.01, and 0.05). No patient in either
   group sustained renal dysfunction or a myocardial infarction. Two
   patients who had not received aprotinin suffered from chronic
   postoperative seizures, and one patient who had received aprotinin
   sustained a perioperative stroke.
   Conclusions: Low-dose aprotinin administration significantly decreases
   blood product transfusion requirements in the setting of thoracic aortic
   surgery requiring deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, and it does not
   appear to be associated with renal or myocardial dysfunction. Copyright

Abstract = {{Methods to re-establish a flat growth front on top of the corrugated
   surface of InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) during MOCVD are reported.
   Overgrowth temperatures at least 100 K higher than the low QD deposition
   temperature of 490 degreesC are required for a reduction of the
   corrugation. In order to avoid degradation of the QDs, however, the
   temperature must not be increased unless the QDs are buried by similar
   to 3 nm GaAs deposited at the QD growth temperature. Application of an
   additional annealing step after deposition of the GaAs cap layer
   improves the surface flatness and leads to an improvement of the
   radiative recombination efficiency. Lasers grown using such an annealing
   process for GaAs spacers of an InGaAs QD stack show lower threshold
   currents and higher internal quantum efficiency. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Epithelial chloride (Cl-) transport is achieved by the coordinated
   action of symporters such as the Na+-K+-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1) and
   chloride channels such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
   regulator (CFTR). As a secretory tissue, mammary epithelial cells are
   obvious candidates for such mechanisms, but Cl- transport and its
   hormonal regulation have been poorly delineated in mammary epithelial
   cells. We determined whether the mammary epithelial cell line, HC11,
   transports chloride and whether this was regulated by PRL, a hormone
   known to stimulate ion transport. HC11 cells express both CFTR and
   NKCC1. Exposure to PRL or PGE, increased Cl- transport in HC11 cells.
   This was inhibited by the NKCC1 blocker, furosemide, and by the Cl-
   channel inhibitor, diphenylamine 2-carboxylate, Dose and time course of
   PRL action indicate that PRL had maximal effect on Cl- transport at 1
   mug/ml and at 10 min of stimulation. Examination of the signaling
   pathways suggests that the PRL effect on Cl- transport does not involve
   an increase in {[}Ca2+](i) or MAP kinase activity. RT-PCR analyses
   indicate that HC11 cells express mRNA for Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2,
   and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) but not
   for JAK3. PRL treatment of HC11 cells increased phosphorylation of
   STAT5. The JAK2 inhibitor AG490 blocked phosphorylation of STAT5 and
   PRL-induced, but not PGE(1)-induced, Cl- transport. NKCC1, but not CFTR,
   is tyrosine phosphorylated in HC11 cells. PRL enhanced tyrosine
   phosphorylation of NKCC1, and this effect was attenuated by the JAK2
   inhibitor AG490. These results are the first demonstrations of a role
   for tyrosine phosphorylation of NKCC1 and of the PRL-JAK2 cascade in the
   regulation of Cl- transport.}},

Abstract = {{A series of annealed and aged Fe-xCr, Fe-12Cr-yC and Fe-12Cr-0.1C-zMo
   model alloys were irradiated in EBR-II at eight temperatures between 400
   degreesC and 650 degreesC and dose levels ranging from 35 to 131 dpa.
   Swelling-induced density changes observed in the binary alloys generally
   peaked at mid-chromium levels, with the chromium and temperature
   dependence expressed primarily in the duration of the transient regime.
   The steady-state swelling rate at the lower irradiation temperatures was
   much higher than previous estimates, reaching similar to0.2\%/dpa and
   possibly still climbing at higher neutron exposures. The dependence of
   swelling on molybdenum and carbon was more complex, depending on whether
   the temperature was relatively low or high. At temperatures of 482
   degreesC and above, the effect of carbon additions was very pronounced
   with swelling of Fe-12Cr jumping dramatically from near zero at 0.002\%
   C to 6-10\% at 0.1\% C. This indicates that the major determinant of the
   composition and temperature dependence probably lies in the duration of
   the nucleation-dominated transient regime of swelling and not primarily
   in the steady-state swelling rate as previously envisioned. This raises
   the possibility that significant swelling may occur earlier in fusion
   and spallation neutron spectra where high gas generation rates may
   assist void nucleation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose To investigate the efficacy and complications associated with
   dose increments of botulinum toxin-A (BTA) for comitant horizontal
   strabismus patients.
   Methods Twenty-five esotropic (ET) and 45 exotropic (XT) patients
   received 2.5-20 U of BTA injection. Parameters for achieving less than
   10 prism dioptres (pd) of horizontal deviation and percentage correction
   of the pretreatment deviation were assessed for injections of less than
   10 U and more than 10 U of BTA. Induced ptosis and vertical deviation
   were examined within and after 6 months of follow-up.
   Results The mean pretreatment deviations were 38.6 +/- 2.5 pd and 37.6
   +/- 1.9 pd for the ET and XT groups, respectively. After receiving 1.6
   and 1.5 injections on average, improvement to less than 10 pd at the
   primary position occurred in 32\% of ET and 22\% of XT patients; the
   difference was not statistically significant. The percentage corrections
   of the ET patients were 41.4 +/- 9.3\% and 36.9 +/- 5.6\% in those
   treated with less than 10 U and more than 10 U of BTA respectively; the
   difference between the two groups was insignificant. For the XT patients
   the values were 42.1 +/- 7.4\% and 28.9 +/- 3.5\% respectively, which
   also were not statistically significantly different. Frequency of
   induced ptosis was more common in ET than XT patients (p = 0.01) and
   this difference was more pronounced with increased doses of BTA (7.7\%
   in ET and 5.3\% in XT patients with less than 10 U of BTA, and 24.0\% in
   ET and 4.3\% in XT patients with more than 10 U of BTA). Ptosis resolved
   completely within 6 weeks in all cases. Induced vertical deviation with
   less than 10 U of BTA was encountered in one case of ET (11.1\%, 9 pd)
   and in another case of XT (8.3\%, 4 pd), increasing to 60.0\% (2-20 pd)
   and 38.8\% (4-16 pd) respectively with more than 10 U of BTA injection.
   In about a year, induced vertical deviation resolved in approximately
   40\%, and decreased in 30\% of the cases.
   Conclusion Increasing the dose of BTA is clinically effective in larger
   deviations, although statistically indifferent, especially in ET
   compared with XT. However, an increased dose is accompanied by increased
   incidence of induced ptosis and vertical deviation. Ptosis is temporary,
   but vertical deviation may persist for a long time and may present a
   cosmetic problem for some patients when more than 10 U of BTA is used.}},

Abstract = {{We studied a mesoscopic crosslike normal-metal structure connected to
   two superconducting (S) and two normal (N) reservoirs. We observed the
   Josephson effect under unusual conditions when there is no current
   through one of the two S/N interfaces. The potential difference between
   the S reservoirs was zero unless the voltage applied between S and N
   reservoirs exceeded a critical value although the electric potential in
   the N wire connecting the superconductors varied in a nonmonotonic way.
   The observed effects are discussed theoretically.}},

Abstract = {{Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) by means of transferrin
   saturation (TS) levels has been advocated and will identify many
   patients who are asymptomatic. The purposes of this study were (1) to
   determine HFE genotypes among asymptomatic HHC patients and correlate
   this profile with the degree of iron overload and (2) to evaluate the
   relationship between mobilized iron (mob Fe), age, serum ferritin (SF),
   and quantitative hepatic iron (QHI) in this population. One hundred
   twenty-three asymptomatic HHC patients were evaluated; ail had
   quantitative phlebotomy to determine mob Fe and genotyping for C282Y and
   H63D mutations. Liver biopsies with QHI determinations were performed an
   72 of the 123 patients. Of the entire group, 60\% were homozygous for
   C282Y, and 13\% were compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D), Among
   asymptomatic patients, the prevalence of homozygous C282Y is lower
   compared with previous studies that include clinically affected
   patients, Of those patients with more than 4 g mob Fe, 77\% were
   homozygous C282Y, Asymptomatic patients with lower iron burdens
   frequently had genotypes other than homozygous C282Y, There was no
   correlation between age and mob Fe in these patients; however, there was
   a correlation between mob Fe and both SF (r = 0.68) and QHI(r = 0.75).
   In conclusion, asymptomatic patients with moderate iron overload had a
   different genotypic profile than was seen in advanced iron overload. The
   significance of identifying patients with modest degrees of iron
   loading, who may not be homozygous for C282Y, must be addressed if
   routine TS screening is to be implemented. (C) 2000 by The American

Abstract = {{Installation of prefabricated vertical drains using a mandrel causes
   disturbance of clay surrounding the drain, resulting in a ``smear{''}
   zone of reduced permeability. In this paper, an attempt is made to
   characterize the smear zone using large-scale laboratory model tests.
   Two tests, simulating the cases of ``no smear{''} and ``with smear,{''}
   were conducted. Excess pore-water pressures were monitored at seven
   different locations along the radial direction. In addition, undisturbed
   samples were collected at various locations in the clay layer for
   conducting oedometer tests. The distribution of excess pore pressure due
   to drain installation gave a clear indication of the extent of the smear
   zone. The effect of reconsolidation on the properties of clay was found
   to be much greater than that of the remoulding of the clay. The extent
   of the smear zone was also confirmed from the change in permeability of
   the clay layer in the smear zone obtained from oedometer tests. The
   radius of the smear zone is about four times that of the mandrel, and
   the horizontal permeability of the clay layer in the smear zone is
   approximately 1.3 times smaller than that in the intact zone.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The stages of floral development in staminate lend pistillate plants of
   hop (Humulus lupulus) were defined using scanning electron microscopy
   and light microscopy. Vegetative meristems of male and female plants are
   morphologically indistinguishable. On transition to the reproductive
   phase, inflorescence spices reduce greatly in size and striking
   developmental sex differences become apparent. The first ses-specific
   differences occur extremely early in floral ontogeny. Both male and
   female plants initiate inflorescence meristems at each leaf node, each
   meristems being enclosed within a bract. Male secondary inflorescence
   meristems give rise to clusters of asynchronously developing flowers.
   Female inflorescence meristems produce flowers arranged in `cones'. Each
   male floral meristem initiates a whorl of five sepal primordia, followed
   by an inner whorl of five stamen primordia. There is no sign of carpel
   development at ally stage. In females, two carpel primordia are
   initiated, surrounded at thier base by a vestigial perianth whorl. No
   stamen development is observed. Several monoecious lines carry bisexual
   flowers, either within cymose panicles or within the basal bracts of
   terminal female inflorescences. Bisexual flowers usually possess
   perianth, stamen and carpel whorls. The central whorls are often highly
   variable, and range from a pair of stigmas fused to a thin central
   filament to a well developed gynoecium. Chimaeric central whorls
   consisting of fused staminoid-carpelloid structures also occur. Sex
   differences in unisexual hop flowers are determined at an extremely
   early stage in ontogeny. The inappropriate set of sex organs is
   suppressed before it becomes visible or, more probably, it is not
   initiated at all. Genes directing the development of sex are likely to
   act at an extremely early stage, well in advance of floral
   organogenesis. The ses chromosomes of dioecious hop plants are
   described, as well as the chromosome constitutions of monoccious plants
   and those,se carrying bisexual flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Generation of electron Bernstein waves by the
   ordinary-extraordinary-Bernstein (O-X-B) mode conversion process has
   been successfully demonstrated on W7-AS. According to Kirchoff's law,
   the inverse process of plasma EC emission by B-X-O mode conversion at
   particular angles must take place in tokamak plasmas. The optical depth
   at electron cyclotron harmonics is generally very high for electron
   Bernstein waves in tokamak plasmas. Consequently the O-mode ECE spectrum
   measured below the plasma frequency will show steps in the emitted power
   when each EC harmonic coincides with the upper hybrid resonance zone,
   where the mode conversion occurs, giving a local measurement of the
   relationship between the total magnetic field and plasma density. In a
   spherical tokamak, there are several EC harmonics below the plasma
   frequency, so several such steps can be observed via the B-X-O mode
   conversion mechanism. This is a very promising way to get information
   about the q profile in ST plasmas. (C) 2000 MAIK

   designed to examine the effects of clonidine on carbachol-induced

   Clonidine, at a dose of 100 muM or greater, attenuated carbachol-induced
   contraction and the accumulation of carbachol-induced inositol
   monophosphate (IP1). Clonidine also attenuated the accumulation of
   aluminium fluoride-induced IP1. The concentration-effect relationship of
   IP1 accumulation was similar to that of carbachol-induced contraction; r
   = 0 . 797, P < 0.001.
   These results suggest that clonidine attenuates contractile responses,

Abstract = {{Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) released from damaged cells can affect
   functions of adjacent cells. Injuries of peripheral tissue stimulate
   nerves, but effect of ATP on the nerve bundles is still speculative.
   Peripheral nerves are surrounded by perineurium, therefore the response
   of perineurium may be a first event of nerve stimulation at tissue
   injuries. The aim of the present study is to clarify whether the
   perineurium responds to ATP. To this end, we analyzed the dynamics of
   the intracellular calcium concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)) of perineurial
   cells by confocal microscopy. ATP induced a {[}Ca2+](i) increase of
   perineurial cells. Ca2+ channel blockers and removing of extracellular
   Ca2+, but not thapsigargin pretreatment, abolished ATP-induced
   {[}Ca2+](i) dynamics. This indicated that the {[}Ca2+](i) increase was
   due to an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Adenosine-5'-diphosphate also
   elicited an increase of {[}Ca2+](i), but PI receptor agonists had few
   effects on {[}Ca2+](i) dynamics. Suramin (an antagonist of P2X and P2Y
   receptors) totally inhibited ATP-induced {[}Ca2+](i) dynamics, but
   reactive blue 2 (a P2Y receptor antagonist) did not.
   Uridine-5'-triphosphate (a P2Y receptor agonist) induced no significant
   change in {[}Ca2+](i), but alpha,beta -methylene ATP (a P2X receptor
   agonist) caused a {[}Ca2+](i) increase. In conclusion, perineurial cells
   respond to extracellular ATP mainly via P2X receptors.}},

Title = {{Multicontinuum description of flow in composite heterogeneous media}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3615-3629}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Adequacy of the description of flow and transport processes in
   subsurface depends on how well a model represents the heterogeneity. One
   of the simplest models to describe the heterogeneity structure is a
   so-called composite system. Flow and transport `simulation in composite
   systems can be reduced to solving equations and averaging the solutions.
   A different approach related to averaging the equations leads to new
   equations. This description is designated as monocontinuum description.
   If the homogeneous components of a composite system, so-called phases,
   have different hydrodynamic and/or geometric parameters, it is natural
   to study averaging on the individual phases along with the global
   averaging. This approach takes into consideration the mean fields in the
   individual continuum phase as well as the cross flows and cross forces
   between continua. However, this description is nonclosed. To overcome
   this difficulty, the phenomenological theory usually postulates a
   special interaction mechanism for closing the equations. This paper
   presents the exact equations of mass balance and moment balance for each
   phase. The exact sense of exchange terms in the multicontinuum models is
   explained. We demonstrate that joint consideration of the monocontinual
   and multicontinual systems in the case of two-phase random composite
   leads to a closed description and that we can find the exchange terms.
   For a periodic composite system the same approach leads to a closed
   description for any number of phases. The terms describing the
   interactions between continua for systems with a random and periodical
   structure are calculated. We examine the hypothesis customarily made in
   the phenomenological models.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty three B-chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (B-CLD) patients
   {[}22 with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 5 with small
   lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and 6 with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)]
   with anaemia (Ht <32\%) of no other cause but their disease, received
   recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO). The treatment protocol
   provided r-HuEPO in a dose of 150 U/kg sc. thrice weekly for 3 mo. After
   1.5 mo of r-HuEPO administration, if response was not satisfactory,
   r-HuEPO dose escalation was utilised by giving incremental doses of 50
   U/kg more than the previous dose up to a maximum dose of 300 U/kg tiw.
   After maximal response, half of the responding patients discontinued
   therapy, while the other half received maintenance therapy at a dose of
   150 U/kg sc./w. Oral iron was given throughout the study. Pretreatment
   EPO levels were determined in all patients. A complete response (CR) was
   defined when Ht was >38\% and a partial response (PR) when there was an
   increase of the Ht >6\% from the initial value was achieved.
   Sixteen of the 22 B-CLL patients had Rai stage III disease and 6 stage
   IV, with a median duration of anaemia 27 months (6-38); twelve of them
   were receiving chlorambucil while the rest were on no treatment. Of the
   SLL and LPL group, 4 patients had Ann Arbor stage III disease and 7
   stage IV with a median duration of anaemia 24 months (5-36); 8 patients
   were on chlorambucil. Complete response was achieved in 50\% of the
   B-CLL group and 54\% of the SLL and LPL group, with an overall response
   rate of 77 and 81\% respectively. All patients on maintenance therapy
   had a continuous response, while all patients. in whom rHuEPO was
   discontinued, relapsed. No correlation was found between patients: with
   low or high pretreatment serum EPO levels; those receiving concomitant
   therapy or not; those with B-symptoms or not; those with a non-diffuse
   or diffuse bone marrow infiltration pattern: and with splenomegaly or
   not. Life quality was significantly improved and no major side effects
   were encountered. We conclude from our study that r-HuEPO is very
   effective in correcting disease-related anaemia in B-CLD, resulting in
   down-staging of Rai stage III patients and that maintenance therapy is
   necessary. Whether the correction of anaemia improves patients' overall
   survival, still remains to be seen.}},

Abstract = {{The stage at which phagocytosis can first be characterized in the
   embryos of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus was investigated by
   microinjecting the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae into its blastocoele.
   Secondary mesenchyme cells were first observed phagocytosing during the
   mid-gastrula stage, Subsequently, as the incubation time increased, the
   number of yeast per phagocyte rose. Using vital fluorescence dyes,
   stained free yeast were seen in the blastocoele during late-gastrula
   stage, indicating cell death and suggesting specific factors, such as
   proteases, in the extracellular environment. The starting point of
   phagocytic activity reflects a biological capacity for distinguishing
   between self and nonself, Thus, the phagocytosis of yeast by mesenchymal
   cells beginning in the mid-gastrula stage in L. variegatus may indicate
   the moment of acquisition of `identity' (self) in this organism.
   Comparative aspects of embryo and adult phagocytes in L. variegatus are
   also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   outcomes. It is effective only when used in accordance with published
   standards and guidelines by professionals skilled in correct
   interpretation and when appropriate timely intervention is based on that
   interpretation. Interpretation and intervention are best accomplished as
   a collaborative perinatal team rather than individual activity. Only in
   these circumstances can EFM optimally contribute to fetal well-being and
   subsequent neonatal health. Risk management strategies to decrease
   potential liability ate presented that can be accomplished with careful
   planning and collaboration among perinatal team members.}},

   with preplant fluchloralin @ 1.0 kg/ha achieved excellent control of all
   major weeds and recorded the highest seed yield of 1 682 kg/ha with
   highest net return (Rs 12694 /ha). It was found to be marginally better
   than hand weeding twice in respect of seed yield. While Oxadiazon was
   found phytotoxic to the crop at both the levels, Pendimethalin and
   Isoproturon were found only slightly phytotoxic at 1.0 kg/ha.
   Pendimethalin @ 0.75 kg/ha achieving satisfactory weed control did not

   dependent on three parameters (pH, structure of the amphiphile and
   position of the connecting links on the imidazole moiety). These

Abstract = {{Study aim: The aim of this retrospective study was to report a series of
   12 cases of mature teratoma of the mediastinum operated during a 10-year
   period in the same center.
   Patients and method: From 1990 to 2000, 12 patients (7 females and 5
   males with a mean age of 32 years) were operated for mature mediastinal
   teratoma. Chest pain was present in 10 cases; cough, dyspnea and septic
   episodes were present in 5 cases and X-ray detected the mediastinal
   tumor in 10 cases. CT scan showed a tumor with liquid acid fatty
   components and calcifications in 5 out of 9 cases. Tumors were resected
   via a posterolateral thoracotomy in 11 cases and an anterior thoracotomy
   in one case, associated with pneumonectomy in 1 case, basal
   segmentectomy in 1 case and thymectomy in 1 case.
   Results: There were no postoperative deaths, Morbidity included 2
   phrenic nerve palsies, 1 pyothorax after pneumonectomy, 1 case of
   bleeding and 1 pleural effusion. No recurrences have been observed with
   a follow-up of 5 to 87 months. Nine of the 10 tumors reviewed by
   pathologist contained multiple tissue components and one only contained
   a single tissue.
   Conclusion: Mature teratomas are usually detected in young patients:
   they are usually located in the middle part of the anterior mediastinum
   and are only diagnosed by pathologic examination of the specimen, They
   have an excellent prognosis when tumor resection is complete and in the
   absence of immature tissue in the tumor. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques

Abstract = {{We have developed a Variant of functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) designed to be sensitive to static neuronal function. This method
   is based on resting instead of dynamic changes in oxygen-dependent
   signal and therefore allows for a spatial resolution that can detect
   signal from different hippocampal subregions in human subjects as well
   as in mice. We found that hippocampal signal was significantly
   diminished in elderly subjects with memory decline compared to
   age-matched controls, and different subjects showed dysfunction in
   different subregions. Among healthy elders, signal intensity from the
   subiculum was correlated selectively with memory performance. This
   method does not require an activation task; it can be used in
   anesthetized normal and in genetically modified and cognitively impaired
   mice. In mice the signal was found to be sufficiently sensitive to
   detect functional changes in the absence of underlying anatomical
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{Gastrin is a growth factor for colorectal cancer, and therefore,
   anti-gastrin hormone therapy has a potential role in treatment of this
   disease, The gastrin immunogen gastrin-17-diphtheria toroid (G17-DT;
   Gastrimmune) produces anti-G17 antibodies that have been shown to be
   effective in tbe treatment of colorectal carcinoma in preclinical
   models. Fifty patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated with
   G17-DT in a multicenter, sequential group, open label Phase I/II study.
   Primary injections with two booster doses were given by i.m. injection.
   The main aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the
   production of antigastrin antibodies. Locally developed and standard WHO
   toxicity measurements with RIA and Scatchard analysis for antibody
   assessment were used. One center measured tumor response radiologically.
   Eighty 96 of patients produced a measurable antibody response,
   Antibodies of high affinity (median K-d, 0.295 nM; interquartile range,
   0.16-0.41 nM) were detected between 4 and 12 weeks after primary
   injection. The antigen binding capacity was high at 2.8 X 10(-9) hi
   (interquartile range, 5.1 X 10(-10) to 7.25 X 10(-9) M). The treatment
   was well tolerated with no systemic side effects seen, Myalgia at the
   injection site was seen in 46\% of patients with severe pain caused by
   the formation of a sterile abscess seen in 14\% of patients, The
   abscesses were all drained under ultrasound guidance, and the patients
   recovered fully within 6 weeks. No radiological responses were seen, but
   two patients had stable disease, G17-DT immunization produces anti-G17
   antibodies in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The antibodies
   were of an affinity high enough to compete with the cholecystokinin
   B/gastrin receptor for G17 binding with adequate capacity to neutralize
   postprandial gastrin surges. Additional dose-ranging studies have been
   performed in patients with gastric cancer using 100- and 200-mug doses
   of G17-DT formulated without adjuvant and the emulsifier aluminum
   monostearate, In addition, the effect of immunizing at different time
   intervals has been determined.}},

Journal = {{GUT}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{820-824}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims-Gastrin and the cholecystokinin type B/gastrin
   receptor (CCKBR) have been shown to be expressed in colorectal
   adenocarcinoma. Both exogenous and autocrine gastrin have been
   demonstrated to stimulate growth of colorectal cancer but it is not
   known if gastrin affects the growth of colonic polyps. The purpose of
   this study was to determine if gastrin and CCKBR are expressed in human
   colonic polyps and to determine at which stage of progression this
   occurs.
   Methods-A range of human colonic polyps was assessed for gastrin and
   CCKBR gene and protein expression.
   Results-Normal colonic mucosa did not express gastrin or CCKBR. Gastrin
   and CCKBR reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction products were
   detected and verified by specific hybridisation with an oligo probe on
   Southern blots. Gastrin and CCKBR were expressed in 78\% and 81\% of
   polyps, respectively. Both genes were coexpressed in 97\% of eases.
   Immunohistochemistry identified progastrin in 91\%, glycine extended
   gastrin 17 in 80\%, and amidated gastrin 17 in only 47\% of polyps.
   CCKBR was present in 96\% of polyps. Expression of gastrin and CCKBR was
   seen in all histological types and sizes of polyps.
   Conclusions-This study is the first to show widespread expression of
   both gastrin and its receptor in colorectal polyps. Their activation
   occurs early in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Gastrin may promote
   progression through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.}},

Abstract = {{The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) is a powerful regulator of
   cellular proliferation and differentiation. The effects of RA on target
   gene expression are mediated by a family of ligand dependent nuclear
   transcription factors known as retinoic acid receptors (RAR), RARs have
   functional domains for retinoic acid binding, dimerization, and
   transactivation, RA response elements (RARE) found in the promoters of
   many genes consist of variable direct repeats of the sequence PuGGTCA
   spaced by five nucleotides (DR5), We have identified a novel DR5 element
   in the human ets-1 promoter. Mutational analysis of this site indicates
   that it is necessary for RA- and RAR-dependent activation of the ets-1
   promoter. RAR alpha can bind specifically to this site as determined by
   electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Finally, RA mediates induction
   of the human ets-1 gene at the mRNA and protein levels. These data
   suggest that induction of ets-1 expression by RA is mediated by a novel
   retinoic acid response element in the promoter region of this gene.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the hypothesis that distractibility is a
   characteristic sequela of mild closed head injury (MHI). The Minnesota
   Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) was used to study whether
   comorbid stress-related symptoms are associated with behavioral and
   electrophysiological indexes of attention. Event-related potentials
   (ERPs) and performance (reaction time, accuracy) were studied in
   patients with MHI (n = 20), patients with frontal lesions (n = 14), and
   healthy controls (n = 20) during a three-tone oddball task. Participants
   were instructed to detect rare target (2000 Hz) tones, and to withhold
   responding to equally rare distracter (500 Hz) tones and frequently
   occurring standard (1000 Hz) tones. All groups distinguished the two
   classes of deviants as indicated by the larger P3 amplitude to target
   relative to distracter tones. This indicates that the group with MHI was
   capable of differential allocation of attentional resources to target
   and non-target events. However, impaired performance and attenuated ERP
   amplitudes to both classes of deviants relative to patients with frontal
   lesions and controls, suggest limited availability, or expenditure of
   the resources needed for adequate task performance. In the group with
   MHI, both P3 amplitude acid reaction time (RT) were significantly
   related to subjectively reported distress. The difference in RT
   disappeared, whereas the P3 amplitude differences between the patient
   groups remained when adjusting for level of distress.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmons (SP's) are electromagnetic surface waves that propagate
   along the interface between conductors and dielectrics. The k vector of
   these waves is larger than the free-space wave vector. The importance of
   SP's Lies in the fact that they are extremely sensitive to small changes
   in the dielectric properties of substances that are in contact with the
   conductors. This property means that SP's have many sensor applications;
   however, when they are used in microscopic applications the lateral
   resolution is Limited to several micrometers. We discuss how this limit
   can be overcome by use of defocused high-numerical-aperture
   liquid-immersion objectives: We also present SP images that demonstrate
   a resolution comparable with that expected from high-numerical-aperture
   optical microscopes. Finally, we discuss how
   ultrahigh-numerical-aperture objectives with numerical apertures greater
   than 1.5 can be expected to have considerable influence on biological
   imaging. (C) 2000 Optical Society of America. OCIS codes: 110.0180,

Abstract = {{Docosahexaenoic acid {[}DHA, 22:6(n-3)], a major component of membrane
   phospholipids in brain and retina, is profoundly susceptible to
   oxidative stress in vitro. The extent of this peroxidation in organs
   when DHA is ingested in mammals, however, is not well elucidated. We
   investigated the effect of dietary DHA-containing oils (DHA 7.0-7.1
   mol/100 mol total fatty acids), in the form of triacylglycerols (TG),
   ethyl esters (EE) and phospholipids (PL), on tissue lipid metabolism and
   lipid peroxidation in rats. Groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were fed
   semipurified diets containing 15 g/100 g test oils and were compared
   with those fed 80\% palm oil and 20\% soybean oil as the control
   (unsupplemented group) for 3 wk. The DHA oil diets markedly increased (P
   < 0.05) the levels of DHA in the plasma, liver and kidney, 1.5-1.9,
   2.5-3.8 and 2.2-2.5 times the control values, respectively, whereas
   there was a concomitant reduction (P < 0.05) in arachidonic acid. All
   forms of DHA oil caused lower TG concentrations in plasma (P < 0.05) and
   liver (P < 0.05), but had no effect in kidney. The DHA oil-fed rats had
   greater phospholipid hydroperoxide accumulations in plasma (191-192\% of
   control rats), liver (170-230\%) and kidney (250-340\%), whereas the
   a-tocopherol level was reduced concomitantly (21-73\% of control rats).
   Consistent with these results, rats fed DHA-containing oils had more
   thiobarbituric reactive substances in these organs than the controls.
   Thus, high incorporation of (n-3) fatty acids (mainly DHA) into plasma
   and tissue lipids due to DHA-containing oil ingestion may undesirably
   affect tissues by enhancing susceptibility of membranes to lipid
   peroxidation and by disrupting the antioxidant system.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the empirical changes of conscription in
   Scandinavia since 1970 from four perspectives, i.e., the demography,
   economy, organization, and personnel that give Denmark, Sweden, and
   Norway a quite different conscription profile. No easy explanations are
   given for these changes which are products of complex and sometimes even
   contradictory decisions made at the national and organizational levels.
   Instead, the present conscription profiles of Denmark, and Sweden, and
   Norway are identified as one of three ideal reasons for using
   conscripts: Democracy, Deterrence, and Deployment abroad, the DDD-model.
   This theoretical model suggests both national and international reasons
   for the continuation of conscription and thus argues against reducing or
   abolishing conscription due to the end of the Cold War and relying,
   instead, on a professional army. In addition, conscripts may be better
   qualified for international peacekeeping missions than regulars because
   they can more easily identify with the local civil population. The
   announcement of the end of conscription as a result of the end of the
   Cold War, therefore, seems somewhat premature.}},

   which have become havens for frugivorous birds. Worldwide, olives have
   proved to be a successful invader of disturbed lands, with birds as the
   principal seed vectors. A proliferation of new olive orchards in the
   1990s and the effect of naturalisation on the size of olive drupes has
   the potential, with help from the avian fauna, to accelerate the

Abstract = {{A previously cloned cDNA from Helianthus annuus codes for a fusion
   protein composed of an N-terminal cytochrome b(5) and a C-terminal
   desaturase domain. For a functional identification, this cDNA was
   expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the structures of sphingolipid
   long-chain bases were analysed. The expression of this sunflower enzyme
   resulted in the formation of new Delta (8)-trans/cis-phytosphingenine
   from C-18- and C-20-phytosphinganine present in wild-type yeast cells.
   To elucidate the substrate specificity, the recently cloned Delta
   (8)-sphingolipid desaturases from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica
   napus were expressed in the yeast mutant sur2 Delta that lacked the
   sphinganine C-4-hydroxylase and was thus unable to form
   phytosphinganine. Long-chain base analysis of the transformed mutant
   cells did not show any conversion of C-18- or C-20-sphinganine into
   Delta (8)-sphingenine, whereas exogenously added C-18-phytosphinganine
   was desaturated to Delta (8)-trans/cis-phytosphingenine. Furthermore,
   GLC-MS analysis did not reveal the presence of any Delta
   (9)-regioisomers as reported before. These results show that the
   sunflower gene codes for a Delta (8)-sphingolipid desaturase which
   accepts C-18- and C-20-phytosphinganine. The absence of Delta
   (8)-sphingenine as desaturation product in the transformed mutant
   suggests that C-4-hydroxylation of sphinganine precedes Delta
   (8)-desaturation. Therefore, in yeast, the substrate for the plant Delta
   (8)-sphingolipid desaturase seems to be the phytosphinganine residue.}},

Abstract = {{Infection of the central nervous system by the ubiquitous fungi
   Aspergillus spp. is a life-threatening disease. Therefore we
   investigated the mechanism of brain damage by fungal infection. To
   examine whether secretory factors of Aspergillus isolates derived from
   patients can induce death of different brain cells, culture supernatants
   of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus terreus and
   Aspergillus niger were added to different astrocytes as well as to the
   neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH, and to the microglial cell line CHME.
   All four fungal species were shown to secrete toxic factors with neurons
   being most sensitive against these factors. Very low amounts and short
   incubation times are sufficient to induce irreversible cell damage,
   indicating that secreted factors might also affect distant brain
   regions. Further characterization of the toxic factors revealed that A.
   fumigatus and A. terreus produced small, heat-stable components whereas
   the toxic activity of A. niger filtrates was triggered by a high
   molecular mass factor which could be inactivated by heat. The active
   component of A. flavus had a molecular mass similar to that of A. niger
   but was heat-stable and had a significantly lower activity. Taken
   together these results indicate that secretion of different necrotizing
   factors might contribute to brain lesions in patients with cerebral
   aspergillosis. (C) 2000 Federation of European Microbiological

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken in order to characterize a Cryptosporidium
   muris-like parasite isolated from cattle in Hungary and to compare this
   strain with other Cryptosporidium species. To date, the large-type
   oocysts isolated from cattle were considered as C. muris described from
   several mammals. The size, form, and structure of the oocysts of the
   Hungarian strain were identical with those described by others from
   cattle. An apparent difference between the morphometric data of C.
   muris-like parasites isolated from cattle or other mammals was noted,
   which is similar in magnitude to the differences between Cryptosporidium
   meleagridis and Cryptosporidium felis or between Cryptosporidium
   serpentis and Cryptosporidium baileyi. The cross-transmission
   experiments confirmed the findings of others, as C. muris-like oocysts
   isolated from cattle fail to infect other mammals. The sequence of the
   variable region of small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene of the strain was 100\%
   identical with that of the U.S. Cryptosporidium andersoni and C.
   andersoni-like isolates from cattle. The difference between the SSU rRNA
   sequence of bovine strains and C. muris is similar in magnitude to the
   differences between C. meleagridis and Cryptosporidium parvum
   anthroponotic genotype or between Cryptosporidium wrairi and C. parvum
   zoonotic genotype. Our findings confirm that the Cryptosporidium species
   responsible for abomasal cryptosporidiosis and economic losses in the

Abstract = {{Localized wounding of one leaf in intact tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum
   Mill.) plants triggers rapid systemic transcriptional responses that
   might be involved in defense. To better understand the mechanism(s) of
   intercellular signal transmission in wounded tomatoes, and to identify
   the array of genes systemically up-regulated by wounding, a subtractive
   cDNA library for wounded tomato leaves was constructed. A novel cDNA
   clone (designated LebZIP1) encoding a DNA-binding protein was isolated
   and identified. This clone appears to be encoded by a single gene, and
   belongs to the family of basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP)
   transcription factors shown to be up-regulated by cold and dark
   treatments. Analysis of the mRNA levels suggests that the transcript for
   LebZIP1 is both organ-specific and up-regulated by wounding. In wounded
   wild-type tomatoes, the LebZIP1 mRNA levels in distant tissue were
   maximally up-regulated within only 5 min following localized wounding.
   Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) prevented the rapid wound-induced increase
   in LebZIP1 mRNA levels, while the basal levels of LebZIP1 transcripts
   were higher in the ABA mutants notabilis (not), sitiens (sit), and
   flacca (flc), and wound-induced increases were greater in the
   ABA-deficient mutants. Together, these results suggest that ABA acts to
   curtail the wound-induced synthesis of LebZIP1 mRNA.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of reliable detection systems for enantiomeric assays
   increases with the necessity of high throughput screening analysis of
   raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry. The utilization of
   electrochemical sensors in enantioselective analysis is an accurate and
   precise alternative to chromatographic techniques. The reliability of
   the response characteristics as well as of the analytical information
   obtained by using electrochemical sensors is strictly correlated with
   the design of the sensors. The designs evaluated for sensors have been
   based on PVC, imprinting polymers and carbon paste matrices. Among
   these, carbon paste sensors have been the most reliable and have been
   utilized for the construction of potentiometric, enantioselective
   membrane electrodes as well as for amperometric biosensors, and
   immunosensors. There are two ways to use the electrochemical sensors in
   enantioselective screening analysis: selective binding and catalyst
   selectivity. A molecule with a special chemical architecture is required
   for selective binding: a lock for a key. The high reliability of
   analytical information obtained using these sensors has made possible
   the automation of potentiometric and amperometric techniques by
   integration of enantioselective sensors as detectors in flow injection
   analysis and sequential injection analysis techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of DNA with various neutral pH, amine-based buffers has
   been analyzed by free solution capillary electrophoresis, using a
   mixture of a plasmid-sized DNA molecule and a small DNA oligonucleotide
   as the reporter system. The two DNAs migrate as separate, nearly
   Gaussian-shaped peaks in 20-80 mM TAE (TAE, Tris-acetate-EDTA; Tris,
   tris{[}hydroxymethyl]aminomethane) buffer. The separation between the
   peaks gradually increases with increasing TAE buffer concentration
   because of differences in solvent friction between large and small DNA
   molecules. The two DNAs form complexes with the borate ions in TEE
   (Tris-borate-EDTA) buffer, with mobilities that depend on the DNA/borate
   ratio. In 45 mM TEE buffer, the two DNAs comigrate as a single sharp
   peak, with a mobility that is faster than either of the constituent DNAs
   in the same buffer. Hence, the mixed DNA-borate complex is stabilized by
   the binding of additional borate ions, possibly forming bridges between
   the different DNAs. The mixed DNA-borate complex is gradually
   dissociated into its component DNAs by increasing the TEE concentration,
   possibly because the borate binding sites become saturated at high
   buffer concentrations. Other neutral pH, amine-based buffers, such as
   Mops (N-{[}N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid), Hepes
   (N'-{[}2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine,N'-{[}2-ethanesulfonic acid]), Bes
   (N,N-bis{[}2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), Tes
   (N-tris{[}hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), and tricine
   (N-tris{[}hydroxymethyl]methylglycine) also form complexes with DNA,
   giving distorted peaks in the electropherograms. The combined results
   indicate that borate buffers and most neutral pH, amine-based buffers
   interact with DNA. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Bolus infusion of of 7.5\% NaCl/6\% dextran-70 (HSD-B) improves outcome
   from controlled hemorrhage. In contrast, HSD-B during uncontrolled
   hemorrhage increases bleeding and short-term mortality. The purpose of
   this study was to compare the effects of bolus vs. slow infusion of HSD
   in a near-fatal vascular injury hemorrhage model. Sixteen (15-20 kg)
   swine with 4-mm aortic tears were hemorrhaged to a pulse pressure of 5
   mmHg. An ultrasonic flow probe was placed proximal to the aortic tear
   for continuous blood flow (AF) measurements. Group I (slow infusion; n =
   8) was resuscitated with 8 mL/kg of HSD at 0.4 mL/kg/min. Group II
   (bolus infusion; n = 8) was resuscitated with 8 mL/kg of HSD at 1.33
   mL/kg/min. In both groups, HSD infusion was followed by administration
   of 30 mL/kg of shed blood at 3 mL/kg/min. Hemorrhage volume and 90-min
   mortality were greater in group II (79 +/- 11 mL/kg; 75\%) compared with
   group I (43 +/- 9 mL/kg; 12.5\%) (P-Hem < 0.001; P-Mort = 0.04). Mean
   arterial pressure (MAP) and AF were greater in group II compared with
   group I during the first 15 min of resuscitation. In group I, MAP, AF,
   cardiac indices, and O-2 delivery gradually returned to baseline levels
   and were significantly greater than group II at 30 min and throughout
   the remainder of the protocol. In this model of near-lethal uncontrolled
   hemorrhage, slow infusion of HSD restored cardiodynamics while
   minimizing hemorrhage volume and mortality. Resuscitation regimens that
   cause early increases in blood flow and pressure may result in greater
   hemorrhage and mortality than those regimens that yield comparable flow
   and pressure increases late in resuscitation.}},

Abstract = {{Hypothyroidism in children causes developmental abnormalities in bone
   and growth arrest, while thyrotoxicosis accelerates growth rate and
   advances bone age, To determine the effects of thyroid hormones on
   endochondral bone formation, we examined epiphyseal growth plates in
   control, hypothyroid, thyrotoxic, and hypothyroid-thyroxine
   (hypo-T-4)-treated rats. Hypothyroid growth plates were grossly
   disorganized, contained an abnormal matrix rich in heparan sulfate, and
   hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation failed to progress. These
   effects correlated with the absence of collagen X expression and
   increased parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) messenger RNA
   (mRNA) expression. In thyrotoxic growth plates, histology essentially
   was normal but PTHrP receptor (PTHrP-R) mRNA was undetectable. PTHrP is
   a potent inhibitor of hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation that acts
   in a negative feedback loop with the secreted factor Indian hedgehog
   (Ihh) to regulate endochondral bone formation. Thyroid hormone receptor
   alpha1(TR alpha1), TR alpha2, and TR beta1 proteins were localized to
   reserve zone progenitor cells and proliferating chondrocytes in
   euthyroid rat cartilage; regions in which PTHrP and PTHrP-R expression
   were affected by thyroid status. Thus, dysregulated Ihh/PTHrP feedback
   loop activity may be a key mechanism that underlies growth disorders in
   childhood thyroid disease.}},

   prototype integrates a low-IF receiver (low noise amplifier, I/Q mixers,

   pre-amplifier) on a single die together with a complete phase-locked
   loop, including a 64/79 prescaler, a fully integrated loop filter, and a
   quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator with on-chip inductors, Design
   trade-offs have been made over the boundaries of the different building
   blocks to optimize the overall system performance. All building blocks
   feature circuit topologies that enable comfortable operation at low
   voltage, As a result, the IC operates from a power supply of only 2
   V,while consuming 191 mW in receiver (RX) mode and 160 mW in transmitter
   (TX) mode. To build a complete transceiver system for 1.8-GHz cellular
   communication, only an antenna, an antenna filter, a power amplifier,
   and a digital baseband chip must be added to the analog front-end. This

Abstract = {{Attempts to correlate radiation-induced microstructural changes with
   changes in mechanical properties rely on a well-established theory to
   compute the resolved shear stress required to move dislocations through
   a field of obstacles. However, this microstructure-based shear stress
   must be converted to an equivalent uniaxial tensile stress in order to
   make comparisons with mechanical property measurements. A review of the
   radiation effects literature indicates that there is some confusion
   regarding the choice of this conversion factor for polycrystalline
   specimens. Some authors have used values of 1.73 and 2.0, based on an
   inappropriate application of the von Mises and Tresca yield criteria,
   respectively. The basic models pertinent to this area of research are
   reviewed, and it is concluded that the Taylor factor with a Value of
   3.06 is the correct parameter to apply in such work. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Assessing goodness of fit of item response theory models typically
   involves evaluating differences between observed and expected score
   response distributions using a chi-square test statistic. When these
   methods are applied to assessments that art shorter in length,
   uncertainty with which ability is estimated greatly affects the
   approximation to the null chi-square distribution. Results from a Monte
   Carlo study indicated serious departures between null theoretical
   distributions and empirically derived sampling distributions for the
   chi-square statistic for tests with 8 and 16 constructed response items.
   This article also describes a fit statistic that attempts to account for
   the uncertainty in estimating ability and that could therefore be
   applied to testing situations in which ability is not precisely
   estimated. This method employs more information from the same
   distribution used to obtain Bayesian point estimates of ability and
   reflects probabilities that examinees have ability equal to a range of
   values rather than restricting expectations to single values.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need to develop sustainable nitrogen(N) management systems
   that minimize environmental losses by maximizing the use efficiency of
   applied fertilizers, particularly with wide-row annual crops that are
   often poor at utilizing N A key approach is to match nitrogen supply
   with crop demand using improved methods of fertilizer application and
   timing. One technique is to target liquid `starter' fertilizers close to
   the seed, or around the roots of transplants, and to omit or reduce
   conventional broadcast applications. This paper examines the effects of
   starter fertilizer combined with various rates of seedbed and/or
   top-dressed N on the growth and yield of bulb onion (Allium cepa L.),
   crisp lettuce (Lactuca sativa L), forage maize (Zea mays Bonaf) and
   sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.). Starter fertilizer improved early growth
   and, in combination with reduced rates of supplementary N, gave yields
   comparable with higher rates of base N with each crop, except sugarbeet.
   The use of top-dressed N was as effective as base N in supplementing
   starter fertilizer and had the benefit that it allowed a top-dressing
   requirement to be estimated accurately using a simple nitrogen balance
   equation. These results, taken with earlier work, show that starter
   fertilizers offer clear opportunities for reducing N inputs, while
   maintaining yield and quality of these crops.}},

   (1989) as a tribute to her mothers and a celebration of ``the female

   drafts show that she used ``Dance on the Earth{''} as the title of a
   novel she attempted to write before giving it to her memoir. While the
   draft novel parallels the memoir in more ways than its title, it
   resembles The Diviners even more closely. Why was Laurence so determined
   to compose ``Dance on the Earth{''} as a novel, and why was she unable
   to complete it? An answer to both questions may lie in the censorship
   controversies of 1976 and 1985, when her Manawaka novels, especially The
   Diviners, were attacked as pornographic. When she was unable to complete
   her last novel, Laurence turned to the memoir form to convey her legacy
   to her inheritors.}},

Abstract = {{The CNS modulates immune cells by direct synaptic-like contacts in the
   brain and at peripheral sites, such as lymphoid organs. To study the
   nerve-macrophage communication, a superfusion method was used to
   investigate cotransmission of neuropeptide Y (NPY) with norepinephrine
   (NE), with interleukin (IL)-6 secretion used as the macrophage read-out
   parameter. Spleen tissue slices spontaneously released NE, NPY, and IL-6
   leading to a superfusate concentration at 3-4 h of 1 nM, 10 pM, and 120
   pg/ml, respectively. Under these conditions, NPY dose-dependently
   inhibited IL-6 secretion with a maximum effect at 10(-10) M (p = 0.012)
   and 10(-9) M (p < 0.001). Simultaneous addition of NPY at 10(-9) M and
   the <alpha>2-adrenergic agonist p-aminoclonidine further inhibited IL-6
   secretion (p < 0.05). However, simultaneous administration of NPY at
   10(-9) M and the <beta>-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol at 10(-6) M Or
   NE at 10(-6) M significantly increased IL-6 secretion (p < 0.005). To
   objectify these differential effects of NPY, electrical field
   stimulation of spleen slices was applied to release endogenous NPY and
   NE. Electrical field stimulation markedly reduced IL-6 secretion, which
   was attenuated by the NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP 3226 (10(-7) M, p
   = 0.039; 10(-8) M, p = 0.035). This indicates that NPY increases the
   inhibitory effect of endogenous NE, which is mediated at low NE
   concentrations via <alpha>-adrenoceptors. Blockade of alpha
   -adrenoceptors attenuated electrically induced inhibition of IL-6
   secretion (p < 0.001), which was dose-dependently abrogated by BIBP
   3226. This indicates that under blockade of <alpha>-adrenoceptors
   endogenous NPY supports the stimulating effect of endogenous NE via beta
   -adrenoceptors. These experiments demonstrate the ambiguity of NPY,
   which functions as a cotransmitter of NE in the nerve-macrophage
   interplay.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To assess the outcomes of the Agency for Healthcare Research
   and Quality's (AHRQ formerly the Agency for Health Care Policy and
   Research, AHCPR) first decade of focus on outcomes and effectiveness
   research (OER) and to identify needs and opportunities for the study of
   OER in the coming years.
   Data Source. Study findings were collected in response to an inquiry by
   the Center for Outcomes and Effectiveness Research at AHRQ in July 1997
   to all principal investigators (PIs) funded between 1989 and 1997. The
   request was for investigators to identify their ``most salient
   findings{''} and supply material for up to three slides.
   Study Design. A taxonomy of 11 non-mutually exclusive categories was
   used to group the investigators' salient findings by characteristics of
   methodology or purpose. Two health services researchers assigned
   findings to up to three categories for each discrete study.
   Principal Findings. Responses were received from 61 (64 percent) of the
   91 PIs, reporting on 115 studies. Of the 246 category assignments made,
   descriptive epidemiology was the most common (24 percent), followed by
   comparative effectiveness (17 percent) and economic assessments (12
   percent). Most studies were retrospective analyses of administrative
   data. Viewed within a conceptual framework for assessing the impact of
   research, OER has built a solid foundation for future quality
   improvement efforts by identifying problems, generating hypotheses, and
   developing new methodologies and has had limited impact on health care
   policies, practices and outcomes.
   Conclusions. OER has had moderate but significant success meeting
   initial expectations for the field. Challenges for the next generation
   of OER include advancing from hypothesis generation to definitive
   studies of effectiveness, and acceleration of the process by which
   findings effect policy, practice, and outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an inflammatory subepidermal
   blistering disease associated with autoantibodies that recognize
   hemidesmosomal proteins. In addition to autoantibodies, the
   cell-mediated immune reaction is considered to play an important part in
   blister formation.
   Objectives To investigate some T-cell activation markers and
   inflammatory cytokines in the blister fluid and sera of patients with
   BP.
   Methods We measured soluble CD4 (sCD4) and soluble CD8 (sCD8), which
   have been, respectively, associated with CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation.
   Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were also used to quantify the
   production of the leucocyte chemoattractant interleukin (IL) -8 and of
   the cytokines IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10 and tumour necrosis
   factor-alpha, in the blister fluid and sera of 11 patients with BP.
   Results The mean +/- SD level of sCD4 in patients' blisters (42.4 +/-
   25.0 units mL(-1)) was significantly elevated (P < 0.005) compared with
   that in their sera (11.2 +/- 8.9) and that in the suction blisters of 10
   healthy people (11.4 +/- 5.4; P < 0.005). Mean +/- SD IL-8
   concentrations in BP blisters (4683.6 +/- 3878.1 pg mL(-1)) were much
   higher than those in their sera (17.1 +/- 18.9; P < 0.001), and were
   very significantly elevated (P < 0.005) in comparison with those in
   suction blisters of healthy persons (512 +/- 292). sCD4 levels in BP
   blisters were inversely related to IL-10 levers (P = 0.03, r(2) = 0.85),
   IL-8 levels were positively related to sCD8 levels (P = 0.01, r(2) =
   0.54), and IL-1 beta levels were positively related to sCD8
   concentrations (P < 0.005, r(2) = 0.65).
   Conclusions The correlations suggest that there is a delicately
   orchestrated network of cytokines and cell-mediated immunity operating
   in BP blisters.}},

Abstract = {{We apply statistical mechanical principles to derive simple expressions
   relating the hydrogen bond thermodynamic properties to the static
   dielectric constant of water. The approach followed by us was to develop
   an expression for the Kirkwood's structure factor (g) of water, taking
   into account the dipolar correlations between a central molecule and
   H-bonded neighbors present in infinite number of shells surrounding the
   central molecule. The number of H-bonded neighbors in a specific shell
   was related to the probability P for the various donor/acceptor sites of
   any given water molecule to be associated. Neglecting cooperativity
   effects, we evaluated P by focusing only on the correct counting of
   Ii-bonds formed between various association sites rather than on the
   oligomer distribution. The theory yielded an extremely simple expression
   for the structure factor (g) of the fluid at any given temperature in
   terms of the enthalpy (H) and entropy (S) changes associated with bond
   formation. The proposed theory was then combined with the
   Kirkwood-Frohlich theory for evaluating the dielectric constant (Eg) We
   have demonstrated that the theory correctly predicts the dielectric
   constant of ice-I without the use of any adjustable parameters. We have
   then deduced estimates for H-bund thermodynamic properties (H = -5.58
   kcal/mole of H-bonds; S = -8.89cal/deg.mole of H-bonds) by fitting the
   theoretical results for Eo of liquid water to available experimental
   data over temperatures ranging from 0 degreesC to the critical point of
   water. The error in the theoretical values was found to be within 1 \%
   of the corresponding experimental values over the entire range of
   temperatures studied. To further test the theory, we have demonstrated
   that the temperature variation of the average number of H-bonds per
   water molecule, calculated using the proposed theory with the above
   mentioned values for H and S, compares quite well with those estimated
   from various available spectroscopic and molecular simulation studies.

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted in water and wind tunnels on spheres in the
   Reynolds number range 6 x 10(3) to 6.5 x 10(5) to study the effect of
   natural ventilation on the boundary layer separation and near-wake
   Vortex shedding characteristics. In the subcritical range of Re (<2 x
   10(5)), ventilation caused a marginal downstream shift in the location
   of laminar boundary layer separation; there was only a small change in
   the vortex shedding frequency. In the supercritical range (Re > 4 x
   10(5)), ventilation caused a downstream shift in the mean locations of
   boundary layer separation and reattachment; these lines showed
   significant axisymmetry in the presence of venting. No distinct vortex
   shedding frequency was found. Instead, a dramatic reduction occurred in
   the wake unsteadiness at all frequencies. The reduction of wake
   unsteadiness is consistent with the reduction in total drag already
   reported. Based on the present results and those reported earlier, the
   effects of natural ventilation on the flow past a sphere can be
   categorized in two broad regimes, viz., weak and strong interaction
   regimes. In the weak interaction regime (subcritical Re), the broad
   features of the basic sphere are largely unaltered despite the large
   addition of mass in the near wake. Strong interaction is promoted by the
   closer proximity of the inner and outer shear layers at supercritical
   Re. This results in a modified and steady near-wake flow, characterized
   by reduced unsteadiness and small drag.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: DSM-IV specifies that Asperger's disorder is a type of
   pervasive developmental disorder without clinically significant
   cognitive or language delay. There are no data, however, on the outcome
   of children with Asperger's disorder or on whether their outcome differs
   from that of children with autism. The objectives of this study were to
   compare the outcome of groups of children with these disorders over a
   period of 2 yea rs on variables independent of the defining criteria and
   to identify variables that might account for these differences.
   Method: All children 4-6 years of age who came for assessment or were
   currently in treatment at a pervasive developmental disorder service of
   one of several centers in a large geographic region were identified.
   Children who received a diagnosis of autism (N=46) or Asperger's
   syndrome (N=20) on the basis of a diagnostic interview and had an IQ in
   the nonretarded range were given a battery of cognitive, language, and
   behavioral tests. Families were contacted roughly 2 yea rs after the
   date of their enrollment in the study, and many of the tests were
   readministered.
   Results: Children with Asperger's syndrome had better social skills and
   fewer autistic symptoms 2 years after study enrollment than the children
   with autism. The differences in outcome could not be explained by
   initial differences in IQ and language abilities. Children with autism
   who had developed verbal fluency at follow-up were very similar to the
   children with Asperger's syndrome at study enrollment.
   Conclusions: Although the exact mechanism for the differences in outcome
   remain to be determined, it appears that Asperger's disorder and autism
   represent parallel but potentially overlapping developmental

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the in vivo morphology of epithelial changes in
   acute herpes tester keratitis.
   Methods: 10 patients with acute disease. In 7, systemic acyclovir
   treatment was started at presentation, in 2 less than or equal to 24
   hours before, 1 was not treated. The corneae were examined with the slit
   lamp, followed intermittently for 3-30 days, and photographed at
   intervals ranging between 1 to 7 days,
   Results: All but one patient had epithelial changes at presentation; all
   developed new ones. The smallest discernible entities were abnormal
   cells of about 10-15 mum in diameter, singular or grouped. Larger foci
   measured about 100-200 mum. 2 patients showed pseudodendrites at
   presentation, and further 3/9 observed greater than or equal to2 weeks
   developed them. Some lesions showed white surface plaques. No
   ulcerations were observed. Healing occurred less than or equal to 10-22
   days after the onset of symptoms.
   Conclusions: The study seemed to have followed the natural course of the
   disease,The rapidly changing morphology in the absence of ulcerative
   features indicated successive damage counteracted by reparative forces.}},

Abstract = {{Dodder (Cuscuta japonica), a holoparasitic angiosperm, develops
   haustoria that are essential for parasitism. We have previously
   demonstrated that in Cuscuta seedlings, haustorial formation could be
   induced efficiently by cooperative effects of far-red light and tactile
   stimuli in the absence of any host plant {[}Tada et al, (1996) Plant
   Cell Physiol. 37: 1049], In this study, we performed differential
   display and isolated several cDNAs that were expressed differentially
   during haustorium development in the seedlings. Sequence similarities
   identified one of them as a gene encoding a 17-kDa low-molecular-weight
   heat shock protein (CJHSP17), Northern blot analysis revealed that
   CJHSP17 mRNAs constitutively accumulated in the seedlings in the absence
   of environmental stress, and that the transcripts dramatically decreased
   to undetectable levels prior to emergence of haustoria upon irradiation
   with far-red light in the presence of tactile stimuli. When treated with
   either of the two stimuli, the CJHSP17 transcript levels did not
   decrease and there was no differentiation of haustoria, Moreover,
   irradiation of red light immediately after far-red light completely
   repressed both the decrease of mRNAs and the subsequent formation of
   haustoria, These observations suggest the involvement of down-regulation
   of CJHSP17 in haustorium development in Cuscuta seedlings.}},

Abstract = {{A vinyl siloxane-modified cresol novolac epoxy (CNE)/cresol novolac
   hardener (CNH) molding compound with both siloxane and epoxy components
   capable of further crosslinking is synthesized. Through careful
   adjustment of TPP dosage, the Tg of CNE/CNH resins can be effectively
   controlled. The VS-modified CNE/CNH compound possesses a lower Young's
   modulus, a lower linear coefficient of thermal expansion (LCTE), and a
   higher break strain than those of its unmodified counterpart. The
   combination of lower mechanical moduli and lower LCTE results in a 33\%
   reduction in thermal stress caused by thermal mismatch. In addition to
   thermal mismatch, chemical shrinkage in a molding process is also an
   important factor that affects the interfacial strain between a compound
   and a substrate. The incorporation of vinyl siloxane (VS) incurs a 25\%
   reduction in the equilibrium moisture uptake and a 16\% reduction in the
   coefficient of diffusion for the VS-modified compound. This modified
   compound can help alleviate the popcorning problems in IC packages
   resulting from hygrothermal stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Some cytokines are believed to play a role in the development of acute

   polymorphisms affect the severity of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD
   (cGVHD). Sixty-two and 54 patients were available for the analysis of
   aGVHD and cGVHD, respectively. We analyzed the gene polymorphisms
   derived from pre- and post-transplant blood cells, Donor-derived TNF2
   allele (A) was more frequently detected in patients with aGVHD III/IV
   than those aGVHD 0-11 (2/6 vs 2/56) (P = 0.04). The donors of the

Abstract = {{The effect of arsenite or nickel on the repair of DNA double-strand
   breaks (DSBs) was studied in gamma -irradiated Chinese hamster ovary
   cells using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, After treatment with
   nickel chloride or arsenite for 2 h, cells were irradiated with gamma
   rays at a dose of 40 Gy, and the numbers of DNA DSBs were measured
   immediately after irradiation as well as at 30 min postirradiation. Both
   arsenite and nickel(II) inhibited repair of DNA DSBs in a
   concentration-dependent manner; 0.08 mM arsenite significantly inhibited
   the rejoining of DSBs, while 76 mM nickel was necessary to observe a
   clear inhibition. The mean lethal concentrations for the arsenite and
   nickel(II) treatments were approximately 0.12 and 13 mM, respectively.
   This indicates that the inhibition of repair by arsenite occurred at a
   concentration at which appreciable cell survival occurred, but that
   nickel(II) inhibited repair only at cytotoxic concentrations at which
   the cells lost their proliferative ability. These novel observations
   provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the effects of combined

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The molecular behavior of water in normal and regenerating tendons was
   analyzed using the transverse relaxation time (T-2) measured by
   spin-echo proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) spectroscopy at
   2.34 T (25 degreesC). A section of the Achilles tendon was dissected
   from an anesthetized Japanese white rabbit, and its longitudinal axis
   was oriented at 0, 35, 54.7, 75, and 90 degrees to the static magnetic
   field. In the normal tendon, the T-2 relaxation of water presented
   biexponential relaxation and anisotropy in both the long T-2 (5.41 to
   6.21 ms) and short T-2 (0.41 to 1.43ms) components, in which the
   greatest values were obtained at 54.7 degrees. However, the range of the
   anisotropy was much narrower than we expected from the H-1 dipolar
   interaction of water bound to the collagen fibers in the tendon. The
   apparent fractions of water proton density also varied with orientation:
   the fraction of the longer T-2 components was at its maximum at 54.7
   degrees. These results suggest that a simple two-compartment model could
   not be applicable to orientational dependency of the T-2 value of the
   tendon, and the well ordered water in the short T-2 relaxation component
   may show an elongated T-2 relaxation time that falls in the range of the
   long T-2 relaxation component at 54.7 degrees. This hypothesis can
   explain both the narrower range of the T-2 relaxation time and the
   orientational dependency on the apparent fraction of H-1 density.
   Regenerating processes of the Achilles tendon were followed for 18 weeks
   by analyzing the T-2 relaxation time. There is only a long T-2
   relaxation time component (21.8 to 28.0 ms) up to 3 weeks after
   transection. Biexponential relaxation is revealed at 6 weeks and
   thereafter, whereby (i) the T-2 relaxation times become shorter, (ii)
   there is anisotropy in the short and long T-2 values, and (iii) the
   orientational dependency of the apparent fraction of water proton
   density becomes evident with maturation of the regenerating tendon. From
   these results, the H-1 T-2 relaxation time of water might be used to
   monitor the healing process of collagen structures of the tendon
   non-invasively.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular retinol-binding protein, type II (CRBPII) is abundantly
   expressed in the small intestinal epithelial cells and plays a pivotal
   role in intestinal absorption and metabolism of retinol and beta
   -carotene. In the 5'-flanking region of rat CRBPII gene, two DR-1 type
   elements which consist of a direct repeat of the AGGTCA-like motif
   spaced by a single nucleotide have been identified as putative binding
   sites for a heterodimer of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
   (PPAR) and retinoid X-receptor (RXR). We found that CRBPII levels were
   elevated in the residual jejunal segment of rats subjected to jejunal
   bypass operation, where a concomitant increase in the apoprotein B
   levels occurred. This result suggested that CRBPII expression was
   enhanced by a condition where fat absorption was stimulated. Indeed,
   dietary fat (especially unsaturated fatty acids) has been shown to
   induce CRBPII gene expression in the jejunum. Nuclear ran-on assays
   revealed that this increase of CRBPII mRNA levels by a high-fat diet was
   the result of the induction of the gene transcription through the rise
   in PPAR alpha expression level as well as the increase in its ligand
   levels. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the DR-1 type
   cis-elements of CRBP II gene showed that PPAR alpha -RXR alpha
   heterodimer was capable of binding to these elements, and that nuclear
   extracts from the jejunum of rats fed the high-fat diet gave greater
   density of retarded bands than those of rats fed a fat-free diet. We
   also found that the expression of PPAR delta was rather reduced by
   dietary fat. Thus, CRBPII gene expression is regulated predominantly by
   dietary fatty acids.}},

Abstract = {{Intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) produces clinical

   factor or prognostic indicator for intestinal GVHD, The pre-conditioning
   leukotoriene B4 level,vas significantly related to the grade of
   intestinal GVHD in 32 patients (P < 0,01), Compared with patients who
   did not develop severe intestinal GVHD after bone marrow
   transplantation, those who did had significantly higher interleukin-2

Abstract = {{Objectives: We describe and evaluate our approach to combined
   nephrectomy and augmentation ureterocystoplasty using a single
   paramedian extraperitoneal incision,
   Patients and Methods: Th ree patients with neurogenic bladders (2
   posterior urethral valves and 1 myelodysplasia) underwent nephrectomy
   and augmentation ureterocystoplasty. The mean age of the patients was
   4.6 +/- 1.5 years, The indications for the procedure included control of
   urinary incontinence or preservation and stabilization of renal
   function,
   Results: The integrity of the peritoneal cavity was easily preserved
   throughout the procedure using a paramedian incision, No complications
   were encountered in these patients, Early post operative resumption of
   normal diet and activity was noted in all patients,
   Conclusion: The paramedian extraperitoneal approach through a single
   incision provides the advantages seen with other extraperitoneal
   techniques combining two incisions, The single paramedian incision has
   the potential to save on operative time and obviates the need to change
   the patient's position on the operating table while under anesthesia,
   Furthermore, the paramedian extraperitoneal approach provides the
   reconstructive surgeon with the chance to convert the procedure into a
   transperitoneal technique to incorporate bowel segments in order to
   complement ureterocystoplasty, Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic commerce is doing business via electronic networks.
   Paper-based trade documents such as, for example, request for quotation,
   purchase order or invoice are replaced by electronic messages, in
   particular Electronic Data interchange (EDI) messages. These electronic
   messages are not only transmitted much faster than paper-based
   documents, but they can also be processed automatically by computers. An
   example of this automated processing of electronic messages is
   electronic contracting and negotiation where the actual trade contract
   is on-line negotiated and concluded via an electronic network. We
   present the legal expert system INCAS that can provide on-line
   explanations about the use of Incoterms in trade contracts. Incoterms
   stipulate which party (buyer or seller) is responsible for arranging and
   paying transport of the goods, and arranging the documents necessary for
   this transport (e.g. export and import clearance documents,
   certification of origin, quality certificates etc.). INCAS is
   implemented in the programming language Prolog. We also explain how the
   defeasible reasoning capability of Prolog is essential for modelling the
   reasoning about the Incoterms. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The present paper proposes a basic formulation for the static bending
   problem of beam-stiffened elastic plates. This problem has been so far
   analyzed using the Timoshenko theory in which the equivalent shear force
   and bending moments are assumed to act on the beam stiffener. Since
   fourth-order derivatives of unknown displacements are included in the
   formulation, in its numerical implementation fourth-order polynomials
   must be used as the interpolation functions.
   In this paper, the interactive forces and moments between the plate and
   the stiffener are treated as line distributed unknown loads. In the
   numerical implementation of the formulation, these forces can be
   approximated using a suitable family of interpolation functions. The
   formulation is presented in detail and a computer code is developed. The
   numerical results obtained by the computer code are discussed, whereby
   the usefulness of the proposed solution procedure is demonstrated. (C)

Abstract = {{Budgets and dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus in Lake Donghu were
   investigated from Oct. 1997 to Sept. 1999. The water residence time was
   estimated to be 89 days in 1997-1998 and 124 days in 1998-1999. The
   total external loadings were 53 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and 3.2 g P m(-2)
   yr(-1) in 1997-1998, and 42 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and 3.1 g P m(-2) yr(-1) in
   1998-1999. On average, about 80\% of nitrogen and phosphorus input was
   from sewage outlets, while the rest was from land runoff and
   precipitation. Ammonium ion was the most abundant form of inorganic
   nitrogen in the sewage. The nutrient output was mainly through water
   outflow and fish catch. The percentages of nutrients in fish were
   estimated to be 7.8\%-11.2\% for nitrogen and 47.6\%- 49.6\% for
   phosphorus. Lake Donghu has a very high nutrient retention (63\% for
   nitrogen and 79\% for phosphorus) mainly due to its closure and long
   water residence time. Sedimentation is an important nutrient retention
   mechanism in this lake. Using mass balance method, we estimated that
   denitrification of Lake Donghu involves about 50\% of the retained
   nitrogen. Lake Donghu is rich in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and
   showed great seasonal variation.}},

Abstract = {{Methyl isobutyl ketone(MIBK) is widely used as extraction agent in
   hydrometallurgy. As it has a definite solubility in water, so when using
   MIBK as extraction agent, there will be MIBK in stripping solutions
   inevitably, which not only pollutes working conditions, but also affects
   the quality of ultimate product. In order to remove MIBK from aqueous
   solutions, the means of flat vacuum membrane distillation(VMD) is
   studied in the paper. The area of the membrane used in the study is 0.02
   m(2), the initial volume of feed is 2 L, each experiment was conducted
   over a time period of 60-120 min. The influences oh the factors such as
   temperature(34.8-55.0 degreesC); pressure in the permeate
   side(10.67-14.67 kPa) and feed now rate(27.8-69.4 mL/s) were
   experimentally studied. Increasing the temperature or reducing the
   pressure in the permeate side results in a faster removal of MIBK;
   however there is a decrease in removal factor beta, increasing the feed
   flow rate results in a faster removal of MIBK and an increase of removal
   factor beta, especially in the range of lower now rate. The study
   indicates that the aim of MIBK removal and recycle from dilute aqueous
   solutions can be achieved by VMD.}},

   neuroblastoma (NB). When combined with TrkA expression, the expression
   of EPHB6, EFNB2, or EFNB3 predicts more accurately the disease outcome
   than each of the four variables alone. Procedure. Cox regression and
   Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess the prognostic significance of
   EPHBG, EFNB2, EFNB3, and TrkA expressions in NB without MYCN
   amplification. Results. High-level expression of EFNB3 or TrkA predicted

   found in the general NB population, EPHB6, EFNB2, or EFNB3 expression in
   combination with TrkA expression was significantly predictive of the

Abstract = {{. We present a remote sensing based vegetation mapping technique well
   suited to a heterogeneous, semi-arid environment. 10 structural
   vegetation classes were identified and described on the ground. Using
   Landsat-TM from two different seasons and a combination of three
   conventional classification techniques (including a multi-temporal
   classification) we were unsuccessful in delineating all of the desired
   vegetation classes. We then employed a simple tex-tural classification
   index, known as the Moving Standard Deviation Index (MSDI), that has
   been used to map degradation status. MSDI measures spatial variations in
   the landscape and is calculated by passing a 3 x 3 standard deviation
   filter across the Landsat-TM red band. High MSDI values are associated
   with degraded or disturbed rangelands whilst low MSDI values are
   associated with undisturbed rangeland. A combination of two conventional
   multi-spectral techniques and MSDI were used to produce a final
   vegetation classification at an accuracy of 84 \%. MSDI successfully
   discriminated between two contrasting vegetation types of identical
   spectral properties and significantly strengthened the accuracy of the
   classification. We recommend the use of a tex-tural index such as MSDI
   to supplement conventional vegetation classification techniques in
   heterogeneous, semi-arid or arid environments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of the Kersten function (Ke), which
   depends on soil temperature and the degree of saturation. The new
   Kersten function enables the prediction of thermal conductivities of
   moist soils also including high temperatures. The eight soils used in
   this paper represent three distinct textural groups, each having a
   comparable shape of Kersten function. The soil thermal conductivity is
   obtained from a linear interpolation between the dryness and saturation
   states with the Ke as the slope. The new Kersten function is valid when
   the degree of saturation (S-r) is greater than 0.125 and soil
   temperature is between 30 and 90 degreesC. At a lower degree of
   saturation (i.e. 0 < S-r < 0.125); a linear approximation is applied to
   Ke. The new Ke function gives particularly good agreement with
   experimental data for temperatures of 30 and 50 degreesC and for low
   moisture contents at all temperatures. At higher temperatures (i.e. 70
   and 90 degreesC) and moisture contents above the permanent wilting
   point, generally good or acceptable results were obtained. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Background Few researchers have conducted heart rate (HR) studies: in
   healthy very elderly subjects aged 70 years or older. and there are no
   longitudinal follow-up studies in this population. The objective of this
   study was to evaluate long-term changes in HR and heart rate variability
   (HRV) with aging in healthy elderly parsons by means of comparison
   between two Holter monitor recordings obtained at an interval of 15
   years.
   Methods. The study population consisted of 15 healthy elderly persons(10
   women and 5 men) aged 64 to 80 years (mean 70 +/- 4.1) at the first
   recording, and 79 to 95 years old (mean 85 +/- 4.1 years) at the second
   recording 15 years later. Nighttime (midnight to 5 Ar) and daytime (noon
   to 5 PM) KR and HRV were obtained, and paired t tests were performed to
   assess the differences in each parameter of nigh(time and daytime HR and
   HRV between the two (15-year interval) Holter monitor recordings.
   Results, The results of the t-test comparisons were as follows: there
   was a significant increase in minimal, maximal, and average HRs
   (nighttime, p <.01: daytime, p (.05, respectively). On the other hand.
   with regard to HRV, there was a significant nighttime decrease in the
   SDNN index (mean of standard deviations of normal RR intervals between
   adjacent QRS complexes resulting from sinus node depolarizations for all
   5-minute segments) (p =.0086), and a significant daytime increase in the
   NN50 (number of adjacent normal RR intervals >50 milliseconds) per hour
   (p =.0425)). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the
   low-frequency (LF) component (nighttime, p =.0151; daytime, p =.0032),
   and a significant decrease in the LF/HF ratio (nighttime, p =.0270;
   daytime, p =.0371), but there was no significant change in the nighttime
   or daytime high-frequency (HF) component.
   Conclusions, KR increased with age over the 15-year period in the
   healthy elderly persons. As for concurrent changes in HRV, however, the
   parameters of sympathetic modulation decreased, and the parameters of
   parasympathetic modulation were unchanged or slightly increased.}},

Journal = {{CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY AND PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose and methods: The lack of a functional DNA mismatch repair (MMR)
   pathway has been recognized as a common characteristic of several
   different types of human cancers due to mutation affecting one of the
   MMR genes or due to promoter methylation gene silencing. These
   MMR-deficient cancers are frequently resistant to alkylating agent
   chemotherapy such as DNA-methylating or platinum-containing, compounds.
   To correlate drug resistance with MMR status in a large panel of human
   tumor cell lines, we evaluated by Western blot the cellular levels of
   the two MMR proteins most commonly mutated in human cancers, MLH1 and
   MSH2, in the NCI human tumor cell line panel. This panel consists of 60
   cell lines distributed among nine different neoplastic diseases.
   Results: We found that in most of these cell lines both MLH1 and MSH2
   were expressed, although at variable levels. Five cell lines (leukemia
   CCRF-CEM, colon HCT 116 and KM12 and ovarian cancers SK-OV-3 and
   IGROV-1) showed complete deficiency in MLH1 protein. MSH2 protein was
   detected in all 57 cell lines studied. Absence of MLH1 protein was
   always linked to resistance to the methylating chemotherapeutic agent
   temozolomide. This resistance was independent of cellular levels of
   O-6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase. Based on data available for
   review in the NCI COMPARE database, cellular levels of MLH1 and MSH2 did
   not correlate significantly with sensitivity to any standard anticancer
   drug or with any characterized molecular target already tested against
   the same panel of cell lines. Conclusion: Based on evaluation of 60
   tumor cell lines in the NCI anticancer drug screen, MLH1 deficiency was
   more common than MSH2 deficiency and was always associated with a high
   degree of temozolomide resistance. These data will enable correlations
   with other drug sensitivities and molecular targets in the COMPARE
   database to evaluate linked processes in tumor drug resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The reparametrization transformation between ultrametrically organised

   invariance of the longitudinal free energy under this transformation,
   i.e. reparametrization invariance, is shown to be a direct consequence
   of the higher level symmetry of replica equivalence. The double limit of
   infinite step replica symmetry breaking and n --> 0 is needed to derive
   this continuous gauge-like symmetry from the discrete permutation
   invariance of the n replicas. Goldstone's theorem and Ward identities
   can be deduced from the disappearance of the second (and higher order)
   variation of the longitudinal free energy We recall also how these and

   enterprises have been divested, 50 per cent of which were sold. Some are
   performing well, contributing to government income and reversing the
   drain through subsidy. The taxation system has improved. It now
   recognises the role played by the private sector and has introduced new
   mechanisms to collect taxes e.g., VAT, and plugging tax evasion
   loopholes. Private sector investment has increased and major
   developments are notable in mining and tourism.
   Although the overall impact of liberalisation on the areas examined has
   been positive, significant weaknesses remain, especially in the
   regulatory frameworks required to prevent abuses of their position by
   private enterprises. Both corruption and an uncertain legal environment
   inhibit the realisation of benefits from reform. The `trickle down' of
   welfare to poorer sections of society has been inadequate, as has the
   extension of financial services to small businesses and rural areas.
   Further public investment is required, especially in health, education
   and infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Leptin, the adipocyte-produced hormone that plays a key role in body
   weight homeostasis, has recently been found to be involved in the
   regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Moreover,
   reciprocal interactions between leptin and glucocorticoids have been
   described. In the present communication, two different strategics were
   undertaken to explore the mode of action of leptin ill the direct
   control of rat adrenal function. First, a synthetic peptide approach
   demonstrated that. the inhibitory effect of leptin on basal and
   ACTH-stimulated corticosterone secretion in vitro, is, at least
   partially, mapped to a domain of the native protein between amino acids
   116 and 130, i.e. an area of the molecule also relevant in terms of
   regulation of food intake and endocrine control. Secondly,
   semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated a complex pattern of adrenal
   leptin receptor (Ob-R) mRNA expression, with predominant expression of
   the Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb isoforms, as well as moderate levels of the Ob-Rc
   and Ob-Rf variants, whereas negligible signals for the Ob-Re isoform
   were detected. Interestingly, such an expression pattern appeared
   hormonally regulated as exposure to human recombinant leptin (10(-7) M)
   or ACTH (10(-7) M) significantly decreased Ob-R isoform mRNA expression.
   Indeed, dose-dependent ligand-induced Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb mRNA
   down-regulation was further confirmed by adrenal stimulation with
   increasing concentrations (10(-9)-10(-5) M) of the active leptin
   fragment, leptin 116-130 amide. Overall, our results provide evidence
   for a novel regulatory step at the level of Ob-R mRNA expression in the
   interplay between ACTH and leptin for the tuning of rat adrenal
   corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, our data showing down-regulation
   of Ob-R mRNA expression bits cognate ligand may well be relevant to
   leptin physiology and its alteration in various disease states.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To test the ascending urethral infection in the pathogenesis of
   acute bacterial prostatitis, we assessed the clonality of Escherichia
   coli strains isolated from urine and rectal swab of patients with acute
   bacterial prostatitis using molecular typing methods.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 50 E. coli strains each isolated from
   urine and rectal swabs of 9 men with acute bacterial prostatitis at
   diagnosis were examined for 6 urovirulence determinant profiles and
   pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns. In 1 case E. coli isolates
   from the rectal swab of the patient's wife were also examined at
   diagnosis and after 5 weeks.
   Results: The urovirulence profile and pulsed field gel electrophoresis
   demonstrated that causative E. coli was monoclonal in each case, and
   present in the rectal swab as a predominant (96\% to 100\%) fecal clone
   in 2 and a minority clone (2\% to 8\%) in 4. Furthermore, causative E.
   coli dominated in the rectal swab of the 1 patient's wife.
   Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the ascending route of
   infection in acute bacterial prostatitis. However, causative E. coli
   might possibly originate from either intestinal reservoir of the host or
   household member. Owing to limitations of the cross-sectional design of
   this study, longitudinal studies are necessary to establish the
   ascending route of infection in this disease.}},

Abstract = {{The maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Thailand is higher than
   neighbouring developing countries including Malaysia and Singapore. The
   1993 MMR of Thailand was 249 per 100 000 livebirths which was four times
   higher than the rates in Malaysia and Singapore (World Health
   Organization 1995). The major causes of these deaths were haemorrhage,
   toxaemia of pregnancy and sepsis which were likely to be prevented by
   adequate prenatal care (Thailand Ministry of Public Health 1996). A
   large proportion of Thai pregnant women have poor health. Between 1994
   and 1995, a national study conducted by Thailand Ministry of Health
   showed that 39\% of pregnant women were anaemic, defined as haemoglobin
   concentration lower than 33\% (Supamethaporn 1997). Another study
   conducted in the southern region also indicated that 13.8\% of pregnant
   women were anaemic caused by iron deficiency (Phatthanapreechakul et al.
   1997). Other behaviours which increased risks associated with child
   birth included non-antenatal care (ANC) attendance, undertaking
   physically demanding tasks and failure to increase nutritional intake
   during their pregnancy period (N. Phiriyanuphong et al. 1992,
   unpublished report). These factors emphasize the importance of a health
   education programme which could facilitate women to, for example,
   increase protein and iron intake during pregnancy which would reduce
   complications from their poor health status. This study was conducted in
   a regional hospital in Thailand where there was no systematic and
   well-planned health education programme for pregnant women. The initial
   aim was to design a health education programme using input from the
   hospital health care professionals including obstetricians, nurses,
   nutritionists, health educators and health promoters. An active
   involvement of these personnel assisted to sustain the provision of the
   programme provided for pregnant women after the cessation of the study
   project. Another aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of the
   programme using a pre-test-post-test method among selected pregnant
   women who participated in the newly designed health education programme.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. Preoperative coronary angiography often reveals significant
   coronary artery lesions in elderly people (> 75 years of age) referred
   to hospital for aortic valve replacement (AVR). However, the possible
   benefit of concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in elderly
   is still under debate. In an effort to contribute to this discussion, we
   evaluated our data on elderly patients after aortic valve replacement.
   Methods. Between January 1990 and December 1993, 219 patients, aged
   greater than or equal to 75, underwent AVR with or without concomitant
   CABG at our Department. There were 121 patients in the AVR group and 98
   patients in the AVR+CABG group. There was no significant difference
   between the two groups in their age, sex valve type, valve size, and
   presence of diabetes. Five variables (concomitant CABG, age, sex, and
   type and size of prosthesis) were investigated with regard to long-term
   survival assessed by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Group comparisons of
   survival were made with the Cox-Mantel log-rank test.
   Results. Early mortality (<30 days) was 0.8\% in the AVR group and 4.1\%
   in the AVR+CABG group. Overall actuarial survival was 77.7+/-4.4\% at 52
   months. There was significantly longer survival in patients with
   mechanical valve implant in the AVR group. None of the other 5
   investigated variables had a significant influence on the long-term
   survival.
   Conclusion. Our results suggest that AVR done in elderly is a treatment
   with excellent surgical results. We could not identify concomitant CABG
   as a predictor of poor long-term surgical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic noise and random synaptic inputs generate a fluctuating
   current across neuron membranes. We determine the statistics of the
   output spike train of a biophysical model neuron as a function of the
   mean and variance of the fluctuating current, when the current is white
   noise, or when it derives from Poisson trains of excitatory and
   inhibitory postsynaptic conductances. In the first case, the firing rate
   increases with increasing Variance of the current, whereas in the latter
   case it decreases. In contrast, the firing rate is independent of
   variance (for constant mean) in the commonly used random walk, and
   perfect integrate-and-fire models for spike generation. The model neuron
   can be in the current-dominated state, representative of neurons in the
   in vitro slice preparation, or in the fluctuation-dominate state,
   representative of in vivo neurons. We discuss the functional relevance
   of these states to cortical information processing.}},

Abstract = {{The chronopharmacokinetics and chronopharmacodynamics of cisplatin were
   studied in a mouse model to reveal the mechanisms of dosing
   time-dependent nephrotoxicity induced by daily administration.
   Chronotoxicity was tested by daily intraperitoneal injections of
   cisplatin (6 mg kg(-1)) for 5 days at four time points (04 00, 10 00, 16
   00 and 22 00 h) in BALB/c mice (n = 6 in each group). After following
   the changes in body weight, serum concentrations of blood urea nitrogen
   (BUN) and creatinine obtained on day 6 were compared.
   The results showed diurnal variations in cisplatin toxicity, with the 04
   00 and 16 00 h time points the best and the worst, respectively, We then
   measured platinum concentrations in blood, liver and kidney and compared
   the results of the 04 00 and 16 00 h groups (n = 4 in each group).
   Kidney sensitivity to cisplatin alone, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone,
   cisplatin with LPS and saline (control) were also measured using a
   tissue culture system (a measurement system of interleukin-6 (IL-6)
   production) between the 04 00 and the 16 00 h groups (n = 4 in each
   group). These results showed no significant difference in platinum
   accumulation between the two groups. IL-6 production was higher in the
   16 00 h group than in the 04 00 h group after saline injection alone (P
   < 0.05). Cisplatin treatment alone did not increase IL-6 production.
   However, IL-6 levels were markedly augmented by cisplatin with LPS.
   In conclusion, chrononephrotoxicity induced by daily cisplatin
   administration does not only depend on cisplatin accumulation, but might
   also depend on kidney sensitivity to diurnal variations in inflammatory
   reaction without direct cisplatin toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Common fragile sites are chromosomal loci prone to breakage and
   rearrangement that can be induced by aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA
   polymerases. Within these loci, sites of preferential DNA breaks were
   proposed to correlate with peaks of enhanced DNA flexibility, the
   function of which remains elusive. Here we show that mammalian DNA
   replication origins are enriched in peaks of enhanced flexibility, This
   finding suggests that the search for these features may help in the
   mapping of replication origins, and we present evidence supporting this
   hypothesis. The association of peaks of flexibility with replication
   origins also suggests that some origins may associate with minor levels
   of fragility. As shown here, an increased sensitivity to aphidicolin was
   found near two mammalian DNA replication origins.}},

Abstract = {{Backgrounds: Although multiple studies suggest a dysregulated T-cell
   cytokine production in systemic lupus erythematosus, the cytokine
   profile in discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) lesions is unknown.
   Objectives: To characterize the cytokine profile in DLE by
   immunohistochemical and molecular methods, and to investigate the role
   of cytokines in the pathogenesis of DLE.
   Design: Patients were evaluated clinically, and biopsy specimens of
   lesional skin were examined by light microscopy. Reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis
   were performed on 11 biopsy specimens. We investigated the presence of
   interleukin (IL) 2, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-4, tumor necrosis
   factor alpha, (TNF-alpha) and IL-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) in 8 biopsy
   specimens of DLE and compared it with 3 biopsy specimens of normal skin.
   Setting: Academic referral research hospital.
   Patients: Eight consecutive patients with a clinical and histologic
   diagnosis of DLE.
   Results: Localized DLE was found in 7 patients and widespread in 1.
   During the 4 years of the investigation, none of the patients developed
   systemic lupus erythematosus. We found significantly elevated levels of
   IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA in all 8 biopsy specimens of DLE; in contrast,
   no transcripts of IL-2 or IFN-gamma were detected in 3 biopsy specimens
   of normal skin (P<.01). Similarly, elevated levels of TNF-<alpha> mRNA
   were detected in 8 DLE biopsy specimens of normal skin (P<.01). No IL-5
   or IL-1<beta> mRNA was detected in 8 biopsy specimens of DLE lesional
   skin and 3 biopsy specimens of normal patient skin. Immunohistochemical
   analysis showed increased staining for IL-2 and IFN-gamma receptors,
   while no detectable IL-4 receptor was found. No cytokine mRNA or
   cytokine receptor protein was detected in biopsy specimens of normal
   skin.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that DLE is associated with type 1
   cytokines characterized by the expression of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Type 1
   cytokines may be critical for induction, development, and maintenance of
   DLE.}},

Abstract = {{The ESPrit ear-level speech processor has recently become available in
   the United Kingdom for use with the Nucleus CI24M multichannel cochlear
   implant. We report on the use of this ear-level processor with 6
   children, ages 8 to 15 years. In this study, all patients were initially
   fitted with the SPrint body-worn processor, this being a prerequisite
   for programming the ESPrit. Five of the children were fitted
   successfully with the ESPrit and are using their devices consistently.
   The results show that patient experience with the ESPrit has been
   favorable, although there have been some device and programming
   difficulties. Aided threshold measures show that the ESPrit processor
   performs at least as well as the SPrint processor, with a trend toward
   improved aided thresholds for the ESPrit processor compared with the
   SPrint processor. Further study of the functional benefit of both of
   these devices may confirm these potential gains. The ESPrit device
   currently has a disadvantage for children in that it does not support FM
   radio hearing aid use. Finally, caution is advised in the fitting of the
   ESPrit in very young children or inexperienced listeners, because of
   difficulties in monitoring device function.}},

Abstract = {{We applied photoacoustic (PA), photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence
   excitation (PLE), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques on porous
   silicon (PS) layers to study the influence of chemical etching by
   low-concentration hydrofluoric acid. The chemical etching reveals the
   formation of PS layers of small dimensions by AFM observations,
   indicating the possibility of a strong quantum confinement effect. PA
   spectroscopy is useful to obtain the optical absorption characteristic
   for strongly scattering media such as PS and it helps to confirm the
   above speculation by indicating the blueshift of the fundamental
   absorption edge for the PS layer with chemical etching. PL spectroscopy
   also confirms the possibility of a quantum confinement effect by
   revealing the strong intensity and blueshift for the PS layer with
   chemical etching. PLE measurements suggest that the site for the
   radiative processes is different from that for the recombination of
   carriers and the PL of PS layers were dominated only by small
   crystallites in various size distributions. (C) 2000 American Institute

Abstract = {{A method to evaluate the use of actively controlled moving weights on
   board ships to reduce roll motion is developed. The weights can simulate
   in principle anti-roll-tank systems, or they can be considered a
   possible anti-roll device in their own right. The ship, the moving
   weight, and the control device an considered components of a single
   dynamic system. The full eight-degree-of-freedom set of coupled
   governing equations for the complete dynamic system is derived. And a
   three-degree-of-freedom non-linear approximation for the roll motion
   only (MOTSIM) is derived from these eight equations. The reduced set of
   equations is used to determine the influence of various parameters and
   to evaluate control strategies. A PID controller is developed to command
   the position of the weight and a servomechanism model is used to predict
   its actual position. Then, the moving-weight system is incorporated into
   LAMP (Large-Amplitude-Motion Program), a computer code that integrates
   the governing equations of the sea and the motion of the ship
   interactively and simultaneously and predicts the motion of the ship in
   the time domain. A comparison of the results from the two simulations
   shows that there is fairly good correlation between the simple and
   complex models, but the simple model is a little optimistic in
   predicting the effectiveness of the moving-weight system. The results
   predict that the moving-weight system can be an excellent
   roll-suppressing device when the moving weight is as small as 1\% of the
   displacement of the ship and the maximum distance the weight moves is as
   small as 15\% of the half-beam. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: Stenoses in infrageniculate arteries proximal to a lower
   extremity vein graft may reduce now velocity through the bypass graft
   and are thought to predispose to graft occlusion. Repair of these
   lesions has been recommended to preserve graft function. This study was
   undertaken to better define the natural history of grafts below inflow
   lesions and to evaluate the necessity of repair to preserve graft
   patency.
   Methods: from 1994 through 1999, patients undergoing lower extremity
   vein grafts by a single surgeon at a university hospital and an
   affiliated teaching hospital were placed in a prospective protocol for
   proximal infrageniculate native artery and graft surveillance through
   use of duplex scanning. The records of those patients with grafts
   originating distal to the common femoral artery were evaluated; they
   form the basis for this report. Arteriograms were obtained before bypass
   grafting, and no patient had a stenosis greater than 50\% diameter
   reduction proximal to the graft origin. follow-up scans were obtained
   from the common femoral artery through the graft and outflow artery The
   peak systolic velocity and velocity ratio in an infrageniculate native
   artery proximal to the graft origin were recorded, as were the location
   and the time interval since the bypass graft. Repair of these proximal
   lesions was not performed during the course of this study. Revision of
   the bypass graft or its anastomoses was undertaken according to
   preestablished duplex scan criteria.
   Results: During this time, 288 autogenous infrainguinal bypass grafts
   were performed, of which 159 originated below the common femoral artery;
   of these, 74 were from the superficial femoral artery, 29 from the
   profunda femoris artery, 49 from the popliteal artery and 7 from a
   tibial artery The maximum peak systolic velocity proximal to the graft
   origin was more than 250 in 38 arteries (25\%) and more than 300 in 26
   arteries (16\%). The velocity ratio was 3.0 or more in 32 arteries at
   the same location as the peak systolic velocity and 3.5 or more in 23
   arteries (15\%), confirming hemodynamically significant stenoses at
   these sites. The location of peak systolic velocity was the common
   femoral artery in 81 patients (51\%), the superficial femoral artery in
   50 (31\%), the popliteal artery in 22 (14\%), and a tibial artery in 6
   (4\%). Follow-up ranged from 8 to 60 months (mean, 35 months). During
   follow-up, 19 patients died, 18 with patent grafts. Overall, nine grafts
   occluded. One of the occluded grafts had a velocity ratio greater than
   3.0; this may have contributed to graft thrombosis, The other occlusions
   resulted from an unrepaired graft lesion in 2 patients, graft infection
   in 2 patients, and graft ligation necessitated by below-knee amputation
   in 2 patients. No cause for the occlusion could be identified in two of
   the grafts (neither had evidence of proximal arterial stenosis).
   Assisted primary patency rates were 95\% and 91\% at 3 and 5 years,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{An original method is proposed for the evaluation of moment tensor
   components using time-domain calculations of low-frequency displacement
   amplitudes with the first-wave polarities attached. The technique is
   suitable for applications involving large amounts of data that require a
   fast response time, such as those encountered in the analysis of induced
   seismicity. Simulation tests indicate an excellent agreement with
   inversions based on the far more labor intense spectral processing. The
   overall results of waveform simulation analysis allow the conclusion
   that this inversion approach is reliable in retrieving the geometrical
   aspects of the seismic source. Inversions for the pure-shear mechanism
   and a general mechanism, including a tensile component, are shown to be
   robust for various wave-type solutions, under reduced array coverage,
   hypocentral mislocation, and the addition of Gaussian normally
   distributed noise. The influence of errors in first-arrival polarities
   and low-frequency displacement amplitudes are subsequently studied for a
   better understanding of the applicability limits.}},

Abstract = {{The respiratory epithelium is vulnerable to noxious substances,
   resulting in the shedding of cells and decreased protection. Zinc (Zn),
   an antioxidant and cytoprotectant, can suppress apoptosis in a variety
   of cells. Here we used the novel Zn-specific fluorophore Zinquin to
   visualize and quantify labile intracellular Zn in respiratory epithelial
   cells. Zinquin fluorescence in isolated ciliated tracheobronchial
   epithelial cells and intact epithelium from sheep and pigs revealed an
   intense fluorescence in the apical and mitochondria-rich cytoplasm below
   the cilia. Zinquin fluorescence was quenched by the Zn chelator
   N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) and increased
   by the Zn ionophore pyrithione. We also assessed whether changes in
   intracellular labile Zn would influence susceptibility of these cells to
   apoptosis by hydrogen peroxide. Our results confirm that Zn deficiency
   enhanced hydrogen peroxide-induced caspase activation from 1.24 +/- 0.12
   to 2.58 +/- 0.53 units.mug protein(-1).h(-1) (P less than or equal to
   0.05); Zn supplementation suppressed these effects. These findings are
   consistent with the hypothesis that Zn protects upper respiratory
   epithelial cells and may have implications for human asthma where there
   is hypozincemia and epithelial damage.}},

Abstract = {{The present research is concerned with multilevel modeling of personal
   victimization rates. Data from the 1994 National Crime Victimization
   Survey are employed. Following the routine activities and lifestyle
   victimization theory, individuals' profile and lifestyle as well as
   characteristics of their household comprise the set of explanatory
   variables. The results of estimated multilevel negative binomial models,
   which explicitly disentangle the unexplained heterogeneity between
   individuals and between households, are discussed. The estimated random
   effects of household characteristics show that the unexplained
   heterogeneity for the average number of personal crimes differs across
   household types. Further, the individual covariates with between
   households random effects become less influential the more the base
   personal crime rates are high.}},

Abstract = {{Electroporation was used to introduce pFLAG-CMV-1-BAP, a DNA fragment
   that includes a bacterial alkaline phosphatase gene driven by a human
   cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, into Penaeus monodon zygotes. The
   transgenic tiger shrimp was achieved by using 10kV, 28 pulses, 120 mu
   sec pulse time, 10 cycles, and a DNA concentration of 37.5 mug/mL. The
   hatching rate of electroporated zygotes (46\%) was significantly lower
   than that of zygotes in the untreated group (89\%). The survival rate of
   postlarvae in the electroporated group using a DNA concentration of 37.5
   mug/mL decreased from 0.6\% for postlarva 45 to 0.4 \% for postlarva
   120. Based on dot blot analysis, the rate of gene transfer was 37\% in
   mysis-stage, 23\% postlarva 15(PL15), 19\% postlarva 45(PL45), and 21\%
   4-month-old (about PL120). Genomic Southern blotting demonstrated that
   DNA from transgenic tiger shrimp contained fragments of exogenous DNA
   that were smaller, larger and of the same molecular size as
   pFLAG-CMV-1-BAP. Transferred DNA fragments were integrated into the
   genomes of 31\% of the transgenic tiger shrimp. The exogenous DNA was
   mosaically distributed in a wide variety of tissues. Immunohistochemical
   staining revealed that the FLAG-BAP fused-protein encoded by
   pFLAG-CMV-1-BAP was present in the ovaries of some transgenic tiger
   shrimp. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Normal hematopoietic progenitor cells from 129S6/SvEv mice are
   substantially less sensitive to Merocyanine 540 (MC540)-mediated
   photodynamic therapy (PDT) than hematopoietic progenitors from sex- and
   age-matched C57BL/6 mice. When exposed to a combination of MC540 and
   Light commonly used for the extracorporeal purging of hematopoietic stem
   cells, granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) from C57BL/6 mice are
   depleted 7.9-fold whereas CFU-GM from 129S6/SvEv and (C57BL/6 x
   129S6/SvEv) Fl mice are depleted 1.4- and 2-fold, respectively. The same
   rank order of sensitivity is also found with regard to unipotent
   progenitors of granulocytes and macrophages and with regard to early and
   late erythroid progenitors. The resistance of hematopoietic progenitors
   from 129S6/SvEv mice to MC540-PDT appears to be the result of reduced
   dye binding rather than the result of high levels of intracellular
   glutathione. These findings have practical implications for the design
   of preclinical tests of PDT in animal models. They may also provide a
   useful tool for future investigations into the molecular determinants of

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1268-1274}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Equivalence testing has been widely discussed and is commonly used in
   pharmacokinetics (bioequivalence) and clinical trials (therapeutic
   equivalence). It can also be applied to pharmacoepidemiology, where the
   aim may be to test with a known risk (one-group design) or with another
   drug (two-group design). Whether the approach is two-sided or one-sided,
   predefined equivalence limits are required. The definition of the
   equivalence region can be based on either risk difference or risk ratio.
   Risk equivalence resting is complicated by the binary nature of the
   outcome, its low frequency, and by the absence of commonly defined
   equivalence limits for differences or ratios. In this context, we
   consider usable formulae for sample sizes. In most cases, at least when
   the risk studied is large enough (above 1/1,000), it appears that these
   formulae result in sample sizes that may be acceptable for practical
   purposes. For example, demonstrating equivalence with a known risk of
   0.01, a 20\% maximal risk difference, and a one-sided test (alpha = 0.05
   and beta = 0.2) requires: under the one-group design (known risk),
   15,309 patients; and under the two-group design, 30,617 patients per
   group. This approach is the appropriate way to conclude equivalence,
   rather than the commonly used approach of difference testing and
   concluding equivalence when the null hypothesis of equality is not
   rejected. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Amplification with catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD) greatly enhances
   peroxidase signals, which has been utilized to amplify
   immunohistochemical labelings including fluorochromes. Here we describe
   a strategy to amplify each of two immunofluorescent signals without
   crosstalk on double-stained histological sections from human autopsied
   brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the two primary antibodies
   (anti-AP or anti-PHF-tau) was probed by a species-specific secondary
   antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which was
   visualized by FITC-labeled tyramide. After inactivation of HRP, the
   other primary antibody was probed by another species-specific secondary
   antibody conjugated with HRP. Amplification with biotinylated tyramide
   was followed by streptavidin-conjugated Cy-5, which specifically labeled
   the latter epitope. It was found that AP and PHF-tau were localized to
   senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), respectively, which
   verified lack of crosstalk on the double-stained section. Localization
   of ubiquitin and PHF-tau was looked for at higher magnification in
   NFT-bearing neurons. Although these two epitopes were colocalized in
   some neurons, ubiquitin was not always present in PHF-tau positive NFTs.
   Discrepancy between PFH-tau and ubiquitin, verified inter- and
   intracellularly, may represent different stages of NFT formation. This
   is the first report of successful CARD amplification of two different
   fluorescent signals on double-labeling immunohistochemistry, which is
   now proved to be powerful in detecting epitopes in relation to
   AD-related lesions. Improved intensity over tenfold of the two
   fluorescent signals without crosstalk will expand the application of the
   multilabeling method with fluorochromes.}},

Abstract = {{Databases of expressed sequence tags (EST) can be used to screen rapidly
   for potential polymorphisms in candidate proteins. As part of this
   study, we screened the gene for the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS), TS
   is important physiologically because it is essential for the synthesis
   of deoxythymidylate, a nucleotide required for DNA synthesis and repair.
   TS is also a major target for cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, especially
   the widely used 5-fluorouracil. Using sequence alignment of ESTs, we
   identified a candidate 6-bp variation at bp 1494 in the 3'-untranslated
   region of the TS mRNA, This sequence variation occurred in 21 of 34
   aligned ESTs at this location, including ESTs from various tissue
   sources. The presence of this polymorphism was confirmed in a Caucasian
   population (n = 95) by polymerase chain restriction amplification/RFLP
   analysis, The allele frequency of the 6-bp deletion was found to be 0.29
   (wild-type +6 bp/+6 bp, 48\%; +6 bp/-6 bp, 44\%; -6 bp/-6 bp, 7\%),
   Although the function of this polymorphism has not yet been
   investigated, the 3'-untranslated region of a gene can play a role in
   mRNA stability and translation. This study illustrates an approach to
   polymorphism discovery in candidate enzymes of physiological interest by
   searches of publicly available sequence data, a rapid and inexpensive
   method, The potential functional relevance of the common 6-bp deletion
   in the TS gene needs to be investigated, because this enzyme is
   plausibly of major importance not only in cancer treatment but also in
   cancer prevention.}},

   significantly more apoptotic cells in stage C3 were detected than in

Abstract = {{A brief state-of-the-art review is given on backfill materials and
   laboratory tests. A new system developed for testing backfill material
   in the laboratory is described. In this system, most of the limitations
   of previously applied techniques have been eliminated. In performing
   unconfined-deformability tests (UDT) and confined-deform ability tests
   (CDT), large cylindrical specimens having a diameter of 600 mm are used.
   The specimens were prepared from riverbed sand and gravel mixed with
   cement. A total of 135 UDT and 127 CDT specimens were tested in order to
   investigate the strength and deformability characteristics of 40
   different combinations of backfill mixture. Calculation methods are
   evaluated in terms of stress-strain plots and are illustrated with
   examples. Typical results are presented. Two sets of deformation data
   can be obtained during testing: one from between the top and bottom
   plates, and the other from between the rings peripherally fixed onto the
   specimen. It is shown in this study that ring-to-ring readings provide
   more reliable modulus results.}},

Abstract = {{Triblock nanospheres with hydroxylated polyisoprene (PHI) coronas,
   cross-linked poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate) shells, and
   poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) cores were prepared following a method
   described previously. Equilibrating such nanospheres with a PdCl2
   solution in methanol enabled the loading of Pd2+ into the PAA cores of
   the nanospheres. After the excess PdCl2 in the methanol phase was
   removed, Pd(II) inside the nanosphere cores was reduced with hydrazine
   to yield Pd nanoparticles. Such encapsulated Pd particles were dispersed
   in methanol or water, which solubilized PHI. Like Pd black, the
   nanosphere-encapsulated Pd nanoparticles catalyzed the hydrogenation of
   alkenes. The need for the reactant(s) to diffuse into and products to
   diffuse out of the encapsulating nanospheres expectedly slowed the
   catalytic reactions. The more interesting aspect had been in our ability
   to modify the activity of the Pd catalyst via changing the pH and thus
   the conformation of the encapsulating polymer chains.}},

Abstract = {{In an earlier study of 37 candidate genes for polycystic ovary syndrome
   (PCOS), the strongest evidence for genetic linkage was found with the
   region of the follistatin gene. We have now carried out studies to
   detect variation in the follistatin gene and assess its relevance to
   PCOS. By sequencing the gene in 85 members of 19 families of PCOS
   patients, we found sequence variants at 17 sites. Of these, 16 sites
   have variants that are too rare to make a major contribution to
   susceptibility; the only common variant is a single base pair change in
   the last exon at a site that is not translated, In our sample of 249
   families, the evidence for linkage between PCOS and this variant is
   weak. We also examined the expression of the follistatin gene; messenger
   RNA levels in cultured fibroblasts from PCOS and control women did not
   differ appreciably. We conclude that contributions to the etiology of
   PCOS from the follistatin gene, if any, are likely to be small.}},

Abstract = {{Study design: A case report of xanthogranulomatous funiculitis and
   epididymo-orchitis. Xanthogranulomatous inflammation is an uncommon,
   non-neoplastic process characterised by destruction of tissue, which is
   replaced by a striking cellular infiltrate of lipid-laden macrophages.
   Case report: A 21-year male sustained complete tetraplegia at C-6 level,
   after a fall in 1998. The neuropathic bladder was managed with an
   indwelling urethral catheter. He had many unsuccessful trials of
   micturition. Sixteen months after the cervical injury, he noticed
   swelling of the left side of the scrotum following removal of a blocked
   catheter. He was prescribed antibacterial therapy. Four weeks later,
   physical examination revealed a hard and irregular swelling encompassing
   the testis, epididymis and spermatic cord. The clinical diagnosis was
   epididymo-orchitis progressing to pyocele. Through a scrotal incision,
   the swollen testis, epididymis and diseased segment of the spermatic
   cord were removed en masse. Histopathology showed extensive areas of
   necrosis, with xanthogranulomatous inflammation in the spermatic cord
   and to a lesser extent in the testis/epididymis.
   Conclusion: Repeated episodes of high-pressure urinary reflux along the
   vas deferens during dyssynergic voiding, and subsequent interstitial
   extravasation of urine together with chronic, low-grade, suppurative
   infection possibly led to development of xanthogranulomatous
   inflammation in the testis and the epididymis. Since tissue destruction
   is a feature of xanthogranulomatous inflammation, the definite and
   curative treatment is either complete (or, where applicable, partial)
   excision of the affected organ in most of the cases.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the compromise of proximal tubule
   cells in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome patients with a histologic
   diagnosis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) through
   assessment of the urinary levels of beta (2)-microglobulin (beta M-2)
   and N-acetyl-beta -D-glucosaminidase (NAG) during active disease and
   remission over a follow-up period of 3 years. We studied 34 children
   with nephrotic syndrome: 12 with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome
   (SRNS) and massive proteinuria, 7 with steroid-dependent nephrotic
   syndrome (SDNS) and 15 with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS).
   Of the SSNS patients, 8 children were in remission (RM) and 7 were in
   relapse (RL). Seven healthy children were included as controls. Urinary
   beta M-2, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was
   significantly increased in the SRNS group as compared to the SDNS group
   (P<0.01), SSNS in remission (P<0.01), and controls (P<0.01). There were
   no differences between the SRNS group and SSNS in relapse. Analysis of
   urinary N-acetyl-<beta>-D-glucosaminidase (U-NAG) by colorimetric assay
   showed significantly higher values in the SRNS group of patients than in
   SDNS, SSNS, and control groups. A positive correlation between U-NAG and
   proteinuria was demonstrated (r=0. 73, P<0.01). The SRNS group of
   patients (n=12, 11 with a histologic diagnosis of FSGS and one with
   diffuse mesangial proliferation) was treated with the same protocol of
   i.v. methylprednisone and oral cyclophosphamide. Long-term follow-up
   showed a progressive de crease in U-<beta>M-2 and U-NAG excretion to
   control values in the 3rd year, except in one patient who did not
   respond to the treatment. In the FSGS patients, evaluation of the
   contribution of structural interstitial histological abnormalities,
   including each of the histological parameters considered in interstitial
   scarring to the functional tubule abnormalities assessed by beta M-2 and
   NAG excretion, was performed by multiple regression analysis. The r(2)
   values for beta M-2 and NAG were 53.99\%, P=0.19, and 57.90\%, P=0.14,
   respectively; neither was significant. We conclude that: (1) proximal
   tubule cell dysfunction, partially affected by massive albuminuria, may
   account for the higher values of beta M-2 and NAG excretion in the SRNS
   patients and (2) urine beta M-2 and NAG levels are not helpful in
   identifying histological evidence of structural tubulointerstitial
   damage in children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the postsurgical outcome of patients with
   corticotroph microadenomas and to define predictors of the long-term
   outcome, with special emphasis on markers of tumor extension.
   Design: Prospective study of 53 corticotroph microadenomas treated by
   enlarged adenomectomy Patients followed for at least 2 years were
   classified into two groups: those in long-term remission and uncured
   patients (immediate failures and recurrences). Pre-, per- and
   postoperative parameters were analyzed as predictors of the long-term
   outcome.
   Methods: Baseline hormone assessments were performed preoperatively, 8
   days after surgery and every 6-12 months thereafter. Pituitary magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) allowed analysis of possible tumor extension to
   adjacent structures, Apparent completeness of the surgical removal was
   determined, and fragments labeled either `tumor' or `surrounding
   pituitary tissue' were submitted to serial sectioning.
   Results: Immediate control of hypercortisolism was achieved in 43/53
   patients (81\%). However, later recurrences were observed in five
   patients (9\%). Preoperative MRI showed tumor extension into adjacent
   structures with good specificity (91\%) for prediction of surgical
   failure. Evidence of local invasion at surgery was also significantly
   predictive of the long-term outcome. A corticotroph adenoma was found at
   histological examination in 96\% of the patients, and 26\% had irregular
   limits, a feature significantly correlated with a poor outcome.
   Immediate postoperative plasma cortisol did not allow discrimination
   between long-term remissions and recurrences.
   Conclusion: Surgical failure was best predicted by signs of tumor
   `invasiveness' at MRI, confirmed by peroperative examination and
   histology.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic arthritis is characterized by persistent joint inflammation and
   concomitant joint destruction. Animal models have been of great value in
   understanding potential pathogenetic pathways and studying therapeutic
   principles. The first models were based on T cell-driven pathways and
   taught us that arthritis can be induced by a variety of stimuli. This
   suggests that the involvement of a single (auto)antigen in rheumatoid
   arthritis is unlikely and suggests that the regulation of arthritis can
   best be approached via bystander suppression. Insight into the pivotal
   role of TNF alpha and IL-1 has emerged from studies employing a range of
   common and also novel transgenic models. Combination treatment with both
   TNF and IL-1 blockers is warranted to control both joint inflammation
   and joint destruction. Novel approaches with viral gene constructs of
   cytokines and cytokine inhibitors teach us that efficient gene therapy
   is a possibility for small joints.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional theories of sand production prediction distinguish between
   compressive (shear) cavity (perforation, borehole) failure, induced by a
   combination of in-situ stress and drawdown, and tensile cavity failure,
   induced by the near-cavity pore pressure gradient. In this paper we
   show, using a global criterion for strain localization around the cavity
   (i.e., cavity failure), that in most cases the preference for either
   compressive or tensile cavity failure only depends on the cavity size
   and on the constitutive properties of the rock, and not on effective
   near-cavity stress or the pore pressure gradient. It is shown that
   ``large{''} cavities (e.g., boreholes) always fail in compression rather
   than in tension failure. Only for sufficiently small cavities (e.g.,
   perforations) in weak, moist sandstones, is compressive failure
   supressed and tensile failure possible. The above results deviate
   significantly from previous sand production prediction concepts. They
   are further supported by laboratory sand production experiments with
   large cavities, in which sand failure was only observed for near-cavity
   effective stresses above a certain threshold, independent of applied
   drawdown (i.e., flow rate). The experiments exhibited no correlation
   between the (non) occurrence of sand production and drawdown.
   From these results, it may be concluded that the primary role of fluid
   flow in sand production is the transport of loose sand (debris)
   resulting from compressive failure, rather than failure of the intact
   sandstone itself.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To measure the health related quality of life (QoL) following
   mitral valve replacement in childhood.
   Design-Cross sectional study.
   Setting-Tertiary referral centre.
   Methods-19 patients, median age (range) 14.4 (9.7-25.4) years, were
   studied at a median of 7.6 (0.5-11.2) years after their most recent
   mitral valve replacement. General health status was measured using age
   specific validated questionnaires. Ten children aged between 9-15 years
   completed the child health related quality of life questionnaire, and
   for nine older patients the UI( version of the short form 36 was used.
   Specific questions were added to the existing questionnaires to study
   the effect of long term anticoagulation treatment.
   Results-All patients in the younger age group reported impaired QoL.
   Five rated their QoL within the range of children with chronic physical
   disabilities, and in the remaining five it was worse. In the older age
   group, all but two patients perceived their QoL as normal or near normal
   compared with a reference population matched for sex and age. Having
   regular blood tests had a negative effect on QoL in three young
   children, and one older patient reported impaired QoL related to taking
   daily warfarin tablets.
   Conclusions-In this small group, the effect of mitral valve replacement
   on QoL appears to be age specific, with more impairment in younger
   children. Long term anticoagulation treatment is well tolerated in most
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background Unintentional weight loss of >10\% contributes to morbidity
   and mortality in HIV-infected patients. In poorer developing countries,
   cost-effective options to promote weight gain are extremely limited.
   Methods We conducted a pilot study of the effect of nutritional
   education and dietary counselling on body weight in 90 HIV/AIDS
   patients. Education entailed principles of healthy eating,
   socioeconomics of nutrition, food safety, and symptom-related dietary
   guidelines, Other clinical parameters examined for potential impact on
   body weight included age, sex, CD4+ lymphocyte count, presence of
   complicating infections, concomitant medications, vitamin use, and
   nutritional supplementation. No patients received antiretroviral
   therapy.
   Results At study end (mean follow-up, 4.2 months) body weight compared
   to baseline was greater in study subjects than in controls (P < 0.01);
   stable or increasing weight was seen in 73\% of study patients. Weight
   gain (<greater than or equal to>1 kg) occurred in 53\% of counselled
   patients (mean = 3.5 kg; range 1-11 kg) vs. 21\% of matched controls
   (mean = 2.0 kg; range 1-3 kg) (P < 0.03). Nutritional counselling was
   found to offset the adverse effects of gastrointestinal tract or
   systemic infection (especially in patients with CD4+ counts <200 cells
   mm(-3)).
   Conclusion In low-resource areas, culturally and economically relevant
   nutritional education and dietary counselling are simple yet effective
   means of stabilizing or increasing body weight in HIV-infected patients.}},

Abstract = {{The response of cells to ionising radiation has been extensively studied
   for the past 30 years. When radiation is absorbed in biological
   material, it can directly ionise a critical site (direct effect) or
   interact with other molecules to produce reactive free radicals, which
   can subsequently damage critical biological molecules (indirect effect).
   DNA is considered the critical target damaged by ionising radiation by
   both direct and indirect processes. Since radiotherapy had proven to be
   effective in the treatment of non-malignant proliferative processes, it
   was assumed that this adjunctive treatment would also inhibit vascular
   restenosis, The major difference between external and intravascular
   radiation is dose distribution. Intravascular delivery results in
   extremely high doses to the lumen with a fall-off in dose as a function
   of distance from the source; whereas, external beam would deliver a
   uniform dose over the entire volume of tissue treated. Unlike in the
   coronary circulation most of the peripheral vessels treated are greater
   than 3 nun in diameter; in fact many are 7 to 10 mm in diameter. Since
   beta radiation is related to lower penetration properties and more
   heterogeneous distribution of radiation in comparison to gamma
   radiation, it is therefore necessary to use a gamma radiation source
   because it would be difficult to irradiate the sub-intimal tissue with a
   beta source centred in a large vessel. Radiation can and does have the
   potential to destroy blood vessels. The challenge in vascular
   brachytherapy is to treat blood vessels to a point where restenosis is
   inhibited; yet the vessel is not irreparably damaged.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-Validation of responsiveness and discriminative power of the
   World Health Organisation/International League of Associations for
   Rheumatology (WHO/ ILAR) core set, the American College of Rheumatology
   (ACR), and European League for Rheumatology (EULAR) criteria for
   improvement/response, and other single and combined measures (indices)
   in a trial in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods-Ranking of measures by response (standardised response means and
   effect sizes) and between-group discrimination (unpaired t test and chi
   (2) values) at two time points in the COBRA study. This study included
   155 patients with early RA randomly allocated to two treatment groups
   with distinct levels of expected response: combined treatment, high
   response; sulfasalazine treatment, moderate response.
   Results-At week 16, standardised response means of core set measures
   ranged between 0.8 and 3.5 for combined treatment and between 0.4 and
   1.2 for sulfasalazine treatment (95\% confidence interval +/-0.25).
   Performance of patient oriented measures (for example, pain, global
   assessment) was best when the questions were focused on the disease. The
   most responsive single measure was the patient's assessment of change in
   disease activity; at 3.5. Patient utility, a generic health status
   measure, was moderately (rating scale) to poorly (standard gamble)
   responsive. Response means of most indices (combined measures) exceeded
   2.0, the simple count of core set measures improved by 20\% was most
   responsive at 4.1. Discrimination performance yielded similar but not
   identical results: best discrimination between treatment groups was
   achieved by the EULAR response and ACR improvement criteria (at 20\% and
   other percentage levels), the pooled index, and the disease activity
   score (DAS), but also by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and
   grip strength.
   Conclusions-Responsiveness and discrimination between levels of response
   are not identical concepts, and need separate study. The WHO/ILAR core
   set comprises responsive measures that discriminate well between
   different levels of response in early RA. However, the performance of
   patient oriented measures is highly dependent on their format. The
   excellent performance of indices such as the ACR improvement and EULAR
   response criteria confirms that they are the preferred primary end point
   in RA clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{We have determined the crystal structure of a spliceosomal RNP complex
   comprising the 15.5kD protein of the human U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP and the 5'
   stem-loop of U4 snRNA. The protein interacts almost exclusively with a
   purine-rich (5+2) internal loop within the 5' stem-loop, giving an
   unusual RNA fold characterized by two tandem sheared G-A base pairs, a
   high degree of purine stacking, and the accommodation of a single RNA
   base, rotated out of the RNA chain, in a pocket of the protein. Apart
   from yielding the structure of an important entity in the pre-mRNA
   splicing apparatus, this work also implies a model for the complex of
   the 15.5kD protein with box C/D snoRNAs. It additionally suggests a
   general recognition principle in a novel family of RNA binding proteins.}},

Abstract = {{The first postnatal week is a critical period for the development of
   posture in the rat. The use of ankle extensor muscles in postural
   reactions increases during this period. Changes in excitability of
   motoneurons are probably an important factor underlying this maturation.
   The aim of this study was to identify whether variations in the
   maturation exist between motor pools innervating antagonistic muscles.
   Intracellular recordings in the in vitro brain stem-spinal cord
   preparation of neonatal rats (from postnatal day 0-5) were used to
   examine the developmental changes in excitability of motoneurons
   innervating the ankle flexors (F-MNs) and:the antigravity ankle
   extensors (E-MNs). No significant difference in resting potential,
   action potential threshold, input resistance or rheobase was observed at
   birth. The age-related increase in rheobase was more pronounced for
   F-MNs than for E-MNs. The development of discharge properties of E-MNs
   lagged behind that of F-MNs. More F-MNs than E-MNs were able to,fire
   repetitively in response to current injection at birth. F-MNs discharged
   at a higher frequency than E-MNs at all ages. Differences in the
   duration of action potential afterhyperpolarization accounted, at least
   partly, for the differences in discharge frequency between E-MNs and
   F-MNs at birth, and for the age-related increase in firing rate. These
   results suggest that E-MNs are more immature at birth than F-MNs and
   that there is a differential development of motoneurons innervating
   antagonistic muscles. This may be a critical factor in the development
   of posture and locomotion.}},

Abstract = {{The structures of the polysaccharide chains of the LPS from Bordetella
   bronchiseptica strains 110H and Bp512 were analysed by NMR spectroscopy
   and mass spectrometry The polysaccharides consist of alpha-(1-4)-linked
   2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-L-galacturonic acid repeating units.
   Polysaccharides from both strains have
   2,3,4-triamino-2,3,4-trideoxy-alpha -galacturonamide derivatives at
   their nonreducing ends, a monosaccharide identified for the first time
   in nature. The polymers from the two strains differ in the nature of the
   acylation of the amino groups of this monosaccharide. In the strain
   110H, the residue is formylated at positions 3 and 4, and has
   N-formyl-L-alanyl or L-alanyl substituents at N-2. In the strain Bp512,
   the amino group at position 2 is acetylated, at position 3 it is
   formylated, and the amino group at position 4 bears a 2-methoxypropionyl
   substituent. The distribution of the acyl groups was determined from
   long range H-1-C-13 correlation (HMBC) NMR spectra. Measurement of the
   spectra under different pH conditions showed that carboxyl groups of the
   inner uronic acid residues of the polymeric chain are free, and that
   carboxyl groups of the terminal residues are amidated. These conclusions
   were confirmed by the results of mass spectrometric analysis.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate whether or not human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) can be transmitted
   through a nonsexual route a serological survey was carried out in a

   in a group of 60 women, matched by age, in the general population (27
   vs. 24\%, 1028 vs. 1575, respectively). Moreover, by using nested
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR), HHV8 DNA sequences were detected in 7
   of 16 (43.8\%) saliva and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
   patients with classical Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and in 3 out of 7 (42\%)
   AIDS-KS patients. None of 5 HIV positive persons who did not have KS
   tested positive for HHV8 DNA. HHV8 DNA sequences were also detected in 2
   of 12 (17\%) saliva and 1 PBMC sample out of 12 healthy HHV8 positive

Abstract = {{Hemoglobin in solution and inside red blood cells forms a complex with
   nitric oxide exhibiting a specific EPR signal both at room and liquid
   nitrogen temperatures. In the present paper it was shown that the
   nitrosyl complex of hemoglobin (NO-Hb) is photochemically sensitive and
   hence may serve as a source of free NO under He-Cd laser irradiation
   (441 nm). It was found that at laser light radiant power of 3.9 mW, room
   temperature and in the presence of oxygen, 50\% decrease of NO-Hb EPR
   signal occurred at doses of 54, 30, and 18 kJ/m(2) for NO-hemoglobin
   solution, hemolysed and intact erythrocytes, respectively. The detection
   of free NO produced as a result of NO-Hb photolysis was performed by
   means of a spin trap, nitronyl nitroxyl radical NNR, which in the
   presence of NO is transformed into imino nitroxyl radical (INR) showing
   different EPR signal. In isolated hemoglobin solution, 20 mM INR was
   accumulated under irradiation with the maximal dose of 700 kJ/m(2). In
   intact cells the HbFe(2+)-NO photolysis and NO release occur with
   essentially higher efficacy. To produce 100 mM INR, a dose of 290
   kJ/m(2) was needed in erythrocyte lysates and 100 kJ/m(2) in intact red
   blood cell suspension. Measurements of absorption spectra showed that in
   all systems studied (NO-Hb in solution, intact erythrocytes and
   hemolysed erythrocytes) NO-Hb concentration decreased after irradiation
   by 14-22\% with simultaneous formation of methemoglobin. These
   observations show that NO-Hb may serve as a store of nitric oxide from
   which free NO can be released by intensive illumination. (C) 2000

   growth rate, length at death and life span without external food. Thus
   these early life-history traits may be modulated by natural selection.
   We found positive phenotypic and genetic correlations between most early

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to develop an improved procedure for
   preparation of chromosome suspensions, and to evaluate the potential of
   flow cytometry for chromosome sorting in wheat. Suspensions of intact
   chromosomes were prepared by mechanical homogenization of synchronized
   root tips after mild fixation with formaldehyde. Histograms of relative
   fluorescence intensity (flow karyotypes) obtained after the analysis of
   DAPI-stained chromosomes were characterized and the chromosome content
   of all peaks on wheat now karyotype was determined for the first time.
   Only chromosome 3B could be discriminated on flow karyotypes of wheat
   lines with standard karyotype. Remaining chromosomes formed three
   composite peaks and could be sorted only as groups. Chromosome 3B could
   be sorted at purity >95\% as determined by microscopic evaluation of
   sorted fractions that were labeled using C-PRINS with primers for GAA
   microsatellites and for Afa repeats, respectively. Chromosome 5BL/7BL
   could be sorted in two wheat cultivars at similar purity, indicating a
   potential of various wheat stocks for sorting of other chromosome types.
   PCR with chromosome-specific primers confirmed the identity of sorted
   fractions and suitability of flow-sorted chromosomes for physical
   mapping and for construction of small-insert DNA libraries. Sorted
   chromosomes were also found suitable for the preparation of
   high-molecular-weight DNA. On the basis of these results, it seems
   realistic to propose construction of large-insert chromosome-specific
   DNA libraries in wheat. The availability of such libraries would greatly
   simplify the analysis of the complex wheat genome.}},

   including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, dexamethasone,
   tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, ketamine, and transcutaneous
   electric nerve stimulation.
   Interventions: An axillary catheter was placed in the brachial plexus
   using a posterior approach that has not been described previously. A
   continuous infusion system of local anesthetics was delivered via a
   catheter. In two patients, the main purpose was to evaluate the
   technical possibilities and implications of this new approach. In all
   patients, the visual analogue scale score was evaluated until the
   patient died. In four additional patients, the quality of life and
   performance skills were recorded.
   Results: In all patients, there was a significant reduction in the
   visual analog scale score, and there was an increase in performance
   skills and quality of life in four patients. No side effects occurred
   from this technique or from the continuous administration of local
   anesthetics.
   Conclusions: We conclude that neuropathic pain may be treated by local
   anesthetics administered through an axillary catheter placed in the
   brachial plexus. This technique is reversible and is preferable to
   destructive procedures such as cordotomy.}},

Abstract = {{Five years ago Morokuma and colleagues introduced the IMOMO method,
   which integrates two molecular orbital methods into one calculation.
   Since then, the method has been expanded in several ways; it has been
   generalized to consider up to three methods, and has been unified as the
   ONIOM method to include both MO and MM combinations. In this review we
   present the history of the method, a number of chemical problems that we
   have studied, how to assess IMOMO combinations and partitionings, and
   our latest efforts that take the method beyond the conventional
   investigation of ground state energy surfaces. In particular, we
   emphasize the importance of the S-value test for validation of the ONIOM
   method/model combinations. The method combination depends much on the
   properties and accuracies required. Generally speaking, however, if the
   target level is CCSD(T) or G2, the best choice of low level is MP2. If
   MP2 or DFT is the target level, HF or eventually semiempirical MO
   methods are good choices of low level. These methods can be further
   combined with an outer-most layer of the MM level. (C) 2000 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Objective: We studied the effect of escalating the dose and
   administration time of American ginseng (AG, Panax quinquefolius L.) in
   nondiabetic individuals to achieve further improvements in glucose
   tolerance seen previously when 3g of AG was taken 40 minutes before a
   25g glucose challenge.
   Methods: Ten nondiabetic individuals (6M:4F; mean +/- STD: age = 41 +/-
   13 years, BMI = 24.8 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2), FBG = 4.5 +/- 0.1 mmolL(-1)) on 12
   separate occasions, randomly received 0 (placebo). 3, 6 or 9g of ground
   AG root at 40, 80, or 120 minutes before a 25g oral glucose challenge.
   Capillary blood glucose was measured prior to ingestion of AG or placebo
   capsules and at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes from start of
   challenge.
   Results: Compared with the placebo, 3, 6 and 9g of AG reduced (p<0.05)
   postprandial incremental glucose at 30, 45 and 60 minutes; also, 3 and
   9g of AG did so at 90 minutes. At 60 minutes, 9g of AG reduced
   incremental postprandial glucose relative to 3g of AG (p<0.05). All AG
   doses reduced (p<0.05) area under the incremental glucose curve (3g,
   26.6\%; 6g, 29.3\%: 9g, 38.5\%). AG taken at different times did not
   have an additional influence on postprandial glycemia.
   Conclusions: In nondiabetic individuals, 3, 6 or 9g of AG taken 40, 80
   or 120 minutes before a glucose challenge similarly improved glucose
   tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the physico-chemical properties of erythrocyte membranes
   induced by nonenzymatic glycation as well as the possible prevention of

   1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), fluorescence anisotropy values were
   determined in erythrocyte membranes isolated from type 1 and type 2
   diabetic patients with and without complications. The mean anisotropy
   values for the groups of diabetic patients were significantly higher
   than those for the control group (p < 0.01). This indicated
   pathologically decreased fluidity in eel membranes in the diabetics
   regardless of the type of diabetes or the presence of complications. The
   fluorescence anisotropy positively correlated (p < 0.01) with clinical
   parameters, such as glycohaemoglobin and plasma cholesterol content,
   which are important for the monitoring of the compensation status of the
   diabetic patient. Our results support the suggestion that protein
   crosslinking and oxidative stress induced by nonenzymatic glycation
   contribute to changes in the physico-chemical properties of erythrocyte
   membranes.
   In vitro testing of a new potential drug resorcylidene aminoguanidine
   (RAG) showed its ability to increase significantly (p < 0.001), to
   various extent (p < 0.01), the fluidity of both diabetic and control
   erythrocyte membranes. Upon the administration of RAG, reduced
   fluorescence anisotropy values for the groups of diabetic patients
   approached the normal values obtained for the controls. This may play an
   important role in the improvement of impaired cell functions found in
   diabetes that are controlled by the cell membrane.}},

Abstract = {{New Sr and Nd isotopic data are presented for several large feldspar
   crystals occurring in microgranular enclaves in the Swifts Creek and
   Bridle Track plutons, along with analyses of their host enclave
   groundmass and adjacent granitoid. In the Swifts Creek Pluton several
   previous studies have concluded that the microgranular enclaves
   represent admixed, more mafic and more primitive magmas, and new data
   presented here confirm that. Feldspar megacrysts in the microgranular
   enclaves have Sr and Nd isotopic signatures that are distinct from the
   surrounding enclave groundmass and from other enclaves in the pluton and
   therefore cannot have crystallised in situ. Isotopic compositions of
   these feldspars are more consistent with their having crystallised in a
   reservoir similar in composition to the most primitive granitoid
   analyses. The crystals were then physically transferred from the
   granitoid magma into the enclave while the latter was still partially
   liquid, thus invalidating arguments for a porphyroblastic origin. Field,
   petrographic and geochemical data are consistent with microgranular
   enclaves in the Bridle Track pluton also originating as admixed, more
   mafic magmas. However, Sr isotopic compositions of the enclaves are
   identical, within error, to the host granite and indicate that
   significant Sr isotopic equilibration has occurred. Nd isotopic
   compositions of the enclaves extend to slightly higher
   Nd-143/Nd-144((i)) and are consistent with a mingled magma origin
   followed by major isotopic equilibration. Feldspar phenocrysts in the
   studied enclave have isotopic compositions indistinguishable from both
   the enclave groundmass and host granite, preventing an interpretation of
   their origin using isotopic evidence alone.}},

Abstract = {{Data on individual variations from one election to the next is
   fundamental in the study of political behaviour, and should, ideally, be
   collected through panel studies in which the same people are interviewed
   at two or more or elections. This method is, however, costly and time
   consuming, and most analyses of this type are therefore based on recall
   data, in which the voters report their choices in the current election
   and also in previous elections. The accuracy of recall data is
   discussed, based on data from the Norwegian Programme of Election
   Research in the period 1977-97. Analyses show that one must expect,
   using this type of data, that about one in four voters will give
   incorrect information about their voting behaviour at the previous
   election. Erroneous recall of previous voting can be explained by
   variations in the voters' affiliation to the parties. Whereas stable
   voters who remain with the same party normally report their voting
   correctly, erroneous recall varies around 40 percent for party changers
   and rises to 70 percent among previous non-voters. There is, however, no
   uniform underlying pattern in erroneous recall during different periods,
   which implies that it is difficult to predict exactly how erroneous
   recall will affect the accuracy of recall data in one particular
   election.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-34}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Current land-cover classifications used for global modelling portray
   Arctic tundra as one or two classes. This is insufficient for analysis
   of climate-vegetation interactions. This paper presents a simple
   three-level vegetation-map legend system useful for modelling at global,
   regional, and landscape scales. At the highest level (global scale:
   10(7)-10(8) km(2)) the Tundra Zone is divided into four subzones based
   on vegetation response to temperature along the latitudinal temperature
   gradient from north to south: (1) Cushion-forb, (2) Prostrate
   Dwarf-shrub, (3) Erect Dwarf-shrub, and (4) Low Shrub subzones. The
   boundaries follow a modification of Yurtsev's phytogeographic subzones.
   Parent material and topography are also major considerations at global,
   regional, and landscape scales. Soil pH is a key variable for many
   ecosystem responses, and a division into acidic (pH 5.5 or less) and
   nonacidic soils is used. A conceptual mesotopographic gradient is used
   to characterize the influence of soil-moisture and snow regimes. The
   example legend framework focuses on the Northern Alaska floristic
   subprovince, and could be expanded to other floristic provinces using
   local expert knowledge and available literature. Dominant plant
   functional types within each habitat type within the four subzones are
   also presented. Modellers could include or ignore different levels of
   resolution depending on the purpose of the model. The approach resolves
   conflicts in terminology that have previously been encountered between
   the Russian, North American, and Fennoscandian approaches to Arctic
   zonation.}},

Abstract = {{A categorical distinction is made between two types of biostratigraphic
   units. In a given superposed section, a eubiostratigraphic unit is a
   thickness of strata whose boundaries are defined by the lowest and/or
   highest occurrences of fossils of one or more specified taxa. In
   contrast, a quasibiostratigraphic unit is a thickness of strata
   characterized by its fossil content, but whose boundaries are defined by
   other means.
   Eubiostratigraphic units include range. single-taxon interval,
   assemblage. and multiple-taxon interval fossilzones.
   Quasibiostratigraphic units include paleontologically distinct
   lithozones. metrizones, and ``fuzzy{''} zones. Quasibiostratigraphic
   units serve to summarize the most distinctive changes in overall fossil
   content observed in individual sections, without necessary regard for
   the exact vertical ranges of particular taxa. Most quasibiostratigraphic
   units need not be given formal binomial names, but are best assigned
   alpha-numeric or informal descriptive designations.
   Assemblage fossilzones are multiple-taxon analogs of range fossilzones,
   in that they are defined by a single set of two or more taxa.
   Multiple-taxon interval fossilzones are multiple-taxon analogs of
   single-taxon interval fossilzones, in that their boundaries are defined
   by two different sets of two or more taxa. As such, multiple-taxon
   interval fossilzones are stratigraphically and temporally contiguous
   with one another by definition.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the additive ocular hypotensive effect of
   brimonidine, dorzolamide, latanoprost, or artificial tears to timolol in
   monkey eyes with laser-induced unilateral glaucoma.
   Methods: Eight monkeys were used and each animal received all four
   combinations of drugs in a randomized fashion during the study. The
   washout period between each combination was at least 2 weeks.
   Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 8:30 AM, 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM,
   and 3:30 PM an day I (untreated baseline), day 2 (timolol treatment
   alone), and days 3 through 5 (combination therapy with two drugs). One
   drop of 0.5\% timolol was topically applied at 3:45 PM On day I and at
   8:45 AM and 3:45 PM on days 2 through 5. One drop of 0.2\% brimonidine
   or 2\% dorzalamide or artificial tears was added on day 2 at 4:00 PM and
   at 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM On days 3 through 5, or latanoprost was added at
   9:00 AM On days 3 through 5.
   Results: Compared with timolol alone, the maximal additive reduction in
   IOP which occurred on day 5 was 4.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg (mean +/- standard
   error of the mean) with timolol plus brimonidine, 5.6 +/- 1.0 mm Hg with
   timolol plus dorzolamide, 4.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg with timolol plus
   latanoprost, and 2.0 +/- 0.5 mm Hg with timolol plus artificial tears (P
   < 0.01). At all measurements, timolol plus brimonidine, timolol plus
   dorzolamide, and timolol plus latanoprost caused greater (P < 0.05) IOP
   reductions than did timolol plus artificial tears. The additive
   IOP-lowering effect was similar (P > 0.60) when comparing timolol plus
   brimonidine and timolol plus dorzolamide, timolol plus brimonidine and
   timolol plus latanoprost, timolol plus dorzolamide and timolol plus
   latanoprost at all measurements, but timolol plus dorzolamide caused a
   greater (P < 0.05) reduction of IOP than did timolol plus latanoprost at
   0 hours on day 5.
   Conclusions: The addition of brimonidine, dorzolamide, or latanoprost to
   timolol caused similar additional reductions of IOP in glaucomatous
   monkey eyes.}},

Abstract = {{The control system performance of gas liquid cylindrical cyclone
   (GLCC(C))(1) separators can be considerably improved by adopting
   suitable control strategy and optimizing the design of the controller
   PID settings. Dynamic simulators have been developed in this study,
   based on Matlab/Simulink(R) software for evaluation of several different
   GLCC control philosophies for two-phase flow metering loop and bulk
   separation applications. Detailed analysis of the GLCC control system
   simulators indicates that for integrated liquid level and pressure
   control strategy, the level control loop compliments the operation of
   the pressure control loop, nod vice versa. This strategy is ideal for
   reducing the pressure fluctuations in the GLCC. At severe slugging
   conditions, the integrated liquid level control is more desirable
   because of its faster response. However, there is no control of the GLCC
   pressure fluctuations. The results also show that the simulators are
   capable of representing the dynamic behavior of real physical systems.

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with the treatment of the dynamic behaviour of
   piezoelectric materials containing interacting cracks under antiplane
   mechanical and inplane electric loading. A general electrical boundary
   condition is used to enable the treatment of both permeable and
   impermeable conditions along the crack surfaces, The theoretical
   solution of the problem is formulated using integral transform
   techniques and an appropriate pseudo-incident wave method. The resulting
   singular integral equations are solved using Chebyshev polynomials to
   provide the dynamic stress and electric fields. Numerical examples are
   provided to show the effect of the geometry of the cracks, the
   piezoelectric constant of the material and the frequency of the incident
   wave upon the dynamic stress intensity factors. The results show the
   significant effect of electromechanical coupling upon local stress
   distribution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the inhibitory effect of extracellular
   ATP on Na+ absorption and the possible underlying mechanism in cultured
   mouse endometrial epithelium using the short-circuit current (I-SC
   technique. The cultured epithelia exhibited a Na+-dependent basal
   current that could be predominately blocked by the epithelial Na+
   channel (ENaC) blocker, amiloride (10 muM). Apical addition of ATP (10
   muM) induced a reduction in basal I-SC. However, in the presence of
   amiloride or when apical Na+ was removed, the ATP-induced reduction was
   abolished and an increase in the I,, was observed with kinetic
   characteristics similar to those reported previously for the ATP-induced
   Cl- secretion, indicating that ATP could induce both Cl- secretion and
   inhibition of Na+ absorption. Further reduction in I-SC after ATP
   challenge could be obtained with forskolin (10 muM), which indicates
   that different inhibitory mechanisms are involved. The ATP-induced
   inhibition of Na+ absorption, but not that induced by forskolin, could
   be abolished by the P-2 receptor antagonist, reactive blue (100 muM),
   indicating the involvement of a P-2 receptor in mediating the ATP
   response. ATP and uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP; 100 muM), a relatively
   selective agonist for the pyrimidinoceptor, induced separate I-SC
   reduction, and distinct I-SC increases in the presence of amiloride,
   regardless of the order of drug administration, indicating the
   involvement of two receptor populations. The ATP-induced inhibition of
   Na+ absorption was mimicked by the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (1 muM),
   whereas the Ca2+ chelators, ECTA and BAPTA-AM, abolished the
   ATP-induced, but not the forskolin-induced, inhibition of Na+
   absorption, suggesting the involvement of a Ca2+-dependent pathway. In
   the presence of the Cl- channel blocker, DIDS (100 muM), both inhibitory
   and stimulatory responses to ATP were abolished, suggesting the
   involvement of a Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (CaCCs) in mediating both
   ATP responses. The ATP-induced as well as the forskolin-induced
   reduction in I-SC was not observed when Cl- was removed from the bathing
   solution, indicating that Cl- permeation is important for the inhibition
   of Na+ absorption. The results suggest the presence of a Ca2+-dependent
   ENaC-inhibiting mechanism involving CaCC in mouse endometrial epithelial
   cells. Thus, extracellular nucleotides may play an important role in the
   fine-tuning of the uterine fluid microenvironment by regulating both Cl-
   secretion and Na+ absorption across the endometrium.}},

   The main carbonaceous product in the CCl2F2/O-2/Ar plasma system was
   CO2, while that in the CCl2F2/H-2/Ar plasma system was CH4 and C2H2.
   Furthermore, the possible reaction pathways were built-up and elucidated
   in this study. The results of the experiments showed that the highly,
   electronegative chlorine and fluorine could easily separate from the
   CCl2F2 molecule and combine with the added reaction gas. This led to the
   reactions terminated with the CO2, CH4, and C2H2 formation, because of
   their high bonding strength. The addition of hydrogen would form a
   preferential pathway for the HCl and HF formations, which were
   thermodynamically stable diatomic species that would limit the
   production of CCl3F, CClF3, CF4, and CCl4. In addition, the HCl and HF
   could be removed by neutral or scrubber method. Hence, a hydrogen-based
   RF plasma system provided a better alternative to decompose CCl2F2.}},

Abstract = {{Loop scheduling is an important issue in the development of high
   performance multiprocessors. As modern multiprocessors have high and
   non-uniform memory access (NUMA) costs, the communication costs dominate
   the execution of parallel programs. Previous affinity algorithms perform
   better than dynamic algorithms under non-clustered NUMA multiprocessors,
   but they suffer heavy overheads when migrating work load under clustered
   NUMA machines. In this paper, we propose a new loop scheduling policy,
   hierarchical policy, to improve Various affinity scheduling algorithms
   (AFSs) for clustered NUMA machines. We cyclically distribute the
   iteration chunks to clusters. When imbalance occurs, the migration of
   iterations is carried on hierarchically. We use hierarchical policy to
   improve AFS and modified AFS (MAFS), and we call them Hierarchical AFS
   (HAFS) and Hierarchical MAFS (HMAFS), respectively. AFS uses a
   deterministic assignment policy to assign repeated executions of loop
   iteration to the same processor. MAFS modifies the migration policy of
   AFS, and reduces the number of synchronization operations. We confirm
   our idea by running many applications under a clustered NUMA simulator.
   Our experimental result shows that hierarchical policy reduces the
   inter-cluster remote memory accesses, decreases the locks to the queues,
   and effectively balances the work load. We also show that HMAFS is the
   best choice among these algorithms in most cases. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity
   reaction to the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus that may progress to
   bronchiectasis. The aim of the present study was to characterize airway
   inflammation in patients with clinically stable ABPA and asthma, and to
   correlate this with bronchiectasis severity.
   Subjects with ABPA and central bronchiectasis (ABPA-CB; n=16) and ABPA
   with serological evidence alone (ABPA-S; n=10) were studied. Comparison
   groups were A. fumigatus-sensitized asthma (n=19), non-A,
   fumigatus-sensitized asthma (n=15) and healthy controls (n=8).
   Hypertonic saline challenge, sputum induction and high-resolution
   computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest were performed.
   Sputum eosinophil numbers were markedly elevated in ABPA-CB (median
   8.4\%) compared to ABPA-S (2.4\%), A. fumigatus-sensitized asthma
   (1.8\%), asthma (1.8\%) and controls (0.3\%) (p<0.01); sputum eosinophil
   cationic protein levels were higher in ABPA-CB (median 13,706
   ng.mL(-1)), compared to ABPA-S (1,633.5 ng.mL(-1)), A.
   fumigatus-sensitized asthma (1,550.7 ng.mL(-1)), asthma (309.2
   ng.mL(-1)), and controls (110 ng.mL(-1)) (p<0.001). ABPA-CB also showed
   increased sputum neutrophil number (median 60.3\%) compared to the other
   groups (controls 29.3\%) (p=0.01). The severity of bronchiectasis on
   HRCT correlated with sputum neutrophil (r=0.6) and eosinophil number
   (r=0.5) but not serum immunoglobulin-E levels.
   In conclusion, clinically stable allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
   with bronchiectasis is characterized by an intense heterogenous
   inflammatory infiltrate consisting of eosinophils and neutrophils, which
   correlates closely with the severity of bronchiectasis on
   high-resolution computed tomography. Sputum analysis may be useful in
   monitoring the course of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study we examined the metabolic fate of progesterone (P4)
   in homogenate and tissue minces of the ovaries and testes of Lytechinus
   variegatus. P4 was metabolized primarily into Su.-reduced metabolites
   including, 5 alpha -pregnane-3,20-dione (DHP),3 beta -hydroxy-5 alpha
   -pregnan-20-one (3 beta ,20-one), 5 alpha -pregnane-3 beta ,20 alpha
   -diol (3 beta ,20 alpha -diol): 5 alpha -pregnane-3 beta ,20 beta -diol
   (3 beta ,20 beta -diol), and 5 alpha -pregnane-3 alpha ,20 alpha -diol
   (3 alpha ,20 alpha -diol) by both the ovaries and testes. The capacity
   to metabolize P4 did not differ between the ovaries and testes. However,
   the relative quantity of 5 alpha -pregnane-3 beta ,20 xi -diol
   synthesized from ovary and testis tissue minces was about 3.3-fold
   higher than from homogenate preparations. Differences in the synthesis
   of 3 beta ,20-one and 3 alpha ,20 alpha -diol in both ovary and testis
   minces were dependent on reproductive state. This study demonstrates the
   pathway of P4 conversion in the ovaries and testes of L. variegatus and
   indicates the rapid conversion of P4 into 5 alpha -reduced metabolites
   in these tissues. Although P4 metabolism is not sex specific,
   sex-specific responses to P4 metabolites have been demonstrated
   previously. We hypothesize that the sex-specific responses of the
   ovaries and the testes to P4 may be associated with receptor-level
   regulatory processes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Title = {{Influence of parental gender and self-reported health and illness on

Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background. Although there is clear evidence of the influence of
   parental factors on child health outcomes, the influence of parental
   perceptions of their health and illness on the reporting of child health
   remains primarily unknown.
   Objectives. To examine relationships between parents' reporting of their
   own health and illness with the reporting of their children's health and
   illness.
   Method. We surveyed parents of a representative population-based sample
   of children aged 5 to 18 years. One parent of each child completed a
   written questionnaire including the Child Health Questionnaire, a
   subjective measure of functional health and well-being, and an
   assessment of self-reported parental health and illness. Logistic
   regression models were used to examine relationships between parent and
   child health and illness.
   Main Results. 5340 parents responded (86\% mothers, 14\% fathers). After
   adjusting for confounding effects, parents self-reporting poor health
   had increased odds of reporting their children with poor health (odds
   ratio: 7.5), although the effect was modified by parent gender. There
   were increased odds of mothers with self-reporting poor global health
   reporting their children with poor global health and illness (odds
   ratio: 9.0 and 2.5, respectively) that were not observed for fathers.
   Conclusions. A mother's self-reported health is strongly associated with
   her reporting of her child's health; this was not observed for fathers.
   These results suggest that parental gender should be considered as a
   mediating factor in the reporting of child health.}},

Abstract = {{Tholeiites accompanying a majority of alkali basalts are restricted to
   the highly productive central part of the CECV plume activity in
   Vogelsberg and Hessian Depression. They mainly occur as quartz
   tholeiites which according to experiments of partial melting and
   material balances are products of olivine tholeiitic primary melts. The
   differentiation from olivine to quartz tholeiitic melts took place in
   lower crustal magma chambers where olivine tholeiitic melt intruded due
   to a density comparable with that of the country rocks. The
   fractionation due to separation of olivine and some clinopyroxene caused
   contamination of tholeiitic magmas by tonalitic partial melts from the
   wall rocks of the magma chambers. The latter process is indicated by
   relatively high Rb, K and Pb and low Nb concentrations and by Nd, Sr and
   Pb isotopes. Contaminating crustal melts, which roughly attained a
   proportion of 10 \%, contained very low Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios from a
   Nd/Sm fractionation as old as 2.6 Ga. This is the first evidence from
   mafic rocks of this high age in the lower crust beneath Central Europe.
   Modelling with incompatible elements allows to recognize olivine
   tholeiites as products of about 1\% partial melting of plume rocks
   consisting of 35\% primitive and 65\% depleted mantle materials. The
   production of tholeiites other than alkali basalts is restricted to the
   highest plume activity and the largest fraction of MORB type source
   rocks.}},

Abstract = {{Both earthquake prediction and failure prediction of disordered brittle
   media are difficult and complicated problems and they might have
   something in common. In order to search for clues for earthquake
   prediction, the common features of failure in a simple nonlinear
   dynamical model resembling disordered brittle media are examined. It is
   found that the failure manifests evolution-induced catastrophe (EIC),
   i.e., the abrupt transition from globally stable (GS) accumulation of
   damage to catastrophic failure. A distinct feature is the significant
   uncertainty of catastrophe, called sample-specificity. Consequently, it
   is impossible to make a deterministic prediction macroscopically. This
   is similar to the question of predictability of earthquakes. However,
   our model shows that strong stress fluctuations may be an immediate
   precursor of catastrophic failure statistically. This might provide
   clues for earthquake forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of Co2+- and Ni2+-exchanged zeolites strongly depends on
   the exchanged transition metal and the experimental conditions of the

   the zeolite famework with acidic species formed during the exchange
   leads to structural damage. After the collapse of the zeolite frameworks
   during the calcination of the exchanged zeolites, the crystallization of
   CoAl2O4 and NiAl2O4 starts. During the calcination of Ni2+-exchanged
   zeolite A and X, NiO crystallizes prior to the formation of spinel and
   dissolves as the spinel crystallization starts. Depending on the zeolite
   precursor and the thermal conditions, SiO2 phases such as quartz or
   cristobalite are formed. The amounts of crystalline and amorphous phases
   vary with calcination temperature and time. The phase formation

Abstract = {{Uptake of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis into mammalian cells involves
   engagement of beta1 integrin receptors by the bacterial protein invasin.
   This triggers a host response that involves tyrosine phosphorylation of
   proteins and the induction of actin rearrangements that lead to cellular
   uptake of bacteria. In this report, we show that the focal adhesion
   protein CAS plays an important role in Yersinia uptake, and that its
   function is linked to the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between
   CAS and Crk. These studies demonstrate that Yersinia binding to host
   cell receptors initiates a cascade of events involving tyrosine
   phosphorylation of GAS, subsequent formation of functional CAS-Crk
   complexes and the activity of the small GTP-binding protein Rac1. The
   delineation of this pathway lends support for a model in which Yersinia
   uptake into human epithelial cells is dependent upon aspects of host
   signalling pathways that govern actin cytoskeleton remodelling and cell
   migration.}},

Abstract = {{Use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for lung gene therapy is
   limited, in part, by low levels of AAV-mediated transgene expression in
   lungs. Generally, less than 1\% of total airway and alveolar epithelial
   cells express transgene activity following vector administration. A
   means of improving AAV vector delivery could potentially enhance
   AAV-mediated gene expression in lungs. We have previously demonstrated
   that use of perfluorochemical (PFC) liquids improved overall levels of
   adenovirus vector-mediated gene expression as well as distribution of
   expression in lungs of spontaneously breathing rodents. To evaluate
   whether use of PFC liquids might similarly enhance AAV-mediated
   expression, spontaneously breathing rodents received intratracheal
   instillation of the AAV vectors CWRAP and ARAP4 (2-5 x 10(8) FFU/animal)
   with or without 10 cc/kg body wt PFC liquid (FC-75, ACROS). Animals were
   sacrificed 4 weeks later and lungs assessed for overall and in situ
   alkaline phosphatase (AP) expression. Animals receiving vector alone
   exhibited scattered sparse in situ activity, predominantly in alveolar
   epithelium. In contrast, animals receiving vector with FC-75 exhibited
   increased and more widespread AP expression as well as up to a 26-fold
   increase in AP activity. These results demonstrate that use of the PFC
   liquid FC-75 improves overall and in situ AAV-mediated gene expression
   in rodent lungs.}},

Abstract = {{Two pilot studies tested the hypothesis that adolescents perceive
   differential risks for unintended pregnancy (UP), sexually transmitted
   diseases (STDs), and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune
   deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The Ist study used a college sample
   consisting of 14 adolescents (21 years or younger) and 64 adults (over
   21) who rated the likelihood that they and others would experience 15
   health problems. The 2nd study used a community sample of 48 adolescents
   between 16 and 21 years of age who rated 11 health problems in a similar
   manner. Optimistic bias and uniqueness of risk in adolescents' perceived
   susceptibility to adverse sexual outcomes were examined. Optimistic bias
   is the difference between ratings of risk to self and risk to others,
   reflecting lower risk to self. Uniqueness of risk is the difference
   between ratings of risk and a baseline risk estimate (i.e., the mean
   rating for all non-sex-related health problems). Consistent with the
   hypothesis, adolescents perceived differential risks for UP, STDs, and
   HIV/AIDS. Implications for adolescent prevention programs are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new familial metabolic bone disease characterized by
   expanding hyperostotic long bones, early onset deafness, premature tooth
   loss, and episodic hypercalcemia, The condition affects a mother and
   daughter studied at the age of 36 years and 11 years, respectively. Both
   individuals lost all hearing in early childhood and suffered premature
   shedding of teeth. Skeletal pains began just before puberty. Swelling
   and aching of most middle phalanges in the hands is an especially
   troublesome manifestation. The mother also had episodes of symptomatic
   hypercalcemia first documented in late childhood and subsequently during
   intercurrent illness and postpartum lactation. Radiographs show
   hyperostosis and/or osteosclerosis predominantly in the skull and
   appendicular skeleton, Long bones also are expanded considerably,
   especially the middle phalanges in the fingers. The mother's skeletal
   abnormalities are more severe. Biochemical parameters of bone turnover,
   including serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, are elevated
   substantially. In the proposita, dynamic histomorphometry of
   nondecalcified sections of iliac crest revealed rapid skeletal
   remodeling, In the mother, who had been treated with bisphosphonates,
   electron microscopy (EM) showed disorganized collagen bundles as well as
   necrotic and apoptotic bone cells but no osteocytic osteolysis. Measles
   virus gene transcripts were not detected in peripheral blood monocytes,
   Karyotyping was normal, 46,XX. Hyperphosphatasia with bone disease
   previously has been reported as either a sporadic or autosomal recessive
   condition. Expansile skeletal hyperphosphatasia (ESH) is probably
   inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with a high degree of
   penetrance.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare entity of
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not yet analyzed cytogenetically. By
   using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), we looked for chromosome
   changes in 2 primary FLCs and a recurrent FLC with and without
   metastases.
   CGH revealed an amplification of 1q in 1 primary FLC. The other primary
   FLC and a metastasis revealed no changes. The recurrent FLC showed 18
   aberrations, including 1q+, 2p+, 3p+, 3q+, 4p+, 4q+, 5p+, 5q+,
   6q+,8p+,8q+,9q+,12p+,12q+,18p+,18q+,Xp+, and Xq+. In 2 metastases, 9 and
   10 aberrations were seen, including 1q+, 3p-, 3q-, 4q+, 5p+, 5q+, 8q+,
   10p+, 10q+, Xp+, and Xq+. In 9 cases of other entities of HCC, a mean of
   10.2 aberrations per case were detectable affecting 1q (7 cases), 4q
   (5), 5q (4), 6q (5), 8p (5), 8q (5), 9p (4), 9q (5), 16q (4), 17p (5),
   and 17q (4). Chromosomes 2p, 2q, 3p, 3q, 4p, 5p, 6p, 7p, 7q, 10q, 11p,
   11q, 12p, 12q, 13q, 14q, 16p, 18p, 18q, 20p, 20q, and 21q were altered
   in up to 3 samples.
   Our findings indicate striking differences in the number of chromosomal
   imbalances in primary FLC and recurrent FLC, whereas imbalances seen in
   the recurrent FLC and the other entities of HCC were similar in number
   and chromosomes involved. It may be speculated that these aberrations
   represent secondary events based on a genetic instability and do not
   mirror the primary alterations in these carcinomas.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In decay analyses the support for a particular split in
   most-parsimonious trees is its decay index, that is, the extra steps
   required of the shortest trees that do not include the split. By
   focusing solely on the support for splits, traditional decay analysis
   may provide an incomplete and potentially misleading summary of the
   support for phylogenetic relationships common to the mast-parsimonious
   tree or trees. Here, we introduce double decay analysis, a new approach
   to assessing support for phylogenetic relationships. Double decay
   analysis is the determination of the decay indices of all n-taxon
   statements/partitions common to the most-parsimonious tree. The results
   of double decay analyses are presented in a partition table, but various
   approaches to graphical representation of the results, including the use
   of reduced consensus support trees, are also discussed. Double decay
   analysis provides a more comprehensive summary and facilitates a better
   understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of complex phylogenetic
   hypotheses than does traditional decay analysis. The limitations of
   traditional decay analyses and the utility of double decay analyses are
   illustrated with both contrived data and real data for sauropod
   dinosaurs.}},

Abstract = {{The parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor
   regulates extracellular calcium concentrations and is therefore
   important for mineral homeostasis. ROS 17/2.8 cells, a rat
   osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line, express the PTH/PTHrP receptor
   and provide a good model for examining the transcriptional regulation of
   its gene. The rat PTH/PTHrP receptor gene has two promoters, U1 and U3,
   which were shown to be important for its expression. Using extracts from
   ROS 17/2.8 cells, we have demonstrated two regions (termed FP1 and FP2)
   of nuclear protein/DNA interaction within promoter sequences previously
   shown to be important for the activity of the U3 promoter. Nuclear
   extracts from rat 2 fibroblasts, which do not express the PTH/PTHrP
   receptor, produced one site of protein/DNA interaction which was found
   at a position on the promoter identical to the position of FP1 produced
   by a ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract. Mutation of these two sites of
   protein/DNA interaction resulted in reduced U3 promoter activity.
   Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the transcription factors SP1 and
   MAZ regulate U3 promoter expression and have shown their functional
   significance using mutational analysis. These data demonstrate that SP1
   and MAZ bind to the PTH/PTHrP receptor promoter and that they are
   involved in cell-specific expression of its gene product.}},

Journal = {{BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{6, B, S}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One simple way of accounting for site conditions in calculating seismic
   hazards is to use the shear-wave velocity in the shallow subsurface to
   classify materials. The average shear-wave velocity to 30 m (V-s(30))
   has been used to develop site categories that can be used for modifying
   a calculated ground motion to account for site conditions. We have
   prepared a site-category map of California by first classifying the
   geologic units shown on 1:250,000 scale geologic maps. Our
   classification of geologic units is based on V-s(30) measured in 556
   profiles and geological similarities between units for which we have V-s
   data and the vast majority of units for which we have no data. We then
   digitized the geologic boundaries from those maps that separated units
   with different site classifications.
   V-s data for California shows that several widespread geologic units
   have ranges of V-s(30) values that cross the boundaries between
   NEHRP-UBC site categories. The Franciscan Complex has V-s(30) values
   across UBC categories B and C with a mean value near the boundary
   between those two categories. Older alluvium and late Tertiary bedrock
   have V-s(30) values that range from about 300 to about 450 m/sec, across
   the boundary between categories C and D. To accommodate these units we
   have created intermediate categories, which we informally call BC and
   CD. Geologic units that have, or are interpreted to have, V-s(30) values
   near the boundary of the UBC categories are placed in these intermediate
   units.
   In testing our map against the available V-s(30) measurements, we have
   found that 74\% of the measured V-s(30) values fall within the range
   assigned to the V-s category where they fall on the map. This ratio is
   quite good considering the inherent problems in plotting site-specific
   data on a regional map and the variability of physical properties in
   geologic units. We have also calculated the mean and distribution of
   V-s(30) for each of our map units and prepared composite profiles,
   showing the Variation of V-s in the upper 100 m from the available V-s
   data. These data show that the map categories that we have defined based
   on geologic units have different V-s properties that can be taken into
   account in calculating seismic hazards.}},

Abstract = {{The mu -receptor is the primary mediator of the effects of morphine and
   the endogenous opiates, endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2. Here we
   demonstrate a dissociation of the analgesic and rewarding effects of
   endomorphin-1 in rats. Tail-flick results revealed that endomorphin-1
   produced significant analgesic effects within 10-min after injection.
   However, it failed to show reward properties in the standard 45-min
   conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm or in an abbreviated 10-min
   pairing which paralleled the time frame of the tail-flick findings.
   Morphine induced both analgesia and reward. Endomorphin-1 therefore is
   the first mu opiate shown to produce potent analgesia in the absence of
   reward behavior, and thus may have significant clinical potential. (C)

Abstract = {{Leigh syndrome is a progressive neuro degenerative disease frequently
   associated with mitochondrial abnormalities. The mitochondrial DNA
   T9176C mutation in the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene has recently been
   described as a cause of Leigh syndrome. Leukocyte DNA from 59 children
   with Leigh syndrome was screened for the T9176C mutation by conventional
   polymerase chain reaction methods. Two unrelated patients were found to
   be homoplasmic for this mutation in blood. Both patients had similar
   clinical and biochemical features. They had first presented acutely at 3
   and 5 years, respectively, with ataxia and slurred speech. Magnetic
   resonance imaging changes were consistent with Leigh syndrome, and the
   cerebrospinal fluid lactate was elevated. They have both had relatively
   stable disease since the time of diagnosis. The mother of one of the
   children had presented at age 29 years with sudden onset of ataxia,
   headache, and blurred vision. She was heteroplasmic for the T9176C
   mutation. The T1976C is an important cause of Leigh syndrome especially
   in the subgroup of patients with more stable disease and normal
   respiratory chain enzyme analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term photoacclimation of Chlorella vulgaris Beijer (UTEX 265)
   to growth irradiance and growth temperature under ambient CO2 conditions
   was examined. While cultures grew at a faster rate at 27 than at 5
   degreesC, growth rates appeared to be independent of irradiance.
   Decreases in light-harvesting polypeptide accumulation, increases in
   xanthophyll pool size and changes in the epoxidation state of the
   xanthophyll cycle pigments were correlated linearly with increases in
   the relative reduction state of QA, the primary quinone receptor of
   photosystem II, when estimated as 1-qp under steady-state growth
   conditions. However, we show that there is also a specific
   temperature-dependent component, in addition to the redox-state of the
   QA, involved in regulating the content and composition of
   light-harvesting complex II of C. vulgaris. In contrast, modulation of
   the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll pool in response to increased
   1-qp in cells grown at 5 OC was indistinguishable from that of cells
   grown at 27 degreesC, indicating that light and temperature interact in
   a similar way to regulate xanthophyll cycle activity in C. vulgaris.
   Because C. vulgaris exhibited a low-light phenotype in the presence of
   3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), but a high-light
   phenotype upon addition of
   2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, we conclude that the
   plastoquinone pool acts as a sensor regulating the accumulation of
   light-harvesting polypeptides in C. vulgaris. However, concomitant
   measurements of non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (q(N)) and the
   epoxidation state of the xanthophyll pool appear to indicate that, in
   addition to the redox-state of the plastoquinone pool, the
   trans-thylakoid Delta pH may also contribute to sensing changes in
   irradiance and temperature that would lead to over-excitation of the
   photosynthetic apparatus. We suggest that sink capacity as reflected in
   photosynthate utilization and cell growth ultimately regulate
   photoacclimation in C. vulgaris.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Deficiency of thiamin (vitamin B1) causes a range of
   neuropsychiatric symptoms that resemble those reported in patients with
   anorexia nervosa (AN) but the prevalence of thiamin deficiency in AN has
   not been reliably established. This study was designed to investigate
   the prevalence of thiamin deficiency in AN. Method: Thirty-seven
   patients attending a specialist eating disorders unit and meeting all or
   some of the DSM-IV criteria for AN were compared with 50 blood donor
   controls. All subjects underwent measurement of erythrocyte
   transketolase activation following the addition of thiamin
   pyrophosphate, the standard biochemical test for thiamin deficiency.
   Deficiency was defined as a result more than 2 SD above the mean of the
   control population. Results: Fourteen patients (38\%) had results in the
   deficient range; 7 (19\%) met the most stringent published criterion for
   deficiency. Deficiency was not related to duration of eating restraint,
   frequency of vomiting, or alcohol consumption. Discussion: Thiamin
   deficiency may account for some of the neuropsychiatric symptoms of AN
   and routine screening or supplementation may be indicated. (C) 2000 by

Abstract = {{States are responsible for implementing many key environmental laws

   development and testing of a summated scale measure of state regulatory
   climate toward finfish aquaculture. Data for the analysis were generated
   from a national survey of state level finfish aquaculture programs, The
   final aquaculture regulatory climate scale (ARCScale) ranges from 0-18,
   with the numerical value of the scale increasing with increases in
   regulatory stringency. Scale values were computed for each state plus
   Guam for five categories of finfish: baitfish, ornamentals, commercial
   foodfish, freshwater gamefish, and marine gamefish. The scale allows
   direct comparison between states, enabling aquaculture producers to make
   more informed location, species selection, and business decisions. The
   scale also provides a means for evaluating changes in state

Abstract = {{The present study considers the important role of bone resorption for
   bone growth in general, and aims to clarify if and how bone resorption
   contributes to the skeletal development of carp, Cyprinus carpio L., a
   teleost species with `normal' osteocyte-containing (cellular) bone. To
   ensure the identification of osteoclasts and sites of bone resorption
   independently from the morphology of the bony cells, bones were studied
   by histological procedures, and by demonstration of the enzymes which
   serve as osteoclast markers, viz. tartrate resistant acid phosphatase
   (TRAP), ATPase and a vacuolar proton pump. Two types of bone-resorbing
   cells were observed in juvenile carp: (1) multinucleated giant cells
   displaying morphological and biochemical attributes which are known from
   mammalian osteoclasts; and (b) flat cells which lack a visible ruffled
   border and for which identification requires the performance of enzyme
   histochemical procedures. Bone resorption performed by osteoclasts
   mainly occurs at endosteal bone surfaces. To a lesser extent, bone
   resorption also takes place at periosteal bone surfaces, but without an
   apparent connection to bone growth. The latter observation, and the
   occurrence of bone remodelling, suggest that the endoskeleton of
   juvenile carp might be involved in mineral metabolism. Morphological
   differences and biochemical similarities to bone resorption in teleosts
   with acellular bone are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. There is evidence that plasma methadone measurements may be of
   benefit in dosage adjustment during methadone maintenance treatment for
   opiate dependence. However, to dare the kinetics of oral rac-methadone
   have been poorly characterized. We describe plasma methadone
   concentration-time data collected from 35 opiate addicts. Subjects. Oral
   doses of rac-methadone were given to 24 male and 11 female addicts
   attending a community-based drug treatment centre. Measurements. Plasma
   methadone concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography (HPLC).
   Procedures. Plasma concentration-time data were collected from patients
   prescribed oral rac-methadone in order to describe the complex kinetics
   of the drug incorporating its long elimination half-life. Findings.
   Auto-induction of methadone metabolism was demonstrated and it was
   observed that clearance of methadone was significantly lower (p < 0.05)
   in opiate addicts at the start of treatment (median elimination
   half-life, 128-hours) than in those who had reached steady-stare (median
   elimination half-life, 48 hours). Our data has provided the basis for a
   population-based pharmacokinetic (POP-PK) model which is intended for
   use as a clinical tool in association with plasma measurements in
   methadone maintenance patients. Conclusions. Using plasma monitoring in
   combination with the application of Bayesian forecasting it should be
   possible to predict trough levels of methadone during daily dosing. The
   model is able to utilize sparse sampling, and two blood samples are
   expected to be sufficient to define patient compliance. Random samples
   during treatment could be used to assess methadone dosing by comparing
   predicted with observed measurements for each individual. The clinical
   tool could therefore help to defect incomplete (failure to consume the
   whole daily dose as prescribed) and poor (due to ingestion of extra
   illicit methadone) compliance as wed as therapeutic failure due to
   drug-drug interactions. Targeting resources in this way could be a
   cost-effective tool for supervision of methadone dosing.}},

Abstract = {{Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter occurring after
   myocardial infarction may occur alone or in association with other
   complications. Whether the arrhythmia portends a poor prognosis
   independent of other complications with contemporary therapy is unknown.
   Methods and Results As port of the Global Use of Strategies To Open
   occluded coronary arteries {[}GUSTO-III) trial, we evaluated whether
   postinfarction complications were associated with the subsequent
   development of AF and whether AF independently predicted death over
   periods of 30 days and 1 year. Information including exact timing was
   collected on deaths and major in-hospital postinfarction complications
   up to 30 days. Of the 13,858 patients with sinus rhythm at enrollment,
   906 later had AF or flutter and 12,952 did not. We compared outcomes
   between these 2 groups, adjusting for differences in baseline
   characteristics and prefibrillation complications. Worsening heart
   failure, hypotension, third-degree heart block, and ventricular
   fibrillation were independent predictors of new-onset AF. The unadjusted
   odds ratio (OR) for death among patients with versus those without AF
   was 2.74 (95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI], 2.56-3.34). After
   adjusting For baseline differences, the OR was reduced to 1.63 (95\% CI,
   1.31-2.02). Adjustment for other in-hospital complications before the
   onset of AF further reduced the OR to 1.49 (95\% CI, 1.17-1.89).
   Conclusions Atrial fibrillation or flutter occurs secondary to other
   postinfarction complications but independently portends a worse
   prognosis. Prevention and management may improve outcome.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, increasing scientific attention has been paid to sea
   mammals as biological indicators of Arctic environmental change. The
   usefulness of animals such as ringed seal (Phoca hispida), harp seal
   (Phoca groenlandica), bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), and harbour
   seal (Phoca vitulina) as indicator species is due to the close
   relationship of their range, reproductive cycles, and life histories to
   sea ice. The behaviour and distribution of these species correlate with
   ice conditions in the areas where the animals are encountered. The
   proportions of seal species represented in archaeological deposits may
   therefore reflect, at least in part, environmental conditions
   characterizing past seascapes.
   This paper examines zooarchaeological data from several Thule and
   historic Inuit archaeological sites in Baffin Island and Labrador, sites
   occupied during the last 700 years, to determine whether regional
   relationships can be demonstrated between subsistence economies, seal
   populations, and sea ice conditions. Ratios of ringed seal, harbour
   seal, bearded seal, and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) bone frequencies from
   several archaeological sites are analyzed and discussed in light of new
   high-resolution proxy sea ice and regional palaeoenvironmental data.
   This exploratory study suggests that characteristics in seal species
   composition reflected in these assemblages can, in some circumstances,
   be correlated with recent sea ice reconstructions. However, a regional
   comparison of a larger number of more precisely dated archaeological
   sites is required for a full examination of these relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is implicated in the pathogenesis of

   administering infusions. We tested oral avian anti-TNF antibodies in the
   acute and chronic phases of a rodent colitis model. Efficacy was
   compared to sulfasalazine and dexamethsone. Rats with chemically induced
   colitis were treated orally with anti-TNF antibody, placebo, or
   comparator. Efficacy was assessed by change in colonic weight,
   morphology, histology, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Oral
   anti-TNF antibody, in both the acute and chronic phases of the model,
   significantly decreased all inflammatory end points and proved to be
   more effective than sulfasalazine and dexamethasone. Oral delivery of
   avian anti-TNF antibodies is an effective treatment of experimental

Abstract = {{1 This study demonstrates the localization of the prostaglandin (PG)D-2
   receptor (DP) within the mucous-secreting globlet cells of the human
   colon by in situ hybridization, which suggests a role for DP in mucous
   secretion. Selective high affinity ligands were used, therefore, to
   evaluate DP regulation of mucous secretion in LS174T human colonic
   adenocarcinoma cells.
   2 The expression of hDP in LS174T cells was confirmed at the mRNA level
   by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and at the protein
   level by radioligand binding assays and signal transduction (cyclic AMP
   accumulation) assays. PGD(2) and the highly selective DP-specific
   agonist L-644,698 ((4-(3-(3-(3-hydroxyoctyl)-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinyl)
   propyl) benzoic acid) (racemate), but not PGE(2) competed for
   {[}H-3]-PGD(2)-specific binding to LS174T cell membranes (K-i values of
   0.4 nM and 7 nM, respectively). The DP-specific agonists PGD(2), PGJ(2),
   BW245C (5-(6-carboxyhexyl)-1-(3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropylhydantoin)),
   and L-644,698 showed similar potencies in stimulating cyclic AMP
   accumulation (EC50 values: 45-90 nM) and demonstrated the expected rank
   order of potency. PGE(2) also elicited cyclic AMP production in this
   cell line (EC50 value: 162 nM).
   3 The activation of cyclic AMP production by PGD(2) and L-644,698, but
   not PGE(2), was inhibited by the selective DP antagonist BW A868C. Thus,
   PGD(2) and L-644,698 act through hDP in LS174T cells. PGD(2), L-644,698
   and PGE(2) tan established mucin secretagogue) potently stimulated mucin
   secretion in LS174T cells in a concentration-dependent manner
   (EC50<50nM). However, BW A868C effectively antagonized only the mucin
   secretion mediated by PGD(2) and L-644,698 and not PGE(2). These data
   support a role for the DP receptor in the regulation of mucous
   secretion.}},

   suitable for the preparation of PZT thin films. To study the sol
   structure evolution gas chromatography mass spectrum (GC-MS) and
   Fourier-transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded and analyzed on
   each step of the synthesis. The rheological behavior and the stability
   of the stock sol were checked using a rheometer. It is observed that the
   addition of acetone leads to a very stable stock sol. The preliminary
   investigation of the electric properties of the obtained PZT thin films
   showed that the crystallized films deposited from a fresh prepared sol

Abstract = {{Two subunits of the IL-12 receptor (IL-12R), IL-12R beta1 and IL-12R
   beta2, have been identified and cloned. Previous studied dem
   demonstrated that the IL-12R beta1 subunit was required for mouse T and
   NK cells to respond to IL-12 in vivo. To investigate the role of IL-12R
   beta2 in IL-12 signaling, we have generated IL-12R beta2-deficient
   (IL-12R beta2(-/-)) mice by targeted mutation in embryonic stem (ES)
   cells, Although Con A-activated splenocytes from IL-12R beta2(-/-) mice
   still bind IL-12 with both high and low affinity, no IL-12-induced
   biological functions can be detected, Con A-activated splenocytes of
   IL-12R beta2(-/-) mice failed to produce IFN-gamma or proliferate in
   response to IL-12 stimulation. NK lytic activity of IL-12R beta2(-/-)
   splenocytes was not induced when incubated with IL-12, IL-12R beta2(-/-)
   splenocytes were deficient in IFN-gamma secretion when stimulated with
   either Con A or anti-CD3 mAb in vitro, Furthermore, IL-12R beta2(-/-)
   mice were deficient in vivo in their ability to produce IFN-gamma
   following endotoxin administration and to generate a type I cytokine
   response, IL-12-mediated signal transduction was also defective as
   measured by phosphorylation of STAT4, These results demonstrate that
   although mouse IL-12R beta1 is the subunit primarily responsible for
   binding IL-12, IL-12R beta2 plays an essential role in mediating the
   biological functions of IL-12 in mice.}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: The effects of gastroesophageal reflux on airway
   hyperresponsiveness in patients with bronchial asthma have yet to be
   studied in significant detail. The purpose of the present study was to
   determine how esophageal acid perfusion could change airway
   responsiveness in patients with bronchial asthma.
   Patients and interventions: In seven patients with bronchial asthma
   (mean +/- SD age, 55.1 +/- 6.4 years; four women and three men),
   esophageal pH was monitored by a pH meter and airway responsiveness was
   evaluated by aerosol inhalation of methacholine, during esophageal
   perfusion through an esophageal tube filled with either saline solution
   or 0.1N hydrochloric acid (HCl), the order of which was selected at
   random, in 1-week intervals. Spirometry was also performed during
   esophageal pH monitoring.
   Results: A significant decrease in the geometric mean of airway
   sensitivity or the concentration of methacholine causing a 35\% fall in
   respiratory conductance was observed during esophageal HCl perfusion
   compared with that of saline solution perfusion (p < 0.01 or p < 0.003),
   although no significant changes were observed in vital capacity, FEV1,
   peak expiratory flow, respiratory resistance, or slope of respiratory
   conductance during the periods of saline solution and HCl perfusion.
   Conclusion: We concluded that an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness
   was induced when HCl stimulated the esophagus in patients with bronchial
   asthma. These results suggest that esophageal reflux is one of the
   important factors that aggravate asthmatic status.}},

Abstract = {{Diaphragmatic hernia was created in 39 rabbit fetuses on day 23 of

   was found between CTR and SHAM fetuses at term, CDH fetuses had smaller
   lungs (LBWR 0.014 +/- 0.004 versus 0.030 +/- 0.04 in CTR, P < 0.0001), a

Abstract = {{This paper provides an estimate of the waste-activated sludge hoc
   interior permeability on the basis of observing the motion of individual
   floc moving vertically towards an impermeable flat plate. The fluid flow
   fields surrounding and inside the floc were modeled numerically, from
   which the hydrodynamic drag force was calculated. The experimental data
   correlate with the numerical solutions regardless of the floc Reynolds
   number. Over the floc size range investigated in this paper, the
   permeability is noted to be approximately proportional to the square of
   floc size, ranging from 2.5 x 10(-9) to 9 x 10(-6) m(2) for floc size
   ranging from 150 to 10 000 mum The structure of waste-activated sludge
   floc is proposed as a multi-fractal. Permeability measured in this work
   is thereby mainly attributed to the global structure level of the flocs.

Abstract = {{Small (N2B) and large (N2BA) cardiac titin isoforms are differentially
   expressed in a species-specific and heart location-specific manner, To
   understand how differential expression of titin isoforms may influence
   passive stiffness of cardiac muscle we investigated the mechanical
   properties of mouse left ventricular (MLV) wall muscle (expressing
   predominantly the small titin isoform), bovine left atrial (BLA) wall
   muscle (predominantly the large isoform), and bovine left ventricular
   (BLV) wall muscle (expressing small and large isoforms at similar
   levels). Results indicate that the overall passive muscle stiffness of
   the muscle types varies nearly ten-ford, with stiffness increasing in
   the following order: BLA, BLV and MLV. To investigate the basis of the
   variation in the overall muscle stiffness, the contributions of titin
   and collagen to muscle stiffness were determined. Results showed that
   increased muscle stiffness results from increases in both titin- and
   collagen-based passive stiffness, indicating that titin and collagen
   change in a co-ordinated fashion. The expression level of the small
   titin isoform correlates with titin's contribution to overall muscle
   stiffness, suggesting that differential expression of titin isoforms is
   an effective means to modulate the filling behavior of the heart. (C)

Abstract = {{Sol-gel technology,because of the use of homogeneous liquid solutions
   and the ability to form gels at room temperature, provides an attractive
   route to the preparation of a three-dimensional inorganic
   network,especially films. A three-dimensional network of
   organic/inorganic hybrid nonlinear optical (NLO) materials can be
   prepared by doping optically active organics into sol-gel liquid
   solution or bonding organic chromophores with inorganics at the
   temperature below decomposition temperature (T-d) of organic
   chromophores without risking the degradation of organic components. The
   properties of hybrid NLO materials can be tailored by changing the
   starting chromophores. The three-dimensional networks can restrict the
   dipole alignment relaxation of NLO chromphores,so the resulting NLO
   materials have high NLO susceptibility,low optical loss,high glass
   transition temperatures and good high-temperature stability. In this
   report, a new kind of bonded organic/inorganic hybrid NLO materials
   (DO3BSD) containing 4-Nitro-4'-amino azobenzene was synthesized through
   sol-gel process by using gamma -glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane (KH560)
   as intermediates. The preparation process and quality of DO3ASD were
   studied and characterized by FTIR,H-1-NMR, UV-VIS, TGA, DSC, SEM and SHG
   measurements. The results show that this bonded polymer film has a high
   NLO coefficient (d(33)) Of 5.79 X 10(-7) esu,and exhibit good SHG
   stability,the d(33) values can maintain about 93.5\% of its initial
   value at room temperature for 90 days, and can maintain about 60\% at
   100 degreesC for 300min. These facts demonstrated that the chemical
   bonding of the chromophores to the SiO2 networks can effectively reduce
   the dipole alignment relaxation of chromophores,thus lead to a better
   orientational stability.}},

   nonlinear structure and unknown disturbances is selected for our
   investigation, and some concrete answers are obtained in this paper. In
   particular, we find that in the space of unknown nonlinear functions,
   the generalized Lipschitz norm is a suitable measure for characterizing
   the size of the structure uncertainty, and that the maximum uncertainty
   that can be dealt with by the feedback mechanism is described by a ball
   with radius 3/2 + root2 in this normed function space.}},

Abstract = {{Rat brain phospholipase D1 (rPLD1) has two highly conserved motifs
   {[}H(X)K(X)(4)D, denoted HKD] located at the N-terminal and C-terminal
   halves, which are required for activity. Association of the two halves
   is essential for rPLD1 activity, which probably brings the two HKD
   domains together to form a catalytic center. In the present study, we
   find that an intact C-terminus is also essential for the catalytic
   activity of rPLD1. Serial deletion of the last four amino acids, EVWT,
   which are conserved in all mammalian PLD isoforms, abolished the
   catalytic activity of rPLD1. This loss of catalytic activity was not due
   to a lack of association of the N-terminal and C-terminal halves.
   Mutations of the last three amino acids showed that substitutions with
   charged or less hydrophobic amino acids all reduced PLD activity. For
   example, mutations of Thr1036 and Va11034 to Asp or Lys caused marked
   inactivation, whereas mutation to other amino acids had less effect.
   Mutation of Trp1035 to Leu, Ala, His or Tyr caused complete
   inactivation, whereas mutation of Glu1033 to Ala enhanced activity. The
   size of the amino acids at the C-terminus also affected the catalytic
   activity of PLD, reduced activity being observed with conservative
   mutations within the EVWT sequence (such as T/S, V/L or W/F). The enzyme
   was also inactivated by the addition of Ala or Val to the C-terminus of
   this sequence. Interestingly, the inactive C-terminal mutants could be
   complemented by cotransfection with a wild-type C-terminal half to
   restore PLD activity in vivo. These data demonstrate that the integrity
   of the C-terminus of rPLD1 is essential for its catalytic activity.
   Important features are the hydrophobicity, charge and size of the four
   conserved C-terminal amino acids. It is proposed that these play
   important roles in maintaining a functional catalytic structure by
   interacting with a specific domain within rPLD1.}},

Abstract = {{An amperometric detector with two working electrodes both modified with
   polydiphenylamine-dodecyl sulfate (PDPA-DS) was successfully used for
   the simultaneous determination of electroinactive anions (SO42-, Cl-,
   NO3-) and cations (Na+, NH4+ and K+) in single-column ion-exclusion
   cation-exchange chromatography (IEC-GEC). The PDPA-DS chemical modified
   electrode (CME) was based on the incorporation of dodecyl sulfate (DS)
   into PDPA by electropolymerization of diphenylamine in the presence of
   sodium dodecyl sulfate. The electrochemical responses against the anions
   and cations at the PDPA-DS CME in differential pulse voltammetry were
   studied. A set of well-defined peaks of electroinactive anions and
   cations were obtained. The anions and cations were detected conveniently
   and reproducibly in a linear concentration range 0.01-5.0 mmol/L and
   their detection limits were in the range 5-9 mu mol/L at a
   signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3). The proposed method was quick,

Abstract = {{We compared the cytotoxic activities of thymus-dependent and

   which are foreign antigen specific, acquired cytotoxic activity to tumor
   cells with a basal dose of the antigen peptides and to hybridoma cells

   cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). In contrast, thymus-independent CD8(+) T
   cells, which have been shown to be self-antigen specific, never showed
   cytotoxic activity to the target cells with a basal dose of the
   self-antigen peptide, while they could lyse hybridoma cells expressing

   ex vivo cytotoxic activity of thymus-independent CD8(+) T cells was also

   peptides, which were not lysed by freshly isolated thymus-dependent
   CD8(+) T cells. Thus it is revealed that thymus-independent,

Abstract = {{1 In urinary bladder, M-2-muscarinic receptors predominate, but it is
   the smaller population of M-3- receptors which mediate detrusor
   contraction. This study examines the M-2:M-3 ratio and the role of
   M-2-receptors in contraction of pig urinary bladder.
   2 Competition experiments with {[}H-3]-QNB determined the ratio of
   M-2:M-3 In functional studies, affinity values (pK(B)) for 4-DAMP,
   darifenacin and methoctramine were calculated. Similar experiments were
   performed on tissues following selective M-3-inactivation (incubation
   with 40 nM 4-DAMP mustard in the presence of 1 muM methoctramine to
   protect M-2-receptors). precontraction with 50 mM KCl and relaxation
   with isoprenaline (30 muM) or forskolin (1 muM).
   3 In competition binding, displacement of {[}H-3]-QNB by 4-DAMP,
   darifenacin and methoctramine best fitted a two-site model suggesting a
   predominant (70-80\%) population of M-2-receptors.
   4 On normal detrusor in vitro, 4-DAMP and methoctramine caused
   surmountable antagonism of responses to carbachol with pK(B) values of
   9.37+/-0.07 and 6.05+/-0.05 respectively. Darifenacin caused
   unsurmountable antagonism, the apparent pK(B) value being 8.61+/-0.10.
   5 In tissues where the M-3-receptors had been inactivated and cyclic AMP
   levels elevated, 4-DAMP and darifenacin were less potent, with apparent
   pK(B) values of 8.72+/-0.08 and 6.74+/-0.07. In contrast, methoctramine
   was more potent, the apparent pK(B) value increasing significantly to
   6.86 +/- 0.06.
   6 These data suggest that the pig bladder possesses a similar muscarinic
   receptor population to the human bladder and that the M-3-receptor
   subtype mediates contraction of the normal detrusor muscle. However an
   involvement of M-2-receptors in contraction can be observed following
   pharmacological manipulation of the receptor population.}},

Abstract = {{The impinging jet technique, a direct microscopic observation method, is
   presented to fundamentally study micron bubble attachment onto a solid
   surface (collector) under well-controlled stagnation flow conditions.
   The bubble-collector attachment near the stagnation point of an
   impinging jet is analogous to bubble-fine solid interaction, which is of
   interest to flotation processes. In this work, bubble attachment
   experiments were conducted for sodium chloride solutions with various
   concentrations (10(-1)-10(-4) M) and pH values (2.5-9.0) under a fixed
   flow intensity tin terms of Reynolds number Re = 200). In addition; the
   effect of metal ion valence on the bubble attachment was examined as
   well. Results have showed that the bubble attachment flux was dependent
   on both solution concentration (ionic strength) and pH, suggesting a
   strong impact of the electrostatic double layer interaction. In the
   presence of multivalent metal ions, the bubble attachment rate was
   noticeably enhanced.}},

Abstract = {{Differential confocal microscopy (DCM), a non-interferometric
   profilometry, is first extended to be used in a fibre optical confocal
   scanning microscope (FOCSM) system. Errors of DCM in a FOCSM system are
   theoretically analysed in detail. Analytical results show that the
   optimum system parameters should be chosen in order to keep the
   measurement error low and the profilometry efficient. Experimentally,
   the surface of a reflection grating was measured with nanometre depth
   resolution. In addition, we develop DCM to determine the surface heights
   of inhomogeneous samples. The approach is used to profile the surface of
   a coated compact disk and the overlay structure of a test bar. The
   experimental result also shows that, for measurement of the surface of a
   sharp edged sample, the approach will be an alternative technique for
   use to generate an edge enhanced profiling image.}},

Abstract = {{Although plasma norepinephrine (NE) increases and hepatocellular
   function is depressed during early sepsis, it is unknown whether gut is
   a significant source of NE and, if so, whether gut-derived NE helps
   produce hepatocellular dysfunction. We subjected rats to sepsis by cecal
   ligation and puncture (CLP), and 2 h later (i.e., early sepsis) portal
   and systemic blood samples were collected and plasma levels of NE were
   assayed. Other rats were enterectomized before CLP. Hepatocellular
   function was assessed with an in vivo indocyanine green (ICG) clearance
   technique, systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha,
   interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 were determined, and the effect of NE
   on hepatic ICG clearance capacity was assessed in an isolated, perfused
   liver preparation. Portal levels of NE were significantly higher than
   systemic levels at 2 h after CLP. Prior enterectomy reduced NE levels in
   septic animals. Thus gut appears to be the major source of NE release
   during sepsis. Enterectomy before sepsis also attenuated hepatocellular
   dysfunction and downregulated TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. Perfusion
   of the isolated livers with 20 nM NE (similar to that observed in
   sepsis) significantly reduced ICG clearance capacity. These results
   suggest that gut-derived NE plays a significant role in hepatocellular
   dysfunction and upregulating inflammatory cytokines. Modulation of NE
   release and/or hepatic responsiveness to NE should provide a novel
   approach for maintaining hepatocellular function in sepsis.}},

   tract is less sensitive to preoperative concurrent radiation and

Abstract = {{Background: The prognosis of upper thoracic esophageal cancer is poor
   when compared with middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer because
   the tumor easily infiltrates the respiratory tract and surgical enbloc
   resection is difficult. Recently, preoperative chemoradiation therapy
   has been shown to lead to down-staging of the disease and improve
   prognosis. But the benefit of this therapy for tumors infiltrating the
   respiratory tract remains unknown.
   Study Design: Fifty-six patients with thoracic esophageal cancer
   infiltrating neighboring organs, but with no hematogeneous metastasis,
   were given preoperative concurrent chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and
   cisplatin) and radiation (40 Gy) therapy. When a clinical response was
   observed, making a curative resection potentially possible, patients
   were scheduled for esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy. Patient
   prognosis with respect to the organs infiltrated by the tumors was
   estimated by calculating survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method
   and comparing the curves by the log-rank test.
   Results: The prognosis was significantly poorer for patients with tumors
   infiltrating the respiratory tract (T) or aorta plus respiratory tract
   (A + T) than for patients with tumors infiltrating the aorta alone (A)
   or other organs (Oth) (p < 0.05 for Oth versus T; p < 0.05 for Oth
   versus A + T; p < 0.0001 for A versus T; p < 0.0001 for A versus A + T
   by log-rank test). Patients positive for respiratory tract invasion (T,
   T + A), compared with those negative for respiratory tract invasion (A,
   Oth), showed a poorer clinical response to chemo-radiation (3.0\%,
   45.5{''}/o, 39.4\%, and 9.1\% versus 4.3\%, 82.6\%, 4.3\%, and 8.7\% in
   complete response (CR), partial response (PR), nonresponse (NC) and
   progressive disease (PD), respectively, p = 0.0156) and surgical
   resectability (36.4\% vs. 87.0\%, p = 0.0003). Histologic effectiveness
   (8.3\%, 50.0\%, and 41.7\% versus 25.0\%, 70.0\%, and 5.0\% in grade 3,
   grade 2, and grade 1, respectively for patients with respiratory tract
   invasion versus those without it, p = 0.0189) and histologic stages
   (8.3\%, 8.3\%, 8.3\%, 8.3\%, 25.0\%, and 41.7\% versus 20.0\%, 0\%,
   15.0\%, 25.0\%, 40.0\%, and 0\% in pathologic CR, stage I, stage IIA,
   stage IIB, stage III, and stage IV, respectively, for patients with
   respiratory tract invasion versus those without it, p = 0.0496) were
   significantly better in patients negative for respiratory tract
   invasion; the percentages of patients with lymph node metastasis did not
   differ significantly between the two groups. Comparison of the
   recurrence patterns showed that local failure was most common in
   patients with respiratory tract invasion, and distant failure was the
   leading cause of recurrence in patients without it.
   Conclusions: Because the prognosis of patients with thoracic esophageal
   cancer infiltrating the respiratory tract is extremely poor, partially
   because of the low local effectiveness of preoperative concurrent
   chemotherapy and radiation therapy, caution is needed when deciding on
   salvage surgery. (J Am Coll Surg 2000; 191:626-634. (C) 2000 by the

Abstract = {{The projection iterative method (PIM) is convergence guaranteed when
   applied to solve the MoM equations with nonsingular matrices. Its
   decomposition procedure divides the matrix into some small subregions to
   avoid large matrix inversions. It is found that the convergent rate can
   be accelerated by introducing the relaxation factor to the PIM
   formulation. Three 3D examples are investigated to show the performance
   and validation of the PIM on electromagnetic scattering problems. A 2D
   infinite circular cylinder with TE field illumination is also studied to
   show the convergence of the method. The relationship of various PIM
   related parameters, such as the normalised residual norm, the number of
   iterations, the number of divided subregions, and the relaxation factor,
   is studied and presented. It is concluded that the operation count of
   the accelerated PIM is usually comparable to the direct method and the
   PIM can predict the RCS faster than the direct method with a reasonable
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Repair of DNA double-strand breaks is essential for maintenance of
   genomic stability, and is specifically required for rearrangement of
   immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) loci during development of
   the immune system. Abnormalities in these repair processes also
   contribute to oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements that underlie many
   lymphoid malignancies. Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare
   autosomal recessive condition characterized by immunodeficiency,
   radiation sensitivity, and increased predisposition to lymphoid cancers
   bearing oncogenic Ig and TCR locus translocations. NBS patients fail to
   produce nibrin, a protein required for the nuclear localization and
   function of a DNA repair complex that includes Mre11 and Rad50. Mre11
   has biochemical properties that suggest a potential role in V(D)J
   recombination. We studied V(D)J recombination in NBS cells in vitro and
   in vivo, using cell lines and peripheral blood leukocyte DNA from NBS
   patients. We found that NBS cells were competent to rejoin signal
   substrates with normal efficiency and high fidelity. Coding substrates
   were similarly rejoined efficiently, and coding end structures appeared
   normal. In B cells from NBS patients, the spectrums of IgH CDR3 regions
   were diverse and normally distributed. Moreover, the lengths and
   composition of Ig kappa VJ joins and IgH VDJ joins derived from NBS and
   normal subjects were indistinguishable. Our data indicate that nibrin
   plays no essential role in V(D)J recombination and is not required for
   the generation of an apparently diverse B cell repertoire. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Effects of IFN-gamma on mammalian small intestinal ion transport were
   studied in vitro using incubated sheets of murine small intestine in
   Ussing chambers. In oxygenated standard culture medium containing
   hydrocortisone and antibiotics, they maintained their short-circuit
   current (Isc) responses to glucose and theophylline for 48 h.
   Histological examination revealed a 50\% diminution of villus height
   over 36 h but no change in crypts. Height was better maintained during a
   36-h incubation of small intestine from SCID mice, suggesting a role for
   B or T lymphocytes in villus atrophy. Exposure of small intestine to 100
   U/ml IFN-gamma for 36 h decreased basal Isc by 40\% and Isc responses to
   glucose and theophylline by similar to 70\%; at 1,000 U/ml for 36 h,
   IFN-gamma inhibited these Isc responses by 90\%. An inhibitor of
   inducible NO synthase did not reverse these effects, suggesting that
   they are not mediated by NO. Tissue resistance, mucosal K+ content, and
   epithelial morphology were not affected. Ouabain-sensitive ATPase
   activity in homogenates was inhibited 60\% by IFN-gamma (100 U/ml for 36
   h). IFN-gamma inhibition of Isc responses to glucose and theophylline
   also occurred in SCID mouse small intestine. Thus murine small
   intestinal sheets can be maintained viable in vitro for at least 48 h,
   although villus blunting develops (but less so in SCID mouse small
   intestine). Also, prolonged exposure to IFN-gamma downregulates
   Na+-coupled glucose absorption, active Cl- secretion, and Na+-K+-ATPase
   activity, effects unlikely to be mediated by enhanced NO.}},

   central region (149 to 505 amino acids) within spMex67p that associates
   with a complex containing Rae1p that complements growth and mRNA export
   defects of the rae1-167 Delta mex67 synthetic lethality. This region is
   devoid of RNA-binding, N-terminal nuclear localization, and the
   C-terminal nuclear pore complex-targeting regions. The (149-505)-green
   fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion is found diffused throughout the cell.
   Overexpression of spMex67p inhibits growth and mRNA export and results
   in the redistribution of the diffused localization of the (149-505)-GFP
   fusion to the nucleus and the nuclear periphery. These results suggest
   that spMex67p competes for essential mRNA export factor(s). Finally we
   propose that the 149-505 region of spMex67p could act as an accessory
   factor in Rae1p-dependent transport and that spMex67p participates at
   various common steps with Rae1p export complexes in promoting the export
   of mRNA.}},

   shock is described in this paper. The erosion of the SiCf/SiC composites
   and TiC + TiN coatings under thermal shock is less than that of WC, TiN,
   TiC and B4C coatings. The surface of multi-are ion coating (MAIC) TiC,
   TiN and TiC + TiN coatings under thermal shock has cracks due to the
   interface between coating and substrate. The ion beam enhanced
   deposition (IBED) TIC coatings and plasma spraying coating (PSC) B4C and
   WC coatings under thermal shock do not have cracks. It seems that these
   coatings approximate to three-dimensional heat transfer. The surface of
   2D Hi-Nicalon SiCf/SiC composites under thermal shock indicates
   sublimation and trace melting. The melting region is only presented in
   the matrix, and the fiber retained its integrity. This means that the
   matrix has poor thermal diffusivity, especially for interface damage

Abstract = {{The Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS III B) is an autosomal recessive
   disease caused by deficiency of alpha -N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC
   3.2.1.50), one of the lysosomal enzymes required for the degradation of
   heparan sulfate. The disease is characterized by profound
   neurodegeneration but relatively mild somatic manifestations, and is
   usually fatal in the second decade, A mouse model had been generated by
   disruption of the Naglu gene in order to facilitate the study of
   pathogenesis and the development of therapy for this currently
   untreatable disease. Recombinant human alpha -N-acetylglucosaminidase
   (rhNAGLU) was prepared from secretions of Lec1 mutant Chinese hamster
   ovary cells. The enzyme, which has only unphosphorylated high-mannose
   carbohydrate chains, was endocytosed by mouse peritoneal macrophages via
   mannose receptors, with half-maximal uptake at ca, 10(-7) IM. When
   administered intravenously to 3 month-old mice, rhNAGLU was taken up
   avidly by liver and spleen but marginally if at all by thymus, lung,
   kidney, heart, and brain (in order of diminishing uptake). The half-life
   of the enzyme was 2.5 days in liver and spleen. Immunohistochemistry and
   electron microscopy showed that only macrophages were involved in enzyme
   uptake and correction in these two organs, yet the storage of
   glycosaminoglycan was reduced to almost normal levels. The results show

Abstract = {{Striated muscle is typically not mentioned in histology chapters of most
   dermatology and dermatopathology books. In others, authors only speak of
   its presence in the dermis or subcutis but do not provide any details
   about its quantity, distribution, or orientation. In the course of an
   investigation concerning regional histologic variations of the skin, the
   presence of striated muscle fibers (StrMFs) has been a noteworthy
   feature of many areas of the face. Striated muscle fibers are a normal
   constituent of the dermis of the eyebrow (few and deep fibers); eyelid
   and nose (excluding the nasal tip) (numerous and deep fibers); and lips
   and chin (numerous, vertical, and more superficial fibers). They are
   also found in the subcutis of all these areas with some differences in
   density and distribution among them. Striated muscle fibers form a
   compact layer beneath the subcutaneous fat on the forehead and cheek,
   but because of their deep location, they are rarely included in
   cutaneous biopsy specimens of the latter area. Mainly based on the
   presence of StrMFs in the dermis, an algorithm to accurately determine
   the location of biopsy specimens from the face has been elaborated. With
   the aid of other features such as the type of hair follicles and the
   presence and degree of solar elastosis, the sex and approximate age of
   the patient can be established in many cases. Some practical and
   scientific consequences of these findings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In utero exposure to cocaine may result in altered neuronal development.
   Our previous studies demonstrated cocaine inhibits neurite outgrowth in
   NGF-induced PC12 cells through dopamine, by activation of D-1 receptors.
   This study examined where cocaine interferes in the NGF signaling
   cascade. GSras1 cells that inducibly express activated forms of Pas upon
   treatment with dexamethasone were used. Morphological differentiation
   was quantified by counting cells bearing neurite-like processes after 72
   h exposure to either dexamethasone or NGF alone, or with cocaine,
   dopamine or SKF-38393. Cocaine, dopamine, and the D-1 agonist inhibited
   neurite-like process outgrowth in both dexamethasone and NGF-induced
   GSras1 cells. GAP-43 expression, used as a measure for biochemical
   differentiation was severely diminished in NGF and dexamethasone-induced
   GSras1 cells treated with cocaine. These results suggest that cocaine,
   dopamine and activation of D-1 receptors affect the NGF signaling
   downstream, independent of ras expression, leading to altered neuronal
   differentiation. (C) 2000 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of a glutamine-supplemented amino acid
   mixture on vastus lateralis muscle protein synthesis rate in healthy
   young men and women. Three men and 3 women (27.8 +/- 2.0 yr, 22.2 +/-
   1.0 body mass index {[}BMI], 56.1 +/- 4.5 kg lean body mass {[}LBM])
   received a 14-hour primed, constant intravenous infusion of
   L{[}1-C-13]leucine to evaluate the fractional rate of mixed muscle
   protein synthesis. In addition to tracer administration, a clinically
   relevant amino acid mixture supplemented with either glutamine or
   glycine in amounts isonitrogenous to glutamine, was infused. Amino acid
   mixtures were infused on separate occasions in random order at a rate of
   0.04 g/kg/h (glutamine at similar to0.01 g/kg/h) with at least 2 weeks
   between treatment. For 2 days before and on the day of an infusion,
   dietary intake was controlled so that each subject received 1.5 g
   protein/kg/d. Com pared with our previous report in the postabsorptive
   state, amino acid infusion increased the fractional rate of mixed muscle
   protein synthesis by 48\% (P <.05); however, the addition of glutamine
   to the amino acid mixture did not further elevate muscle protein
   synthesis rate (ie, 0.071\% +/- 0.008\%/h for amino acids + glutamine v
   0.060\% a 0.008\%/h for amino acids + glycine; P =.316). Plasma
   glutamine concentrations were higher (P <.05) during the
   glutamine-supplemented infusion, but free intramuscular glutamine levels
   were not increased (P =.363). Both plasma and free intramuscular glycine
   levels were increased when extra glycine was included in the infused
   amino acid mixture (both P <.0001). We conclude that intravenous
   infusion of amino acids increases the fractional rate of mixed muscle
   protein synthesis, but addition of glutamine to the amino acid mixture
   does not further stimulate muscle protein synthesis rate in healthy
   young men and women. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B. Saunders Company.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer incidence rates for Swedish twins born between 1928 and 1965 and
   who both were alive at age 30 are studied by means of bivariate frailty
   models. Altogether, 7,280 fraternal (DZ) and 4,699 identical (MZ) twin
   pairs were followed up through December 31, 1995, for cancer status. The
   association between cancer incidence rates was statistically greater
   among the MZ than among the DZ pairs and stronger between women than
   between men; however, the magnitude of this association is relatively
   small and decreases over time. The relative decrease in dependency
   (association) is most easily detected using shared frailty models but
   may also be demonstrated, at least for women, using correlated frailty
   models. We also demonstrate that estimates of the correlation
   coefficient are similar when using any correlated frailty models derived
   from the power variance family but that these estimates disagree
   regarding the age at which the dependence is most important. The
   relative importance of dependence across age may sometimes be more
   interesting than the correlation coefficient itself. The latter may
   usually be estimated using alternative methods. Furthermore, when
   estimating correlation coefficients close to the boundary of the
   parameter space, simulation studies indicate that the correlated inverse
   Gaussian frailty model is more robust than the gamma frailty model. (C)

Abstract = {{The many applications of Monte Carlo modeling in nuclear medicine
   Imaging make it desirable to increase the accuracy and computational
   speed of Monte Carlo codes. The accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations
   strongly depends on the accuracy in the probability functions and, thus,
   on the cross-section libraries used for photon-transport calculations. A
   comparison between different photon cross-section libraries and
   parameterizations implemented in Monte Carlo simulation packages
   developed for positron emission tomography and the most recent Evaluated
   Photon Data Library (EPDL97) developed by the Lawrence Livermore
   National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, was performed for several human
   tissues and common detector materials for energies from I keV to 1 MeV.
   Different photon cross-section libraries and parameterizations show
   quite large variations when compared to the EPDL97 coefficients. This
   latter library is the more up-to-date complete and consistent library
   available, and was carefully designed in the form of look-up tables
   providing efficient data storage, access, and management. EPDL97 is
   already a standard in the nuclear reactor industry. Its use as a
   standard in the simulation of medical imaging systems will help to
   eliminate potential differences between the results obtained with
   different codes. Together with the optimization of the computing time
   performances of the Monte Carlo software package, Eidolon, photon
   transport in three-dimensional (3-D) positron emission tomography could
   be efficiently modeled to develop accurate scatter models and better
   understand scatter correction techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The oroclinal axial fold-thrust mountain belt has notable features in
   the geology of Pakistan. The southern part of this belt is of particular
   importance because it includes the southern branch of the main Himalayan
   ophiolitic zone, the Bela ophiolites, and its continuation into the
   Arabian Sea. A number of geological models and hypotheses have been
   proposed for explanation of the tectonic setting of the area based on
   surface geological investigations. A gravity study was carried out to
   provide a model for the tectonic setting of the investigated area. The
   results of interactive gravity modeling point to the underthrusting of a
   narrow segment of the Arabian oceanic plate (Bela-Hingol micro-oceanic
   plate) under the western rifted margin of the Indo-Pakistan
   subcontinental plate, characterized by a well developed accretionary
   wedge, an ophiolite complex and a tectonically eroded green schist unit
   derived from the over-ridding continental plate.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a systematic investigation on the adsorption of
   polyethylene oxide (PEO) onto the surface of silica particles and the
   viscosity behavior of concentrated dispersions of silica particles with
   adsorbed PEO has been performed. The variation of shear viscosity with
   the adsorbed layer density, concentration of free polymer in the
   solution (depletion forces), polymer molecular weight, and adsorbed
   layer thickness at different salt concentrations (range of the
   electrostatic repulsion between particles) is presented and discussed.
   Adsorption and rheological studies were performed on suspensions of
   silica particles dispersed in solutions of 10(-2) M and 10(-4) M NaNO3
   containing PEO of molecular weights 7,500 and 18,500 of different
   concentrations. Adsorption measurements gave evidence of a primary
   plateau in the adsorption density of 7,500 MW PEO at an electrolyte
   concentration of 10(-2) M NaNO3. Results indicate that the range of the
   electrostatic repulsion between the suspended particles affects both
   adsorption density of the polymer onto the surface of the particles and
   the viscosity behavior of the system. The adsorbed layer thickness was
   estimated from the values of zeta potential in the presence and absence
   of the polymer and was found to decrease with decreasing the range of
   the electrostatic repulsive forces between the particles. Experimental
   results show that even though there is a direct relation between the
   viscosity of the suspension and the adsorption density of the polymer
   onto the surface of the particles, variation of viscosity with
   adsorption density, equilibrium concentration of the polymer, and range
   of the electrostatic repulsion cannot be explained just in term of the
   effective volume fraction of the particles and needs to be further
   investigated.}},

   Personality Disorders (DIPD-IV). Fair-good median interrater kappa
   (.40-.75) were found for all axis II disorders diagnosed five times or
   more, except antisocial personality disorder (1.0). AU of the
   test-retest kappa for axis II disorders, except for narcissistic
   personality disorder (1.0) and paranoid personality disorder (.39), were
   also found to be fair-good. Interrater and test-retest dimensional
   reliability figures for axis II were generally higher than those for
   their categorical counterparts; most were in the excellent range (>.75).
   In terms of axis I, excellent median interrater kappa were found for six
   of the 10 disorders diagnosed five times or more, whereas fair-good
   median interrater kappa were found for the other four axis I disorders.
   In general, test-retest reliability figures for axis I disorders were
   somewhat lower than the interrater reliability figures. Three
   test-retest kappa were in the excellent range, six were in the fair-good

Abstract = {{Photonic slot routing (PSR) has been proposed as an approach to
   implement an all-optical packet-switched network in a manner which is
   scalable and not overly complex. In PSR, packets are transmitted within
   a basic transport unit referred to as a:photonic slot. The photonic slot
   is fixed in length and spans multiple wavelengths. Each photonic slot is
   routed through the network as a single entity; thus, individual
   wavelengths do not need to be multiplexed or demultiplexed at
   intermediate nodes through which the photonic slot is traversing, When
   implementing PSR in a mesh environment, a number of significant issues
   must be addressed. Two such issues are fairness and contention
   resolution. In this study, we propose a novel approach for allocating
   capacity on each link in a fair manner, and we investigate various
   approaches, such as buffering and deflection, for handling contention.
   We develop an analytical model to evaluate the performance of such
   networks, and validate the analysis through simulation. It is shown that
   the proposed capacity allocation approach can significantly reduce
   contention in the network and provide a fair allocation of bandwidth to
   each source-destination pair.}},

Abstract = {{Brown cells that are found in the red glands of Mercenaria mercenaria
   accumulate, detoxify and excrete cadmium. Brown cell involvement in
   metal detoxification was due in part to endogenous glutathione (GSH) and
   protein sulfhydryl. Metallothionein (MT) and GSH have been shown to play
   an important role in metal detoxification in bivalve molluscs. This
   study showed that the protein sulfhydryl in brown cells of Mercenaria
   was in fact MT, that brown cell GSH functioned in acute protection
   against Cd2+ toxicity, that GSH provided the initial defense against
   Cd2+ toxicity prior to MT induction and that MT variants were unequal in
   response to Cd2+. During treatment of Mercenaria with 0.5 and 1.0 ppm
   Cd2+, brown cells were analyzed for MT by capillary electrophoresis and
   GSH colorimetrically after 0.25, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days. The data indicated
   that the cadmium-binding protein was MT with an apparent molecular
   weight of 9 kDa determined by gel filtration or 6 kDa as indicated by
   capillary electrophoresis. Glutathione appeared to prevail in the brown
   cell acute response to 0.5 ppm Cd2+, whereas MT appeared to prevail in
   the acute response to 1.0 ppm Cd2+. Capillary electrophoresis can be
   used to monitor and quantify MT and its variants in brown cells without
   need for prior separation of cytosolic components by chromatography. The
   change in MT-II was greater relative to the change in MT-I in the brown
   cell acute response to 0.5 ppm Cd2+, whereas the change in MT-I was
   greater relative to the change in MT-IT in the acute response to 1.0 ppm
   Cd2+. The variants of brown cell MT appeared to respond differentially
   to Cd2+ depending upon the Cd2+ treatment concentration. Published by

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of a heat exchanger network (HEN)
   retrofit considering process changes. Traditionally it is a common
   practice to fix process conditions before a HEN is retrofitted. However,
   it has been realized that there exists strong interactions between HENs
   and processes, and it should simultaneously consider the changes to
   process conditions (e.g. flow rates, temperatures) and the HEN retrofit.
   In this paper, new insights for process changes and their impacts an HEN
   retrofit have been-developed and the T-H diagram is used to represent
   the interactions. On the basis of the newly developed understanding, a
   systematic method has been developed to deal with process changes and
   HEN topological changes in a simultaneous way. To demonstrate this, a
   short-cut crude distillation model has been built up that relates stream
   temperatures and flow rates to process conditions. This model has been
   combined with the model for HEN topological changes proposed by Zhu and
   Asante,(1) which forms a complete model for optimizing the tradeoff
   between HEN retrofit and process changes. The case study shows
   significant cost savings by considering process changes and HEN
   modifications simultaneously.}},

   toroidal traction drive continuously variable transmissions (CVT). The
   contacts between the input disk, the roller and the output disk of the
   traction drive are formulated using the classical Hertzian contact
   theory. The traction force and side slip force occurring in CVT
   operation are modelled based on the elasto-hydrodynamic theory and are
   correlated to the traction drive geometric and kinematic parameters. The
   model allows for the quantitative analysis of traction drive operation
   under various torque inputs and over the desired ratio range.}},

Abstract = {{The potential cytostatic function of apolipoprotein (apo) E in vivo was
   explored. by measuring neointimal hyperplasia in response to vascular
   injury in apoE-deficient and apoE-overexpressing transgenic mice.
   Results showed a significant increase in medial thickness, medial area,
   and neointimal formation after vascular injury in both apoE knockout and
   wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Immunochemical analysis with smooth muscle alpha
   -actin-specific antibodies revealed that the neointima contained
   proliferating smooth muscle cells. Neointimal area was 3.4-fold greater,
   and the intima/medial ratio as well as stenotic luminal area was more
   pronounced in apoE(-/-) mice than those observed in control mice (P <
   0.05). The human apoE3 transgenic mice in FVB/N genetic background were
   then used to verify a direct effect of apoE in protection against
   neointimal hyperplasia in response to mechanically induced vascular
   injury. Results showed that neointimal area was reduced threefold to
   fourfold in mice overexpressing the human apoE3 transgene (P < 0.05).
   Importantly, suppression of neointimal formation in the apoE transgenic
   mice also abolished the luminal stenosis observed in their nontransgenic
   FVB/N counterparts. These results documented a direct role of apoE in
   modulating vascular response to injury, suggesting that increasing apoE
   level may be beneficial in protection against restenosis after vascular
   surgery.}},

Abstract = {{A full-length heme oxygenase gene from the gram-negative pathogen
   Neisseria meningitidis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli,
   Expression of the enzyme yielded soluble catalytically active protein
   and caused accumulation of biliverdin within the E. coli cells. The
   purified HemO forms a 1:1 complex with heme and has a heme protein
   spectrum similar to that previously reported for the purified heme
   oxygenase (HmuO) from the gram-positive pathogen Corynebacterium
   diphtheriae and for eukaryotic heme oxygenases, The overall sequence
   identity between HemO and these heme oxygenases is, however, low. In the
   presence of ascorbate or the human NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase
   system, the heme-HemO complex is converted to ferric-biliverdin IX alpha
   and carbon monoxide as the final products. Homologs of the hemO gene
   were identified and characterized in six commensal Neisseria isolates,
   Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria subflava, Neisseria flava, Neisseria
   polysacchareae, Neisseria kochii, and Neisseria cinerea. All HemO
   orthologs shared between 95 and 98\% identity in amino acid sequences
   with functionally important residues being completely conserved. This is
   the first heme oxygenase identified in a gram-negative pathogen, The
   identification of HemO as a heme oxygenase provides further evidence
   that oxidative cleavage of the heme is the mechanism by which some
   bacteria acquire iron for further use.}},

Abstract = {{Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) are potent broad-spectrum
   antivirals, also effective against immunodeficiency viruses and
   hepatitis viruses. Effects of several ANPs on in vitro cytokine gene
   expression and nitric oxide (NO) production by murine peritoneal
   macrophages were investigated. Included in the study were
   9-{[}2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]adenine (PMEA; Adefovir),
   9-(R)-{[}2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenin {[}(R)-PMPA; Tenofovir],
   9-(S)-{[}2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenin (S)-PMPA),
   9-{[}2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-2,6-diamin (PMEDAP),
   9-(R)-{[}2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine (PMPDAP), and
   9-{[}2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]guanine (PMEG). Some of them, i.e.
   (R)-PMPA, (S)-PMPA, and PMEG, stimulate secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-10
   in a concentration-dependent manner, and enhance the IFN-gamma -induced
   secretion of TNF-alpha. Although unable to activate production of nitric
   oxide (NO) on their own, these compounds substantially augment NO
   formation induced by IFN-gamma. Analysis of the expression of inducible
   NO synthase mRNA indicates that the NO-enhancing effects of ANPs is
   mediated posttranscriptionally. In contrast to IFN-gamma, production of
   NO triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone, or synergistically by
   LPS + IFN-gamma, remains unaltered by ANPs. The immunomodulatory effects
   have been differentially expressed in distinct genotypes of inbred
   strains of mice, including the low NO-responders Balb/c and high
   NO-responders C3H/HeN. Although less effectively, PMEG and (R)-PMPA also
   increase production of TNF-alpha and NO by the IFN-gamma- but Mot
   LPS-co-stimulated macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice, which are otherwise
   hypo-responsive to major immune stimuli provided by IFN-gamma and LPS.
   It can be concluded that the expression of immunomodulatory properties
   of ANPs depends on the immune state of cells and its activation by
   distinct priming signals. (C) 2000 International Society for

Abstract = {{Background: The functional integrity of transplanted fetal intestine was
   proven in rodents. The authors examined the morphology and development
   of intraperitonealy transplanted fetal intestine under cyclosporin A
   (CsA) monotherapy in a large mammal.
   Methods: Allogeneic fetal intestinal grafts we re transplanted
   intraperitonealy in pigs. The graft was wrapped in omentum. Thirteen
   recipients received grafts harvested at 60 days of gestation and 5 at
   105 days of gestation. All recipients received 25 mg/kg/d CsA. CsA blood
   levels were measured at the end of the study. The development of the
   grafts was assessed by inspection and histology studying
   revascularization, maturation, and immune rejection.
   Results: All grafts developed neovascularization. The intestinal wall in
   the 105-day-old group was thick enough to lead to complete mucosal
   destruction, whereas the 60-day-old group showed viable mucosa. All
   grafts induced an immune rejection. This immune response was correlated
   with the CsA blood level. The graft was destroyed within 15 days when
   CsA trough level was below 70 ng/mL, had a subacute rejection with villi
   atrophy when CsA trough level ranged from 70 to 150 ng/mL, and had a
   good appearance in spite of mild blunting of villi when CsA trough level
   was over 150 ng/mL.
   Conclusion: Allogeneic fetal intestinal transplantation from 60-day-old
   embryos in pig achieved successful graft. J Pediatr Surg 35:1728-1732.

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design of an adaptive autopilot for a
   containership. Well-known results of linear adaptive theory are extended
   through the use of neural network to the case where the plant dynamics
   are described by a set of non-linear equations. The desired behaviour of
   the containership during course-changing manoeuvre is defined by the
   response of a reference model. Using an indirect approach, the
   controller parameters are adjusted based on the definition of an
   estimation error. The proposed adaptive controller is tested by a
   simulation study based on a non-linear model, describing the dynamics of
   a containership in four degrees of freedom. In order to take into
   account the wave effects, a stochastic model of the ship wave-induced
   motion is considered. Shallow water effect is also considered by
   changing some of the hydrodynamics parameters. Copyright (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that selectin inhibition with blocking
   antibodies or a small-molecular-weight inhibitor of L-, P-, and
   E-selectin, methoxybenzoylpropionic acid (MBPA), prevents thrombus
   formation in a canine coronary Folts' model. Cyclic flow variations
   (CFVs) were induced by crush injury and constriction of the left
   anterior descending coronary artery in dogs. Systemic infusion of
   antibodies to P- and L- selectin abolished CFVs, respectively, in 50\%
   and 17\% of treated dogs {[}P = not significant (NS)]. The combination
   of P- and L- selectin antibodies suppressed CFVs in 60\% of treated dogs
   (P = NS). In contrast, systemic selectin blockade by intravenous
   infusion or local adventitial application of MBPA markedly reduced CFVs
   and, in addition, reduced myocardial myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. We
   conclude that inhibition of L-, P-, and E-selectin binding by a
   small-molecular-weight, noncarbohydrate compound markedly reduces
   arterial thrombosis, whereas systemic administration of antibodies to L-
   and P- selectin fail to reproduce this antithrombotic effect. These
   results underscore the role of selectins in the pathogenesis of arterial
   thrombosis under high shear stress and suggest that inhibition of P- and
   L- selectin may not suffice to prevent thrombus formation in this model.
   The role of E-selectin in thrombus formation in this model awaits
   further testing.}},

Abstract = {{Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), a congenital disorder of teeth,
   hair, and eccrine sweat glands, is usually inherited as an X-linked
   recessive trait, although rarer autosomal dominant and recessive forms
   exist. We have studied males from four families with HED and
   immunodeficiency (HED-ID), in which the disorder segregates as an
   X-linked recessive trait. Affected males manifest dysgammaglobulinemia
   and, despite therapy, have significant morbidity and mortality from
   recurrent infections. Recently, mutations in IKK-gamma (NEMO) have been
   shown to cause familial incontinentia pigmenti (LP). Unlike HED-ID, IP
   affects females and, with few exceptions, causes male prenatal
   lethality. Wt-gamma is required for the activation of the transcription
   factor known as ``nuclear factor kappa B{''} and plays an important role
   in T and B cell function. We hypothesize that ``milder{''} mutations at
   this locus may cause HED-ID. In all four families, sequence analysis
   reveals exon 10 mutations affecting the carboxy-terminal end of the
   IKK-gamma protein, a domain believed to connect the IKK signalsome
   complex to upstream activators. The findings define a new X-linked
   recessive immunodeficiency syndrome, distinct from other types of HED
   and immunodeficiency syndromes. The data provide further evidence that
   the development of ectodermal appendages is mediated through a tumor
   necrosis factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor-like signaling pathway,
   with the IKK signalsome complex playing a significant role.}},

Abstract = {{The fragmentation of natural habitats is generally considered to be a
   major threat to biodiversity. We investigated short-term responses of
   vascular plants (grasses and forbs) and four groups of invertebrates
   (ants, butterflies, grasshoppers and gastropods) to experimental
   fragmentation of calcareous grassland in the north-western Jura
   mountains, Switzerland. Three years after the initiation of
   fragmentation - which was created and maintained by mowing the area
   between the fragments - we compared species richness, diversity and
   composition of the different groups and the abundance of single species
   in fragments of different size (area: 20.25 m(2), 2.25 m(2) and 0.35
   m(2)) with those in corresponding control plots. The abundances of 19
   (29\%) of the 65 common species examined were affected by fragmentation.
   However, the experimental fragmentation affected different taxonomic
   groups and single species to a different extent. Butterflies, the most
   mobile animals among the invertebrates studied, reacted most
   sensitively: species richness and foraging abundances of single
   butterfly species were lower in fragments than in control plots. Of the
   few other taxonomic groups or single species that were affected by the
   experimental fragmentation, most had a higher species richness or
   abundance in fragments than in control plots. This is probably because
   the type of fragmentation used is beneficial to some plants via
   decreased competition intensity along the fragment edges, and because
   some animals may use fragments as retreats between foraging bouts into
   the mown isolation area.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the role of bismuth as a surfactant in the growth of InAs
   quantum dots (QDs) on GaAs (001) by metal organic vapour phase epitaxy.
   Atomic force microscopy investigations have shown that bismuth
   suppresses coalescence of the InAs QDs and advances a more uniform size
   distribution. The photoluminescence spectra of the Pi-assisted grown QDs
   present several narrow peaks from the ground and the excited state
   transitions with full width at half maximum (FWHM) as narrow as 25 meV
   (both at 77 and 300 K). Due to such low values of the FWHM we were able
   to observe up to two well resolved excited state transitions in the
   photovoltage spectra measured by an electrolyte cell technique. The
   lowest ground transition energies observed were 0.93 eV at 77 K and
   0.875 eV at 300 K (emission wavelength 1.46 mum). So using Bi-assisted
   growth it is possible to cover the 1.3 mum band, which is important for
   optoelectronic applications in the InAs/GaAs material system. Formation
   of such `deep' QDs without misfit dislocations was explained by the
   formation of a graded-composition transient InGaAs alloy layer at the
   GaAs/InAs hetero-interface as a result of diffusion intermixing of the
   components. The proposed mechanism for the effect of Bi on the QDs'
   morphology is that Bi decreases the surface mobility of the In atoms on
   the growing surface, preventing the coalescence of the QDs. Because of
   its rather large covalent radius (compared with that of As), Bi is not
   incorporated into the QDs' material segregating on the growing surface.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the effectiveness of a testing strategy for an integrated
   circuit, the potential structural faults in a circuit must be modelled.
   Analogue fault simulation is conventionally done at the transistor
   level. Behavioural fault models are desirable to speed up the
   simulations. Behavioural fault modelling needs faults to be grouped.
   However, it is not easy to group faults using a Euclidean measurement of
   the distance between faults, if the populations of the circuit faults
   have distributions with differing variances. Mutual information theory
   is suggested here as a robust method for clustering circuit faults. The
   bootstrap technique is proposed to speed up the process of generating
   statistical data. Statistical data on the performance of circuits under
   fault conditions is generated using HSPICE. A software program has been
   written to implement clustering of responses using mutual information
   theory and to generate statistical data using bootstrap. The technique
   is shown to generate a suitable set of parameters for a regression
   function. The simulation results for the behavioural models are close to
   those of the full circuit model. Mutual information theory is a useful
   technique for clustering responses of circuits under fault conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Hematopoietic toxicity is the dose-limiting side effect produced in
   cancer chemotherapy with deoxycytidine nucleoside analogs. Deletion of
   the deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), results in a drug resistance phenotype
   to these analogs, An interesting gene therapy strategy to confer drug
   resistance to cytosine nucleoside analogs would be to specifically
   inactivate the dCK in normal hematopoietic stem cell. In this study, we
   designed hammerhead ribozymes that can specifically cut and downregulate
   the murine dCK mRNA. Three different ribozymes were identified and shown
   to cleave in vitro the dCK RNA. After introduction of ribozyme cDNA into
   murine L1210 leukemic cells by retroviral transfer, two of the ribozymes
   showed some capacity in reducing dCK activity. However, analysis of
   transduced L1210 clones showed that the significant reduction in the dCK
   mRNA was not sufficient to confer drug resistance to cytosine
   arabinoside. Nevertheless, these results provide a new avenue of
   modulating the dCK enzyme activity and with improved modifications may
   have the potential for use in gene therapy to confer drug resistance to
   deoxycytidine analogs. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Initiation of skin tumors in mice is associated with the formation of
   oncogenic mutations in the H-ras gene. Mice treated on the dorsal skin
   with the potent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogen
   dibenzo{[}a.l]pyrene (DB{[}a,l]P) form papillomas carrying the H-ras
   codon 61 (CAA to CTA) mutations. These mutations are induced in early
   preneoplastic skin within 1 day after DB{[}a,l]P treatment (Oncogene 16
   (1998) 3203-3210) and appear to be related to
   DB{[}a,l]P-Ade-depurinating adducts (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92
   (1995) 10422-10426). The rapid kinetics of mutation induction suggests
   that abasic sites generated from base depurination may undergo
   error-prone excision repair in pre-S-phase cells to induce these
   mutations. Analysis of mutations in the H-ras exon 1 and 2 region in
   DB{[}a,l]P-treated early preneoplastic skin indicated great changes in
   mutation spectra in the preneoplastic period. The initial spectra
   contained abundant A-->G mutations, which frequently occurred 3' to a
   putative conserved sequence (TGN-doublet). These mutations appeared to
   be induced initially as mismatched (G.T) heteroduplexes and then
   converted into double-stranded mutations by one round of replication.
   Unlike the A-->G mutations found in DB{[}a,l]P-treated skin (which forms
   99\% depurinating adducts), A-->G mutations found in

Abstract = {{A majority of human colon carcinomas coexpress the epidermal growth

   alpha), amphiregulin (AR) and CRIPTO-1 (CR). We have synthesized novel,
   antisense mixed backbone oligonucleotides (AS MBOs) directed against TGF
   alpha. AR and CR, We screened the EGF-related (AS MBOs) for their
   ability to inhibit the anchorage independent growth of GEO human colon
   carcinoma cells. Tbe MBOs that showed a high in vitro efficacy were then
   used for in vitro experiments. TGF alpha, AR and CR AS MBOs were able to
   inhibit the growth of CEO tumor xenografts in nude mice in a
   dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the AS MBOs were able to
   specifically inhibit the expression of the target mRNAs and proteins in
   the tumor xenografts. A more significant tumor growth inhibition was
   observed when mice were treated with a combination of the three AS MBOs
   as compared to treatment with a single AS MBO, Finally, tumors from mice
   treated with TGF alpha, AR and CR AS MBOs showed a significant reduction
   of microvessel count, as compared with tumors from untreated mice or
   from mire treated with a single AS MBO, These data suggest that
   combinations of AS oligonucleotides directed against different growth
   factors might represent a novel, experimental therapy approach of colon

   {[}4,5-b]jndole-4-amines, and tetrahydropyrimido{[}4,5-b] indole-camines
   was synthesized and their adenosine receptor affinity determined in
   radioligand binding assays at rat A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptors
   (ARs). Selected compounds were additionally investigated in binding
   assays at recombinant A(3) ARs. The 2-phenyl residue in
   (R)-7-(1-methylbenzyl)-2-phenylpyrrolo {[}2,3-d] pyrimidine-4-amine
   (ADPEP, 1) and in the corresponding pyrimido {[}4,5-b]indole (APEPI, 3)
   could be bioisosterically replaced by heterocyclic rings;such as
   2-thienyl and 4-pyridyl. The resulting compounds retained high affinity
   and selectivity fdr Al ARs. Judging from the investigation of selected
   compounds, it appears that they are also potent at human Al ARs and
   selective not only versus A2A ARs but also highly selective versus A(2B)
   and A(3) ARs. The p-pyridyl-substituted derivatives 11 and 27 (APPPI)
   may be interesting pharmacological tools due to their fluorescent
   properties. Pyrrolo{[}2;3-d] pyrimidine-e-amine derivatives which were
   simultaneously substituted at N7 and N-4, combining the substitution
   pattern of ADPEP (1) and DPEAP (2), showed very low affinity for AL ARs.
   This finding supports our previously published hypothesis of different
   binding modes for pyrrolopyrimidines, such as ADPEP (1) and DPEAP (2).
   DPEAP (2), a pyrrolo{[}2,3-d]pyrimidined-4-amine substituted gt the
   amino group (N4), was found to exhibit high affinity for human A(3) ARs
   (K-i = 28 nM), whereas N-4-unsubstituted analogues were inactive. DPEAP
   (2) and related compounds provide new leads for the development of
   antagonists for the human A(3) AR.}},

   examined. Single treatment showed its peak activity at 9 h, while Double
   treatment was at 3 h after the second treatment. Double treatment had a
   significantly higher peak activity. The up-regulated activities of

Abstract = {{The substrate specificity of immobilized D-glucose isomerase (EC
   5.3.1.5) is investigated with an immobilized enzyme-packed reactor. A
   series of isomerization experiments with alpha-, beta-, and equilibrated

   substrate of the glucose isomerase at pH 7.5 and 60 degreesC. For
   substrate concentration of 0.028 mol l(-1) (1\% w/v), the initial
   conversion rate of alpha -D-glucose was 43\% higher than that with
   equilibrated glucose at the same concentration and 113\% higher than
   beta -D-glucose conversion rate. This anomeric reactivity of glucose
   isomerase is mathematically described with a set of kinetic equations
   based on the reaction steps complying with Briggs-HaIdane mechanism and
   the experimentally determined kinetic constants. The proposed reaction
   mechanism includes the mutarotation and the isomerization reactions of
   alpha- and beta -D-glucose with different rate constants. (C) 2000

   deposition of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings in recent years. The effect
   of melting state of HA powders on the coating microstructure and
   performance is investigated in this paper. Tensile adhesion lest, X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) analysis and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)
   analysis are used for the evaluation of the coatings. The coating
   microstructure is analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The
   results show that the tensile bond strength of the HVOF sprayed HA
   coatings can be up to 31 MPa and is largely dependent on the spray
   parameters. XRD result shows that the as-sprayed IIA coating using
   powders with the size around 50 mu m is composed of crystalline HA and
   very small amount of tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP). The coatings
   deposited using fine powders around 30 mu m contained a lot of amorphous
   phase, crystalline HA and very small amount of alpha-TCP. Result from
   the DSC indicates that the crystallization temperature of the amorphous
   phase in the coatings is around 703 degrees C. Amorphous phases in the
   as-sprayed coating significantly improved bond strength. The structure
   crystallized. totally in heat-treated coatings below 750 degrees C. SEM
   analyses of the tensile fractured HA coatings show that fracture occurs
   within the partially melted powders. The interface between the melted
   and unmelted parts of the powders is the weakest zone for crack
   propagation. This suggests that the fully melted state of the feedstock
   can result in the formation of amorphous phase and simultaneously
   decrease the bond strength. It also suggests that the fraction of the
   powders melted is the most critical factor influencing the bond strength
   and phase composition of the coatings. The partial melting state of HA
   powders is beneficial in terms of bond strength and crystallinity. (C)

Abstract = {{The cryostability of superconducting magnet is mainly dependent on the
   heat release performance between superconductor (SC) and coolants as
   well as superconductor material properties. The heat balance between
   that generated in solid and that cooled by coolant in the vicinity of
   quench Is studied in this paper. Various cooling media (normal liquid,
   saturated superfluid and subcooled superfluid helium) and different
   surface materials on SC (lacquer, porous and its bare form) are
   examined. Measurements show that the varnish layer working as the
   electrical insulator is a barrier of heat release, which allows quench
   to happen immediately just when current shares in matrix. It is also
   found that the thermal properties are obviously developed by coating a
   porous layer on wire instead of varnish layer, even better than the bare
   wire. The current transported is thus greatly increased and also the
   thermal performance of porous coated wire in HeIIs expresses the
   characteristics in HeIIp. A reasonable explanation is given in this
   paper and verified by experiments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All

Abstract = {{Adequate knowledge of climatic change over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with
   an average elevation of more than 4000 m above sea level (a.s.1.) has
   been insufficient for a long time owing to the lack of sufficient
   observational data. In the present study, monthly surface air
   temperature data were collected from almost every meteorological station
   on the TP since their establishment. There are 97 stations located above
   2000 m a.s.1. on the TP; the longest records at five stations began
   before the 1930s, but most records date from the mid-1950s. Analyses of
   the temperature series show that the main portion of the TP has
   experienced statistically significant warming since the mid-1950s,
   especially in winter, but the recent warming in the central and eastern
   TP did not reach the level of the 1940s warm period until the late
   1990s. Compared with the Northern Hemisphere and the global average, the
   warming of the TP occurred early. The linear rates of temperature
   increase over the TP during the period 1955-1996 are about 0.16
   degreesC/decade for the annual mean and 0.32 degreesC/decade for the
   winter mean, which exceed those for the Northern Hemisphere and the same
   latitudinal zone in the same period. Furthermore, there is also a
   tendency for the warming trend to increase with the elevation in the TP
   and its surrounding areas. This suggests that the TP is one of the most
   sensitive areas to respond to global climate change. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Within a research project aimed at probing the substrate specificity and
   the enantioselectivity of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL), computer modeling
   studies of the interactions between CRL and methyl
   (+/-)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionate (Ketoprofen methyl ester) have been
   carried out in order to identify which amino acids are essential to the
   enzyme/substrate interaction. Different binding models of the substrate
   enantiomers to the active site of CRL were investigated by applying a
   computational protocol based on molecular docking, conformational
   analysis, and energy minimization procedures. The structural models of
   the computer generated complexes between CRL and the substrates enabled
   us to propose that Phe344 and Phe345, in addition to the residues
   constituting the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole, are the amino
   acids mainly involved in the enzyme-ligand interactions. To test the
   importance of these residues for the enzymatic activity, site-directed
   mutagenesis of the selected amino acids has been performed, and the
   mutated enzymes have been evaluated for their conversion and selectivity
   capabilities toward different substrates. The experimental results
   obtained in these biotransformation reactions indicate that Phe344 and
   especially Phe345 influence: CRL activity, supporting the findings of
   our theoretical simulations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Infrared chemiluminescence from a room-temperature flow reactor was used
   to study the reactions of H atoms with (CH3)(3)COCl, ClC(O)SCl,
   FC(O)SCl, and CH3OC(O)SCl. Infrared emission spectra were recorded from
   the HCl, HF, and OCS products. The anharmonic shifts from bands
   involving v(1), v(2), and v(3) excitation are too small to obtain
   information about bending vs stretch excitation of OCS from the
   Deltav(3) = -1 spectra; however, a computer simulation method was
   developed to analyze the Deltaq = -1 transition to assign the average
   total vibrational energy of OCS, {[}E-v(OCS)]. The enthalpy changes for
   the carbonylsulfenyl chloride reactions were estimated from ab initio
   calculations. The proposed mechanism for the carbonylsulfenyl chlorides
   includes two reaction pathways: one involves interaction with the S-Cl
   bond to give HCl; the second involves an RC(O)SCI .H adduct that
   subsequently gives RH and OCS (+Cl). The {[}E-v(OCS)] values were 17.2,
   14.6, and 8.4 kcal mol(-1) from FC(O)SCl, CH3OC(O)SCl, and ClC(O)SCl,
   respectively. The fraction of the available energy released as HCl
   vibrational energy, {[}f(V)(HCl)], from reaction with the S-Cl bond was
   similar to0.3 for all three reactions. The reaction mechanism for H +
   (CH3)(3)COCl, which was employed as a reference reaction, is thought to
   be direct abstraction and (fv(HC1)) is 0.23.}},

Abstract = {{The N,N-diphenylnitrenium ion (Ph2N+) was generated from the photolysis
   of a stable precursor, the
   1-(N,N-diphenylamino)-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium ion. The behavior of
   this nitrenium ion was studied by laser flash photolysis (LFP) and the
   analysis of its stable products. In accord with an earlier
   communication, Ph2N+ is found to have absorption maxima at 425 and 660
   nm, to live for ca. 1.5 mus in CH3CN, and to react with Cl- at or near
   the diffusion limit. However, no evidence for concurrent formation of
   the diphenylamine cation radical (Ph2NH+.) is found. Its formation in
   the earlier experiments is attributed to small amounts of accumulated
   photoproducts. The LFP experiments also show that Ph2N+ is quenched by
   various H atom donors, including 1,4-cyclohexadiene and tri(n-butyl)tin
   hydride. However, the radical cation that would be expected from a
   homolytic H atom transfer, Ph2NH+. is not detected in these experiments.
   Moreover, the rate constants for trapping do not vary in the expected
   way with the bond dissociation energies of the traps. The rate constants
   do, however, show a reasonable correlation with the hydride affinities
   of the traps. It is argued that the quenching mechanism is a hydride
   transfer to the singlet state of Ph2N+ and that the triplet state of
   this nitrenium ion is not involved in these reactions.}},

   mitochondrial carrier protein-1 (BMCP1) is a new member of the UCP
   family, but little is known about the gene regulation and the role of
   BMCP1 in the central nervous system. In the present study, we first
   cloned BMCP1 cDNA encoding 325 amino acids from rat brain. The BMCP1
   mRNA showed a distinct distribution pattern compared with that of UCP2
   gene in human brain. Cold exposure did not affect the mRNA levels of
   BMCP1 and UCP2 in rat whole brain, but did increase the expression of
   UCP2 in the spinal cord. The mRNA level of BMCP1 in the brain of
   26-month-old rats was decreased by 30\% and that of UCP2 increased by
   60\% compared with the levels in 6-month-old rats. These results suggest

Abstract = {{Vascular endothelial cell superoxide (O-2(.)) has an important role in
   intracellular signaling, in interaction with other reactive species such
   as nitric oxide, and in vascular dysfunction. Little is known regarding
   the source and function of O-2(.) from microvascular endothelial cells
   from specific tissues. Mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells
   stimulated with phorbol ester (PMA) or NADPH generated significant
   O-2(.), which was inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) but not by
   allopurinol, rotenone, indomethacin, or quinacrine. Optimal O-2(.)
   generation required cytosolic as well as particulate cell fractions of
   cells. In parallel studies, PMA induced increased expression of the p47
   component of the NAD(P)H oxidase in the particulate fraction, which was
   inhibited by staurosporine and calphostin. These data demonstrate that
   NAD(P)H oxidase is an important source of O-2(.) generation in lung
   microvascular endothelial cells. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes an empirical methodology for modelling and mapping
   the air temperature (mean maximum, mean and mean minimum) and total
   precipitation, all of which are monthly and annual, using geographical
   information systems (GIS) techniques. The method can be seen as an
   alternative to classical interpolation techniques when spatial
   information is available. The geographical area used to develop and
   apply this model is Catalonia (32000 km(2), northeast Spain). We have
   developed a multiple regression analysis between these meteorological
   variables as the dependent ones, and some geographical variables
   (altitude (ALT), latitude (LAT), continentality (CON), solar radiation
   (RAD) and a cloudiness factor (CLO)) as the independent ones. Data for
   the dependent variables were obtained from meteorological stations, and
   data for the independent variables were elaborated from a 180 m
   resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Multiple regression
   coefficients (b(n)) were used to build final maps, using digital layers
   for each independent variable, and applying basic GIS techniques. The
   results are very satisfactory in the case of mean air temperature and
   mean minimum air temperature, with coefficients of determination (R-2)
   between 0.79 and 0.97, depending on the month; in the case of mean
   maximum air temperature, R-2 ranges between 0.70 and 0.89, while in the
   case of precipitation, it ranges between 0.60 and 0.91. Copyright (C)

   DERKO, but not BERKO, demonstrated a clear increase in total body fat
   and enhanced serum leptin levels. Serum cholesterol was increased and a
   qualitative change in the Lipoprotein profile, including smaller LDL
   particles, was observed in ERKO and DERKO mice. In conclusion, ER alpha

Abstract = {{The identification of galaxies at extreme distances provides the most
   direct information about the earliest phases of galaxy formation. But at
   redshifts z>5 even the most luminous galaxies appear faint; the
   interpretation of low signal-to-noise ratio data is difficult and
   misidentifications do occur. Here we report optical and near-infrared
   observations of the source STIS123627+621755, which was previously
   suggested to be at a redshift of 6.68 (ref. 1). At that redshift, and
   with the reported 1 spectral energy distribution, the galaxy should be
   essentially invisible at wavelengths less than 9,300 Angstrom, because
   the intervening intergalactic medium absorbs almost all light energetic
   enough to ionize neutral hydrogen-that is, with wavelengths less than
   the redshifted Lyman limit of lambda = (1 + z) x 912 Angstrom. At
   near-infrared wavelengths, however, the galaxy should be relatively
   bright. Here we report a detection of the galaxy at 6,700 Angstrom and a
   non-detection at a wavelength of 1.2 mum, contrary to expectations for z
   approximate to 6.68. The data conservatively require that
   STIS123627+621755 has a redshift z< 6.}},

Abstract = {{The transcriptional activator protein-2 (AP-2) has been suggested to
   participate in keratinocyte gene regulation. Cystatin A, a cysteine
   proteinase inhibitor, is one of the cornified cell envelope constituents
   and is expressed in the upper epidermis. We report AP-2-dependent
   transcriptional regulation of cystatin A gene expression of
   keratinocytes. At least three isoforms of AP-2 (AP-2 alpha, beta, gamma)
   have been described. Transfection of AP-2 alpha, beta and gamma
   expression vectors into cultured normal human keratinocytes (NHK)
   resulted in increased cystatin A expression in both mRNA and protein
   levels. Among the three isoforms AP-2 gamma was most potent in inducing
   cystatin A expression. In contrast, transfection of antisense oriented
   AP-2 gamma expression vector decreased basal AP-2 expression,
   accompanied by decreased cystatin A mRNA The fragment, +77 to -478 of
   5'-flanking region of human cystatin A gene, was subcloned into
   chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector (p478CAT).
   Cotransfection of p478CAT vector with AP-2 alpha, beta, and gamma
   expression vectors resulted in three-, three-, and sixfold increase in
   the CAT activity, respectively. Transfection of the deleted construct
   (p478 Delta AP-2CAT, devoid of AP-2-like binding site (-75 to -84))
   decreased CAT activity by one-third compared to p478CAT promoter
   activity. Cotransfection of p478 Delta AP-2CAT with AP-2 alpha, beta,
   and gamma expression vectors had no effect on the decreased promoter
   activity. Immunohistochemical analysis of human skin showed that AP-2
   gamma is exclusively expressed in the nuclei of basal cell layer. AP-2
   gamma is expressed in the nuclei of basal, spinous, and granular cell
   layers. AP-2 beta expression was not observed in the epidermis. Gel
   mobility shift assay revealed that the AP-2 gamma protein specifically
   binds to oligonucleotides containing AP-a-like binding site of cystatin
   A gene. These results indicate that AP-2 gamma regulates the cystatin A
   gene expression of epidermal keratinocytes at the transcriptional level.

Abstract = {{Most field soils exhibit soil spatial variability as well as soil
   structure, The challenge is to account adequately for both types of
   spatial heterogeneity in simulation models. A numerical finite element
   code was used to compare single- and dual-permeability approaches for
   modeling variably saturated flow and transport in two-dimensional
   heterogeneous soil systems. The code was based on the Richards' equation
   for water how and the advection-dispersion equation for solute
   transport. Spatial variability in the soil hydraulic properties was
   accounted for by randomly generating a hydraulic conductivity field
   using a one-dimensional first-order Markov process, Soil structural
   effects were modeled with a two-domain concept in which a first-order
   kinetic expression is used to describe the transfer of water and solute
   between the two domains. Numerical experiments were carried out for the
   case of furrow irrigation, including the breakthrough of a conservative
   solute to the groundwater table. We compared five different scenarios: a
   single domain having uniform hydraulic properties (SU), a single domain
   with a randomly distributed hydraulic conductivity (SR), a
   dual-permeability system with uniform hydraulic properties (DU), a
   dual-permeability system with a randomly distributed fracture hydraulic
   conductivity (DRF), and a dual-permeability system having a randomly
   distributed matrix hydraulic conductivity (DRM). All scenarios started
   with pressure heads in equilibrium with a constant groundwater table 150
   cm below the soil surface and zero initial solute concentrations. The
   simulated two-dimensional (2D) vertical concentration profiles showed
   preferential pathways resulting from both the spatial variability (SR)
   and soil structure (DRF) scenarios. As expected, drainage of water from
   the bottom of the profile occurred significantly earlier for dual-than
   for single-permeability scenarios. The combination of having spatial
   variability in the hydraulic properties and invoking the
   dual-permeability approach yielded the quickest and largest leaching of
   solute. The 2D dual-permeability approach should considerably improve
   the simulation of water and solute movement in naturally heterogeneous
   field soils. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of the force of natural selection was developed to explain
   the evolution of ageing. After ageing, however, comes a period in which
   mortality rates plateau and some individual organisms could, in theory,
   live forever. This late-life immortality has no presently agreed upon
   explanation. Two main theories have been offered. The first is
   heterogeneity within ageing cohorts, such that only extremely robust
   individuals survive ageing. This theory can be tested by comparisons of
   more and less robust cohorts. It can also be tested by fitting survival
   data to its models. The second theory is that late-life plateaus in
   mortality reflect the inevitable late-life plateau in the force of
   natural selection. This theory can be tested by changing the force of
   natural selection in evolving laboratory populations, particularly the
   age at which the force plateaus. This area of research has great
   potential for elucidating the overall structure of life-history
   evolution, particularly the interrelationship between the three
   life-history phases of development, ageing and immortality.}},

   tetrahexadecyl-tetrapyridinoporphyrazinium bromide (TA(16)PyPzCo) on the
   air/aqueous methyl orange (MO) solution interface, composite monolayer

   have been fabricated and characterized by means of UV-vis spectra, IR

   estimated by using polarized UV-vis and polarized IR absorption
   measurements. The orientation angles of the hydrocarbon chains of
   TA(16)PyPzCo, the macrocycle, and the MO with respect to the normal of
   the substrate were estimated to be 49.5 degrees, 56.9 degrees, and 46.2
   degrees, respectively. The XD patterns of the LB films showed a
   well-defined lamella structure, and the d value was 6.04 nm. Based on
   these results, a possible film structure was proposed, in which the MO
   unit was under the macrocycle in the composite monolayer, and the long
   alkyl chains were interpenetrated in the adjacent TA(16)PyPzCo layer in
   the LB films. The trans to cis photoisomerization of the azobenzene

Abstract = {{High surface area titania-silica hydrophobic xerogels were prepared by
   the sol-gel method. In this procedure, titanium ions are well dispersed
   and the coordination sphere of the titanium ion is induced by the silica
   matrix. The reaction of hydroxyl groups of the gel with the drying
   chemical compound additive protects the texture toward collapse during
   drying. The amounts of titania and silylant agent were varied, and
   thermal treatment was studied on both silylated and nonsilylated
   samples. Textural properties were evaluated from nitrogen
   adsorption-desorption isotherms. The degree of incorporation and
   dispersion of titanium ions in the silica matrix was evaluated by FTIR
   spectroscopy of the framework vibrations. To elucidate the nature and
   quantity of exposed titanium ions on the surface of the catalyst, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and FTIR of adsorbed deuterated acetonitrile
   were used. Upon increasing the Ti loading, the BET area, the pore
   volume, and the mean pore diameter decreased whereas the amount of
   exposed Ti followed the opposite trend. In contrast, an increase in the
   amount of silylant agent decreased the proportion of exposed titanium
   and simultaneously improved the hydrophobic character and BET area.
   Thermal treatment of the silylated samples removed the hydrophobic
   character, although it did not change to a large extent their texture
   after drying. In short, silylation of the gel before drying leads to an
   increase in BET area and to partial blockage of exposed titanium sites,
   controlling moreover, the porosity and the hydrophobic character.
   Precise knowledge of these parameters and the influence of the thermal
   treatments on them will play a key role in the understanding of their
   performance in the liquid-phase partial oxidation of alkylaromatics.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the relationship between metal ion selective
   conformational changes of recoverin and its metal-bound coordination
   structures. Recoverin is a 23 kDa heterogeneously myristoylated
   Ca2+-binding protein that inhibits rhodopsin kinase. Upon accommodating
   two Ca2+ ions, recoverin extrudes a myristoyl group and associates with
   the lipid bilayer membrane, which was monitored by the surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) technique. Large changes in SPR signals were observed
   for Sr2+, Ba2+, Cd2+, and Mn2+ as well as Ca2+, indicating that upon
   binding to these ions, recoverin underwent a large conformational change
   to extrude the myristoyl group, and thereby interacted with lipid
   membranes. In contrast, no SPR signal was induced by Mg2+, confirming
   that even though it accommodates two Mg2+ ions, recoverin does not
   induce the large conformational change. To investigate the coordination
   structures of metal-bound Ca2+ binding sites, FT-IR studies were
   performed. The EF-hands, Ca2+-binding regions each comprising 12
   residues, arrange to coordinate Ca2+ with seven oxygen ligands, two of
   which are provided by a conserved bidentate Glu at the 12th relative
   position in the EF-hand. FT-IR analysis confirmed that Sr2+, Ba2+, Cd2+,
   and Mn2+ were coordinated to COO- of Glu by a bidentate state as well as
   Ca2+ while coordination of COO- with Mg2+ was a pseudobridging state
   with six-coordinate geometry. These SPR and FT-IR results taken together
   reveal that metal ions with seven-coordinate geometry in the EF-hands
   induce a large conformational change in recoverin so that it extrudes
   the myristoyl group, while metal ions with six-coordinate geometry in
   the EF-hands such as Mg2+ remain the myristoyl group sequestered in
   recoverin.}},

Abstract = {{A best-fitting procedure for the quantitative determination of the molar
   fractions of the stereosequences that define the microstructure of an
   ethylene-norbornene (E-N) copolymer from C-13 NMR spectra has been set
   up. The quantitative determination of copolymer microstructure will
   allow one to clarify the E-N copolymerization mechanism. This method
   utilizes the observed peak areas of the C-13 signals and takes into
   account the consistency between peak areas and the stoichiometry of the
   copolymer chain. Thus, a further extension of signal assignments is made
   possible by guessing assignments of unknown signals and by discarding
   inconsistent hypotheses. This procedure has been applied to the analysis
   of the C-13 NMR spectra of a large number of E-N copolymers, prepared
   with catalyst precursors rac-Et(indenyl)(2)ZrCl2 (1),
   rac-Me2Si(2-Me-benz{[}e]indenyl)(2)ZrCl2 (2),

Abstract = {{The reaction between coenzyme B-12 (5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, AdoCbl)
   and tetrabutylammonium cyanide to give dicyanocobalamin, adenine, and
   1-cyano-D-erythro-2,3-dihydroxy-4-pentenol has been examined in 92\%
   N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/8\% D2O. Under these conditions
   rate-determining Co-C heterolytic cleavage is preceded by rapid addition
   of cyanide to AdoCbl to form an intermediate, (beta
   -5'-deoxyadenosyl)(alpha -cyano)cobalamin ((beta -Ado)(alpha
   -CN)Cbl(-)), identified by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Rate constants have
   been determined by both H-1 NMR and visible spectroscopies, with the
   latter showing saturation kinetics. The observed rate constant is
   pH-independent in the pH region studied, and replacing D2O by H2O
   increases it by ca. 10\%. Increasing the percentage of D2O in the
   DMF/D2O solvent mixture also increases the reaction rate, and for D2O
   greater than or equal to 50\% there is a change in the rate-determining
   step, with formation of the (beta -Ado)(alpha -CN)Cbl(-) intermediate
   becoming rate-determining. A mechanism in 92\% DMF/8\% D2O is proposed
   which involves rapid reversible formation of (beta -Ado)(alpha
   -CN)Cbl(-) from base-off AdoCbl plus cyanide, followed by
   rate-determining solvent-assisted cleavage of the Co-C bond of the
   intermediate and subsequent rapid addition of a second cyanide to give
   the products.}},

Abstract = {{We have carried out mechanical property measurements on zirconium metal
   compressed in a diamond anvil cell to 19 GPa at room temperature with

   from the ambient hexagonal-close-packed phase to the simple hexagonal
   omega phase (AlB2 structure) is confirmed by synchrotron energy
   dispersive x-ray diffraction followed by nanoindentation of the
   pressure-quenched sample. We document an 80\% increase in hardness as a
   consequence of the pressure-induced transformation to the omega phase at
   room temperature. This is a large increase for a metallic phase
   transformation and can be attributed to the presence of sp(2)-hybrid
   bonds forming graphite-like nets in the (0001) plane of the AlB2
   structure. Atomic force microscopy of the indents shows that a plastic
   deformation of 2 mum in depth was achieved with a force of 200 mN. (C)

Abstract = {{Seven spectroradiometers measured simultaneous surface UV irradiances at

   the sites was analyzed with respect to altitude, aerosol optical depth,
   solar zenith angle, effective albedo, and tropospheric ozone. For
   conditions of low aerosol loading the increase of irradiance per 1000 m
   altitude difference was 9\% at 400 nm, 20\% at 320 nm, and 30\% at 300
   nm in this season. Effective albedo differences of 0.15, 0.29, and 0.65
   were found between the snow-covered stations and the snow-free ground
   station with the higher effective albedo values determined at the two
   mountain stations. Clean continental aerosol with a single-scatter
   albedo of 0.95 were observed during this campaign. The measurements and
   the observed variations between the sites should enable more accurate

Abstract = {{A new citharid flounder, Citharoides orbitalis, is described based on
   four specimens from Western Australia. The new species can be
   distinguished from the only known congener, C. macrolepidotus, by its
   longer orbit, greater distance between the upper eye and dorsal profile,
   and wider space between each eye and the anterior rim of the orbit.}},

Abstract = {{Reactions of TPtCl2(cod)] with the appropriate Grignard reagents produce
   {[}PtR2(cod)] CR C6H5, C6H4CH3-4, C6H4CH3-2, CH2C6H5), which, on
   treatment with 1 mol equiv of HCl, yield the corresponding
   chloroplatinum complexes {[}PtClR(cod)]. The 2-tolyl compounds exhibit
   hindered rotation about the Pt-C bonds at ambient temperature, the
   barrier to rotation being greater in {[}PtCl(C6H4CH3-2)(cod)] than in
   the ditolyl derivative. The chloroplatinum compounds react with 1 mol
   equiv of dppm to give {[}PtClR(dppm)], which are in equilibrium with the
   A-frame complexes {[}Pt2R2(mu -Cl)(mu -dppm)(2)]Cl. The extent of
   dimerization depends on the nature of R, but in each case the A-frame
   complex could be obtained quantitatively by treatment of the solution
   with NH4PF6 or TIPF6. The structures of {[}Pt2R2(mu -Cl)(mu -dppm)(2)]
   PF6 (R = CH2C6H5, C6H4CH3-4) were determined by X-ray crystallography.
   In the benzyl derivative, one of the ortho hydrogens on each phenyl
   (benzyl) ring points towards the centroid of a dppm phenyl ring, and
   this may account for the low-frequncy signal associated with the ortho
   hydrogens in solution. The chloride-bridged A-frames could be converted
   to the corresponding hydride-bridged derivatives, {[}Pt2R2(mu -H)(mu
   -dppm)(2)]PF6 (R = C6H5, C6H4; CH3-4, CH2C6H5), by treatment with NaBH4.}},
