Abstract = {{Being a pivotal resource, conservation of energy has been considered as
   the most striking issue in the wireless sensor network research. Several
   works have been performed in the last years to devise duty cycle based
   MAC protocols which optimize energy conservation emphasizing low traffic
   load scenario. In contrast, considering the high traffic situation,
   another research trend has been continuing to optimize both energy
   efficiency and channel utilization employing rate and congestion control
   at the MAC layer. In this paper, we propose A Load-aware
   Energy-efficient and Throughput-maximized Asynchronous Duty Cycle MAC
   (LET-MAC) protocol for wireless sensor networks to provide an integrated
   solution at the MAC layer considering both the low-and high-traffic
   scenario. Through extensive simulation using ns-2, we have evaluated the
   performance of LET-MAC. LET-MAC achieves significant energy conservation
   during low traffic load (i.e., no event), compared to the prior
   asynchronous protocol, RI-MAC, as well as attains optimal throughput
   through maximizing the channel utilization and maintains lower delay in
   regard to the CSMA/CA-like protocol during a high volume of traffic
   (i.e., when an event occurs).}},

Title = {{A SEARCH FOR RR LYRAE VARIABLES IN THE CENTRAL REGION OF M54}},

Abstract = {{We have analyzed archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field
   Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) observations of the central region of the
   globular cluster M54. The 12 irregularly timed observations (6 F555W, 6
   F814W) were reduced using the HSTphot stellar photometry package. Our
   statistical analysis of the HSTphot photometry yielded 50 variable stars
   that are likely RR Lyrae candidates. These candidates were missed by
   previous ground-based searches for RR Lyraes due to the extreme crowding
   in the core of M54. We performed two checks on our sample of RR Lyrae
   candidates to determine how different they were from the other variable
   candidates. The first test was a numerical analysis comparing the ratio
   of variable candidates to the total number of stars within the blue
   horizontal branch, the RR Lyrae region, and the red giant branch. We
   found ratios of 0.61\%, 13\%, and 1.1\% in these regions, respectively.
   Our next test was a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, which
   allowed us to find out how different our 50 RR Lyrae candidates were
   from the 50 brightest other variable candidates. According to the K-S
   test, there is only a 0.0004\% probability that these two populations
   are similar, indicating that our RR Lyrae candidates do indeed exhibit
   some real fluctuation in their brightness. We sampled the light curves
   of confirmed RR Lyrae light curves to simulate the HST observing
   conditions and found that a signature of variability in 2911 out of the
   4000 (72\%) generated ``stars.{''} We estimate that there maybe as many
   as 19 more RR Lyrae candidates that were undetected in the WFPC2 field
   of view. The presence of additional RR Lyraes has implications into the
   current Oosterhoff classification for the cluster.}},

Abstract = {{Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are very challenging with respect to
   their adaptive optics (AO) requirements. Their diameters and the
   specifications required by the astronomical science for which they are
   being designed imply a huge increment in the number of degrees of
   freedom in the deformable mirrors. Faster algorithms are needed to
   implement the real-time reconstruction and control in AO at the required
   speed. We present the results of a study of the AO correction
   performance of three different algorithms applied to the case of a 42-m
   ELT: one considered as a reference, the matrix-vector multiply (MVM)
   algorithm; and two considered fast, the fractal iterative method (FrIM)
   and the Fourier transform reconstructor (FTR). The MVM and the FrIM both
   provide a maximum a posteriori estimation, while the FTR provides a
   least-squares one. The algorithms are tested on the European Southern
   Observatory (ESO) end-to-end simulator, OCTOPUS. The performance is
   compared using a natural guide star single-conjugate adaptive optics
   configuration. The results demonstrate that the methods have similar
   performance in a large variety of simulated conditions. However, with
   respect to system misregistrations, the fast algorithms demonstrate an
   interesting robustness. c 2010 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Spanish drivers beliefs about speed. Speeding is a major issue of road
   safety. Extending and updating our knowledge concerning drivers'
   motivational and cognitive processes is of essential importance if we
   are to apply policies with long-lasting effects. This study presents
   data from a representative national survey analyzing the Spanish
   drivers' beliefs about speed, the risks of speeding, the degree of
   violation of speed-limits and the reasons for speeding. Results indicate
   that Spanish drivers rate speeding as a serious offence, yet not among
   the most dangerous ones. All in all they claim to comply mostly With the
   speed limits. However, some interesting violation patterns emerge:
   observance is lower for generic speed limits according to road type (vs.
   specific limits shown by certain road signs). and particularly in
   motorways (vs. single carriageways and urban areas). Risk perception and
   reasons for speeding emerge as the main factors predicting the levels of
   speed violations reported. Results suggest that any effective
   intervention strategy should consider such factors, namely the link
   between speed, road safety, and drivers' specific reasons for speeding.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Malnutrition is common among cancer patients. This study
   aimed to determine the overall prevalence of malnutrition among patients
   undergoing chemotherapy and to determine the predictors of malnutrition
   among cancer patients.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 88 cancer patients
   admitted for chemotherapy at the National Kidney and Transplant
   Institute, Philippines, from October to November 2009. Subjective Global
   Assessment (SGA), anthropometric data and demographic variables were
   obtained. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA and logistic regression analysis
   were performed between the outcome and variables.
   Results: A total of 88 cancer patients were included in the study. The
   mean age of the patients was 55.7 +/ 14.8 years. The mean duration of
   illness was 9.7 +/ 8.7 months and the mean body mass index (BM I) was
   22.9 kg/m(2). The mean Karnofsky performance status was 79.3. 29.55
   percent of the patients had breast cancer as the aetiology of their
   illness. 38 patients (43.2 percent) had SGA B and four (4.5 percent) had
   SGA C, giving a total malnutrition prevalence of 47.7 percent. The
   patients were statistically different with regard to their cancer stage
   (p is less than 0.001), weight (p is 0.01), BMI (p is 0.004),
   haemoglobin level (p is 0.001) and performance status by Karnofsky score
   (p is less than 0.001), as evaluated by ANOVA. Logistic regression
   analysis showed that cancer stage and Karnofsky performance score were
   predictors of malnutrition.
   Conclusion:About 47.7 percent of cancer patients suffer from
   malnutrition, as classified by SGA. Only cancer stage and Karnofsky
   performance status scoring were predictive of malnutrition in this
   select group of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) has been used to track changes in total
   body water (TBW). Accurate TBW estimations can be influenced by both
   methodological and biological factors. One methodological variation that
   contributes to BIS TBW errors is the electrode placement. The purpose of
   the present study was to compare the reproducibility and validity of
   fixed-distance electrode placements (5 cm) with the standard single-site
   electrode placements. Twenty-nine subjects (fifteen men and fourteen
   women) participated in the reproducibility study, while sixty-nine
   subjects (thirty-three men and thirty-six women) participated in the
   validity study. The reproducibility study included two measurements that
   were taken 24 h apart, while the validity study consisted of a 12-week
   exercise intervention with measurements taken at weeks 1 and 12. TBW was
   estimated using BIS and H-2 techniques. Reproducibility results
   indicated that fixed-distance electrodes reduced the day-to-day standard
   error of the measurement in men (from 1.13 to 0.81 litres) but not in
   women (0.47 litres). SEM values were lower for women than for men,
   suggesting that BIS TBW estimates are sex dependent. Validity results
   produced similar accurate findings (mean difference < 0.21 litres).
   However, fixed-distance electrodes improved delta TBW errors (mean
   difference improvements > 0.04 litres in men, women, and men and women
   combined). When tracking changes in TBW, fixed-distance electrodes may
   reduce reproducibility errors and allow for smaller changes to be
   detected. However, the reduction of reproducibility errors may be
   greater for men than for women. Therefore, reproducibility calculations
   should be based on the sex of the sample population.}},

Abstract = {{Kidney transplantation from hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive
   donors (HCVD+) into HCV antibody positive recipients (HCVR+) is
   controversial. We implemented this policy in our units in 1990. Herein,
   we report the long-term safety of this strategy. From March 1990 to
   March 2007, 162 HCVR+ received a kidney from HCVD+ (group 1) and 306
   from HCVD- (group 2) in our units. Mean follow-up was 74.5 months.
   Five-and 10-year patient survival was 84.8\% and 72.7\% in group 1 vs.
   86.6\% and 76.5\% in group 2 (p = 0.250). Three deaths in group 1 and
   two in group 2 were liver-disease related. Five- and 10-year graft
   survival was 58.9\% and 34.4\% versus 65.5\% and 47.6\% respectively (p
   = 0.006) while death-censored graft survival was 69\% and 47\% versus
   72.7\% and 58.5\% (p = 0.055). Decompensated chronic liver disease was
   similar: 10.3\% versus 6.2\%. Cox-regression analysis could not identify
   the donor's HCV serology as a significant risk factor for death, graft
   failure and severe liver disease in HCVR+. In conclusion, long-term
   outcome of HCVR+ transplanted with kidneys from HCVD+ seems good in
   terms of patient survival, graft survival and liver disease. HCVD+ was
   not a significant risk factor for mortality, graft failure and liver
   disease among HCVR+. These data strongly suggest that the use of kidneys
   from HCVD+ in HCVR+ is a safe long-term strategy that helps to prevent
   kidney loss.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The ideal spread of local anesthetic (LA) solution around
   the sciatic nerve during a popliteal block remains unclear. We tested
   the hypothesis that a circumferential spread of LA and/or intraneural
   injection could lead to rapid surgical block.
   Methods: Patients (n = 100) scheduled for foot or ankle surgery
   underwent popliteal sciatic nerve block using nerve stimulation
   according to Borgeat's technique and injection of ropivacaine (0.5
   mL/kg). Sensory and motor blockades were assessed on the tibial nerve
   (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) at 5, 15, and 30 mins after
   completion of the block and in the recovery room. A successful block was
   defined as a complete sensory block in TN and CPN. Changes in
   cross-sectional and longitudinal surfaces and diameters and the
   characteristics of LA spread around the nerve were noted using
   ultrasound. A suspected intraneural injection was defined as a 15\%
   increase in the surface area or anteroposterior diameter of the nerve.
   Patients were followed up on days 1 and 7 after surgery.
   Results: Successful block was noted in 57\% of patients at 30 mins and
   in 88\% of patients in the recovery room. A circumferential spread of LA
   occurred in 47\% of patients and 53\% had noncircumferential spread.
   Complete sensory block was significantly higher in the group that had a
   circumferential spread (73\% vs 43\%, P = 0.035) only at 30 mins. In the
   postoperative care unit, there was no difference among the groups.
   Separated circumferential spreads around TN and CPN were noted in 12\%
   of patients. All of these patients had a complete sensory and motor
   blockade at 15 mins. Concerning intraneural injection, only the change
   in the anteroposterior diameter on a 6-cm length of nerve was associated
   with a higher success and faster onset block at 5 (P = 0.008), 15 (P =
   0.02), and 30 (P = 0.05) mins. There were no clinically detectable nerve
   injuries at follow-up.
   Conclusion: For popliteal sciatic nerve block, circumferential spread of
   LA, and separation of the nerve into its 2 components are associated
   with rapid surgical block.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of water resources scarcity, the rational use of water
   for irrigation is necessary, implying precise estimations of the actual
   evapotranspiration (ET). With the recent progresses of remote-sensed
   technologies, regional algorithms estimating evapotranspiration from
   satellite observations were developed. This work aimed at applying the
   SEBAL algorithm (Surface Energy Balance Algorithms for Land) at three
   Landsat-5 images during the second semester of 2006. These images cover
   irrigated areas, dense native forest areas and caatinga areas in three
   regions of the state of Ceara (Baixo Acara, Chapada do Apodi and Chapada
   do Araripe). The SEBAL algorithm calculates the hourly
   evapotranspiration from the latent heat flux, estimated from the surface
   energy balance. The hourly evapotranspiration values obtained were
   greater than 0.60 mm h(-1) in irrigated or dense native vegetation
   areas, from 0.35 to 0.60 mm h(-1) in sparse vegetation areas and almost
   null in degradated areas. The analysis of hourly evapotranspiration
   means by Tukey test at 5\% probability level showed not only a
   significant variability locally but also at a regional scale in the
   state of Ceara.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Three-dimensional (3D) Doppler quantification within the
   uteroplacental unit could be of great help in understanding and
   screening for pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Yet the
   correlation between 3D Doppler indices and true blood flow has not been
   confirmed in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate this
   correlation in a pregnant sheep model.
   Methods A blood flow quantitative sensor and a controllable vascular
   occlusion system were placed around the common uterine artery in seven
   sheep in late pregnancy, while all the other arterial supplies were
   ligated. Several occlusion levels were applied, from 0 to 100\%,
   simultaneously with 3D Doppler acquisitions of several placentomes,
   using standardized settings. Each placentome was analyzed using VOCAL
   (TM) (Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis) software. The correlation
   between true blood flow and Doppler indices (vascularization index (VI),
   flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI)) was evaluated,
   together with measurement reproducibility.
   Results Forty-eight acquisitions were analyzed. All 3D Doppler indices
   were significantly correlated with true blood flow. Higher correlations
   were observed for VI and VFI (r = 0.81 (0.74-0.87), P < 0.0001 and r =
   0.75 (0.67-0.82), P < 0.0001) compared with FI (r = 0.53 (0.38-0.64) P <
   0.0001). Both intra-and interobserver reproducibility were high, with
   intraclass correlation coefficients of at least 0.799.
   Conclusion This is the first in-vivo experimental study confirming a
   significant correlation between true blood perfusion and quantitative 3D
   Doppler indices measured within the uteroplacental unit. These results
   confirm the potential usefulness of 3D Doppler ultrasound for the
   assessment of placental vascular insufficiency both in clinical cases
   and in a research setting. Copyright (C) 2010 ISUOG. Published by John

Abstract = {{This article explores the word ``khaki{''} in various contexts, focusing
   on its etymological association with dust. It is not a technical textile
   history, though elements of process, production, and consumption are
   discussed as critical to the formation of what khaki means. The article
   emphasizes the associative power of khaki in production, in use, and on
   disposal and dispersal from the late nineteenth century to the Second
   World War and in a variety of European and international contexts.
   Focusing on ideas of the particle and processes of fragmentation, it is
   a teasing out of what might be described as khaki's poetics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe the morphological, histological and chemical
   characters of 20 native Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don ssp. italicum
   genotypes collected from different locations in Italy and Corsica
   (France) and grown under similar edaphic and climatic conditions. An
   AFLP technique was used to examine the level of genetic variability
   among the genotypes with the aim to disclose a possible correlation
   between the genetic and chemical data. The chemical analysis recognizes
   at least three different chemotypes based on the major constituents in
   the essential oils. This was confirmed by the AFLP analysis resulting in
   a dendrogram divided into three main clades. Because of the polymorphic
   trait of Helichrysum species, an efficient micropropagation protocol was
   established for the 20 H. italicum (Roth) G. Don ssp. italicum genotypes
   to guarantee the availability of stable genetic material with defined
   chemical profiles for industrial applications. The genotypes were found
   to influence the in vitro performance and the chemical composition of
   the essential oils, but not the phenotypic traits of the plants. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate developmental changes, personal smoking
   experiences, and vicarious smoking experiences as predictors of
   adolescents' perceptions of the risks and benefits of cigarette smoking
   over time, and to identify new and effective targets for youth smoking
   prevention programs. Design: There were 395 adolescents surveyed every 6
   months for two school years, from the beginning of 9th grade to the end
   of 10th grade. Main Outcome Measures: Time, participant smoking, friend
   smoking, parental smoking, and sex were evaluated as predictors of
   smoking-related short-term risk perceptions, long-term risk perceptions,
   and benefits perceptions using multilevel modeling techniques. Results:
   Perceptions of benefits did not change over time. Perceptions of risk
   decreased with time, but not after sex and parental smoking were
   included in the model. Adolescents with personal smoking experience
   reported decreasing perceptions of risk and increasing perceptions of
   benefits over time. Adolescents with more than 6 friends who smoked also
   reported increasing perceptions of benefits over time. Conclusions:
   Changes in risk perceptions may not purely be the result of
   developmental processes, but may also be influenced by personal and
   vicarious experience with smoking. Findings highlight the importance of
   identifying and targeting modifiable factors that may influence
   perceptions.}},

   automatic contextualisation of problems. In two experiments we compared
   the performance of autistic and typically developing adolescents on a
   set of conjunction fallacy tasks. Participants with autism were less
   susceptible to the conjunction fallacy. Experiment 2 also demonstrated
   that the difference between the groups did not result from increased
   sensitivity to the conjunction rule, or from impaired processing of
   social materials amongst the autistic participants. Although adolescents
   with autism showed less bias in their reasoning they were not more
   logical than the control group in a normative sense. The findings are
   discussed in the light of accounts which emphasise differences in
   contextual processing between typical and autistic populations.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maternal nutrition during pregnancy or lactation may affect
   the chance of offspring becoming obese as adults, but little is known
   regarding the possible role of maternal nutrition before conception. In
   this study, we investigate how variable protein and carbohydrate content
   of the diet consumed before pregnancy affects fat deposition and gut
   dimensions of offspring mice.
   Methods: Eight-week-old female mice (C57BL/6JBom) were fed isocaloric
   low protein (8.4\% protein; LP), standard protein (21.5\% protein; ST)
   or high protein (44.2\% protein; HP) diets. After 8 weeks of feeding,
   females were mated and fed a standard laboratory chow diet (22.5\%
   protein) throughout periods of mating, gestation, lactation and weaning.
   Offspring mice were fed the same standard diet up to 46 days of age.
   Then offspring were killed and measures of dissected fat deposits and of
   the digestive system were taken.
   Results: Fat deposition of the offspring was significantly affected by
   preconceptional maternal nutrition and the effects differed between
   sexes. Male offspring deposited most fat when mothers were fed the LP
   diet, whereas female offspring deposited most fat when mothers were fed
   the ST diet. The mass and length of the digestive organs were affected
   by preconceptional maternal nutrition. Total gut from pyloric sphincter
   to anus was significantly shorter and dry mass was heavier in mice whose
   mothers were fed LP diets compared with offspring of mothers fed ST
   diets or HP diets. There was no significant effect of maternal nutrition
   on dry mass of the stomach or ceca.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that preconceptional nutrition can have
   important influence on several body features of offspring in mice,
   including body composition and dimensions of the digestive system.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To report a method to track the pupil in three
   axes simultaneously prior to imaging the fundus.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: The system is based on parallax optical alignment
   to detect the center of the pupil. The system consists of two cameras
   acquiring pupil images from two distinct directions and an
   operator-supervised algorithm to derive the coordinates of the pupil
   center and output of commands to drive a three-axes computer-controlled
   stage. The system was tested in a cohort of 45 individuals 61 +/- 15
   years of age, 26 with and 19 without glaucoma. The tracking was
   performed without pharmacologic pupil dilation.
   RESULTS: The variability of the pupil center determination (assessed by
   the standard deviation) was +/- 0.19 and +/- 0.33 mm for the vertical
   and horizontal directions, respectively. The processing time of the
   algorithm was 0.75 msec. The tracking converged to within a preset
   tolerance of +/- 0.5 mm in 45 of the 45 eyes.
   CONCLUSION: Image acquisition and processing of pupil images can be used
   to align fundus imaging systems rapidly, accurately, and with minimal
   operator intervention.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the behavioral ecology of a chimpanzee population on
   Rubondo Island in Lake Victoria, Tanzania. over 40 years after
   chimpanzees were first introduced to the island from captivity. Despite
   little pre-release habitat assessment, rehabilitation, or post-release
   monitoring, these chimpanzees are one of the only released populations
   to survive over decades without provisioning. We surveyed habitat
   structure and plant composition to gain insights into ecological
   features that have supported this self-sufficient chimpanzee population
   for over 40 years. We also examined possible ecological sources of
   chimpanzee ranging patterns on the island. We surveyed woody plant
   composition, and quantified densities of species producing large fleshy
   fruits and confirmed chimpanzee fruit foods across three chimpanzee
   ranging areas, each separated by several kilometers. We used non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination to compare community-level
   patterns of plant composition across regions. The densities of trees and
   lianas producing fleshy fruits were high in comparison with similar
   measures at endemic chimpanzee study sites. There were major differences
   in the composition of tree species, including species of chimpanzee
   fruit foods, across the three regions. In contrast, liana species
   composition was similar across regions, and was characterized by a few
   super-abundant species, including one chimpanzee fallback food. The
   wide-ranging patterns of chimpanzees do not appear to be influenced by
   localized tree fruiting patterns, but may be facilitated by the
   wide-spread distribution of an important fallback food. In comparison
   with other endemic and release sites, the relatively low ecological
   population density of chimpanzees, the high density of both trees and
   lianas producing large fleshy fruits and the presence of a high-quality,
   widely-distributed fallback food are factors that likely contributed to
   the success of Rubondo chimpanzees in reverting to natural foraging
   behaviors after their release. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To examine the association of race/ethnicity with medication
   use, emergency hospital care (EHC) utilization, and quality-of-life
   outcomes in a population with persistent asthma and to determine if
   factors related to severity of illness, treatment characteristics, and
   demographic, socioeconomic, and smoking status explain differences in
   study outcomes.
   Study Design: Retrospective analysis.
   Methods: We examined survey and administrative data for 974 adults with
   persistent asthma enrolled in a group-model health maintenance
   organization. Patients with persistent asthma were identified in 1999
   using Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set inclusion
   criteria. In 2000, the same patients were surveyed regarding quality of
   life using the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. In 2001, the
   use of controller medications, the ratio of controller medications to
   rescue medications, and EHC utilization were identified by electronic
   medical record. Multiple logistic regression and linear regression
   analyses were used to evaluate the independent association of
   race/ethnicity with study outcomes after adjusting for severity of
   illness, treatment characteristics, and demographic, socioeconomic, and
   smoking status.
   Results: Compared with whites, African Americans (standardized beta
   coefficient, -0.12) and Native Americans/Aleutians/Eskimos (standardized
   beta coefficient, -0.14) had lower Mini Asthma Quality of Life
   Questionnaire scores (P < .05 for both). African Americans were
   significantly ( P < .05) more likely to report EHC utilization (odds
   ratio, 5.2; 95\% confidence interval, 2.6-10.3).
   Conclusions: Disparities existed in 2 outcome measures, Mini Asthma
   Quality of Life Questionnaire scores and EHC utilization. A concerning
   finding is that African Americans were at least 5 times more likely to
   report higher EHC utilization, even after adjusting for factors such as
   income and education. (Am J Manag Care, 2010;16(11):821-828)}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction.
   Early post-radical prostatectomy (RP) erectile preservation (EP) therapy
   may be critical to preserve erections after surgery.
   Aim.
   To assess if pre-RP female sexual function predicts of partner
   compliance with an EP protocol.
   Main Outcome Measures.
   Compliance, defined as use of localized penile EP therapy
   (intracavernosal injections {[}ICIs], vacuum erection device {[}VED], or
   alprostadil) at 3 and 6 months after RP.
   Methods.
   Records of patients enrolled in our EP program from April 2007 to June
   2008 were reviewed. Before surgery, patients completed the Sexual Health
   Inventory for Men (SHIM) and their female partners completed the Female
   Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. Prior to surgery, patients
   were advised to take sildenafil 25 mg every nightly and use a 250-mu g
   alprostadil suppository three times/week. At 1 month, additional daily
   use of a VED was encouraged. All patients unable to achieve erections
   sufficient for penetration were encouraged to initiate ICI of Trimix
   (phentolamine, papaverine, and PGE1) twice weekly after 3 months
   following surgery. Data were analyzed using binary logistic regression
   analysis holding all input variables constant.
   Results.
   Twenty-nine patients had preoperative SHIM > 7 and pre-RP partner FSFI
   data available. After a 4-week follow-up, compliance with alprostadil
   suppository declined and both ICI and VED usage increased. At 6 months,
   six (25.0\%) patients had return of natural erectile function and 22
   (91.7\%) were achieving assisted erections. Higher preoperative partner
   FSFI scores were associated with greater compliance to the localized
   penile therapy component of our EP protocol (risk ratio 3.8, P = 0.05).
   Conclusions.
   Preoperative female sexual function correlated with greater partner
   compliance with the localized component of our EP protocol.
   Consideration of a female partner's preoperative sexual function in
   predicting patient erectile function recovery after RP is warranted.
   Future studies are necessary to determine the clinical significance of
   this factor. Moskovic DJ, Mohamed O, Sathyamoorthy K, Miles BJ, Link RE,

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of cochlear
   implantation (CI) on prelingually deafened participants who were
   implanted as adults. The effect of the CI was examined with regard to
   the following variables: communication, family, social skills,
   education, and work satisfaction with one's life, loneliness, and
   self-esteem.
   Materials and methods: Thirty-eight adults participated. Four
   self-report questionnaires were used at 2 points in time: before and
   after CI.
   Results: The research findings show significant differences in the
   reports of most variables before and after implantation. The
   participants felt better with regard to communication, social skills,
   education, and work and satisfaction with one's life after implantation
   in comparison to their feelings before implantation. Furthermore, they
   felt less lonely after implantation. However, there were no significant
   differences before and after implantation regarding their feelings
   within the family and regarding their self-esteem.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrated the need to evaluate the benefits
   resulting from the CI not only with traditional clinical measures but
   with additional measures as well. Furthermore, they demonstrated the
   benefit of the CI on the positive psychosociological implications of
   prelingually deafened adults. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background and aim of the study: Risk models of cardiac valve surgery
   using a large database are useful for improving surgical quality. In
   order to obtain accurate, high-quality assessments of surgical outcome,
   each geographic area should maintain its own database. The study aim was
   to collect Japanese data and to prepare a risk stratification of cardiac
   valve procedures, using the Japan Adult Cardiovascular Surgery Database
   (JACVSD).
   Methods: A total of 6,562 valve procedure records from 97 participating
   sites throughout Japan was analyzed, using a data entry form with 255
   variables that was sent to the JACVSD office from a web-based data
   collection system. The statistical model was constructed using multiple
   logistic regression. Model discrimination was tested using the area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve (C-index). The model
   calibration was tested using the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test.
   Results: Among 6,562 operated cases, 15\% had diabetes mellitus, 5\%
   were urgent, and 12\% involved preoperative renal failure. The observed
   30-day and operative mortality rates were 2.9\% and 4.0\%, respectively.
   Significant variables with high odds ratios included emergent or salvage
   status (3.83), reoperation (3.43), and left ventricular dysfunction
   (3.01). The H-L test and C-index values for 30-day mortality were
   satisfactory (0.44 and 0.80, respectively).
   Conclusion: The results obtained in Japan were at least as good as those
   reported elsewhere. The performance of this risk model also matched that
   of the STS National Adult Cardiac Database and the European Society
   Database.}},

   prosthetic reinforcements vaginally The classification was made from
   descriptions found and then assessed by questionnaires filled out by
   surgeons
   Results - The classification takes account of all the techniques
   available today and can integrate new Among the surgeons, 56 5\% (13/23)
   found that the POP ST is adapted to reflect the reality and variety of
   techniques and 60 8\% (14/23) will be ready for daily use

   bacteria (89.02\%) were correctly identified at the species level.
   Enterobacteriaceae constituted 35.15\% of all species found,
   Staphylococaceae 37.96\%, Streptococaceae and Enterococaceae 20.85\%,
   Pseudomonadaceae 1.69\%, and anaerobes 2.44\%. In most of the
   polymicrobial samples, one of the species present was identified
   (80.9\%). Seven isolates remained misidentified as Streptococcus
   pneumoniae, all belonging to Streptococcus mitis. Staphylococcus aureus
   was identified better when grown on anaero-aerobic medium, and MALDI
   BioTyper identification scores as low as 1.4 were pertinent, provided
   that four successive proposals of the same species were given. This new
   protocol correlates with conventional microbiology procedures by up to
   90\%, and by > 95\% for only monomicrobial samples, and provides a
   decreased turn-around time for identification of bacteria isolated from
   blood cultures, making this technology suitable also for blood cultures,
   with less delay and cost decreases in bacterial diagnostics, and
   favouring better care of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Total phenolic content, proanthocyanidins, gallotannins, flavonoids, and
   antioxidant activities of Sclerocarya birrea and Harpephyllum caffrum
   methanolic extracts were evaluated using in vitro assays. S. birrea
   young stem extract contained the highest levels of total phenolic
   content (14.15 +/- 0.03 mg GAE/g), flavonoids (1.21 +/- 0.01 mg CE/g)
   and gallotannins (0.24 +/- 0.00 mg GAE/g). H. caffrum stem bark extract
   had the highest content of proanthocyanidins (1.47\%). The EC50 values
   of the extracts in the DPPH free radical scavenging assay ranged from
   4.26 to 6.92 mu g/ml, compared to 6.86 mu g/ml for ascorbic acid. A
   dose-dependent linear curve was obtained for all extracts in the
   ferric-reducing power assay. Dichloromethane and methanol extracts
   exhibited dose-dependent acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity.
   Similarly, all extracts exhibited high antioxidant activity comparable
   to butylated hydroxytoluene based on the rate of beta-carotene bleaching
   (84.1-93.9\%). The two Anacardiaceae species provide a source of natural
   antioxidants and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and may be beneficial
   to the health of consumers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The polypeptide hormone relaxin has been proven to be effective in
   promoting both the remodeling and regeneration of various tissues,
   including cardiac muscle. In addition, our previous study demonstrated
   that relaxin is beneficial to skeletal muscle healing by both promoting
   muscle regeneration and preventing fibrosis formation. However, the
   molecular and cellular mechanisms of relaxin in regulating both myogenic
   cell differentiation and muscle healing process are still unclear. In
   this study, C2C12 mouse myoblasts and primary human myoblasts were
   treated with relaxin to investigate its potential effect in vitro;
   relaxin was also injected intramuscularly into the injured site of the
   mouse on the second day after injury to observe its function in vivo,
   especially in the aged muscle. Results showed that relaxin promoted
   myogenic differentiation, migration, and activation of matrix
   metalloproteinases (MMPs) of cultured myoblasts in vitro. In the injured
   muscle, relaxin administration promoted the activation of Pax7-positive
   skeletal muscle satellite cells and increased its local population
   compared with non-treated control muscles. Meanwhile, both angiogenesis
   and revascularization were increased, while the extended inflammatory
   reaction was repressed in the relaxin-treated injured muscle. Moreover,
   relaxin similarly promoted muscle healing in mice with aged muscle.
   These results revealed the multiple effects of relaxin in systematically
   improving muscle healing as well as its potential for clinical
   applications in patients with skeletal muscle injuries and diseases. (Am

Abstract = {{The ability to both identify and explain others' intentional acts is
   fundamental for successful social interaction. In two cross-sectional
   studies, we investigated 3- to 9-year-olds' (n = 148) understanding of
   the folk concept of intentionality, using three types of intentionality
   measures. The relationship between this type of reasoning and false
   belief and interpretive mind understanding was also examined. Judgment
   of the appropriateness of an explanation was based on adult responses (n
   = 20). Overall, the results indicated that the ability to both identify
   and appropriately explain a range of intentional acts does not fully
   emerge until 7 years of age or later. The pattern of explanations
   revealed the gradual development of a folk concept of intentionality.
   Preschool- and early school-age children focused on the protagonists'
   desires and actions, whereas 8- and 9-year-olds and adults were more
   likely to reference the protagonists' awareness and skills. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A set of tools are described for optimal allocation of wood fibre at an
   operational planning level. These were applied to a case study in
   Ireland. Allocation was based on optimising net value recovery
   (delivered price minus harvesting and transportation costs) while
   meeting market demands and operational constraints (mainly crew
   capability and productivity limits). Two new models were developed to
   predict harvesting costs and transportation costs for Irish forest
   conditions. A new model was developed to link Sitka spruce biomass
   expansion factors to optimal log-making algorithms so that log and
   bio-energy product yields could be estimated for individual harvest
   areas. An existing operational allocation model based on a tabu search
   heuristic procedure was used. The case study included 16 forest harvest
   areas and 12 processing plants (saw logs, pallet logs, stakes, pulp,
   bio-energy slash bundles, etc.). New terrestrial lidar scanning
   procedures were used to obtain representative stem profiles from over
   4,000 trees for the 16 forests. We demonstrated that optimal allocation
   of bio-energy and log products, while complex, can be achieved through
   the use of appropriate management tools.}},

Abstract = {{Mosquito larval development occurs in aquatic habitats that are directly
   or indirectly exposed to chemical contaminants. Little is known about
   how interaction of these chemicals with other biotic and abiotic
   stressors impact mosquito populations. We used two levels of nutrient
   (low and high) and four larval densities (10, 20, 30, 40) to examine the
   effects of low concentrations of insecticide malathion, on Culex pipiens
   L mosquitoes experiencing stress from larval competition. Addition of
   malathion at the high nutrient condition enhanced survival with
   increasing larval densities, but this effect was not observed at low
   nutrient condition. Males exposed to malathion were significantly larger
   than those from control treatments while the effect of malathion on size
   of females varied with larval density and the level of nutrients. Larval
   exposure to malathion and low nutrient resulted in significantly larger
   females with increases in larval densities compared with other
   treatments. The effect of malathion on male longevity varied with larval
   density and amount of nutrients. At higher densities, male longevity was
   consistently higher in low nutrient than in high nutrient conditions and
   addition of malathion in high nutrient treatment increased male
   longevity at the highest density. These effects are most likely
   attributable to release from competition among survivors after mortality
   from malathion and density-dependent effects. We conclude that biotic
   conditions of the larval habitat can alter the impact of low
   concentrations of chemical contaminants on mosquito populations in ways
   that may influence the pattern of disease transmission and the outcome
   of vector control efforts. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   12p70 production and expression of DC co-stimulatory molecules did not
   vary significantly by age indicating that TLR expression function and

   40-fold across the lifespan DC-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) also
   increased with age and the up-regulation of IL-23 expression by aged DC
   was blocked by indomethacin that prevents PGE2 production and by
   antagonists of PGE2 receptors Exogenous PGE2 added to DC cultures
   further enhanced IL 23 production from aged but not young DCs These data

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1882-1891}},

Abstract = {{Accurate definition of the similarity measure is a key component in
   image registration. Most commonly used intensity-based similarity
   measures rely on the assumptions of independence and stationarity of the
   intensities from pixel to pixel. Such measures cannot capture the
   complex interactions among the pixel intensities, and often result in
   less satisfactory registration performances, especially in the presence
   of spatially-varying intensity distortions. We propose a novel
   similarity measure that accounts for intensity nonstationarities and
   complex spatially-varying intensity distortions in mono-modal settings.
   We derive the similarity measure by analytically solving for the
   intensity correction field and its adaptive regularization. The final
   measure can be interpreted as one that favors a registration with
   minimum compression complexity of the residual image between the two
   registered images. One of the key advantages of the new similarity
   measure is its simplicity in terms of both computational complexity and
   implementation. This measure produces accurate registration results on
   both artificial and real-world problems that we have tested, and
   outperforms other state-of-the-art similarity measures in these cases.}},

   occurrence of double-storied cambium In this species procambium and
   primary vascular tissues are present only within the bud, whereas just
   below this level, cambium and secondary vascular tissues occur
   Procambium differentiates as a continuous cylinder which as a whole
   transforms Into cambium during further development Commonly used
   criteria distinguishing procambium and cambium - that is the appearance
   of periclinal divisions, intrusive growth of meriste mane cells,
   presence of rays and primary versus secondary nature of derived vascular
   tissues - were analysed in D lotus All these features, however were
   present in procambium, making the sharp distinction between both stages
   of vascular meristem based on these criteria difficult In addition, the
   formation of fusiform and ray initial storeys in D lotus was shown to
   appear in the third year of cambium activity and become more distinct
   with cambium age The double stoned structure may result from the genetic
   control of cell fate and (or) the presence of epigenetic patterns

Abstract = {{The Bayesian design approach is an experimental design technique which
   has many advantages over standard experimental designs. It incorporates
   prior knowledge about the process into the design to suggest a set of
   future experiments in an optimal, sequential, and iterative fashion.
   Since for many complex polymerizations prior information is available,
   either in the form of experimental data or mathematical models, the use
   of Bayesian design methodology could be beneficial. Exploiting this
   technique in complex polymerizations could hopefully lead to optimal
   performance in fewer trials, thus saving time and money. Advantages of
   the Bayesian design approach are illustrated via case studies drawn from
   the nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization as an example. However,
   since this technique is perfectly general, it can be potentially applied
   to other polymerization variants.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Interleukin (IL)-24 and -29 are novel cytokines, produced by
   immune cells in response to microbial antigens. The functions of these
   cytokines in the reproductive system are unknown. We examined the
   expression pattern of IL-24 and IL-29 in human fetal membranes from
   preterm and term births and in in vitro in response to microbial
   antigens.
   Methods: Fetal membranes collected from cesarean sections at term
   (normal, not in labor) were placed in culture for 48 h. These membranes
   were then stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or viral
   antigen poly-inosinic and cytidylic acid (polyIC) for an additional 24
   h. Amniotic fluids (AF) and fetal membranes were also collected from
   preterm and term deliveries. IL-24 and IL-29 expressions were studied by
   RT-PCR. ELISA documented culture media and AF cytokine concentrations.
   Results: IL-24 and IL-29 expressions were seen in cultured fetal
   membranes regardless of stimulation. Expressions were also found in
   preterm and term labor membranes, but not in non-labor tissues at term.
   IL-24 concentrations were higher after LPS stimulation whereas IL-29
   concentrations were higher after polyIC-stimulation. AF analysis did not
   detect either of the cytokines either preterm or term.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to report IL-24 and IL-29
   expressions in human fetal membranes. Higher concentrations of these
   cytokines in response to distinct infectious stimuli suggest different
   pathways for fetal immune response during infection.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{79}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Single crystals of layered perovskite Sr2RhO4-delta (delta = 0.0 and
   0.1) are successfully grown by the floating-zone method. Stoichiometric
   single crystals (Sr2RhO4.0) are obtained by O2-annealing the as-grown
   crystals (Sr2RhO3.9). Sr2RhO4.0 and Sr2RhO3.9 show quasi-two-dimensional
   Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures, whereas there are large
   differences in the anisotropy of electrical resistivity rho(c)(3
   K)/rho(ab)(3 K) and Wilson ratio R-w between Sr2RhO4.0 and Sr2RhO3.9:
   rho(c)(3 K)/rho(ab)(3 K) = 2400 (19000) and R-w = 3.8 (6.4) for
   Sr2RhO4.0 (Sr2RhO3.9). The differences observed between the temperature
   dependence of the in-plane electrical resistivity (T < 15 K), magnetic
   susceptibility (T < 300 K) and specific heat (T < 10 K) of Sr2RhO4.0 and
   Sr2RhO3.9 are mainly derived from those between the density of states
   and band structure near the corresponding Fermi level. This indicates
   that the changes in these physical properties, which are accompanied by
   oxygen defects in the Sr2RhO4-delta system, can be explained by the
   rigid band model. Moreover, these results suggest that t(2g)
   band-filling can be controlled by adjusting the oxygen defect content
   delta in the Sr2RhO4-delta system. Although many similarities are
   observed in this study between the physical properties of Sr2RhO4.0 and
   Sr2RuO4, Sr(2)RhO(4.)0 does not exhibit superconductivity down to 36 mK.}},

Title = {{Beyond alias hierarchical scale curvelet interpolation of regularly and

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{6, S}},
Pages = {{WB189-WB202}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{We propose a robust interpolation scheme for aliased regularly sampled
   seismic data that uses the curvelet transform. In a first pass, the
   curvelet transform is used to compute the curvelet coefficients of the
   aliased seismic data. The aforementioned coefficients are divided into
   two groups of scales: alias-free and alias-contaminated scales. The
   alias-free curvelet coefficients are upscaled to estimate a mask
   function that is used to constrain the inversion of the
   alias-contaminated scale coefficients. The mask function is incorporated
   into the inversion via a minimum norm least-squares algorithm that
   determines the curvelet coefficients of the desired alias-free data.
   Once the alias-free coefficients are determined, the curvelet synthesis
   operator is used to reconstruct seismograms at new spatial positions.
   The proposed method can be used to reconstruct regularly and irregularly
   sampled seismic data. We believe that our exposition leads to a clear
   unifying thread between f-x and f-k beyond-alias interpolation methods
   and curvelet reconstruction. As in f-x and f-k interpolation, we stress
   the necessity of examining seismic data at different scales (frequency
   bands) to come up with viable and robust interpolation schemes.
   Synthetic and real data examples are used to illustrate the performance
   of the proposed curvelet interpolation method.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the central mechanisms of feeding suppression by the
   anorexigenic hormones neuromedin U (NMU) and neuromedin S (NMS) in rats.
   I.c.v. injection of either NMU or NMS dose dependently decreased 3-h
   food intake during the first quarter of a dark period. Pretreatment
   involving i.c.v. injection of a specific anti-NMS IgG blocked the
   suppression of food intake induced by i.c.v.- and i.p.-injected leptin,
   but anti-NMU IgG elicited no blockade. Quantitative PCR analysis
   revealed that i.c.v. injection of NMU or NMS caused a dose-dependent
   increase in CRH and proopiomelanocortin mRNA expression in the
   paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and arcuate nucleus (Arc) respectively. In
   tissue cultures of the Arc, secretion of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating
   hormone was stimulated by NMU and NMS, with more potent stimulation by
   NMS. The time-course curves of the increase in neuronal firing rate in
   Arc slices in response to NMU and NMS showed almost the same pattern,
   with a peak 10-15 min after treatment, whereas the time-course curves
   for the PVN slices differed between NMU and NMS. These results suggest
   that NMS and NMU may share anorexigenic effects, depending on
   physiological conditions. Journal of Endocrinology (2010) 207, 185-193}},

Abstract = {{The Chinese stock market is an order-driven market and hence its
   characteristics are structurally different from quote-driven markets.
   There are no studies that consider the role of the market liquidity risk
   factor in determining cross-sectional stock returns in a model including
   financial market anomalies for order-driven markets. Our aim is to test
   whether financial market anomalies such as firm size, the book-to-market
   ratio, the turnover rate, and momentum both with and without the
   inclusion of the market liquidity risk factor in the case of the Chinese
   stock market can explain cross-sectional stock returns. The empirical
   framework is based on the model proposed by Avramov and Chordia (AC,
   2006). Our main finding is that the AC model can capture financial
   market anomalies except momentum when we include the market liquidity
   risk factor on the Chinese stock market. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   Study Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting \& Participants: 44,630 adult living donor kidney recipients

   1994, to December 31, 2004.
   Predictor: DGF, defined as the need for dialysis therapy in the first
   week after transplant.
   Outcome: Time to DWGF.
   Measurements: Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to assess the impact
   of DGF on DWGF. Recipients with DGF were 1: 1 propensity score matched
   to those without DGF, and time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models
   were used to examine factors associated with DWGF. Subgroup and
   sensitivity analyses also were conducted.
   Results: DWGF occurred in 3,878 patients during 3.9 years' (median)
   follow-up. In patients with DGF, survival with graft function at 1, 3,
   5, and 10 years was 91.9\%, 86.8\%, 81.6\%, and 61.7\%, respectively (in
   patients without DGF, these values were 98.0\%, 95.2\%, 91.6\%, and
   80.1\%, respectively; P < 0.001 compared with the DGF group). In a fully
   adjusted time-dependent Cox model, HRs for DWGF in patients with DGF (vs
   without DGF) were 6.55 (95\% CI, 4.78-8.97), 3.55 (95\% CI, 2.46-5.11),
   2.07 (95\% CI, 1.53-2.81), and 1.48 (95\% CI, 1.26-1.73) at 0-1, 1-3,
   3-12, and longer than 12 months posttransplant, respectively. Propensity
   score analysis showed similar results. Inferences were unchanged after
   adjustment for kidney function and acute rejection at 6 months and 1
   year posttransplant. Cardiovascular and infectious causes of DWGF were
   more prevalent in patients with DGF. The association was more marked in
   female recipients and robust to various sensitivity analyses.
   Limitations: The impact of lesser decreases in early graft function
   could not be evaluated.
   Conclusions: DGF is associated with an increased risk of DWGF in living
   donor kidney recipients. The mechanisms underlying this relation require
   further study. Am J Kidney Dis 56: 961-970. (C) 2010 by the National

Abstract = {{Previously, we reported that chlorogenic acid (CGA) facilitated root
   hair formation at pH 4.0 in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Grand
   Rapids). Light was essential for this process. In the present study, we
   determined relationships between CGA, light, and sugar during root hair
   formation in lettuce seedlings. The amount of CGA increased with white
   light in intact seedlings. Exogenously applied CGA restored root hair
   formation in dark-grown intact seedlings at pH 4.0. However, no root
   hair formation was induced in decapitated seedlings regardless of light
   exposure and CGA application. Application of sucrose or glucose induced
   both root hair formation and CGA synthesis in light-grown decapitated
   seedlings at pH 4.0. Blue light was the most effective for both root
   hair formation and CGA synthesis when supplied with sucrose to
   decapitated seedlings. Addition of sucrose and CGA together induced root
   hair formation at pH 4.0 in dark-grown decapitated seedlings. Results
   suggest that light induced CGA synthesis from sugar in the roots. Sugar
   was also required for root hair formation other than starting material
   of CGA synthesis. In addition, an unknown low pH-induced factor was
   essential for lettuce root hair formation.}},

Abstract = {{A system level implementation of a large area hybrid detector is
   presented. The detector used in this system consists of an array of
   hydrogenated amorphous silicon photodiodes directly connected to a CMOS
   readout chip, which is vertically integrated over the sensor array using
   flip-chip bonding. In particular, the proposed solution relies on a
   stack of interconnection layers, deposited on top of the photodiode
   array, to route each individual pixel output to a separate pre-amplifier
   channel. This avoids the need for a geometrical matching between the
   sensor array and the chip contact pads. As a consequence, conventional
   non-pixelated readout chip can be used and easy-scalable large area
   detectors can be produced. The CMOS chip is connected to an electronic
   board, providing the interfaces needed to read the signals as well as
   providing voltage references and power to the chip. The signals are
   collected and pre-processed by an FPGA chip, providing a very compact
   and flexible setup. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss the emergence of a new paradigm in 3D city
   modeling, which we will call the rich point cloud paradigm and which is
   largely based on dense and semantically rich 3D point clouds. We first
   present existing modeling paradigms, namely the explicit modeling of 3D
   geometry and image-based city modeling, and discuss their strengths and
   shortcomings. Key elements of the new modeling paradigm include the
   following: (1) treatment of 3D point clouds with increasingly rich
   geometric, radiometric and semantic properties as actual urban 3D models
   and not just as an input to the traditional 3D modeling process, (2)
   potential for fully automatically capturing and generating large scale
   3D city models, (3) capturing rich detail of the micro- to meso-scale
   environment from a ground-based `human' perspective supporting numerous
   drive-through and walk-through application scenarios and (4) possibility
   to start from fully automatically derived simple visual models and to
   gradually enhance and enrich them on an as-needed basis. We contend that
   virtual globes have a key role in fully exploiting the potential of the
   new paradigm. These arguments are supported with the implementation of a
   proof of concept prototype based on the i3D virtual globe technology and
   with initial observations from tests with real-world data sets. Finally,
   we identify a number of future research issues and challenges that are
   triggered by the new paradigm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   metabolizes raltegravir, but the magnitude of steady-state inhibition
   and role of the UGT1A1 genotype are unknown. Sufficient inhibition could
   lead to reduced-dose and -cost raltegravir regimens. Nineteen healthy
   volunteers, age 24 to 51 years, took raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (arm
   A) and 400 mg plus atazanavir 400 mg once daily (arm B), separated by >=
   3 days, in a crossover design. After 1 week on each regimen, raltegravir
   and raltegravir-glucuronide plasma and urine concentrations were
   measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in multiple
   samples obtained over 12 h (arm A) or 24 h (arm B) and analyzed by
   noncompartmental methods. UGT1A1 promoter variants were detected with a
   commercially available kit and published primers. The primary outcome
   was the ratio of plasma raltegravir C-tau, or concentration at the end
   of the dosing interval, for arm B (24 h) versus arm A (12 h). The arm
   B-to-arm A geometric mean ratios (95\% confidence interval, P value) for
   plasma raltegravir C-tau, area under the concentration-time curve from 0
   to 12 h (AUC(0-12)), and raltegravir-glucuronide/ raltegravir AUC(0-12)

   (0.38 to 0.59, <0.001), respectively. Nine volunteers were heterozygous
   and one was homozygous for a UGT1A1 reduction-of- function allele, but
   these were not associated with metabolite formation. Although atazanavir
   significantly reduced the formation of the glucuronide metabolite, its
   steady-state boosting of plasma raltegravir did not render the C-tau
   with a once-daily raltegravir dose of 400 mg similar to the C-tau with
   the standard twice-daily dose. UGT1A1 promoter variants did not
   significantly influence this interaction.}},

Abstract = {{While cholera has been a recognized disease for two centuries, there is
   no strategy for its effective control. We formulate a mathematical model
   to include essential components such as a hyperinfectious, short-lived
   bacterial state, a separate class for mild human infections, and waning
   disease immunity. A new result quantifies contributions to the basic
   reproductive number from multiple infectious classes. Using optimal
   control theory, parameter sensitivity analysis, and numerical
   simulations, a cost-effective balance of multiple intervention methods
   is compared for two endemic populations. Results provide a framework for
   designing cost-effective strategies for diseases with multiple
   intervention methods.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the pharmacokinetics of dapivirine in plasma and dapivirine
   concentrations in cervicovaginal fluids (CVF) and cervicovaginal tissues
   following vaginal administration of dapivirine microbicide gel in
   healthy, HIV-negative women for 10 days. A randomized, double-blind,
   phase I study was conducted at a single research center in South Africa.
   A total of 18 women used dapivirine gel (0.001\%, 0.005\%, or 0.02\%)
   once daily on Days 1 and 10 and twice daily on Days 2-9.
   Pharmacokinetics of dapivirine were assessed in plasma on Days 1 and 10.
   Dapivirine concentrations were measured in CVF on Days 1 and 10 and in
   cervicovaginal tissues on Day 10. Safety was evaluated through
   laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis),
   physical examinations, and assessment of adverse events. Plasma
   concentrations of dapivirine increased over time with gel dose and were
   greater on Day 10 (C-max 31 to 471 pg/ml) than Day 1 (C-max 23 to 80
   pg/ml). T-max was 10-12 h on Day 1, and 9 h on Day 10. Concentrations in
   CVF generally increased with dose but were highly variable among
   participants. Mean peak values ranged from 4.6-8.3 x 10(6) pg/ml on Day
   1 and from 2.3-20.7 x 10(6) pg/ml on Day 10 across dose groups.
   Dapivirine was detectable in all tissue biopsies on Day 10 at
   concentrations of 1.0-356 x 10(3) pg/mg.
   Conclusions: Dapivirine was widely distributed throughout the lower
   genital tract with low systemic absorption when administered in a
   vaginal gel formulation for 10 consecutive days. The gel was safe and
   well tolerated.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In a multicenter, prospectively randomized study we evaluated
   bacillus Calmette-Guerin alone vs bacillus Calmette-Guerin plus
   interferon alpha-2b and megadose vitamins vs recommended daily allowance
   vitamins during induction and maintenance intravesical therapy in the
   treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.
   Materials and Methods: Patients who were bacillus Calmette-Guerin naive
   with carcinoma in situ, Ta or T1 urothelial cancer were randomized to
   receive intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin or bacillus
   Calmette-Guerin plus interferon alpha-2b. Patients were further
   randomized to receive a recommended daily allowance or megadose vitamin
   preparation. Induction bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment was given
   weekly for 6 weeks, and patients who were recurrence-free received
   maintenance treatment at 4, 7, 13, 19, 25 and 37 months. Patients were
   followed with quarterly cystoscopy for 2 years, then semiannually
   through year 4 and then annually. The primary end point was biopsy
   confirmed tumor recurrence or positive cytology.
   Results: A total of 670 patients were accrued and randomized. At
   24-month median followup recurrence-free survival was similar in all
   groups with 63\% in the bacillus Calmette-Guerin with recommended daily
   allowance vitamins group, 59\% in bacillus Calmette-Guerin with megadose
   vitamins, 55\% in bacillus Calmette-Guerin/interferon alpha-2b with
   recommended daily allowance vitamins and 61\% in bacillus
   Calmette-Guerin/interferon alpha-2b with megadose vitamins (p >0.05).
   The addition of interferon alpha-2b was associated with a more frequent
   incidence of fever (11\% vs 5\%) and constitutional symptoms (18\% vs
   11\%) vs bacillus Calmette-Guerin alone (p <0.05).
   Conclusions: Interferon alpha-2b added to bacillus Calmette-Guerin
   induction and maintenance intravesical therapy did not decrease tumor
   recurrence in bacillus Calmette-Guerin naive cases, but was associated
   with increased fever and constitutional symptoms. No difference in time
   to recurrence was present in patients receiving recommended daily
   allowance vs high dose vitamins.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Signals in the environment are rarely specified exactly: our visual
   system may know what to look for (e. g., a specific face), but not its
   exact configuration (e. g., where in the room, or in what orientation).
   Uncertainty, and the ability to deal with it, is a fundamental aspect of
   visual processing. The MAX model is the current gold standard for
   describing how human vision handles uncertainty: of all possible
   configurations for the signal, the observer chooses the one
   corresponding to the template associated with the largest response. We
   propose an alternative model in which the MAX operation, which is a
   dynamic non-linearity (depends on multiple inputs from several stimulus
   locations) and happens after the input stimulus has been matched to the
   possible templates, is replaced by an early static non-linearity
   (depends only on one input corresponding to one stimulus location) which
   is applied before template matching. By exploiting an integrated set of
   analytical and experimental tools, we show that this model is able to
   account for a number of empirical observations otherwise unaccounted for
   by the MAX model, and is more robust with respect to the realistic
   limitations imposed by the available neural hardware. We then discuss
   how these results, currently restricted to a simple visual detection
   task, may extend to a wider range of problems in sensory processing.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has emerged as
   an innovative and popular procedure for closure of a patent ductus
   arteriosus (PDA), but is associated with a minute rate of residual or
   recurrent duct patency. This study aims to analyze the efficacy of
   intraoperative esophageal stethoscopic monitoring in reducing the
   incidence of residual ductal flow during PDA clipping by VATS.
   Methods: Between June 1997 and October 2009, we retrospectively assessed
   2000 consecutive patients with PDA who underwent VATS. During the
   procedure, heart sounds were monitored by the anesthesiologist through
   an esophageal stethoscope. Changes in continuous cardiac murmurs were
   recorded before and after the PDA clipping and were confirmed to
   disappear completely. Color flow Doppler echocardiography was performed
   immediately before discharge, and patients were followed monthly for 3,
   6, and 12 months and then annually to confirm the absence of residual or
   recurrent shunt.
   Results: Mean age was 6.0 years (range, 1 month-35 years), mean weight
   was 11.1 kg (range, 6-65 kg), and mean PDA diameter was 5.5 mm (range,
   3-9 mm). Ninety-two percent of patients showed no ductal flow after a
   single clipping. In the other 8\% of patients, residual flow was
   detected intraoperatively after a single clipping, but was eliminated by
   the second clipping. Twelve patients (0.6\%) presented with residual
   ductal flow immediately after the operation (detected by color Doppler
   echocardiography), which was eliminated by thoracotomy before discharge.
   All patients left the hospital with echocardiography documenting no
   evidence of residual PDA. At follow-up, the incidence of residual
   patency was 0.2\% (4 of 2000).
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the intraoperative esophageal
   stethoscope provides a remarkably effective technique for monitoring and
   evaluating PDA ligation by VATS, thus avoiding reintervention and the
   complications associated with residual ductal flow in most cases. (C)

Abstract = {{Representative surface reconstruction algorithms taking a gradient field
   as input enforce the integrability constraint in a discrete manner.
   While enforcing integrability allows the subsequent integration to
   produce surface heights, existing algorithms have one or more of the
   following disadvantages: They can only handle dense per-pixel gradient
   fields, smooth out sharp features in a partially integrable field, or
   produce severe surface distortion in the results. In this paper, we
   present a method which does not enforce discrete integrability and
   reconstructs a 3D continuous surface from a gradient or a height field,
   or a combination of both, which can be dense or sparse. The key to our
   approach is the use of kernel basis functions, which transfer the
   continuous surface reconstruction problem into high-dimensional space,
   where a closed-form solution exists. By using the Gaussian kernel, we
   can derive a straightforward implementation which is able to produce
   results better than traditional techniques. In general, an important
   advantage of our kernel-based method is that the method does not suffer
   discretization and finite approximation, both of which lead to surface
   distortion, which is typical of Fourier or wavelet bases widely adopted
   by previous representative approaches. We perform comparisons with
   classical and recent methods on benchmark as well as challenging data
   sets to demonstrate that our method produces accurate surface
   reconstruction that preserves salient and sharp features. The source
   code and executable of the system are available for downloading.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{611-617}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   To review recent publications related to NSAID-induced adverse effects
   on the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems.
   Recent findings
   This paper explores novel mechanisms of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal
   injury, highlights new composite endpoints evaluating adverse events of
   NSAIDs in the entire gastrointestinal tract, and combines published data
   to establish evidence-based guidance on the best use of NSAIDs to
   achieve optimal clinical outcomes whilst minimizing cardiovascular and
   gastrointestinal injuries.
   Summary
   NSAIDs can induce peptic ulcers via epithelial cell membrane disruption
   and the renin angiotensin system, independent of the cyclooxygenase
   (COX) pathways, whereas mast cells and bile acid sensors may have a
   protective effect on NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage. Patients
   with arthritis treated with a COX-2 inhibitor are less likely to develop
   upper and lower gastrointestinal complications than those who are
   treated with diclofenac plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). PPI therapy
   is recommended in patients receiving dual antiplatelet treatment but
   observational studies show that clopidogrel users taking PPIs have an
   increased risk of cardiovascular events. Until further reliable
   controlled data are available, this potential, but currently unproven,
   clinical interaction can be minimized by widely separating the dosing of
   clopidogrel and PPI. Histamine-2 antagonists may be an alternative to
   PPI for the prevention of peptic ulcers in patients taking low-dose
   aspirin.}},

Title = {{COMPARATIVE CALIBRATION OF A COMPLEX HYDROLOGIC MODEL BY STOCHASTIC
   METHODS GLUE AND PEST}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1773-1786}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hydrologic and environmental models are useful for prediction and
   understanding of processes. Model calibration often faces the problem of
   equifinality, by which empirical observations validate one set of model
   parameter values almost to the same degree as another very different
   set. This uncertainty in model parameter values implies uncertainty in
   model predictions. A stochastic approach to calibration is therefore
   appropriate to establish the likely range or probability distribution of
   model parameters and predictions. In the literature, two commonly used
   methods are the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE)
   approach and the Parameter Estimation (PEST) software (a nonlinear
   parameter estimation and optimization package). This study makes a
   side-by-side comparison of GLUE and PEST applied to two models, the
   first a simple two-parameter sinusoidal temperature model and the second
   a complex multi-parameter multi-purpose hydrologic model, the Soil and
   Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, applied to the Salt Creek watershed
   in Illinois. The SWAT model is calibrated for stream flow, corn and
   soybean yields, and nitrate load. The GLUE and PEST calibrations for the
   simple model are straightforward. The same is not true, however, of the
   complex SWAT model, for which both GLUE and PEST are found to require
   some level of prior information to be effective. In this study, that
   information is obtained from a deterministic calibration of the system
   using a genetic algorithm (GA). The results indicate that generally
   there is a greater flexibility in problem specification in GLUE than in
   PEST This is desirable, although it also means that there is a greater
   level of subjectivity. This flexibility, together with GLUE's
   independence from any assumption of model structure, makes GLUE suitable
   for calibrating large complex models where computational resources are
   available. On the other hand, for problems where the presence of local
   optima is not significant, PEST is an attractive option, as it is able
   to identify the optimal set of adjustable model parameters at just a
   fraction of the computational cost of GLUE.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Accumulating evidence implicates T(H)17 cytokines in
   protection against Candida species infections, but the clinical
   relevance is not clear. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is a
   heterogeneous syndrome with the unifying feature of selective
   susceptibility to chronic candidiasis. Different subgroups with distinct
   clinical features are recognized, including autoimmune
   polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), CMC with
   hypothyroidism, and isolated CMC. Understanding immune defects in
   patients with CMC will define cellular and molecular mechanisms crucial
   for protection against Candida species in human subjects.
   Objectives: We sought to determine whether impaired T(H)17 responses
   underlie susceptibility to Candida species infections and whether the
   same defect is present in different CMC subgroups.
   Methods: We assessed T(H)17 responses of PBMCs to Candida and
   non-Candida species stimuli by measuring IL-17, IL-22, IL-21, IL-6,
   IL-23, and IFN-gamma cytokine production using cytokine arrays and
   intracellular cytokine-producing cell numbers and proliferation with
   flow cytometry. PBMCs from healthy subjects and unaffected family
   members served as controls.
   Results: In patients with CMC with hypothyroidism, TH17 cells
   demonstrated decreased proliferation and IL-17 production in response to
   Candida species. In contrast, in patients with APECED, TH17 cell
   proliferation and IL-17 production were normal unless exposed to APECED
   plasma, which inhibited both functions in both APECED and normal PBMCs.
   Candida species-stimulated IL-22 production was impaired in all patients
   with CMC, whereas IL-6 and IL-23 responses were unaltered.
   Conclusion: An impaired T(H)17 response to Candida species, although
   mediated by different mechanisms, was present in all CMC subgroups
   studied and might be a common factor predisposing to chronic
   candidiasis. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;126:1006-15.)}},

   English language periodicals included free and purchased publications
   Measures We identified and coded 254 health content containing articles
   from 22 issues of six periodicals (four free Vietnamese, one free

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the current contamination status and
   evaluated several kinetic-related features of organochlorine pesticides
   (OCPs) and PCBs in human breast milk collected from northern Vietnam.
   The variation in the levels of these contaminants was found to be
   strongly associated with total lactation time and dietary habits. OCPs
   exhibited the characteristics of steadily declining compounds: the
   overall levels of DDTs and HCHs in the population decreased with a
   half-time of only 5 years and it can be suggested that OCPs depurated
   relatively fast with breastfeeding (5\% per month). PCBs were slower in
   both regards, with a temporal decrease half-time of 12 years and a
   suggested depuration rate via breastfeeding of 2.5\% per month,
   indicating that the exposure level was still high relative to the human
   body burden. It was found that the PCB exposure levels of infant from
   breastfeeding exceeded the reference dose, and this situation may
   continue for the next two or three decades. Knowledge of these
   kinetic-related characteristics not only is useful for risk assessment
   and prediction of future trends of legacy contaminants but also may
   provide insight regarding similar kinetic processes of emerging
   persistent pollutants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Strong green photoluminescence (PL) was observed for hydrothermal
   synthesized Zn-3(OH)(2)V2O7 center dot nH(2)O nanosheets. The energy
   band structure of the material was theoretically computed using first
   principle method and experimentally obtained by linear extrapolating
   from UV-vis reflection spectrum. It is shown that the material is an
   indirect bandgap semiconductor with a direct bandgap of 3.03 eV at Gamma
   and an indirect gap of 2.8 eV from R to Gamma. UV-vis reflection
   spectrum changes regularly along with doping of cobalt, showing clearly
   reflection peaks of Co2+. The bandgap of Zn-3(OH)(2)V2O7 center dot
   nH(2)O decreases significantly along with doping of cobalt, indicating
   the substitution of Co2+ with Zn2+. The intensity of the PL spectrum of
   Zn-3(OH)(2)V2O7 center dot nH(2)O that annealed in vacuum remains almost
   unchanged, whereas it distinctly decreases with doping of cobalt. The
   results indicate that it is zinc vacancies that cause the green
   emitting, which is in accordance with Zn deficiency that deduced from
   energy dispersion spectroscopy characterization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The complex nature of the structure of the anticoagulant warfarin is
   reflected in the diversity of binding modes observed in warfarin-protein
   recognition systems. A series of theoretical, H-1-NMR and steady state
   and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopic studies, have been used to
   establish correlations between the molecular environment provided by
   various solvent systems and the relative concentrations of the various
   members of warfarin's ensemble of isomers. A consequence of these
   observations is that the judicious choice of solvent system or molecular
   environment of warfarin allows for manipulation of the position of the
   equilibrium between isomeric structures such as the hemiacetal and open
   phenol-keto forms, the latter even possible in a deprotonated form,
   where in each case unique spectroscopic properties are exhibited by the
   respective structures. Collectively, warfarin's capacity to adapt its
   structure as a function of environment in conjunction with the
   fluorescence behaviours of the various isomers together provide an
   environment-dependent molecular switch with reporter properties, which
   allows for the simultaneous detection of warfarin in different states
   with lifetimes spanning the range <0.10-5.5 ns. These characteristics
   are here used to examine warfarin binding domains in a series of
   materials (solvents, protein, inorganic matrix and synthetic polymer).
   Moreover, these studies demonstrate the potential for using warfarin, or
   other switchable analogues thereof, as a tool for studying molecular
   level characteristics, for example local dielectricity. Copyright (C)

   good postoperative recovery. Even though the role of surgical

Abstract = {{Background: Increasing interest has been focused on providing
   psychosocial support and preventive care for the children of adult
   cancer patients. Objective: The primary purpose of this study was to
   describe clinicians' experiences using structured family-centered
   interventions to address the needs of children whose parent has cancer.
   Methods: Using a narrative method, qualitative data were collected from
   interviews with 7 experienced clinicians who had used structured
   family-centered interventions in families with a parent with cancer.
   Results: Narrative analysis revealed 4 primary thematic categories:
   interteam collaboration, focus on the children, death, and perceived
   impact of interventions. Conclusions: It is important to identify the
   needs of children and provide appropriate support to the entire family
   of adult cancer patients. To effectively support a family with divergent
   needs requires good interteam collaboration and networking with local
   services that are available for children. It is important to acknowledge
   and address the needs of children of cancer patients. In so doing,
   parents benefit and are empowered in their parenting role. Families can
   be helped to address their concerns, particularly death issues, through
   effective interteam collaboration. Clinical Implications: Evidence
   gained from the experiences of health professionals in clinical practice
   is important and forms a basis for focusing next on producing
   research-based evidence regarding the effects of interventions. The
   benefits of the interventions we describe must be clearly demonstrated
   by comparison with usual treatment practices before applying them widely
   in clinical practice.}},

   2704-2712, 2010. First published September 1, 2010;
   doi:10.1152/jn.01080.2009. Unexpected support-surface movements
   delivered during stance elicit ``first trial{''} postural reactions,
   which are larger and cause greater instability compared with habituated
   responses. The nature of this first trial reaction remains unknown. We
   hypothesized that first trial postural reactions consist of a
   generalized startle reaction, with a similar muscle synergy as the
   acoustic startle response, combined with an automatic postural reaction.
   Therefore we compared acoustic startle responses to first trial postural
   reactions. Eight healthy subjects stood on a support surface that
   unexpectedly rotated backwards 10 times, followed by 10 startling
   acoustic stimuli, or vice versa. Outcome measures included full body
   kinematics and surface EMG from muscles involved in startle reactions or
   postural control. Postural perturbations and startling acoustic stimuli
   both elicited a clear first trial reaction, as reflected by larger
   kinematic and EMG responses. The ensuing habituation rate to repeated
   identical stimuli was comparable for neck and trunk muscles in both
   conditions. Onset latencies in neck muscles occurred significantly later
   for first trial perturbations compared with startle responses, but
   earlier in trunk muscles. Our results show that platform tilting
   initially induces reactions larger than needed to maintain equilibrium.
   For neck and trunk muscles, these first trial postural reactions
   resembled acoustic startle reflexes. First trial postural reactions may
   be triggered by interaction of afferent volleys formed by somatosensory
   and vestibular inputs. Acoustic startle reactions may also be partially
   triggered by vestibular inputs. Similar muscle activation driven by
   vestibular inputs may be the common element of first trial postural
   responses and acoustic startle reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Crop-raiding by primates is increasingly known to cause conflict between
   humans and primates, and due to their opportunism, adaptability,
   intelligence and manipulative abilities, primates can be significant
   agricultural pests. Levels of crop-raiding are dependent on time of
   year, crop type, size and location of the farm, and primate species
   involved, making it difficult for farmers to predict susceptibility to
   crop-raiding accurately. We use a simple method for calculating the
   likelihood of crop damage by primates using crop susceptibility to
   predict the frequency of crop damage for individual farms. The method
   relies on calculating incidence rates of crop-raiding for individual
   crops using pooled data from all farms in the sample, and summing these
   rates as to reach a farm's risk value (RV) to primate crop-raiding. From
   273 farms in southwestern Sri Lanka data were collected on crop-raiding
   by two species of primate, the arboreal folivorous purple-faced langur
   and the terrestrial frugivorous toque macaque. Data from 93 farms were
   used to calculate crop-raiding incidence rates for seven commonly grown
   crops, and we tested the applicability of the model using the remainder
   of the dataset. Incidence rates of raiding for crops differed for the
   two species of primate, albeit not in a uniform manner. Farms appear to
   be more susceptible to crop-raiding by langurs than by macaques, with
   higher RVs for langurs than for macaques: this is not related to the
   behaviour of the farmer as for both species four-fifth of the farmers
   that experience crop-raiding actively chase primates away. Our model
   using RVs works well for predicting crop-raiding in langurs as
   crop-raided farms have significantly higher RVs. It works less well for
   macaques, which may be related to their terrestriallity allowing them to
   range over larger areas and raid farms opportunistically. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine how to manage children
   with recurrence of intussusception.
   Methods: Medical records of patients treated for intussusception from
   1976 to 2008 at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health
   were reviewed. Information on patients who developed recurrent
   intussusception was extracted to study patterns of recurrent attack and
   suitable management procedures. The statistical differences were
   analyzed by the chi(2) and the Student t test, with a P value < .05
   considered significant.
   Results: During the study period, 1340 patients were treated for 1448
   episodes of intussusceptions, with an average of 40 cases per year.
   There were 108 episodes of recurrent intussusception in 75 patients (45
   males and 30 females). The overall recurrence rate was 8\%. Patient age
   at the first episode ranged from 3 months to 12 years (average, 14.9
   months). The time interval before each recurrence ranged from 1 day to
   3.2 years (average, 7.8 months). The number of recurrences ranged from 1
   to 5 attacks. Recurrent intussusception occurred in 35 (15.8\%) of 222
   children following successful hydrostatic barium enema (BE) reduction
   and in 55 (11.4\%) of 482 after successful pneumatic or air enema (AE)
   reduction. There was no statistical difference between the recurrence
   rates after the 2 nonoperative procedures (P = .08). Recurrent
   intussusception developed in 14 (3.0\%) of 457 patients after operative
   manual reduction. Recurrence was not observed after intestinal resection
   for initial irreducible intussusception in 175 patients. The remaining 4
   recurrent episodes occurred after spontaneous reduction. Of the 108
   episodes of recurrence, BE and AE reductions were successful in 25
   (96.2\%) of 26 attempts and in 57 (92\%) of 62 attempts, respectively.
   Seven patients had their first episode of intussusception treated
   surgically. All 7 when they recurred were successfully treated with
   either BE or AE reduction. Operative intervention was needed in 23
   episodes of recurrent intussusception; 18 were reduced manually, and 5
   required intestinal resection. Overall, 7 (9.3\%) of the 75 recurrences
   had a pathologic lead point: colonic polyps in 4 cases and Meckel
   diverticulum in 3 cases. There were no deaths among the 75 patients with
   recurrent intussusception.
   Conclusions: Recurrent intussusception should be initially treated by
   nonoperative reduction. Laparotomy is needed in cases with failure of BE
   or AE reduction, in cases with suspicion of a pathologic lead point, and
   in selected cases with several episodes of recurrence. The treatment of
   recurrent intussusception, in general, should be similar to that of
   primary intussusception. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water shortages and poor water quality are critical issues in many areas
   of the world. With rapid increases in population and shortage of water
   supplies in urban areas, use of alternative water sources such as
   municipal reclaimed water and other sources of non-potable waters for
   irrigating landscapes is inevitable. A potential concern is the elevated
   salt levels in these alternative waters. This article briefly summarizes
   general information regarding alternative water sources and general
   responses of landscape plants to salinity stress. Methodology of
   screening and evaluating salt tolerance of landscape plants are
   discussed. Recent research results on salt tolerance of landscape plants
   and their physiological responses to salinity stress are reviewed. Like
   agricultural crops, a wide range of salt tolerance among landscape
   plants has been found. In addition to plant species, dominant salt type,
   substrate, irrigation method and management, and environmental
   conditions also affect plant responses to salinity stress. A number of
   mechanisms of salinity tolerance have been observed among landscape
   species, including restriction of ion uptake, selective ion uptake, and
   tolerance to high internal concentrations of sodium and/or chloride.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of neutron stars are investigated by including delta
   meson field in the modified quark-meson coupling model. It is found that
   delta meson has opposite effects on hadronic matter with or without
   hyperons: it softens the EOSs of hadronic matter with hyperons, while it
   stiffens the EOSs of pure nucleonic matter. Moreover, by replacing the
   isovector mesons with the contact scalar-isovector interaction, a
   considerable change of proton fraction is observed. It is shown that the
   contact scalar-isovector interaction provides an approach to satisfy the
   constraint of Direct Urca critical star masses. However, the inclusion
   of delta meson increases the proton fraction, consequently it decreases
   the M(DU) which departs farther from the Direct Urca constraint.
   Furthermore, the inclusion of delta meson field can increase the maximum
   mass of neutron star and enlarge the corresponding radius, while these
   quantities are decreased when the contact scalar-isovector interaction
   is included.}},

Abstract = {{In-hospital and long-term mortality of infective endocarditis (IE) are
   well noted, but the studies for mid-term (90-day) mortality of IE is
   still limited. We determine the mid-term mortality rate of IE and its
   significant predictors. Seventy patients with IE were hospitalised at
   St. Luke's International Hospital between January 1996 and March 2009,
   of whom 62 consecutive patients could be followed up for 90 days after
   diagnosis. We then calculated Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates and performed
   time-to-event analysis. The mean (standard deviation, SD) age was 66.6
   (15.3) years. Thirty-five patients (56\%) were male. Blood cultures were
   positive in 87\%. Causative microorganisms were: viridans group
   streptococci (23\%), beta-streptococci (16\%), Staphylococcus aureus
   (15\%), including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (5\%).
   Thirty-three cases (53\%) had at least one complication such as heart
   failure (34\%), central nervous system (CNS) complication (29\%) or
   emboli peripheral to CNS (6\%). KM estimates (95\% CI) of the 90-day
   mortality was 14.5\% (7.8-25\%). In multiple regression analysis using
   the Cox proportional hazards model, hazard ratios of at least one
   complication for the 90-day mortality was 8.2 (1.4-155). Mid-term
   mortality of IE continues to be high and the presence of at least one
   complication may be considered as an independent risk factor of mid-term
   mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study documented the number of people seeking help for
   mental health problems after a fireworks disaster in Enschede, the
   Netherlands. It describes their diagnostic characteristics,
   interventions provided, and their results. Methods: Researchers coded
   data from intakes and medical charts of all patients who sought help
   (N=1,659) and entered treatment (N=663) at a disaster relief service
   between May 13, 2000 (day of the disaster), and June 1, 2004. Patients
   who received more than eight treatment sessions (N=394) and were in
   treatment one year after the disaster were interviewed with the
   Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (N=228, response
   rate, 58\%) and other questionnaires (N=271, response rate, 69\%).
   Results: In the population probably exposed, the cumulative
   referral-incidence for disaster-related mental health problems over four
   years was approximately 10\%; in terms of referrals to the mental health
   facility over five years, the proportion of disaster-related referrals
   was 5.7\%. Among adults, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the
   most common clinical diagnosis (53\%, chart sample). However, depression
   was the most common CIDI diagnosis (58\%, CIDI interview sample). The
   recovery rate was about 50\% on the basis of clinical judgment (chart
   sample), between 69\% and 76\% on the basis of ``healthy{''} scores on
   symptoms, and between 39\% and 60\% in social and physical functioning
   (interview sample). Conclusions: Apart from persons seeking support
   during the first weeks postdisaster, the largest influx occurred after
   about one year and was limited in size. Clinicians in specialized
   services should be aware that conditions other than PTSD, such as
   depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and somatoform disorders, are also
   quite common after disasters. (Psychiatric Services 61:1138-1143, 2010)}},

Title = {{Impact of Vertical Hydraulic Gradient on Rill Erodibility and Critical

Journal = {{SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{74}},

Pages = {{1914-1921}},

Abstract = {{Field observations and subsequent support from controlled lab
   experiments have shown the linkage between vertical hydraulic gradients
   and initiation of rills or incised channels. Nevertheless, current
   erosion prediction models do not include the hydraulic gradient effect
   in the erodibility parameters. The objectives of this study were to: (i)
   quantify the impact of a subsurface hydraulic gradient on rill
   erodibility and critical shear stress; and (ii) determine the intrinsic
   critical shear stress of the soil, which is the critical shear stress of
   the soil without the influence of the vertical hydraulic gradient. Two
   series of concentrated flow experiments were conducted on a silt loam
   soil subjected to hydraulic gradients varying from -2 to 2 m m(-1). The
   first series measured soil loss at a given shear stress, while the
   second was a direct measurement of the critical shear stress by
   calculating the shear stress at the point of incipient motion of
   particles. The intrinsic critical shear stress was determined using a
   fluidized bed approach. We found that the average erodibility under an
   upward or positive hydraulic gradient was 5.64 times larger than that
   under a downward hydraulic gradient. The critical shear stress decreased
   from 1.0 to 0.2 Pa as the hydraulic gradient was increased from -2 to 2
   m m(-1). Using the fluidized bed approach, we obtained an inherent
   critical shear stress value of 1.61 Pa. We concluded that the presence
   of positive pore pressure near the soil surface was a major factor in
   reducing soil cohesion. We also concluded that with some improvements,
   the fluidized bed concept can be applied to determine the critical shear
   stress independent of the hydraulic gradient effect.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We assessed the effectiveness of the penalty points system
   (PPS) introduced in Spain in July 2006 in reducing traffic injuries.
   Methods. We performed an evaluation study with an interrupted
   time-series design. We stratified dependent variables-numbers of drivers
   involved in injury collisions and people injured in traffic collisions
   in Spain from 2000 to 2007 (police data)-by age, injury severity, type
   of road user, road type, and time of collision, and analyzed variables
   separately by gender. The explanatory variable (the PPS) compared the
   postintervention period (July 2006 to December 2007) with the
   preintervention period (January 2000 to June 2006). We used
   quasi-Poisson regression, controlling for time trend and seasonality.
   Results. Among men, we observed a significant risk reduction in the
   postintervention period for seriously injured drivers (relative risk
   {[}RR]=0.89) and seriously injured people (RR=0.89). The RRs among women
   were 0.91 (P=.095) and 0.88 (P<.05), respectively. Risk reduction was
   greater among male drivers, moped riders, and on urban roads.
   Conclusions. The PPS was associated with reduced numbers of drivers
   involved in injury collisions and people injured by traffic collisions

Abstract = {{Hafnium nitride (HfN) was chosen as a material for non porous
   intermediate layer to improve the high temperature stability of Pd-Ta
   composite membranes for hydrogen separation A layer of dense HfN (70 nm)
   was prepared between Ta substrate and thin Pd film (300 nm) and the high
   temperature stability of Pd coating was examined by hydrogen absorption
   experiments at 573 K after the heat treatments at 873 and 973 K The HfN
   layer showed obvious hydrogen permeability, though the permeation rate
   in HfN appeared to be smaller than that in Pd and Ta In addition the
   degradation in coating effects of Pd at elevated temperatures was
   substantially retarded by HfN layer Such improved stability was ascribed
   to retardation of open porosity development in Pd films and
   interdiffusion between Pd and Ta It was concluded that HfN is a

Abstract = {{Human resistin is expressed strongly in monocytes or macrophages rather
   than in adipocytes and may play a pivotal role in inflammation. We
   hypothesize that resistin levels are elevated in patients with Kawasaki
   disease (KD) in the acute phase and may be associated with the disease
   severity.
   Serum resistin concentrations were measured in 44 Japanese children with
   KD and 17 age-matched healthy children. All the KD patients were given
   both aspirin and a single dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
   The serum resistin levels at baseline in KD children were significantly
   higher than those in controls {[}33.0 (21.6-45.3) vs. 14.8 (12.4-18.6)
   ng/mL, P < 0.001]. After IVIG therapy, serum resistin levels were
   significantly decreased to normal control levels. No significant
   difference in baseline resistin levels was found between the high-risk
   group and the low-risk group of coronary artery aneurysms.
   We confirmed that resistin was an acute inflammatory protein, but its
   concentrations were unlikely to predict the prognosis of disease in
   acute KD patients.}},

   Gravitation (ASTG). This theory is built on Laplace-Poisson's well known
   equation and it has been shown that the ASTG is capable of explaining,
   from a purely classical physics standpoint, the precession of the
   perihelion of solar planets as a consequence of the azimuthal symmetry
   emerging from the spin of the Sun. This symmetry has and must have an
   influence on the emergent gravitational field. We show herein that the
   emergent equations from the ASTG, under some critical conditions
   determined by the spin, do possess repulsive gravitational fields in the
   polar regions of the gravitating body in question. This places the ASTG
   on an interesting pedestal to infer the origins of outflows as a
   repulsive gravitational phenomenon. Outflows are a ubiquitous phenomenon
   found in star forming systems and their true origin is a question yet to
   be settled. Given the current thinking on their origin, the direction
   that the present paper takes is nothing short of an asymptotic break
   from conventional wisdom; at the very least, it is a complete paradigm
   shift because gravitation is not at all associated with this process,
   but rather it is thought to be an all-attractive force that only tries
   to squash matter together onto a single point. Additionally, we show
   that the emergent Azimuthally Symmetric Gravitational Field from the
   ASTG strongly suggests a solution to the supposed Radiation Problem that
   is thought to be faced by massive stars in their process of formation.
   That is, at similar to 8-10 M-circle dot, radiation from the nascent
   star is expected to halt the accretion of matter. We show that
   in-falling material will fall onto the equatorial disk and from there,
   this material will be channeled onto the forming star via the equatorial
   plane, thus accretion of mass continues well past the value of similar
   to 8-10 M-circle dot, albeit via the disk. Along the equatorial plane,
   the net force (with the radiation force included) on any material
   there-on right up to the surface of the star is directed toward the
   forming star, hence accretion of mass by the nascent star is
   un-hampered.}},

Abstract = {{Low temperature injury can be significantly reduced by pre-treatment at
   sub-lethal low temperatures of only a few hours - a phenomenon termed
   `rapid cold-hardening' (RCH). However, most studies to date have focused
   extensively on only a few key insect taxa, e.g. Drosophila melanogaster
   within the Drosophilidae family. Further studies on other
   closely-related species are required to better understand evolutionary
   and ecological variation in the magnitude of the RCH response in
   terrestrial arthropods. Here, we investigated RCH in a previously
   unstudied fruit fly, Zaprionus vittiger, following a range of high and
   low pretreatment temperatures. There was a significant improvement in Z.
   vittiger survival of lethal temperatures (2 h at -3 degrees C) following
   a 2 h pretreatment at 4, 7 and 10 degrees C as well as 30 degrees C for
   2 h. Maximum survival (60-70\%) during RCH was achieved following
   hardening at 7 degrees C and 10 degrees C but is lower than some
   Drosophila species under similar treatment conditions. Therefore, since
   RCH was detected in a confamilial species, we propose that RCH might be
   a widely conserved response to temperature variation in the family
   Drosophilidae, although some variation in the magnitude of the response
   can be detected.}},

Title = {{Community Health Worker Intervention to Decrease Cervical Cancer
   Disparities in Hispanic Women}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: U.S. Hispanic women suffer a disproportionate burden of
   cervical cancer, with incidence and mortality rates almost twice that of
   whites. Community health workers, or promotoras, are considered a
   potential strategy for eliminating such racial and ethnic health
   disparities. The current study is a randomized trial of a promotora-led
   educational intervention focused on cervical cancer in a local Hispanic
   community.
   METHODS: Four promotoras led a series of two workshops with community
   members covering content related to cervical cancer. Sociodemographic
   characteristics, cervical cancer risk, previous screening history,
   cervical cancer knowledge, and self-efficacy were measured by a
   pre-intervention questionnaire. The post-intervention questionnaire
   measured the following outcomes: cervical cancer knowledge (on a 0-6
   scale), self-efficacy (on a 0-5 scale). and receipt of Pap smear
   screening during the previous 6 months (dichotomous). Univariate
   analyses were performed using chi square, t-test, and the Mann-Whitney
   test. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association
   between explanatory variables and receipt of Pap smear screening.
   RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the
   two experimental groups at baseline. Follow-up data revealed significant
   improvements in all outcome measures: Pap smear screening (65\% vs.
   36\%, p-value 0.02), cervical cancer knowledge (5.4 vs. 3.5,
   p-value<0.001), and self-efficacy (4.7 vs. 4.0, p-value 0.002). In
   multivariate analysis, cervical cancer knowledge (OR 1.68, 95\% CI
   1.10-2.81) and intervention group assignment (OR 6.74, 95\% CI
   1.77-25.66) were associated with receiving a Pap smear during the
   follow-up period.
   DISCUSSION: Our randomized trial of a promotora-led educational
   intervention demonstrated improved Pap screening rates, in addition to
   increased knowledge about cervical cancer and self-efficacy. The
   observed association between cervical cancer knowledge and Pap smear
   receipt underscores the importance of educating vulnerable populations
   about the diseases that disproportionately affect them. Future research
   should evaluate such programs on a larger scale, and identify novel
   targets for intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Aim As part of a large study of nursing turnover in Canadian hospitals,
   the present study focuses on the impact and key determinants of nurse
   turnover and implications for management strategies in nursing units.
   Background Nursing turnover is an issue of ever-increasing priority as
   work-related stress and job dissatisfaction are influencing nurses'
   intention to leave their positions.
   Methods Data sources included the nurse survey, unit managers, medical
   records and human resources databases. A broad sample of hospitals was
   represented with nine different types of nursing units included.
   Results Nurses turnover is a major problem in Canadian hospitals with a
   mean turnover rate of 19.9\%. Higher levels of role ambiguity and role
   conflict were associated with higher turnover rates. Increased role
   conflict and higher turnover rates were associated with deteriorated
   mental health. Higher turnover rates were associated with lower job
   satisfaction. Higher turnover rate and higher level of role ambiguity
   were associated with an increased likelihood of medical error.
   Conclusion Managing turnover within nursing units is critical to
   high-quality patient care. A supportive practice setting in which role
   responsibilities are understood by all members of the caregiver team
   would promote nurse retention.
   Implications for nursing management Stable nurse staffing and adequate
   managerial support are essential to promote job satisfaction and
   high-quality patient care.}},

Abstract = {{Decentralized or onsite wastewater treatment (OWT) systems have long
   been implicated in being a major source of N inputs to surface and
   ground waters and numerous regulatory bodies have promulgated strict
   total N (TN) effluent standards in N-sensitive areas. These standards,
   however, most of which have effluent limitations of <10 mg/L TN. were
   generally developed without data on treatment performance and attainable
   compliance levels of operating OWTs designed to remove N. This paper
   reviews OWT technologies that rely on preanoxic or postanoxic
   denitrification, or simultaneous nitrification-denitrification, and
   frequently include compact, mechanized components. TN effluent data from
   20 OWTs in 3 long-term N removal demonstration projects in Florida,
   Oregon, and New Zealand are analyzed and compared with the performance
   of 15 centralized N removal treatment plants from the US and Canada. A
   reliability and stability analysis shows that only one of the 20 OWTs
   approaches the reliability and stability of centralized plants, and can
   comply with a <10 mg/L TN effluent standard with a 99\% probability; all
   of the remaining 19 OWTs have a <50\% probability of compliance. The
   lower reliability of OWTs, many of which are energy-intensive,
   scaled-down models of centralized plants, is due to the inherent
   variability of decentralized wastewater characteristics and the
   challenges of operationally controlling N removal processes at the level
   of residences. However, the small footprint (required land area) of
   these compact designs offers important opportunities for retrofitting
   OWTs on small lots, in shoreline developments where land is at a premium
   and where communities wish to foster and sustain compact, village
   developments that reflect ``smart growth{''} strategies. Other
   approaches to decentralized N management emphasizing passive, robust,
   ecologically engineered designs are reviewed and include natural
   wastewater treatment systems such as single pass sand filters with
   denitrifying bioreactors, which performed better than any other OWT
   technology; shallow trenches and drip irrigation for denitrification or
   plant N uptake in the carbon-rich root zone: denitrification beds/layers
   installed down gradient from effluent plumes; and the consideration of
   watershed N sinks in estimating the risks of N loading to receiving
   waters. These alternative approaches require further research and
   development, but can offer alternatives or additional treatment to
   mechanized OWTs. More comparative studies of long-term operation of OWTs
   under field conditions in other parts of the world are needed to further
   quantify performance capabilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Triticale grain could be a useful material for bioethanol
   production. The aim of this study was to examine how grain cultivar,
   nitrogen fertilisation level, location and year affect the starch
   content in triticale grain and which method of starch determination,
   polarimetric, enzymatic or near-infrared transmission (NIT), gives the
   best prediction of real bioethanol productivity from triticale grain.
   RESULTS: It was found that the starch content in triticale grain was
   correlated positively with test weight and 1000-kernel weight but
   negatively with falling number and protein content. All factors, i.e.
   cultivar, nitrogen fertilisation level, location and year, as well as
   the intrinsic interaction between these factors, had a significant
   effect on the starch level in triticale grain. The NIT procedure of
   starch determination gave the best results in predicting the real yield
   of ethanol obtained on the basis of classic fermentation (95\% match),
   while the enzymatic and polarimetric methods corresponded with the real
   results at levels of 89-90 and 78-82\% respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Grain growth conditions related to location and nitrogen
   fertilisation level had the most noticeable effect on grain starch
   content, while grain yield per hectare had the most significant effect
   on ethanol productivity. (c) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Under applied strain, the damage behavior of bent
   (Bi,Pb)(2)Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+delta (Bi2223) composite tape is different from
   specimen to specimen. Accordingly, the irreversible bending strain and
   critical current differ among specimens. The present work attempted to
   reveal the irreversible bending strain distribution and the critical
   current distribution in low bending strain region. For analysis, a
   damage model, in which the shape of the core where the current
   transporting Bi2223 filaments are bundled into Ag, and the damage strain
   parameter given by the difference between the intrinsic tensile damage
   strain and residual strain of the Bi2223 filaments, were incorporated to
   describe the damage evolution in the core and its relation to critical
   current, was employed. The model was applied to the experimental results
   measured at limited bending strains. With the present approach in
   combination with a statistical analysis, the irreversible bending strain
   distribution and the variation of the critical current distribution with
   bending strain in low bending strain range were revealed successfully.

Abstract = {{Multiple factors over the lifetime of an individual, including diet,
   geography, and physiologic state, will influence the microbial
   communities within the primate gut. To determine the source of variation
   in the composition of the microbiota within and among species, we
   investigated the distal gut microbial communities harbored by great
   apes, as present in fecal samples recovered within their native ranges.
   We found that the branching order of host-species phylogenies based on
   the composition of these microbial communities is completely congruent
   with the known relationships of the hosts. Although the gut is initially
   and continuously seeded by bacteria that are acquired from external
   sources, we establish that over evolutionary timescales, the composition
   of the gut microbiota among great ape species is phylogenetically
   conserved and has diverged in a manner consistent with vertical
   inheritance.}},

Abstract = {{A series of dansyl-labeled glycosides with di-, tetra-, and
   hexasaccharides carrying the terminal N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc)
   sequence were synthesized as acceptor substrates for alpha 2,6- and
   alpha 2,3-sialyltransferases. As an alternative design, dansyl-labeled
   LacNAc glycoside carrying a long-spacer linked glycan was engineered by
   replacement of the LacNAc or lactose units with an alkyl chain. In
   addition, we designed a dansyl-labeled bi-antennary LacNAc glycoside as
   an N-linked oligosaccharide mimetic, such as asialo-alpha(1)-acid
   glycoprotein. The kinetic parameters for the transfer reaction of
   synthesized dansyl-labeled glycosides by sialyltransferases were
   determined by the fluorescent HPLC method. The catalytic efficiencies
   (V-max/K-m) of acceptor substrates carrying the terminal LacNAc sequence
   with various length glycans in the array for alpha 2,6- and alpha
   2,3-sialyltransferases decreased in a glycan length-dependent manner.
   Furthermore, of the acceptor substrates tested, dansyl-labeled
   bi-antennary LacNAt glycoside displayed the most favorable K-m value for
   alpha 2,6- and alpha 2,3-sialyltransferases.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effects of comparatively high doses of
   diminazene aceturate on the reproductive performance of female rats in
   the early stage of pregnancy. Methods: After oestrus synchronisation and
   successful mating, 20 pregnant female rats were randomly divided. into
   four groups (A-D). Group A rats served as the control and were given
   single intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mL sterile water (vehicle only)
   while groups B, C and D rats were given single intraperitoneal doses of
   7, 14 and 21 mg/kg body weight diminazene aceturate respectively, on day
   7 of pregnancy. The gestation length, litter size and weight at birth,
   and areas of foetal resorption in the uterus were determined post
   partum. The post-implantation survival index (\%) and the gestation
   index (group \%) were also evaluated for rats in all the groups.
   Results: There was a graded increase in the number of observed resorbed
   foetuses as the dose of diminazene aceturate was increased, although
   only groups C (14 mg/kg) and D (21 mg/kg) revealed a. significant
   decrease (P<0.01, ANOVA) in the post implantation survival index of rat
   embryos. There was also a significant decrease (P<0.05) in the litter
   weights of rats in groups C and D. Conclusions: Although the pregnant
   rats showed no overt signs of systemic toxicity even at the highest dose
   of 21 mg/kg body weight diminazene aceturate in this study, it was
   concluded that the use of high doses of diminazene aceturate in an
   effort to combat resistant trypanosomes could have adverse reproductive
   effects on female animals in the early period of pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{The ATLAS BPTX stations are composed of electrostatic button pick-up
   detectors, located 175 m away along the beam pipe on both sides of
   ATLAS. The pick-ups are installed as a part of the LHC beam
   instrumentation and used by ATLAS for timing purposes.
   The usage of the BPTX signals in ATLAS is twofold: they are used both in
   the trigger system and for LHC beam monitoring. The BPTX signals are
   discriminated with a constant-fraction discriminator to provide a
   Level-1 trigger when a bunch passes through ATLAS. Furthermore, the BPTX
   detectors are used by a stand-alone monitoring system for the LHC
   bunches and timing signals. The BPTX monitoring system measures the
   phase between collisions and clock with a precision better than 100 Ps
   in order to guarantee a stable phase relationship for optimal signal
   sampling in the sub-detector front-end electronics. In addition to
   monitoring this phase, the properties of the individual bunches are
   measured and the structure of the beams is determined.
   On September 10, 2008, the first LHC beams reached the ATLAS experiment.
   During this period with beam, the ATLAS BPTX system was used extensively
   to time in the read-out of the sub-detectors. In this paper, we present
   the performance of the BPTX system and its measurements of the first LHC
   beams. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conclusion: Our results confirmed that OK-432 therapy is simple, easy,
   safe, and effective and can be used as a substitute for surgery in the
   treatment of benign neck cysts. In OK-432 therapy, inflammatory
   cytokines may play important roles in shrinkage of the cystic spaces.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome and
   mechanism of action of OK-432 therapy in benign neck cysts. Methods: We
   tried OK-432 therapy in 83 patients with benign neck cysts between April
   1997 and August 2009. We aspirated as much of the fluid content of each
   cystic lesion as possible, and then replaced the volume of aspirated
   fluid with about half the volume of OK-432 solution. We evaluated the
   mechanism of action of OK-432 in 43 of the patients. The intracystic
   fluid in the cysts was aspirated before and after OK-432 therapy, and
   cytokine production in each aspirate was analyzed by ELISA. Results:
   Disappearance of the lesion was observed in 63 of 83 patients (76\%).
   Marked reduction was observed in 13 of the 83 patients (16\%). Partial
   reduction was observed in two patients (2\%) and no response was seen in
   five (6\%). Local discomfort at the injection site and low-grade fever
   were side effects observed in half of the patients, but such problems
   resolved within a few days. No local scarring or deformity of the
   injected sites occurred in any patient. We performed OK-432 therapy on
   an outpatient basis without hospitalization. Levels of various
   cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-8,
   interleukin-6, interferon gamma, and vascular endothelial growth factor,
   were significantly elevated in each aspirate after OK-42 therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic responses such as acceleration, velocity and displacement of
   geo-materials during fracturing and slippage have not been studied in
   the fields of geo-engineering and geo-science, as measurement,
   monitoring and logging technologies were not so advanced in the past. By
   virtue of the recent advances in these technologies, the authors have
   been carrying out experiments on geo-materials ranging from very soft
   materials such as clay to hard rocks such as siliceous sandstone by
   using different loading schemes and loading frames, as well as rock
   discontinuities with different surface roughness characteristics. This
   study describes the experiments and experimental results of the
   acceleration, velocity and displacement responses of geo-materials
   during fracturing and slippage under laboratory conditions. The velocity
   and displacement responses are obtained through the erratic pattern
   screening integration technique proposed by the authors. We further
   discuss their implications in geo-engineering and earthquake engineering
   in relation to permanent surface deformations.}},

Abstract = {{Aurora kinases play a pivotal role in the regulator of mitotic processes
   during cell division and Aurora kinases are overexpressed in a number of
   human cancers. In this study, we examined the intracellular signaling of
   Aurora kinases inhibitor, MK-0457 (VX680), in BCR-ABL positive cell
   lines and in primary samples. MK-0457 induced apoptosis. Caspase 3 and
   poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were activated and heat shock
   proteins were reduced. A combination of MK-0457 and histone deacetylase
   inhibitor, vorinostat, increased apoptosis. Caspase 3 and PARP were
   activated and phosphorylation of BCR-ABL, Lyn, and Crk-L were reduced.
   BCR-ABL and Aurora A and B were reduced after vorinostat treatment.
   Moreover, combination of vorinostat and MK-0457 synergistically
   increased the extent of apoptosis in primary acute lymphoblastic
   leukemia cells with T315I mutation. Our study increases insight into how

Abstract = {{Background and objective: A genetically diabetic mouse strain (db/db)
   exhibits severe obesity and a syndrome resembling human
   non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Our histological study of
   submandibular glands revealed that the size and area of the granular
   convoluted tubules was substantially decreased in db/db mice. We
   hypothesized that this structural difference reflected a specific
   alteration in salivary duct function.
   Methods: The saliva evoked by pilocarpine was used for the measurement
   of ion concentrations, and submandibular glands were dissected out for
   the immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR study.
   Results: The K(+) concentration of the salivary secretion was higher in
   db/db than in control m+/m+ mice, while neither saliva volume nor the
   concentrations of Na(+) or Cl(-) differed between these strains. In
   db/db mice (vs. m+/m+ mice): quantitative PCR analysis revealed an
   increased mRNA expression of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+)
   (maxi-K) channels, immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in the
   luminal surface expression of the maxi-K channel protein, and a
   particularly interesting finding was that there was a substantial
   increase in the salivary tissue-specific splice variant ParSlo.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that in db/db mice, the K(+) content
   of saliva may be elevated due to an expression of a maxi-K channel
   variant, which results from a modification of ductal structure. General
   significance: Our data may shed some light on the mechanism responsible
   for determining the dynamics of salivary K(+) concentration increased in
   diabetic patients. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   manufacture technical cast profile models based on the example of gear
   wheels in silicone molds produced with the vacuum casting (VC) method.
   In this process, designing of the model manufacturing begins with the
   preparation of the silicone mold structure. At this stage the properties
   of the material to be cast into the silicone mold should be taken into
   account. The properties, including the viscosity, density, reactivity
   and crosslinking thermal effect of the material should be build into
   designing of the prototype. They determine also the geometry of the
   runner system supplying mold cavity and its vents.}},

   experimented with different generation technologies in order to achieve
   distribution of microwave and millimeter-wave signals operating at
   different bands, ranging from a few gigahertz up to 60 GHz. We will show
   how these technologies, in combination with novel devices, can be used
   to enable networks in which dynamic channel allocation and peer-to-peer
   are carried entirely in the optical domain. Furthermore, since wireless
   and wired services fall within the domain of optical-access networks, we
   will demonstrate the performance of basic functionalities, such as

Abstract = {{Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a central force in microbial evolution.
   The observation that genes encoding subunits of complexes exhibit
   relatively compatible phylogenies, suggesting vertical descent, can be
   explained by different evolutionary scenarios. On the one hand, the
   failure of a new gene product to correctly interact with preexisting
   protein subunits can make its acquisition neutral-a theory termed the
   ``complexity hypothesis.{''} On the other hand, foreign subunit-encoding
   genes may reduce the fitness of the new host by disrupting the
   stoichiometric balance between complex subunits, resulting in purifying
   selection against gene retention. We previously showed in a model LGT
   system that overexpression of an orthologous subunit was neutral due to
   lack of interaction with host subunits. Here, we examine a case where
   the foreign protein is more similar to its native orthologs, by
   expressing the RNA polymerase beta subunit (RpoB) of Bacillus subtilis
   in Escherichia coli. The foreign subunit is shown by
   coimmunoprecipitation to interact with the host subunits, and to form
   novel, nonspecific interactions. Nevertheless, the host did not incur
   any fitness disadvantage, as measured by its growth. We conclude that
   LGT of complex subunits may be neutral even when the transferred subunit
   can integrate into the host complex and that this neutrality can be a
   fertile ground for selective forces once the environment changes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The emergence of Clostridium difficile as a major nosocomial
   pathogen points to the need for safe, effective, and fast-acting
   environmental sporicides for infection prevention and control. Available
   and fast-acting sporicides are generally corrosive and unsafe for both
   humans and the environment.
   Methods: We evaluated chlorine bleach (500 and 5000 ppm) and a gel
   containing 4.5\% of accelerated hydrogen peroxide against the spores of
   C difficile and its surrogates Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium
   sporogenes with contact times of 1, 5, and 10 minutes at 20 degrees C
   +/- 2 degrees C using a quantitative carrier test (QCT-2), which is a
   standard (ASTME2197) of American Society for Testing and Materials
   International.
   Results: The gel and the higher level of bleach inactivated >= 6-log(10)
   of viable spores of all 3 types in 10 minutes but were unable to do so
   after 1 and 5 minutes. The lower level of bleach showed virtually no
   activity even after 10 minutes. The gel could keep the treated surface
   wet for the entire 10 minutes, whereas the bleach became visibly dry in
   approximately 4 minutes and needed reapplication.
   Conclusion: The gel, with no off-gassing and designed especially for use
   on toilet bowls to allow for the required dwell time on vertical
   surfaces with one application, is a potential alternative to high levels
   of bleach.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sealing
   ability of 2 different resin-based endodontic filling systems after
   smear layer removal with 2 different techniques.
   Study design. Extracted human single-rooted teeth (n = 74) were
   instrumented using HERO Shaper rotary instruments and irrigated with 1
   mL of 2.5\% NaOCl between each instrument. Additionally, the canals
   received either an extra 3-minute rinse with 2 mL of 17\% EDTA or a
   40-second Er,Cr:YSGG laser treatment. The root canals were filled with
   either Hybrid Root Seal/Resilon combination or AH Plus/gutta-percha
   combination using lateral condensation technique (n + 11). Apical
   leakage quantity was measured with the computerized fluid filtration
   meter at 1 and 4 weeks. One root from each group, which was not
   submitted to the fluid filtration test, was selected for scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
   using 3-way ANOVA and the post hoc Tukey HSD test (alpha = 0.05).
   Results. A significant decrease was observed in the microleakage values
   of all the experimental groups tested with time (P < .0001). EDTA + AH
   Plus/gutta-percha combination exhibited the least microleakage, whereas
   laser irradiation + Hybrid Root Seal/Resilon combination showed the
   greatest microleakage at each of the 2 time periods. Each experimental
   combination exhibited architecture in SEM that seemed to correlate with
   its sealing performance.
   Conclusion. Er, Cr: YSGG laser treatment does not enhance the sealing
   ability of the sealers compared with EDTA application. The root canal
   adaptation and sealing ability of the Hybrid Root Seal/Resilon
   combination is not superior to that of the AH Plus/gutta-percha

Abstract = {{The large variation in the relationships between environmental factors
   and plant traits observed in natural communities exemplifies the
   alternative solutions that plants have developed in response to the same
   environmental limitations. Qualitative attributes, such as growth form,
   woodiness, and leaf habit can be used to approximate these alternative
   solutions. Here, we quantified the extent to which these attributes
   affect leaf trait values at a given resource supply level, using
   measured plant traits from 105 different species (254 observations)
   distributed across 50 sites in mesic to wet plant communities in The
   Netherlands. For each site, soil total N, soil total P, and water supply
   estimates were obtained by field measurements and modeling. Effects of
   growth forms, woodiness, and leaf habit on relations between leaf traits
   (SLA, specific leaf area; LNC, leaf nitrogen concentration; and LPC,
   leaf phosphorus concentration) vs. nutrient and water supply were
   quantified using maximum-likelihood methods and Bonferroni post hoc
   tests. The qualitative attributes explained 8-23\% of the variance
   within sites in leaf traits vs. soil fertility relationships, and
   therefore they can potentially be used to make better predictions of
   global patterns of leaf traits in relation to nutrient supply. However,
   at a given soil fertility, the strength of the effect of each
   qualitative attribute was not the same for all leaf traits. These
   differences may imply a differential regulation of the leaf economy
   traits at a given nutrient supply, in which SLA and LPC seem to be
   regulated in accordance to changes in plant size and architecture while
   LNC seems to be primarily regulated at the leaf level by factors related
   to leaf longevity.}},

Abstract = {{When a patient performs a clinically normal hop test based on distance,
   it cannot be assumed that the biomechanics are similar between limbs.
   The objective was to compare takeoff and landing biomechanics between
   legs in patients who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction. Kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded as
   13 patients performed the single-leg hop on each leg. Distance hopped,
   joint range of motion, peak joint kinetics and the peak total extensor
   moment were compared between legs during both takeoff and landing.
   Average hop distance ratio (involved/noninvolved) was 93 +/- A 4\%.
   Compared to the noninvolved side, knee motion during takeoff on the
   involved side was significantly reduced (P = 0.008). Peak moments and
   powers on the involved side were lower at the knee and higher at the
   ankle and hip compared with the noninvolved side (Side by Joint P =
   0.011; P = 0.003, respectively). The peak total extensor moment was not
   different between legs (P = 0.305) despite a decrease in knee moment and
   increases in ankle and hip moments (Side by Joint P = 0.015). During
   landing, knee motion was reduced (P = 0.043), and peak power absorbed
   was decreased at the knee and hip and increased at the ankle on the
   involved side compared to the noninvolved side (P = 0.003). The
   compensations by other joints may indicate protective adaptations to
   avoid overloading the reconstructed knee.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Viral infection at the ocular surface can lead to the chronic
   condition of viral stromal keratitis. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid
   {[}poly(I:C)], an analog of viral double-stranded RNA, induces the
   expression of adhesion molecules in cultured corneal fibroblasts. The
   authors investigated the roles of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and
   phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathways in the
   poly(I:C)-induced expression of adhesion molecules in corneal
   fibroblasts.
   METHODS. Human corneal fibroblasts were cultured with poly(I:C) in the
   absence or presence of I kappa B kinase 2 (IKK2) inhibitor (an inhibitor
   of NF-kappa B activation) or the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. The expression
   of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, intercellular adhesion
   molecule (ICAM)-1, ICAM-2, and E-selectin, as well as the
   phosphorylation of the NF-kappa B inhibitory protein I kappa B-alpha and
   Akt, were examined by immunoblot analysis. The subcellular localization
   of adhesion molecules was determined by immunofluorescence analysis.
   RESULTS. Poly(I:C) increased the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 but not
   that of ICAM-2 or E-selectin in corneal fibroblasts. Poly(I: C) also
   induced the phosphorylation of I kappa B-alpha and Akt. The
   poly(I:C)-induced expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 was attenuated by both
   IKK2 inhibitor and LY294002.
   CONCLUSIONS. The NF-kappa B and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways mediate the
   poly(I:C)-induced upregulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in corneal
   fibroblasts, with PI3K acting upstream of NF-kappa B activation. These
   pathways thus likely modulate local immune and inflammatory responses to
   viral infection in the corneal stroma. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.

Abstract = {{An increasing number of educational institutions and organizations

   in teacher competence. Research literature, however, showed that few
   studies have been conducted that followed teachers in their respective

   by this lack of empirical proof, this study was conducted to assess the
   modifications on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) - an accepted
   construct in educational lexicon of nine non-major science teachers who
   were given a month-long, fully online training. Using a multi-method
   assessment procedure (e.g., achievement testing, concept mapping, lesson
   planning, and demonstration teaching), results disclose substantial
   alteration in two knowledge-based PCK components in science teaching
   knowledge about science curriculum and students' understanding of
   science. A significant increase in achievement scores, better concept
   map structure and corrected misconceptions were observed after the
   training. Contrastingly, only little improvement was noted in the other
   two skill-based components knowledge about instructional strategies and
   assessment in science. Few changes were noticed in teachers'
   topic-specific strategies and science learning assessment skills. Based
   on these findings, it appeared that fully online teacher trainings were
   insufficient in enhancing all facets of the complex nature of science
   teaching.}},

Abstract = {{Direct injection of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into the
   circulation has shown therapeutic benefit in both experimental models
   and clinical studies of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Using the
   monocrotaline (MCT)-induced rat model of PAH, we investigated the role
   of innate immunity in the therapeutic activity of two types of putative
   EPCs derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells: an early
   population of endothelial-like, culture-modified monocytes (E-CMMs) and
   late-outgrowth EPCs (L-EPCs), which exhibit a strong endothelial
   phenotype. In the athymic nude rat, E-CMMs prevented MCT-induced
   increases in right ventricular systolic pressure (P < 0.001) and right
   ventricular hypertrophy (P < 0.01) when administered 3 days after MCT
   challenge, whereas L-EPCs were ineffective. However, in both cases,
   there was a lack of cell persistence within the lungs at 24 hours after
   injection, likely due to residual natural killer (NK) cell activity in
   the model. Although ablation of NK and NK-T cells with anti-asialo-GM-1
   antiserum enhanced the retention of both E-CMMs and L-EPCs, still no
   benefit was seen with L-EPCs, and the efficacy of E-CMMs was lost. In
   vitro characterization revealed that E-CMMs resemble a regulatory
   subtype of dendritic cells, producing IL-10, but not IL-12, in response
   to inflammatory stimuli. Coculture studies demonstrated the capacity of
   E-EPCs to stimulate autologous human and nude rat NK cells in vitro.
   These data support a novel mode of action for human E-CMMs in the
   prevention of PAH, whereby they act through an immune-dependent
   mechanism, potentially involving the stimulation of NK cells.}},

Abstract = {{The disruption of the circadian system in humans has been associated
   with the development of chronic illnesses and the worsening of
   pre-existing pathologies. Therefore, the assessment of human circadian
   system function under free living conditions using non-invasive
   techniques needs further research. Traditionally, overt rhythms such as
   activity and body temperature have been analyzed separately; however, a
   comprehensive index could reduce individual recording artifacts. Thus, a
   new variable (TAP), based on the integrated analysis of three
   simultaneous recordings: skin wrist temperature (T), motor activity (A)
   and body position (P) has been developed. Furthermore, we also tested
   the reliability of a single numerical index, the Circadian Function
   Index (CFI), to determine the circadian robustness. An actimeter and a
   temperature sensor were placed on the arm and wrist of the non-dominant
   hand, respectively, of 49 healthy young volunteers for a period of one
   week. T, A and P values were normalized for each subject. A
   non-parametric analysis was applied to both TAP and the separate
   variables to calculate their interdaily stability, intradaily
   variability and relative amplitude, and these values were then used for
   the CFI calculation. Modeling analyses were performed in order to
   determine TAP and CFI reliability. Each variable (T, A, P or TAP) was
   independently correlated with rest-activity logs kept by the volunteers.
   The highest correlation (r = -0.993, p<0.0001), along with highest
   specificity (0.870), sensitivity (0.740) and accuracy (0.904), were
   obtained when rest-activity records were compared to TAP. Furthermore,
   the CFI proved to be very sensitive to changes in circadian robustness.
   Our results demonstrate that the integrated TAP variable and the CFI
   calculation are powerful methods to assess circadian system status,
   improving sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in differentiating
   activity from rest over the analysis of wrist temperature, body position
   or activity alone.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To explore the incidence and visual outcomes of acute-onset
   endophthalmitis after transconjunctival microincision vitrectomy surgery
   (MIVS).
   DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional, multicenter survey with a
   systematic review.
   METHODS: A clinical database search was performed at 27 institutions
   involving 43 868 consecutive patients who underwent vitrectomy between
   November 2003 and October 2008 to identify all patients with
   endophthalmitis after vitrectomy. A systematic review of studies
   reporting the endophthalmitis rates after MIVS versus 20-gauge
   vitrectomy was conducted to assess the pooled incidence rates of
   postvitrectomy endophthalmitis.
   RESULTS: The endophthalmitis rates from the multicenter survey were
   0.034\% (10 cases per 29 030 eyes) after 20-gauge vitrectomy and 0.054\%
   (8 cases per 14 838 eyes) after MIVS, with no significant (P = .603)
   differences between groups. Although the incidence in 25-gauge cases (6
   per 8238 eyes; 0.073\%) was greater than in 23-gauge cases (2 per 6600
   eyes; 0.030\%), the difference was not significant (P = 0.451). Of 8
   eyes in which endophthalmitis developed after MIVS, 6 eyes (75\%) had a
   final visual acuity of 0.5 or better, and none lost light perception. By
   combining the results of 7 studies, including the current multicenter
   survey, meta-analyses from a total of 77 956 cases at the baseline
   showed that the pooled endophthalmitis rates after MIVS (0.08\%; 95\%
   confidence interval, 0.030\% to 0.164\%) and after 20-gauge vitrectomy
   (0.030\%; 95\% confidence interval, 0.012\% to 0.048\%) did not differ
   significantly (P = .207, pooled risk difference; 0.0005 {[}95\%
   confidence interval, -0.0002 to 0.0012]).
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postvitrectomy endophthalmitis was low
   with no significant differences between MIVS and 20-gauge vitrectomy.

Abstract = {{Although Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is a
   leading malaria vaccine candidate, extensive allelic diversity may
   compromise its vaccine potential. We have previously shown that
   naturally acquired antibodies to AMA1 were associated with protection
   from clinical malaria in this Kenyan population. To assess the impact of
   allelic diversity on naturally acquired immunity, we first sequenced the
   ectodomain-encoding region of P. falciparum ama1 from subjects with
   asymptomatic, mild, and severe malaria and measured allele frequency
   distributions. We then measured antibodies to three allelic AMA1
   proteins (AMA1\_3D7, AMA1\_FVO, and AMA1\_HB3) and used competition
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to analyze allele-specific
   antibodies. Seventy-eight unique haplotypes were identified from 129
   alleles sampled. No clustering of allelic haplotypes with disease
   severity or year of sampling was observed. Differences in nucleotide
   frequencies in clinical (severe plus mild malaria) versus asymptomatic
   infections were observed at 16 polymorphic positions. Allele frequency
   distributions were indicative of balancing selection, with the strongest
   signature being identified in domain III (Tajima's D = 2.51; P < 0.05).
   Antibody reactivities to each of the three allelic AMA1 proteins were
   highly correlated (P < 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons). Although
   antibodies to conserved epitopes were abundant, 48\% of selected
   children with anti-AMA1 IgG (n = 106) had detectable reactivity to
   allele-specific epitopes as determined by a competition ELISA.
   Antibodies to both conserved and allele-specific epitopes in AMA1 may
   contribute to clinical protection.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Pregnancy-related weight retention can contribute to
   obesity, and breastfeeding may facilitate postpartum weight loss. We
   investigated the effect of breastfeeding on long-term postpartum weight
   retention.
   Methods. Using data from the North Carolina Special Supplemental
   Nutrition Program for Women. Infants, and Children (WIC; 1996-2004),
   weight retention was assessed in women aged 18 years or older who had
   more than one pregnancy available for analysis (n = 32,920). Using
   multivariable linear regression, the relationship between duration of
   breastfeeding after the first pregnancy and change in pre-pregnancy
   weight from the first pregnancy to the second pregnancy was estimated,
   controlling for demographic and weight-related covariates.
   Results. Mean time between pregnancies was 2.8 years (standard deviation
   (SD) 1.5), and mean weight retention from the first to the second
   pregnancy was 4.9 kg (SD 8.7). In covariate-adjusted analyses,
   breastfeeding for 20 weeks or more resulted in 0.39 kg (standard error
   (SE) 0.18) less weight retention at the beginning of the second
   pregnancy relative to no breastfeeding (p = 0.025).
   Conclusion. In this large, racially diverse sample of low-income women,
   long-term weight retention was lower among those who breastfed for at
   least 20 weeks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. - The main aim of the study was to investigate if different level
   of aerobic fitness influence heart rate (HR) responses during 10-s
   intervals of first minute of recovery after maximal exercise in
   athletes.
   Methods. - Thirty female athletes requesting a pre-competition medical
   examination with exercise-stress testing at the exercise physiology lab,
   who were participating in consistent training for the past 2 years and
   who were between 20 and 22 years of age, were recruited for the study.
   After maximal exercise on treadmill, the end of exercise was flagged,
   and 1 min of post-exercise HR recorded with the subject at supine
   position.
   Results. - At the both 10 and 20s of recovery period, female athletes
   with high aerobic capacity (> 50 ml/kg/nnin) had significantly tower HR
   as compared to their sub-elite counterparts (<40 ml/kg/min) (p<0.05).
   The results obtained in this study suggest that the female athletes with
   superior aerobic fitness had lower 10 and 20s recovery HR after maximal
   exercise than their counterparts with lower aerobic capacity.
   Conclusion. - These results seem to indicate that aerobic fitness along
   with autonomic modulation might have played a rote in the ultra
   short-term cardiovascular responses to all-out exercise. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Having a quantitative understanding of the carbon cycle in forests is of
   great importance for predicting global warming issues. Carbon dioxide
   production in soil is the largest CO2 source in forests, and exhibits
   large temporal and spatial variations. Continuous observation of soil
   CO2 flux at many sites over a forest is therefore necessary to obtain
   representative soil CO2 fluxes for the forest. In this study, a gradient
   method to measure soil CO2 flux indirectly from soil radon and CO2
   measurements was theoretically modified to conveniently measure the soil
   CO2 flux from soil radon and CO2 concentrations measured at one soil
   depth. To experimentally test the modified method, a field observation
   was conducted continuously in a forest over a 31-day period.
   Since changes in the soil water content near the soil surface were small
   throughout the observation, a constant effective diffusivity for CO2 was
   assumed for the soil CO2 flux estimation. The soil CO2 flux was then
   calculated as the product of the effective diffusivity and the gradient
   of the soil CO2 concentration, each calculated from soil radon and CO2
   concentrations. The estimated flux ranged from 1.9 to 5.8 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1), and, correlating well with the reference value, measured with a
   conventional ventilated-chamber method.. We therefore conclude that the
   modified gradient method based on the measurement of soil CO2 and radon
   concentration at one depth is reliable, at least under conditions where
   the change in the soil water content is small. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The primary objective of this study was to characterize Fusarium spp.
   associated with the economically devastating mango malformation disease
   (MMD) in Mexico. In all. 142 Fusarium strains were isolated from
   symptomatic mango inflorescences and vegetative tissues in eight
   geographically diverse Mexican states from 2002 through 2007. Initially,
   all the Mexican isolates were screened for genetic diversity using
   appolymerase chain reaction and random amplified polymorphic DNA markers
   and were grouped into seven distinct genotypes. Based on results of
   these analyses, evolutionary relationships and species limits of the
   genetically diverse MMD-associated Fusarium spp. were investigated using
   multilocus DNA sequence data and phylogenetic species recognition.
   Maximum parsimony analyses of a five-locus data set comprising 5.8 kb of
   aligned DNA sequence data indicated that at least nine phylogenetically
   distinct Fusarium spp. within the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex
   are associated with MMD, including one species within the African chide
   (Fusarium pseudocircinatum), two species within the Asian elude (F.
   mangiferae and F proliferatum), and at least six species within the
   American clade (F. sterilihyphosum and five undescribed Fusarium spp.).
   Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that a novel genealogically
   exclusive lineage within the American chide was the predominant MMD
   associate in Mexico. This new Fusarium sp. caused MMD and could be
   distinguished from all other known species morphologically by the
   production of mostly sterile, coiled hyphae which are typically
   associated with sporodochial conidiophores together with un-branched or
   sparsely branched aerial conidiophores. Koch's postulates were completed
   for isolates of the new species on nucellar seedlings of mango CV.

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes, within a regional growth model, the impact of a
   productive governmental input and integration on the spatial
   distribution of economic activity. In doing so, two benchmark cases (i)
   equal distribution, and (ii) agglomeration in the sense of a
   core-periphery structure as well as the corresponding transition
   processes are discussed. Integration is understood as enhancing
   inter-territorial cooperation and it describes the extent to which one
   region may benefit from the other region's public input. Both
   integration and the characteristics of the public input crucially affect
   whether or not agglomeration arises and hence to which extent economic
   activity is concentrated. Key results are: Intensifying integration
   reduces the strengths of agglomeration forces and the corresponding
   degree of concentration will be lower. Relative congestion leads to an
   overestimation of capital returns and capital growth in the core region
   is faster due to congestion thereby leading to suboptimally high
   concentration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eucalypt woodlands have been extensively cleared in southern Australia
   for agricultural production and the scattered trees that remain
   ({''}paddock trees{''}) are at risk of extinction without conservation
   action to lift recruitment rates. Here we assessed the reproductive,
   demographic, and genetic structure of trees from two vegetation types
   (paddock vs. intact vegetation fragments) for each of two species of
   eucalypts to characterize post-clearance population structure and to
   evaluate paddock trees as seed sources for revegetation. Paddock trees
   of both species were structurally larger than trees in vegetation
   fragments, but seedlings and saplings were completely absent in paddocks
   due to ongoing agricultural land use. Eucalyptus leucoxylon paddock
   trees had high mortality, but overall paddock trees were not in poorer
   condition than fragment trees. E. leucoxylon paddock trees had lower
   reproductive output than trees in fragments, and Eucalyptus
   camaldulensis paddock trees had higher. Levels of genetic diversity of
   adult trees were very similar in the two vegetation types, and there was
   no genetic differentiation between paddock trees and remnant vegetation
   across our survey sites. These results suggest that paddock trees
   represent a potential source of seed to contribute to genetically
   diverse woodland restoration plantings, though further trials will be
   required to evaluate seedling survival on agriculturally modified land
   and under predicted future climate conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The inheritance of the resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis
   (F.o.m.) races 0 and 2 in `Tortuga', a Spanish cantalupensis accession,
   was studied from crosses of `Tortuga' by the susceptible line `Piel de
   Sapo' and the resistant one `Charentais-Fom1' that carries the
   resistance gene Fom-1. The segregation patterns observed in the F-2
   ('Tortuga' x `Piel de Sapo') and the backcross ('Piel de Sapo' x
   ('Tortuga' x `Piel de Sapo') populations, suggest that resistance of
   `Tortuga' to races 0 and 2 of F.o.m. is conferred by two independent
   genes: one dominant and the other recessive. In the F2 derived from the
   cross between accessions `Tortuga' and `Charentais-Fom1', the lack of
   susceptible plants indicated that the two accessions are carrying the
   same resistance gene (Fom-1). The analysis of 158 F-2 plants ('Tortuga'
   x `Piel de Sapo') with a Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence marker
   618-CAPS, tightly linked to Fom-1 (0.9 cM), confirmed that `Tortuga'
   also carries a recessive gene, that we propose to symbolize by fom-4.}},

Title = {{Intended sensitive and harsh caregiving responses to infant crying: The
   role of cry pitch and perceived urgency in an adult twin sample}},
Journal = {{CHILD ABUSE \& NEGLECT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the underlying mechanisms of adults' intended
   caregiving responses to cry sounds in a behavioral genetic design and to
   investigate the role of cry pitch and perceived urgency in sensitive and
   harsh caregiving responses.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 184 adult twin pairs (18-69 years),
   including males and females, parents and nonparents. In an experimental
   design we presented cry sounds varying in pitch and measured adults'
   perception and their intended caregiving responses. Cry stimuli were
   based on a 10-second cry sample of a 2-day-old infant with a fundamental
   frequency averaging 500 Hz. Two additional cry sounds were created by
   digitally increasing the fundamental frequency to 700 and 900 Hz.
   Results: Individual differences in the perceived urgency of infant
   crying and intended sensitive caregiving responses were explained by
   genetic factors (38\% and 39\%, respectively), while the variance in
   harsh caregiving responses was due to shared (31\%) and unique (69\%)
   environmental influences. Adults were more likely to indicate sensitive
   caregiving responses to higher-pitched cry sounds and when they
   perceived the cries as more urgent, while high-pitched cry sounds were
   also directly associated with harsh caregiving responses.
   Conclusions: The influence of genetic factors on intended caregiving
   responses to infant crying is substantial for normal variations in
   sensitive caregiving, but absent for harsh caregiving responses. The
   findings suggest that the perception of infant crying as urgent paves
   the way for more immediate and affectionate caregiving responses, while
   an extreme increase in cry pitch may present a direct risk factor for
   more irritated, negative and even harsh parenting.
   Practice implications: Infants who display abnormal cry acoustics such
   as extreme increases in pitch may be at risk for harsh parenting.
   Interventions should promote parental sensitive response to distress
   vocalizations to prevent harsh parenting in case of at-risk infants. (C)

Abstract = {{Significant time lags between the development of novel innovations
   (e.g., nanotechnologies), understanding of their wider impacts, and
   subsequent governance (e.g., regulation) have led to repeated calls for
   more anticipatory and adaptive approaches that promote the responsible
   emergence of new technologies in democratic societies. A key challenge
   is implementation in a pragmatic way. Results are presented of a study
   with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the largest
   public funder of basic innovation research in the United Kingdom who,
   for the first time, asked applicants to submit a risk register
   identifying the wider potential impacts and associated risks
   (environment, health, societal, and ethical) of their proposed research.
   This focused on nanoscience for carbon capture and utilization. Risk
   registers were completed conservatively, with most identified impacts
   concerning researchers' health associated with nanoparticle synthesis,
   handling, and prototype device fabrication, i.e., risks that could be
   identified and managed with a reasonable level of certainty. Few wider
   environmental impacts and no future impacts on society were identified,
   reflecting the often uncertain and unpredictable nature of innovation.
   However, some applicants addressed this by including investigators with
   expertise beyond engineering and nanosciences supporting integrated
   activities that included life cycle and real-time technology assessment,
   which in some cases were also framed by stakeholder and/or public
   engagement. Proposals underpinned by a strong commitment to responsible
   science and innovation promoted continuous reflexivity, embedding a
   suite of multidisciplinary approaches around the innovation research
   core to support decisions modulating the trajectory of their innovation
   research in real-time.}},

   consecutive patients who underwent sirolimus-eluting stent implantation
   in the J-Cypher registry, we identified 910 patients who underwent PCI
   within 24 hours from onset of STEMI Three-year outcomes were evaluated
   according to use of 13 blockers at hospital discharge (349 patients in
   beta-blocker group and 561 patients in no-beta-blocker group) Patients
   in the beta-blocker group more frequently had hypertension, low left
   ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), a left anterior descending artery
   infarct, and statin use than those in the no-beta-blocker group No
   difference was observed between the B-blocker and no-beta-blocker groups
   in mortality (6 6\% vs 6 6\%, p = 0 85, propensity score adjusted hazard
   ratio 110, 95\% confidence interval 064 to 1 90, p = 0 70) or in

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The quality of a software system is partially determined by its
   structure (topological structure), so the need to quantitatively analyze
   the quality of the structure has become eminent In this paper a novel
   metric called software quality of structure (SQoS) is presented for
   quantitatively measuring the structural quality of object-oriented (OO)
   softwares via bug propagation analysis on weighted software networks
   (WSNs) First, the software systems are modeled as a WSN, weighted class
   dependency network (WCDN), in which classes are nodes and the
   interaction between every pair of classes if any is a directed edge with
   a weight indicating the probability that a bug in one class will
   propagate to the other Then we analyze the bug propagation process in
   the WCDN together with the bug proneness of each class, and based on
   this, a metric (SQoS) to measure the structural quality of OO softwares
   as a whole is developed The approach is evaluated in two case studies on
   open source Java programs using different software structures (one
   employs design patterns and the other does not) for the same OO software
   The results of the case studies validate the effectiveness of the
   proposed metric The approach is fully automated by a tool written in
   Java}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim of the study: The study aim was to investigate the
   mid-term risk factors for neo-aortic regurgitation in patients with
   transposition of the great arteries (TGA) and Taussig-Bing malformation
   after the arterial switch operation (ASO).
   Methods: Between February 2001 and December 2007, a total of 202
   patients with TGA or Taussig-Bing malformation underwent the ASO at the
   authors' institution. Subsequently, 185 surviving patients (140 males,
   45 females; mean age 14 +/- 28 months) were followed up in the
   out-patient department, using echocardiography. A multiple logistic
   regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for
   postoperative neo-aortic regurgitation.
   Results: The mean period of follow up was 35 +/- 22 months (range: 3 to
   88 months). Postoperative neo-aortic regurgitation was present in 19
   patients; this was mild in 16 cases (9\%) and moderate in three (2\%).
   During the follow up, freedom from aortic regurgitation was 90\%; the
   overall rates of freedom from aortic regurgitation at one, three, and
   five years were 95\%, 89\%, and 83\%, respectively. The mid-term risk
   factors for neo-aortic regurgitation were ventricular septal defect
   (VSD) (p = 0.02), operative age >6 months (p = 0.01), and a
   postoperative neo-aortic valve Z-score >1 (p <0.01).
   Conclusion: The ASO showed an acceptable midterm function of the aortic
   valve. The risk factors for postoperative neo-aortic regurgitation
   included VSD, operative age >6 months, and a postoperative neo-aortic
   valve Z-score >1.}},

Title = {{Transvaginal ultrasound measurement of bladder wall thickness: a more
   reliable approach than transperineal and transabdominal approaches}},
Journal = {{BJU INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1519-1522}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES
   To validate transperineal, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound
   (US) techniques to measure bladder wall thickness (BWT).
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS
   Women underwent US measurement of BWT at three different anatomical
   sites: anterior wall, dome and trigone of the bladder by two `blinded'
   operators using transabdominal, transperineal and transvaginal
   approaches at separate visits and by a single operator using
   transabdominal and transperineal techniques. Bland-Altman analysis was
   used to determine interobserver reliability for all three techniques and
   intraobserver reliability for transabdominal and transperineal methods.
   RESULTS
   In all, 25 women were scanned. The transperineal US had a high
   interobserver mean difference when measuring the anterior BWT (-0.34)
   and a high intraobserver mean difference when measuring the anterior
   (0.54) and dome BWT (0.33). Transabdominal US had a high interobserver
   mean difference for all measurements of BWT, and a high intraobserver
   mean difference when measuring the trigonal thickness (0.56).
   Transvaginal US had a consistent interobserver mean difference for all
   three measurements. The transperineal and transabominal approaches had
   the widest intraobserver and interobserver 95\% confidence intervals of
   the mean difference when compared with the transvaginal approach.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Transabdominal and transperineal US for measuring BWT did not have good
   intraobserver and interobserver reliability for measurement of the three
   anatomical sites to determine mean BWT. Transvaginal US had good

Abstract = {{This study examined health insurance disparities among recent
   immigrants. The authors analyzed all working-age adult immigrants
   between the ages of 18 and 64 using the New Immigrant Survey data
   collected in 2003. This survey is a cross-sectional interview of recent
   legal permanent residents on their social, economic, and health status.
   Respondents were interviewed in English or in their preferred languages.
   Nearly two-thirds of immigrants were uninsured, in spite of their strong
   labor force participation. Of the four key classes of
   immigration-employment based, family sponsored, refugee/asylum program,
   and diversity program-the diversity program immigrants were least likely
   to be insured, controlling for a wide array of demographic, human
   capital, acculturation, and assets-related variables. Strategies to
   increase health insurance coverage among legal immigrants, especially
   diversity immigrants, are discussed.}},

Title = {{Spectral energy distributions of 6.7 GHz methanol masers}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{522}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Context. The 6.7 GHz maser transition of methanol has been found
   exclusively towards massive star forming regions. A majority of the
   masers have been found to lack the presence of any associated radio
   continuum. This could be due to the maser emission originating prior to
   the formation of an HII region around the central star, or from the
   central object being too cool to produce a HII region.
   Aims. One way to distinguish between the two scenarios is to determine
   and model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the masers.
   Methods. We observed a sample of 20 6.7 GHz methanol masers selected
   from the blind Arecibo survey, from centimeter to submillimeter
   wavelengths. We combined our observations with existing data from
   various Galactic plane surveys to determine SEDs from centimeter to
   near-infrared wavelengths.
   Results. We find that 70\% of the masers do not have any associated
   radio continuum, with the rest of the sources being associated with
   hypercompact and ultracompact HII regions. Modeling the SEDs shows them
   to be consistent with rapidly accreting massive stars, with accretion
   rates well above 10(-3) M-circle dot yr(-1). The upper limits on the
   radio continuum are also consistent with any ionized region being
   confined close to the stellar surface.
   Conclusions. This confirms the paradigm of 6.7 GHz methanol masers being
   signposts of early phases of massive star formation, mostly prior to the
   formation of a hypercompact HII region.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a study that employed a theory-based approach in
   the form of a learning study to enhance a domain-specific generic
   capability, financial literacy, of Grade 12 students to empower them to
   make informed and independent financial decisions. Financial literacy is
   seen in this study as a function of student understanding of a limited
   set of interrelated economic concepts that can be used as tools to
   assess financial situations and make sound financial decisions. Twelve
   teachers participated in the study. Six worked together in a learning
   study group and drew on a particular theory of learning in planning and
   carrying out lessons designed to serve the learning aims, whereas the
   other six worked collaboratively in a lesson study group. To evaluate
   the effectiveness of the two learning conditions created by the two
   groups, 193 students answered questions on complex, everyday financial
   situations in four tests: a pretest, a posttest following the research
   lessons, and delayed posttests 6 weeks and 6 months after instruction.
   The results showed that students in the learning study group
   outperformed their counterparts in the lesson study group in all three
   post-lesson tests, and that the inter-group performance gap was
   maintained or widened over time.}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{By using the National Burn Repository, the authors sought to identify
   markers for injury severity and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) risk after
   electrical injury. They identified adult patients in the National Burn
   Repository who were admitted with an electrical injury between 1995 and
   2007 (n = 1469). Patients who died within 24 hours or were admitted for
   less than 1 day and hospitals reporting no complications were excluded.
   Independent variables included TBSA burned, duration of intensive care
   unit stay and hospital admission, duration of mechanical ventilation,
   the number of operative procedures, amputation, and early fasciotomy.
   Early fasciotomy was defined as fasciotomy performed on a patient's
   first trip to the operating room and was used as a proxy for severity of
   electrical injury. DVT and death were the dependent variables. Among
   electrically injured patients, 10.4\% had early fasciotomy. Patients who
   had early fasciotomy had significantly prolonged intensive care unit
   stays (10.3 vs 4.8 days, P < .001), hospital days (36.7 vs 17.1 days, P
   < .001), amputations (49.0 vs 4.6\%, P < .001), and a number of
   operative codes (17.6 vs 5.4, P < .001). DVT incidence was 0.9\%.
   Electrically injured patients who had early fasciotomy were
   significantly more likely to have a DVT when compared with patients who
   did not have early fasciotomy (7.55 vs 0.95\%, P = .002). Early
   fasciotomy after electrical injury is a marker for increased injury
   severity. Among patients who underwent early fasciotomy after electrical
   injury, 7.5\% develop DVT, and 49\% require amputation during their
   initial hospitalization. (J Burn Care Res 2010; 31: 882-887)}},

Abstract = {{Antibodies are an important class of proteins with many biomedical and
   biotechnical applications. Although there are a plethora of experimental
   techniques geared toward their efficient production, there is a paucity
   of computational methods for their de novo design. OptCDR is a general
   computational method to design the binding portions of antibodies to
   have high specificity and affinity against any targeted epitope of an
   antigen. First, combinations of canonical structures for the antibody
   complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that are most likely to be
   able to favorably bind the antigen are selected. This is followed by the
   simultaneous refinement of the CDR structures' backbones and optimal
   amino acid selection for each position. OptCDR is applied to three
   computational test cases: a peptide from the capsid of hepatitis C, the
   hapten fluorescein and the protein vascular endothelial growth factor.
   The results demonstrate that OptCDR can efficiently generate diverse
   antibody libraries of a pre-specified size with promising antigen
   affinity potential as exemplified by computationally derived binding
   metrics.}},

   independent of its enzymatic activity Accordingly, NE knockout mice do
   not form NETs in a pulmonary model of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,
   which suggests that this defect may contribute to the immune deficiency
   of these mice This mechanism provides for a novel function for serine

Abstract = {{We investigated the use of solid residues from Pleurotus ostreatus
   mushroom production in adsorbing and decolorizing different dyes The
   solid residue used in this study was composed of hemicellulose and
   cellulose (52 81 \%), acid-insoluble lignin (25 42\%), chitin (6 5\%),
   and water extractives (14 82\%) After incubating 14\% (wt/vol) solid
   residue in distilled water for 4 h, laccase and manganese peroxidase
   (MnP) activities were 0 5 U/g and 12 mU/g, respectively Enzymatic
   decolorization percentages were up to 100 for azure B (heterocyclic dye)
   and indigo carmine (indigoid dye), 74 5 for malachite green (MG)
   (triphenylmethane dye), and zero for xylidine (azoic dye) The optimum
   temperature for decolorization was in the range of 26 36 C for all dyes
   Data obtained on adsorption (enzymatic decolorization was prevented with
   sodium azide) at different dye concentrations and m a pH range of 3 7
   were used to plot Freundlich isotherms The spent fungal substrate (SFS)
   displayed large differences in adsorption capacity, depending on the dye
   tested The highest adsorption capacity was observed at pH 3 for MG,
   while xylidine was slightly adsorbed at pH 3 and 4 and not adsorbed at
   higher pH values Laccase and MnP production were affected by the
   presence of the dyes The highest enzyme levels were observed m the
   presence of MG, when laccase and MnP increased 1 39- and 2 13-fold,
   respectively Decolorization and adsorption to SFS are both important
   processes in removing dyes from aqueous solutions The application of
   this spent substrate for wastewater treatment will be able to take
   advantage of both of these dye removal processes An important problem in
   bioremediation processes involving microorganisms is the amount of time
   required for their growth In this report, we used the spent substrates
   from mushroom cultivation in wastewater treatment, thus solving the
   problem of waiting for microorganisms to grow}},

Abstract = {{Fos, a protein product of immediate early gene c-fos, has been used as a
   marker for activation of nociceptive neurons in central nervous system
   including spinal trigeminal nucleus (Vsp). By noxious stimulation
   applied to orofacial area, the expression of Fos occurred in the Vsp
   pars oralis (Vo), the subnucleus receiving inputs from trigeminal
   primary afferents that predominantly innervate intraoral receptive
   fields. The present study demonstrates that the in vitro activation of
   group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs; mGluR1 and 5) by
   bath-application of their well-known agonist
   (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) increased the number of
   Fos-expressing neurons in the Vo area. In addition, bath application of
   DHPG caused inward currents, a parameter of neuronal excitation, in the
   Vo neurons held at -70 mV in voltage-clamp mode of whole-cell
   recordings. In further experiments characterizing two phenomena, the
   increased Fos expression in the Vo was mediated by an additive
   activation of both mGluR1 and mGluR5, which required the activation of
   N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, protein kinase C (PKC) and
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In contrast, the inward
   currents were mediated only by mGluR1, but not by others. The data
   resulting from this in vitro study indicate that the DHPG-induced
   membrane depolarisation or neuronal excitation may be upstream to, or
   skip, the NMDA receptor, PKC and ERK pathways for the DHPG-induced Fos
   expression.}},

Abstract = {{Sumoylation is a post-translational regulatory process in diverse
   cellular processes in eukaryotes, involving conjugation/deconjugation of
   small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to other proteins thus
   modifying their function. The PIAS {[}protein inhibitor of activated
   signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)] and SAP
   (scaffold attachment factor A/B/acinus/PIAS)/MIZ (SIZ) proteins exhibit
   SUMO E3-ligase activity that facilitates the conjugation of SUMO
   proteins to target substrates. Here, we report the isolation and
   molecular characterization of Oryza sativa SIZ1 (OsSIZ1) and SIZ2
   (OsSIZ2), rice homologs of Arabidopsis SIZ1. The rice SIZ proteins are
   localized to the nucleus and showed sumoylation activities in a tobacco
   system. Our analysis showed increased amounts of SUMO conjugates
   associated with environmental stresses such as high and low temperature,
   NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) in rice plants. The expression of OsSIZ1
   and OsSIZ2 in siz1-2 Arabidopsis plants partially complemented the
   morphological mutant phenotype and enhanced levels of SUMO conjugates
   under heat shock conditions. In addition, ABA-hypersensitivity of siz1-2
   seed germination was partially suppressed by OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2. The
   results suggest that rice SIZ1 and SIZ2 are able to functionally
   complement Arabidopsis SIZ1 in the SUMO conjugation pathway. Their
   effects on the Arabidopsis mutant suggest a function for these genes
   related to stress responses and stress adaptation.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1278-1287}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   This study investigated the surface characteristics and in vitro
   osteoconductivity of a titanium (Ti) surface incorporated with the
   magnesium ions (Mg) produced by hydrothermal treatment for future
   application as an endosseous implant surface.
   Material and methods
   Mg-incorporated Ti oxide surfaces were produced by hydrothermal
   treatment using Mg-containing solution on two different microstructured
   surfaces - abraded minimally rough (Ma) or grit-blasted moderately rough
   (RBM) samples. The surface characteristics were evaluated using scanning
   electron microscopy, thin-film X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, optical profilometry, and inductively coupled plasma
   atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cell
   attachment, proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and
   quantitative analysis of osteoblastic gene expression on Ma, RBM,
   Mg-incorporated Ma (Mg), and Mg-incorporated grit-blasted (RBM/Mg) Ti
   surfaces were evaluated.
   Results
   Hydrothermal treatment produced an Mg-incorporated Ti oxide layer with
   nanoporous surface structures. Mg-incorporated surfaces showed surface
   morphologies and surface roughness values almost identical to those of
   untreated smooth or micro-rough surfaces at the micron scale. ICP-AES
   analysis showed Mg ions released from treated surfaces into the
   solution. Mg incorporation significantly increased cellular attachment
   (P=0 at 0.5 h, P=0.01 at 1 h) on smooth surfaces, but no differences
   were found on micro-rough surfaces. Mg incorporation further increased
   ALP activity in cells grown on both smooth and micro-rough surfaces at 7
   and 14 days of culture (P=0). Real-time polymerase chain reaction
   analysis showed higher mRNA expressions of the osteoblast transcription
   factor gene (Dlx5), various integrins, and the osteoblast phenotype
   genes (ALP, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin) in cells grown on
   micro-rough (RBM) and Mg-incorporated (Mg and RBM/Mg) surfaces than
   those on Ma surfaces. Mg incorporation further increased the mRNA
   expressions of key osteoblast genes and integrins (alpha 1, alpha 2,
   alpha 5, and beta 1) in cells grown on both the smooth and the
   micro-rough surfaces.
   Conclusion
   These results indicate that an Mg-incorporated nanoporous Ti oxide
   surface produced by hydrothermal treatment may improve implant bone
   healing by enhancing the attachment and differentiation of osteoblastic
   cells.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate parallel implementation techniques for
   network coding. It is known that network coding is useful for both wired
   and wireless networks and it also mitigates peer/piece selection
   problems in P2P file sharing systems. However, due to the decoding
   complexity of network coding, there have been concerns about adoption of
   network coding in practical network systems and to improve the decoding
   performance, the exploitation of parallelism has been proposed
   previously. In this paper, we argue that naive parallelization
   strategies of network coding may result in unbalanced workload
   distribution, and thus, limiting performance improvements. We further
   argue that a higher performance enhancement can be achieved through
   balanced partitioning methods in parallelized network coding and propose
   new parallelization techniques for network coding. Our experiments show
   that on a quad-core processor system, proposed algorithms exhibit up to
   5.69 speedup which is better than the linear speedup with the influence
   of additional cache. Moreover, on an octal-core system, our algorithms
   even achieve speedup of 8.46 compared to a sequential network coding and
   43.3 percent faster than an existing parallelized technique using 1
   Mbytes data with 1,024 x 1,024 coefficient matrix size.}},

   Selenium concentration in black shales and slates of the study area is
   relatively higher than that in the crust and shales but lower than that
   in average black shales Soil pH values range from 5 to 6 and LOI is in
   the range of 3 to 7\% The mean concentrations of Se in mountain farmland
   and paddy soils overlying black shales and slates are 44 mg/kg 1 8 mg/kg
   and 1 5 mg/kg respectively In particular the maximum level of Se is up
   to 72 6 mg/kg in mountain soils which is much higher than the world
   average concentration of Se A significant level of Se was found in soils
   collected from the previous exploration sites for uranium bearing black
   shales Selenium concentration in soils derived from black shales and
   slates is enriched more than 2 times compared with that from nearby
   limestones and phyllites Distribution patterns of Se also show a very

Abstract = {{Bacterial cellulose is produced by the bacterium Gluconacetobacter
   xylinus, which forms a nanofibrous pellicle in its culture medium. We
   studied properties of the bacterial cellulose such as crystallinity,
   viscosity, morphology, and mechanical properties according to the carbon
   source. Static cultures of Gluconacetobacter sp. V6 were performed in
   three kinds of media: standard Hestrin-Schramm medium, and modified
   medium with either glycerol or molasses as carbon sources. Cell growth
   and cellulose yield were increased in the glycerol and molasses media.
   The culture in the glycerol medium improved the physical properties of
   cellulose such as crystallinity, intrinsic viscosity, and breaking
   stress. However, the culture in the molasses medium decreased
   crystallinity, crystallite size, and intrinsic viscosity of cellulose.
   In summary, the cellulose yield was remarkably improved in the molasses
   medium, but with inferior structural properties.}},

Abstract = {{The valence band structure and the optical gain characteristics of
   staggered CaZnO/CdZnO/MgGaN quantum well (QW) lasers are investigated
   using the multiband effective mass theory. These results are compared
   with those of conventional CdZnO/MgZnO QW lasers. The spatial separation
   between electron and hole wavefunctions is found to be reduced greatly
   with the inclusion of staggered InGaN layers. The heavy-hole effective
   mass around the topmost valence band is not affected by the inclusion of
   the staggered layer. The optical gain peak of a conventional QW
   structure rapidly decreases with increasing Cd composition. On the other
   hand, the reduction in the optical gain by the increase of the Cd
   composition is shown to be decreased greatly with the inclusion of a
   staggered QW structure. This can be explained by the fact that the
   internal field is reduced for a staggered QW structure.}},

   characteristics of the biodiesel fuel are compared to experimental
   results from diesel fuel The combustion and exhaust emission
   calculations for the biodiesel fuel are performed in KIVA 3v code
   Investigations revealed that biodiesel fuel shows a fast spray
   development in the initial stage of injection However, at the end of
   injection, the biodiesel spray shows a somewhat slow development
   compared to diesel spray in the same injection quantity conditions In
   addition, the biodiesel spray targeted the piston lib due to the piston
   geometry and the low ambient gas density at an injection timing of BTDC
   30 degrees At this time, the spray and combustion temperature
   distributions are concentrated within the entire engine cylinder, while
   they are mainly concentrated in the piston bowl region when injected
   after BTDC 30 degrees When compared to diesel fuel at the same injection
   quantity, biodiesel fuel shows lower NOx and soot emissions, and the CO
   and HC emissions of biodiesel fuel show similar trends}},

Abstract = {{A bacterial strain capable of producing extracellular
   alpha-galactosidase was isolated from a sample of sugarcane industrial
   waste. Microbiological, physiological, and biochemical studies revealed
   that the isolate belonged to Bacillus sp. Furthermore, based on a 16S
   rDNA sequence analysis, the new isolate was identified as Bacillus
   megaterium VHM1. The production of alpha-galactosidase was optimized
   based on various physical culture conditions. Guar gum and yeast extract
   acted as the best carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The optimum
   pH was 7.5 and the enzyme remained stable over a pH range of 5-9. The
   enzyme was optimally active at 55 degrees C and thermostable with a
   half-life of 120 min, yet lost 90\% of its residual activity within 120
   min at 60 degrees C. One mM concentrations of Ag-2, Cu-2, and Hg2+
   strongly inhibited the alpha-galactosidase, whereas the metal ions Fe-2,
   Mn2+, and Mg2+ had no effect on the alpha-galactosidase activity, and
   Zn2+, Ni2+, and Ca2+ reduced the enzyme activity slightly. When treated
   with the B. megaterium VHM1 enzyme, the flatulence-causing sugars in
   soymilk were completely hydrolyzed within 1.5 h.}},

Abstract = {{Although actinomycetes are the plant-associated environmental bacteria
   best known for producing thousands of antibiotics, their presence in the
   guts of flower-feeding honeybees has rarely been reported. Here, we
   report on the selective isolation of actinomycetes from the gut
   microbiota of healthy honeybees, and their inhibitory activity against
   honeybee indigenous bacteria. More than 70\% of the sampled honeybees (N
   > 40) in a season carried at least one CFU of actinomycete. The isolates
   from bees of one location produced inhibitory bioactivities that were
   almost exclusively against several bee indigenous Bacillus strains and
   Gram-positive human pathogens but not Escherichia coli. An
   antibiotic-producing actinomycete closely related to Nocardiopsis alba
   was isolated from the guts in every season of the year. A DNA fragment
   encoding a homologous gene (phzD) involved in phenazine biosynthesis was
   identified in the isolate. Expression of the phzD detected by reverse
   transcription-PCR can explain the survival of this organism in anaerobic
   environments as some redox-active extracellular phenazines are commonly
   regarded as respiratory electron acceptors. The results raise important
   questions concerning the roles of the antibiotic-producing actinomycetes
   and the phenazine-like molecules in honeybee guts and honey.}},

   compete with Klemens for speed due to the large density of states

   (PWM) synchronous buck converter, which is designed to operate at low
   voltage and high efficiency typically required for portable systems. A
   new passive auxiliary circuit that allows the main switch to operate
   with zero-voltage switching has been incorporated in the conventional
   PWM synchronous buck converter. The operation principles and detailed
   steady-state analysis of the ZVT PWM synchronous converter with a
   passive auxiliary circuit are presented. All of the semiconductor
   devices aside from the main switch operate under soft-switching
   conditions. Thus, the auxiliary circuit provides a larger overall
   efficiency. The feasibility of the auxiliary circuit is confirmed by the
   simulation and experimental results.}},

   cluttered multipath environments has been shown to be feasible, and in

   for a number of factors, 2 predictors contributed significantly toward
   uniquely explaining the use of these stereotypes: race salience (i.e.,
   seeing and organizing by race) and essentialist thinking (i.e.,
   believing that race cannot change). These results provide insight into

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider a construction in an arbitrary triangulated
   category J which resembles the notion of a Moore spectrum in algebraic
   topology. Namely, given a compact object C of T satisfying some finite
   tilting assumptions, we obtain a functor which ``approximates{''}
   objects from the module category of the endomorphism algebra of C in J.
   This provides a higher analogue of a construction of Jorgensen which
   appears in (Manuscr Math 110:381-406, 2003) in connection with lifts of
   certain homological functors of derived categories. We show that this
   new functor is well-behaved with respect to short exact sequences and
   distinguished triangles, and as a consequence we obtain a new way of
   embedding a module category in a triangulated category. As an example of
   the theory, we recover Keller's canonical embedding of the module
   category of a path algebra of a quiver with no oriented cycles into its
   u-cluster category of u >= 2.}},

Abstract = {{Most multidimensional projection techniques rely on distance
   (dissimilarity) information between data instances to embed
   high-dimensional data into a visual space. When data are endowed with
   Cartesian coordinates, an extra computational effort is necessary to
   compute the needed distances, making multidimensional projection
   prohibitive in applications dealing with interactivity and massive data.
   The novel multidimensional projection technique proposed in this work,
   called Part-Linear Multidimensional Projection (PLMP), has been tailored
   to handle multivariate data represented in Cartesian high-dimensional
   spaces, requiring only distance information between pairs of
   representative samples. This characteristic renders PLMP faster than
   previous methods when processing large data sets while still being
   competitive in terms of precision. Moreover, knowing the range of
   variation for data instances in the high-dimensional space, we can make
   PLMP a truly streaming data projection technique, a trait absent in
   previous methods.}},

Abstract = {{The design of cellular manufacturing systems involves many structural
   and operational issues. One of the important design steps is the
   formation of part families and machine cells (cell formation). Despite a
   large number of papers on cell formation published worldwide, only a
   handful incorporates operation sequence in layout design (intra-cell
   move calculations). We propose a solution to solve the part-family and
   machine-cell formation problem considering the within-cell layout
   problem, simultaneously. In this paper, the cellular manufacturing
   system is formulated as a multiple departures single destination
   multiple travelling salesman problem (MDmTSP) and a solution methodology
   based on simulated annealing is proposed to solve the formulated model.
   Numerical examples show that the proposed method is efficient and
   effective in finding optimal solutions. The results also indicate that
   the proposed approach performs well compared to some well-known cell
   formation methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Siricid woodwasps live in obligatory nutritional symbiosis with fungi.
   Screening of symbionts from mycetangia of emerging Xiphydria females (X.
   longicollis, X. prolongata, X. camelus, X. picta) from 28 locations and
   four tree genera yielded 1389 isolates. Each female carried a pure
   culture of a single fungus. In X. longicollis (Quercus), Daldinia
   childiae was either the only fungus or a highly dominant one in the
   samples from moderately dry oak-hornbeam (Quercus-Carpinus betula)
   forests. Females from the alluvial sites harboured D. childiae and
   Daldinia decipiens (approx. 1:1). X. camelus and X. picta (Alnus) shared
   the dominant symbiont D. decipiens whereas X. camelus from Betula
   carried D. decipiens and D. petriniae (approx. 1:1). In X. prolongata,
   D. childiae was the dominant species followed by an undescribed Daldinia
   sp. (0-20\% of isolates); D. decipiens was rare and in three females
   Hypoxylon macrocarpum was found. No symbiont occurred in a significant
   number among endophytes from the host trees. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{Radiotherapy is widely used as a radical treatment for prostate cancer,
   but curative treatments are elusive for poorly differentiated tumors
   where survival is just 15\% at 15 years. Dose escalation improves local
   response rates but is limited by tolerance in normal tissues. A
   sphingosine analogue, FTY720 (fingolimod), a drug currently in phase III
   studies for treatment of multiple sclerosis, has been found to be a
   potent apoptosis inducer in prostate cancer cells. Using in vitro and in
   vivo approaches, we analyzed the impact of FTY720 on sphingolipid
   metabolism in hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer cells and
   evaluated its potential as a radiosensitizer on cell lines and prostate
   tumor xenografts. In prostate cancer cell lines, FTY720 acted as a
   sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) inhibitor that induced prostate cancer cell
   apoptosis in a manner independent of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors.
   In contrast,. irradiation did not affect SphK1 activity in prostate
   cancer cells yet synergized with FTY720 to inhibit SphK1. In mice
   bearing orthotopic or s.c. prostate cancer tumors, we show that FTY720
   dramatically increased radiotherapeutic sensitivity, reducing tumor
   growth and metastasis without toxic side effects. Our findings suggest
   that low, well-tolerated doses of FTY720 could offer significant
   improvement to the clinical treatment of prostate cancer. Cancer Res;

Abstract = {{The aim was to determine the frequency with which thromboprophylaxis is
   prescribed, factors predicting its prescription, and the frequency of
   symptomatic venous thromboembolism in patients admitted with acute
   abdominal conditions.
   Charts of patients admitted with acute abdominal conditions that did not
   have surgery for at least 24 h following admission were audited to
   identify if thromboprophylaxis was prescribed, if it was prescribed
   appropriately, factors affecting its prescription, and the rate of
   symptomatic venous thromboembolism.
   Of 350 patients (176 females, mean age 64.9 +/- 18.6), 194 (55.4\%) were
   admitted for bowel obstruction, 113 (32.3\%) for biliary conditions, 14
   (4.0\%) for diverticulitis, 8 (2.3\%) for pancreatitis, and 21 (6.0\%)
   for other conditions. One hundred forty-two (40.6\%) underwent surgery.
   Two hundred fifty-two (72.0\%, 95\% CI 67.3-76.7\%) received
   thromboprophylaxis although only 199 (56.9\%, 95\% CI 51.7-62.1\%)
   received adequate thromboprophylaxis. Hospital site and having surgery
   were associated with prescription of thromboprophylaxis. Twelve patients
   (3.4\%, 95\% CI 1.5-4.3\%) developed symptomatic venous thromboembolism
   (nine deep venous thrombosis, three pulmonary embolism).
   Despite patients admitted with acute abdominal conditions being at high
   risk for development of symptomatic venous thromboembolism, many do not
   receive adequate thromboprophylaxis. Further work is required to
   decrease this gap in care.}},

Abstract = {{HAX1 was originally described as HS1-associated protein with a suggested
   function in receptor-mediated apoptotic and proliferative responses of
   lymphoid cells. Recent publications refer to a complex and
   multifunctional role of this protein. To investigate the in vivo
   function of HAX1 (HS1-associated protein X1) in B cells, we generated a
   Hax1-deficient mouse strain. Targeted deletion of Hax1 resulted in
   premature death around the age of 12 wk accompanied by a severe
   reduction of lymphocytes in spleen, thymus and bone marrow. In the bone
   marrow, all B-cell populations were lost comparably. In the spleen,
   B220(+) cells were reduced by almost 70\%. However, as investigated by
   adoptive transfer experiments, this impairment is not exclusively B-cell
   intrinsic and we hypothesize that a HAX1-deficient environment cannot
   sufficiently provide the essential factors for proper lymphocyte
   development, trafficking and survival. Hax1(-/-) B cells show a
   significantly reduced expression of CXCR4, which might have an influence
   on the observed defects in B-cell development.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the shallow Neossolos (Leptosols and Regosols) is limited in
   view of the small depth and rock fragments on the surface. There is a
   lack of information about the definition of the contacts between soil,
   saprolite and rock in this soil class, as well as tools that would
   facilitate the morphologic field identification. The objectives of this
   research were an evaluation of the morphology of the contact between
   soil, saprolite and rock in the Neossolos derived from the sandstones of
   the Caturrita Formation, in the central area of Rio Grande do Sul State;
   to test and to adapt the weathering classes of Pedron et al. (2009) to
   the conditions of sedimentary rock; and to verify the correlation of the
   weathering classes with penetration resistance. It was stated that the
   morphology of the saprolithic layers of the Neossolos Litolicos
   (Leptosols) and Neossolos Regoliticos (Regosols) derived from sandstone
   are similar to the same soil classes derived from volcanic rocks in the
   State, allowing the adaptation of the same weathering classes proposed
   by Pedron et al. (2009). The tests with the impact penetrometer showed
   high correlation with the weathering classes adapted in this study. The
   following contacts were identified in the studied profiles: lithic
   contact, lithic fragmentary contact, and saprolithic fragmentary
   contact. The authors suggest, considering its importance, the inclusion
   of this latter in the Brazilian soil classification system.}},

Abstract = {{We present a detailed study on the numerical effects due to staircase
   approximations of non-planar material interfaces and the importance of
   mesh alignment to such material boundaries using the discontinuous
   Galerkin finite element method. Our aim is to define clear rules that
   have to be adhered to guarantee acceptable synthetic data in seismic
   forward modelling for the cases where material contrasts occurring along
   curved interfaces are discretized with regular meshes. To this end, we
   compare results of structured staircase approximations with reference
   results obtained by unstructured triangular meshes that can be aligned
   to non-planar interfaces. We investigate different mesh spacings, wave
   frequencies, and material contrasts to cover various parameter ranges
   that allow us to measure their influence on the accuracy of the
   resulting waveforms. Our results show that acceptable synthetic results
   strongly depend on the material contrast and we give a quantitative
   estimate of the required mesh resolution in the sense of numbers of
   elements per shortest dominant wavelength to obtain satisfying
   seismograms even if the material interfaces are not respected by the
   mesh. We apply our rules to two different test cases including a
   multilayered model and a basin structure, both with non-planar
   interfaces of small and large material contrasts to confirm the validity
   of our study. We finally conclude that for moderate material contrasts
   regular meshing can be beneficial due to its simple mesh generation
   process and typically superior computational efficiency compared to
   unstructured meshes, however, the correct frequency- and
   material-dependent mesh resolution has to be chosen.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we analysed the dynamics of deforestation and burnings
   during the dry seasons from 2003 to 2008 in the Urucuu-Una Ecological
   Station (UUES) and its buffer zone, located in the Cerrado biome of the
   southwest of Piaui, a Brazil's State, based on images from the orbital
   sensors CCD/CBERS-2 and TM/Landsat-5. Two dates from each of the years
   were interpreted and analysed: one in the middle of the dry season and
   one at the end. The deforested areas were expanded through the period
   analysed and were larger in the buffer zone, suggesting a relative
   protection of the UUES. New cut-offs were predictable because of the
   early opening of roads that would become their limits. The burning scars
   were larger at the end of the dry season as a consequence of the
   management and implementation of agricultures and pastures. In 2004 and
   2007 these scars were larger probably because of the increase of dry
   phytomass that every three years is big enough to spread the fire
   originated in the anthropogenic burnings through the native vegetation.
   This scenario reaffirms the need for: stronger enforcement in order to
   stop anthropisation in the UUES and a management plan, absent for this
   unit so far. These proceedings are urgent also because the UUES is
   located in one of the most preserved regions of the Cerrado and
   controversially where intense anthropisation in ongoing, which stresses
   the lack, need and urgency of biological conservation proceedings for
   the Piaui's southeastern Cerrado.}},

Abstract = {{For dietary intake assessments, one needs to know the minimum 24-hour
   recall or food record replications that are required to estimate usual
   energy and nutrient intake and to classify subjects correctly according
   to their nutrient intake. Data from two different studies on dietary
   intake that were carried out with 300 adults and 169 adolescents in the
   Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan area, Brazil, were analyzed. To estimate the
   number of replications two methods were applied: one based on the
   variances ratio, the other based on the within-subject variance alone.
   The most important results found were the requirement for 14
   replications for boys and men, 15 for girls, and 23 for women in order
   to estimate energy intake with a precision of 90\%. Also four
   replications for boys and seven for men, girls and women are required to
   classify individuals' energy intake with a correlation coefficient of
   0.9. Due to the within variance in food intake, a larger number of
   replications is required to obtain estimates of usual intakes than is
   needed to classify subjects according to levels of dietary intake.}},

Abstract = {{Most dark fermentation (DF) studies had resorted to above ambient
   temperatures to maximize hydrogen yield without due consideration of the
   net energy gain In this study literature data on fermentative hydrogen
   production from glucose sucrose and organic wastes were compiled to
   evaluate the benefit of higher fermentation temperatures in terms of net
   energy gain This evaluation showed that the improvement in hydrogen
   yield at higher temperatures is not justified as the net energy gain not
   only declined with increase of temperature but also was mostly negative
   when the fermentation temperature exceeded 25 C To maximize the net
   energy gain of DF the following two options for recovering additional
   energy from the end products and to determine the optimal fermentation
   temperature were evaluated methane production via anaerobic digestion
   (AD) and direct electricity production via microbial fuel cells (MFC)
   Based on net energy gain it is concluded that DF has to be operated at
   near ambient temperatures for the net energy gain to be positive and DF
   + MFC can result in higher net energy gain at any temperature than DF or
   DF + AD (C) 2010 Professor T Nejat Veziroglu Published by Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{Actinorhizal symbioses are mutualistic interactions between plants and
   the soil bacteria Frankia that lead to the formation of nitrogen-fixing
   root nodules. Little is known about the signaling mechanisms controlling
   the different steps of the establishment of the symbiosis. The plant
   hormone auxin has been suggested to play a role. Here we report that
   auxin accumulates within Frankia-infected cells in actinorhizal nodules
   of Casuarina glauca. Using a combination of computational modeling and
   experimental approaches, we establish that this localized auxin
   accumulation is driven by the cell-specific expression of auxin
   transporters and by Frankia auxin biosynthesis in planta. Our results
   indicate that the plant actively restricts auxin accumulation to
   Frankia-infected cells during the symbiotic interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   To review the recent literature on the prognostic value of biomarkers of
   liver fibrosis and impaired liver function in patients with chronic
   hepatitis C with or without HIV coinfection.
   Recent findings
   A combination of standard blood tests seems to be useful in identifying
   patients at risk of liver-related complications. Findings from studies
   investigating the validity of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
   (MELD) score in HIV-infected liver transplant candidates are
   conflicting. Two large studies of HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected
   patients have shown that plasma levels of the fibrosis marker hyaluronic
   acid are a strong predictor of clinical complications. A smaller study
   found hyaluronic acid and two other fibrosis tests, aspartate
   aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fib-4, to be
   independent predictors of mortality when included in models with the
   MELD or the Child-Pugh-Turcotte scores.
   Summary
   Although the data are still limited, recent findings from large studies
   of the prognostic ability of fibrosis markers in hepatitis C patients
   provides hope that fibrosis markers, together with other noninvasive
   methods, one day, will replace liver biopsy as the gold standard for the
   prognostic evaluation of liver disease. The MELD score, and other
   prognostic factors, need further evaluation in HIV/ HCV coinfected
   patients with end-stage liver disease.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was conducted to study the in-plane shear
   behavior of masonry panels strengthened with near-surface mounted (NSM)
   carbon fiber-reinforced polymer strips (CFRP). As part of the study four
   unreinforced masonry panels and seven strengthened panels were tested in
   diagonal tension/shear. Different reinforcement orientations were used
   including vertical, horizontal, and a combination of both. The effect of
   nonsymmetric reinforcement was also studied. The results of these tests
   are presented in this paper, and include the load-displacement
   behaviors, crack patterns, failure modes, and FRP strains. The results
   showed that the vertically aligned reinforcement was the most effective,
   with significant increases in strength and ductility observed. The dowel
   strength of the vertical reinforcement did not likely contribute
   significantly to the shear resistance of the masonry. Instead, it was
   likely that the vertical reinforcement acted in tension to restrain
   shear induced dilation and restrain sliding. In some panels cracking
   adjacent to the FRP strip, through the panel thickness was observed.
   This type of cracking reduced the bond between one side of the FRP strip
   and the masonry, and led to premature debonding. A comparison of the
   test results with the results of other tests from the literature is also
   presented in this paper.}},

Title = {{Effects of Pentoxifylline on Liver Regeneration A Double-Blinded,

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate the effects of pentoxifylline (PTX) on liver
   regeneration in patients undergoing major liver resection.
   Background: Recent experimental data suggest that PTX, a tumor necrosis
   factor (TNF) alpha inhibitor, enhances liver regeneration and reduces
   ischemic injury through activation of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling
   pathway. However, the clinical impact of PTX in patients undergoing
   major liver surgery is unknown.
   Methods: One hundred one consecutive noncirrhotic patients undergoing
   major liver surgery with inflow occlusion were included in a
   double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) at a single tertiary
   care center (2006-2009). Fifty-one patients received intravenous
   administration of PTX starting 12 hours before and ending 72 hours after
   surgery, whereas 50 control patients received a placebo infusion.
   Primary endpoint was liver regeneration as assessed by three-dimensional
   volumetry based on magnetic resonance (MR) tomography at postoperative
   day 8 compared with preoperative images. Secondary endpoints were
   transaminases, cytokines, and postoperative complications.
   Results: Both groups were comparable regarding demographics, risk score,
   preoperative laboratory tests, and type and extent of liver resection.
   Treatment with PTX resulted in significantly better volume regeneration
   for small remnant livers {[}remnant liver to body weight (RLBW) ratio <=
   1.2\%], whereas no beneficial effect was observed for RLBW ratio of more
   than 1.2\%. There was a 3.6-fold stronger induction of IL-6 mRNA for the
   PTX group (P < 0.001). Postoperative alanine aminotransferase (AST)
   levels were significantly decreased for the PTX group on the second
   postoperative day (442 vs 585 U/L, P = 0.025). No significant benefit
   could be identified regarding the number and severity of postoperative
   complications and median ICU (1 vs 1 day) and hospital stay (10 vs 10
   days). However, the PTX group had significantly more drug-related
   adverse events (23 vs 8, P = 0.007).
   Conclusions: This is the first RCT evaluating the effects of PTX on
   liver regeneration after major liver resection. The study demonstrates
   beneficial effects of PTX on regeneration of small remnant livers (RLBW
   ratio <= 1.2\%) that seems to be mediated by IL-6.}},

Abstract = {{Low iron absorption from common beans might contribute to iron
   deficiency in countries where beans are a staple food. High levels of
   phytic acid (PA) and polyphenols (PP) inhibit iron absorption; however,
   the effect of bean PP on iron absorption in humans has not been
   demonstrated and, with respect to variety selection, the relative
   importance of PP and PA is unclear. To evaluate the influence of bean PP
   relative to PA on iron absorption in humans, 6 stable iron isotope
   absorption studies were conducted in women (16 or 17 per study). Bean PP
   (20, 50, and 200 mg) were added in studies 1 3 as red bean hulls to a
   bread meal. Studies 4 6 investigated the influence on iron absorption of
   PP removal and dephytinization of whole red bean porridge and PP removal
   from dephytinized porridge. Iron absorption was lowered by 14\% with 50
   mg PP (P < 0.05) and by 45\% with 200 mg PP (P < 0.001). The mean iron
   absorption from whole bean porridge was 2.5\%. PP and PA removal
   increased absorption 2.6-fold (P < 0.001) and removal of PP from
   dephytinized porridge doubled absorption (P < 0.001). Between-study
   comparisons indicated that dephytinization did not increase iron
   absorption in the presence of PP, but in their absence, absorption
   increased 3.4-fold (P < 0.001). These data suggest that in countries
   where beans are a staple food, PP and PA concentrations should be
   considered when selecting bean varieties for human consumption. Lowering
   only one inhibitor will have a modest influence on iron absorption. J.

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of the aging human population highlights the need for
   laboratory animal models to study the basic biologic processes of aging
   and susceptibility to disease, drugs, and environmental pollutants
   Methods are needed to evaluate the health of aging animals over time,
   particularly methods for efficiently monitoring large research colonies
   Here we describe an observational assessment method that scores
   appearance, posture, mobility, and muscle tone on a 5-point scale that
   can be completed in about 1 min A score of 1 indicates no deterioration,
   whereas a score of 5 indicates severe deterioration Tests were applied
   to male Brown Norway rats between 12 and 36 mo of age (n = 32) The rats
   were participating concurrently in experiments on the behavioral effects
   of intermittent exposure (approximately every 4 mo) to short-acting
   environmental chemicals Results demonstrated that aging-related signs of
   deterioration did not appear before 18 mo of age Assessment scores and
   variability then increased with age Body weights increased until
   approximately 24 mo, then remained stable, but decreased after 31 mo for
   the few remaining rats The incidence of death increased slightly from 20
   to 28 mo of age and then rose sharply, median survival age was
   approximately 30 mo, with a maximum of 36 mo The results indicate that
   our observational assessment method supports efficient monitoring of the
   health of aging rats and may be useful in studies on susceptibility to
   diseases, drugs, and toxicants during old age}},

Abstract = {{Background. The goal of the present study was to analyze associations
   between depression and mortality of cancer patients and to test whether
   these associations would vary by study characteristics.
   Method. Meta-analysis was used for integrating the results of 105
   samples derived from 76 prospective studies.
   Results. Depression diagnosis and higher levels of depressive symptoms
   predicted elevated mortality. This was true in studies that assessed
   depression before cancer diagnosis as well as in studies that assessed
   depression following cancer diagnosis. Associations between depression
   and mortality persisted after controlling for confounding medical
   variables. The depression-mortality association was weaker in studies
   that had longer intervals between assessments of depression and
   mortality, in younger samples and in studies that used the Beck
   Depression Inventory as compared with other depression scales.
   Conclusions. Screening for depression should be routinely conducted in
   the cancer treatment setting. Referrals to mental health specialists
   should be considered. Research is needed on whether the treatment of
   depression could, beyond enhancing quality of life, extend survival of
   depressed cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for the rapid, smooth turn-on of a transducer is described.
   The method is based on a previously described technique {[}J. C.
   Piquette, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 92, 1203-1213 (1992)]. In the previous
   method, transducer output amplitude is severely reduced compared to that
   obtained when driving the transducer using a standard gated sine due to
   the presence of a ramp component in the transient-suppressing voltage
   waveform. In the present work, approximate methods that eliminate the
   ramp component are described. Eliminating the ramp component results in
   significantly greater output amplitude, although the level of transient
   suppression that is achieved is not as good as that seen when using the
   exact transient-suppressing drive. Nonetheless, the smoothness (i.e.,
   lack of spikes) in the transducer response is not compromised by the
   approximations. {[}DOI: 10.1121/1.3490855]}},

Abstract = {{Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is prototypic autoimmune disease
   characterized by the production of autoantibodies to DNA among other
   nuclear molecules. These antibodies can form immune complexes that
   promote pathogenesis by stimulating cytokine production and depositing
   in the kidney to instigate nephritis. The antigens that form these
   complexes arise from the blood nucleome, a pool of circulating
   macromolecules comprised of DNA, RNA and nuclear proteins released from
   cells. Cell death is a major source of these molecules, releasing DNA in
   a process that can be modeled in mice by the administration of cells
   killed ex vivo. In the mouse model, the appearance of blood DNA requires
   macrophages and differs between males and females. This finding raises
   the possibility that augmented levels of extracellular DNA and other
   nuclear antigens can contribute to the increased frequency of SLE in
   females. Extracellular DNA can occur in both a soluble and particulate
   form, with microparticles generated in vitro displaying antigenically
   active DNA. Together, these findings suggest that cell death is an
   important event in lupus pathogenesis and can provide a supply of blood
   DNA essential for immune complex formation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   density-functional theory calculations in the generalized gradient
   approximation First-principles calculations are also employed to obtain
   the Fe surface stress used in the Peierls-Nabarro model to account for
   the strain dependence of the surface energy It is found that the

   sectoral structure of the economy is constant as the higher resource
   dependency in resource-intensive sectors is compensated by enhanced
   research activities. Resource taxes have no impact on dynamics except
   when the tax rate varies over time. Research subsidies and the sectoral
   provision of productivity-enhancing public goods raise growth and
   provide an effective tool for structural policy.On analyse la dynamique

Abstract = {{We recently showed that arachidonic acid (AA) triggers calcium signals
   in endothelial cells derived from human breast carcinoma (B-TEC). In
   particular, AA-dependent Ca2+ entry is involved in the early steps of
   tumor angiogenesis in vitro. Here, we investigated the multiple roles of
   the nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathways in
   AA-mediated Ca2+ signaling in the same cells. B-TEC stimulation with 5
   mu mol/L AA resulted in endothelial NO synthase (NOS) phosphorylation at
   Ser(1177), and NO release was measured with the fluorescent NO-sensitive
   probe DAR4M-AM. PKA inhibition by the use of the membrane-permeable PKA
   inhibitory peptide myristoylated PKI14-22 completely prevented both
   AA-and NO-induced calcium entry and abolished B-TEC migration promoted
   by AA. AA-dependent calcium entry and cell migration were significantly
   affected by both the NOS inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and
   the NO scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide,
   suggesting that NO release is functionally involved in the signaling
   dependent on AA. Moreover, pretreatment with carboxyamidotriazole, an
   antiangiogenic compound that interferes with agonist-activated calcium
   entry, prevented AA-dependent B-TEC motility. Interestingly, even in the
   absence of AA, enhancement of the cyclic AMP/PKA pathway with the
   adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin evoked a calcium entry dependent on
   NOS recruitment and NO release. The functional relevance of AA-induced
   calcium entry could be restricted to tumor-derived endothelial cells
   (EC) because AA evoked a smaller calcium entry in normal human
   microvascular ECs compared with B-TECs, and even more importantly, it
   was unable to promote cell motility in wound healing assay. This
   evidence opens an intriguing opportunity for differential pharmacologic
   treatment between normal and tumor-derived human ECs. Mol Cancer Res;

Title = {{Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Biofuels' Indirect Land Use Change Are
   Uncertain but May Be Much Greater than Previously Estimated}},

Abstract = {{The life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions induced by increased
   biofuel consumption are highly uncertain: individual estimates vary from
   each other and each has a wide intrinsic error band. Using a
   reduced-form model, we estimated that the bounding range for emissions
   from indirect land-use change (ILUC) from US corn ethanol expansion was
   10 to 340 g CO2 MJ(-1). Considering various probability distributions to
   model parameters, the broadest 95\% central interval, i.e., between the
   2.5 and 97.5\%ile values, ranged from 21 to 142 g CO(2)e MJ(-1) ILUC
   emissions from US corn ethanol expansion thus range from small, but not
   negligible, to several times greater than the life cycle emissions of
   gasoline. The ILUC emissions estimates of 30 g CO2 MJ(-1) for the
   California Air Resources Board and 34 g CO(2)e MJ(-1) by USEPA (for
   2022) are at the low end of the plausible range. The lack of data and
   understanding (epistemic uncertainty) prevents convergence of judgment
   on a central value for ILUC emissions. The complexity of the global
   system being modeled suggests that this range is unlikely to narrow
   substantially in the near future. Fuel policies that require narrow
   bounds around point estimates of life cycle GHG emissions are thus
   incompatible with current and anticipated modeling capabilities.
   Alternative policies that address the risks associated with uncertainty
   are more likely to achieve GHG reductions.}},

Abstract = {{Kinases from the Trk family are important for the regulation of
   development and for the correct functioning of the neural system.
   Deregulation (over-expression) of Trks leads to survival and
   proliferation of different human cancers. Therefore, development of
   inhibitors for Trks that can disrupt the signal pathway of Irks could
   lead to cure against cancer as well as to nociception. Homology models
   built by YASARA have been used as targets for docking various libraries
   of known Trk inhibitors. The receptor plasticity was compensated with
   induced fit docking and/or ensemble docking. It was determined that
   DFG-in and DFG-out conformational states of TrkB kinase must be taken
   into account in order to get more reasonable relationships between the
   docking score and the activity measured by pIC(50) for the corresponding
   ligands. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microarray-based sandwich immunoassays can simultaneously detect dozens
   of proteins. However, their use in quantifying large numbers of proteins
   is hampered by cross-reactivity and incompatibilities caused by the
   immunoassays themselves. Sequential multiplex analyte capturing
   addresses these problems by repeatedly probing the same sample with
   different sets of antibodycoated, magnetic suspension bead arrays. As a
   miniaturized immunoassay format, suspension bead array-based assays
   fulfill the criteria of the ambient analyte theory, and our experiments
   reveal that the analyte concentrations are not significantly changed.
   The value of sequential multiplex analyte capturing was demonstrated by
   probing tumor cell line lysates for the abundance of seven different
   receptor tyrosine kinases and their degree of phosphorylation and by
   measuring the complex phosphorylation pattern of the epidermal growth
   factor receptor in the same sample from the same cavity. Molecular \&

   changes in the rheological parameters in each zone of the reactor; the
   flow field is recomputed if a significant change in any of the
   properties is detected. The details of the framework are presented and

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to analyze how social class markers are
   constructed in the discourse on gated communities in a postsocialist
   urban context. The case of Poland is used as an example of a
   post-Communist country where the number of gated communities is
   increasing rapidly in urban areas. The material of study consists of 50
   articles published in the largest national newspaper. This article
   argues that the discourse on gated communities is constituted by and
   constitutes class divisions and social class markers prevalent in the
   country since the fall of Communism. The ``new{''} capitalistic system
   with its inherent social divisions is described as creating demands for
   ``new{''} forms of housing where gates function as separators,
   protectors, and class identifiers. Residential differentiation is a
   reality in Polish society, and private space has become a symbol of
   exclusivity and spread throughout the country along with the popularity
   of gated forms of housing.}},

Abstract = {{A method for estimating the maximum impurity gas pressure averaged over
   the specimen cross section in the combustion wave for different cross
   sections of a long specimen is proposed. The impurity gas pressure in a

   induces cross-sectional fracture of the specimen enclosed into a shell
   and certain displacement along the shell of the pressed matter portion
   located ahead of the combustion wave front at the instant of fracture
   initiation. Special composite specimens are used to ensure constant
   conditions of impurity gas removal from the volume and to model the SHS
   process and associated impurity degassing in the case of long (L/d gamma
   1) cylindrical specimens under the condition L = const. The model
   mixtures are chosen to be typical compositions for SHS: Ti+C and Ti +

   METHODS Using US Department of Veterans Affairs electronic medical
   records veterans with stomas were surveyed using the City of Hope
   Quality of Life Ostomy questionnaire Focus groups were conducted
   segregated by type of stoma (ileostomy vs colostomy) and quality-of life
   score (high vs low) Qualitative analysis was performed on the basis of
   the City of Hope Quality of Life for Ostomates format of health related
   quality of life (physical psychological social and spiritual) The
   findings of the colostomy focus groups are reported
   RESULTS Two new domains emerged colostomy specific and health care
   specific The most common domains discussed were colostomy specific,
   psychological, and social The most frequently discussed
   colostomy-specific theme was effective and ineffective solutions to
   colostomy care Family and spousal relationships were the main theme from
   the psychological category The predominant social issue was sexual

Abstract = {{Contemporary U.S. schools and professional reforms call for teachers to
   have greater disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge for teaching school
   subjects. Reform efforts leave unexamined the rules and standards of
   ``reason{''} that historically order school subjects. The notion of
   alchemy provides an analytic ``tool{''} to consider the processes of
   translation from disciplinary knowledge to teaching practices. It is
   argued that the intellectual tools of school pedagogies have little to
   do with the disciplinary fields. The psychological strategies for
   defining school subjects historically are strategies of governing who
   the child is and should be. There is an ironic quality to this alchemy
   of schooling subjects. Efforts to increase student participation may
   narrow the possibilities of reflection and action. An alternative style
   for thinking about the translation of disciplinary fields into the
   curriculum and ``methods{''} of school subjects is discussed, drawing on
   studies of science, technology, and mathematics.}},

Abstract = {{This short review deals with our investigations in neuroendocrine tumors
   (NETs) with antibodies against defined epitopes of chromogranins (Cgs) A
   and B and secretogranins (Sgs) II and III. The immunohistochemical
   expression of different epitopes of the granin family of proteins varies
   in NE cells in normal human endocrine and non-endocrine organs and in
   NETs, suggesting post-translational processing. In most NETs one or more
   epitopes of the granins were lacking, but variations in the expression
   pattern occurred both in benign and malignant NETs. A few epitopes
   displayed patterns that may be valuable in differentiating between
   benign and malignant NET types, e.g., well-differentiated NET types
   expressed more CgA epitopes than the poorly differentiated ones and
   C-terminal secretoneurin visualized a cell type related to malignancy in
   pheochromocytomas. Plasma concentrations of different epitopes of CgA
   and CgB varied. In patients suffering from carcinoid tumors or endocrine
   pancreatic tumors the highest concentrations were found with epitopes
   from the mid-portion of CgA. For CgB the highest plasma concentrations
   were recorded for the epitope 439-451. Measurements of SgII showed that
   patients with endocrine pancreatic tumors had higher concentrations than
   patients with carcinoid tumors or pheochromocytomas. SgIII was not
   detectable in patients with NETs.}},

Abstract = {{Methods. One hundred and seventy-one subjects (58 AUS and 112 SA) with
   Achilles tendon pathology (ATP group) and 235 (142 AUS and 96 SA)
   asymptomatic control (CON group) subjects were genotyped for the
   selected SNPs using custom-designed Taqman assays. A chi(2)-analysis or
   Fisher's exact test was used to analyse any differences in the genotype
   and allele frequencies. Significance was accepted when P < 0.05.
   Results. There were no significant TGFB1 rs1800469 genotype (P = 0.491)
   or allele (P = 0.400) frequency differences between the ATP and CON
   groups. The TT genotype of the GDF5 rs143383 variant was significantly
   over-represented in the ATP group of the AUS cohort {[}P = 0.011; odds
   ratio (OR) = 2.24; 95\% CI 1.21, 4.16], and when the AUS and SA cohorts
   were combined (P = 0.004; OR = 1.82; 95\% CI 1.23, 2.74).
   Conclusions. In conclusion, this study suggests that individuals with a
   TT genotype of the functional GDF5 rs143383 variant have twice the risk
   of developing ATP. This finding highlights a role of GDF-5 in the
   pathogenesis of Achilles tendon pathology.}},

   basic equations of the problem are constructed and linearized by using
   the quantum magnetohydrodynamic model. The contributions of Hall current
   and viscosity of the medium are incorporated into the present analysis
   because of their astrophysical importance. The general dispersion
   relation is obtained using the normal mode analysis technique, which is
   reduced for both the transverse and the longitudinal mode of
   propagation. The longitudinal mode is found to be modified by Hall
   current, while the transverse mode is unaffected by the presence of the
   Hall parameter. The Jeans criterion of instability is obtained, which is
   modified by Alfven velocity and quantum corrections but is unaffected by
   the presence of the Hall parameter and viscosity. The longitudinal mode
   is found to be modified by Alfven speed and the Hall parameter and is
   independent of quantum corrections. Viscosity, magnetic field and
   quantum corrections all have a stabilizing influence on the growth rate
   of the Jeans instability.}},

Abstract = {{Periodontal disease is an inflammatory disease process resulting from
   the interaction of a bacterial attack and host inflammatory response.
   Arrays of molecules are considered to mediate the inflammatory response
   at one time or another, among these are free radicals and reactive
   oxygen species (ROS). Periodontal pathogens can induce ROS
   overproduction and thus may cause collagen and periodontal cell
   breakdown. When ROS are scavenged by antioxidants, there can be a
   reduction of collagen degradation. Ubiquinol (reduced form coenzyme
   Q(10)) serves as an endogenous antioxidant which increases the
   concentration of CoQ(10) in the diseased gingiva and effectively
   suppresses advanced periodontal inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{In automated manufacturing systems, one of the most important issues is
   accurate detection of the tool conditions under given cutting conditions
   so that worn tools can be identified and replaced in time. In metal
   cutting as a result of the cutting motion, the surface of workpiece will
   be influenced by cutting parameters, cutting force, and vibrations, etc.
   But the effects of vibrations have been paid less attention. In the
   present paper, an investigation is presented of a tool condition
   monitoring system, which consists of a fast Fourier transform
   preprocessor for generating features from an online acousto-optic
   emission (AOE) signals to develop a database for appropriate decisions.
   A fast Fourier transform (FFT) can decompose AOE signals into different
   frequency bands in the time domain. Present work uses a laser Doppler
   vibrometer for online data acquisition and a high-speed FFT analyser
   used to process the AOE signals. The generation of the AOE signals
   directly in the cutting zone makes them very sensitive to changes in the
   cutting process due to vibrations. AOE techniques is a relatively recent
   entry into the field of tool condition monitoring. This method has also
   been widely used in the field of metal cutting to detect process changes
   like displacement due to vibration and tool wear, etc. In this research
   work the results obtained from the analysis of acousto-optic emission
   sensor employs to predict flank wear in turning of AISI 1040 steel of
   150 BHN hardness using Carbide insert and HSS tools. The correlation
   between the tool wear and AOE parameters is analyzed using the
   experimental study conducted in 16 H.P. all geared lathe. The
   encouraging results of the work pave the way for the development of a
   real-time, low-cost, and reliable tool condition monitoring system. A
   high degree of correlation is established between the results of the AOE
   signal and experimental results in identification of tool wear state.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Presence of nodal skip metastasis is an established
   prognostic factor for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Little
   is known about this form of lymphatic spread in esophageal cancer. The
   aim of this study was to assess nodal skip metastasis and its clinical
   importance for patients with cancer of the esophagus.
   Methods. Resected lymph nodes of 128 patients with esophageal cancer and
   pN1 status (adenocarcinoma, n = 67; squamous cell cancer, n = 61) were
   mapped according to the Japanese lymph-node classification for
   esophageal cancer. Skip metastases were defined as tumor-free N1 lymph
   nodes, whereas N2 through N4 lymph nodes harbor metastases.
   Results. Skip metastases were present in 26 of 128 (20\%) patients.
   There was a higher rate of skip metastasis in early tumors (39\% versus
   23\% versus 14\% for T1, T2, and T3 tumors; p = 0.032) and tumors in the
   middle and upper third of the esophagus (37\% versus 15\% for upper- and
   middle-third and lower-third tumors; p = 0.022). Patients with skip
   metastasis had a significantly better 5-year survival rate than patients
   with continuous metastasis (53\% versus 15\%; p < 0.0001). Multivariate
   analysis revealed skip metastasis as an independent prognostic factor.
   Conclusions. Skip metastasis is a common form of lymphatic spread in
   esophageal cancer, which is associated with a favorable prognosis. (Ann

Abstract = {{In retinal transplantation experiments it is hypothesized that remaining
   diseased photoreceptor cells in the host retina and inner retinal cells
   in transplants physically obstruct the development of graft-host
   neuronal contacts which are required for vision. Recently, we developed
   methods for the isolation of donor photoreceptor layers in vitro, and
   the selective removal of host photoreceptors in vivo using biodegradable
   elastomeric membranes composed of poly(glycerol-co-sebacic acid) (PGS).
   We also coated PGS membranes with electrospun nanofibers, composed of
   laminin and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), to promote attachment of
   embryonic retinal explants, allowing the resulting composites to be
   handled surgically as a single entity. Here, we report subretinal
   transplantation of these composites into adult porcine eyes. In
   hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of composite explants after 5-7
   days in vitro, excellent fusion of retinas and biomaterial membranes was
   noted, with the immature retinal components showing laminated as well as
   folded and rosetted areas. The composite grafts could be transplanted in
   all cases and, 3 months after surgery, eyes displayed clear media,
   attached retinas and the grafts located subretinally. Histological
   examination revealed that the biomaterial membrane had degraded without
   any signs of inflammation. Transplanted retinas displayed areas of
   rosettes as well as normal lamination. In most cases inner retinal
   layers were present in the grafts. Laminated areas displayed
   well-developed photoreceptors adjacent to an intact host retinal pigment
   epithelium and degeneration of the host outer nuclear layer (ONL) was
   often observed together with occasional fusion of graft and host inner
   layers. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine predictors of response to light therapy (LT) for
   seasonal affective disorder, winter version, in a clinical office
   setting for patients with a spectrum of seasonality defined by the
   Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). Method. A
   retrospective review was done of charts of 51 patients who had been
   treated with a 1-week light therapy intervention. Patient self-rated
   scales applied in a standard manner were used to measure clinical
   progress. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) with added atypical
   features was used as the primary outcome variable. Sleep patterns were
   analyzed and the effect of psychotropic medications on outcome was
   determined. Seven point scales were used to assess expected response and
   global response. The importance of having LT set up and available in an
   office setting was evaluated. Retrospective degree of disability was
   measured based on the SPAQ degree of problem. The severity of the
   depressive episode was determined based on BDI score at entry. Results.
   Seasonality (how a patient's symptoms vary as a function of the season
   of the year), degree of disability based on the SPAQ, and severity of
   depressive episode at entry based on the BDI predicted response to LT.
   Greater severity at baseline based on BDI score predicted less chance of
   attaining full remission within 7 days of treatment compared with
   patients with lower severity scores at entry on the BDI. Sleep patterns
   relative to a fixed treatment time of 7 AM did not predict LT response.
   Light therapy was effective on its own, and the results were mixed as to
   whether adding LT to an existing antidepressant medication produced
   superior results. Conclusion. Degree of seasonality can be used as a
   predictor of response to LT and may be clinically useful when suggesting
   that patients consider a trial of LT. (Journal of Psychiatric Practice

Abstract = {{Fibronectin-binding proteins A and B are multifunctional LPXTG
   staphylococcal adhesins, comprising an N-terminal region that binds
   fibrinogen and elastin, and a C-terminal domain that interacts with
   fibronectin. The C-terminal domain of fibronectin-binding protein A is
   organized into 11 tandem repeats, six of which bind the ligand with high
   affinity; other sites bind more weakly. Fibronectin-binding protein B
   has been postulated to harbor 10 rather than 11 repeats, but it contains
   the same number of high-affinity fibronectin-binding sites as
   fibronectin-binding protein A. In this study, we confirm this prediction
   and show that six of 10 sites bind with dissociation constants in the
   nanomolar range. We also found that the full-length repetitive region of
   fibronectin-binding protein B stimulated the production of a mAb (15E11)
   that binds with high affinity to an epitope shared by repeats 9 and 10
   from both adhesins. With the use of truncated fragments of repeat 9 of
   fibronectin-binding protein A, we mapped the antibody epitope to the
   N-terminal segment and the fibronectin-binding site to the C-terminal
   segment of the repeat. The distinct localization of the 15E11 epitope
   and the fibronectin-binding site suggests that the interfering effect of
   the antibody might result from steric hindrance or a conformational
   change in the structure that reduces the accessibility of fibronectin to
   its binding determinant. The epitope is well exposed on the surface of
   staphylococcal cells, as determined by genetic analyses, fluorescence
   microscopy, and flow cytometry. When incubated with cells of
   Staphylococcs aureus strains, 15E11 inhibits attachment of bacteria to
   surface-coated fibronectin by almost 70\%.}},

Abstract = {{Objective assessment of memory functioning is an important part of
   evaluation for Dementia of Alzheimer Type (DAT). The revised Picture
   Recognition Memory Test (r-PRMT) is a test for visual recognition memory
   to assess memory functioning of persons with intellectual disabilities
   (ID), specifically targeting moderate to severe ID. A pilot study was
   performed to investigate whether the r-PRMT could differentiate
   DAT-related memory decline from pre-existing poor memory functioning of
   persons with moderate to severe ID. The r-PRMT scores were compared
   between 26 participants with DAT and moderate to severe ID and 33
   controls with similar levels of ID. The results revealed that the
   controls with DS showed uniformly high scores in contrast to those with
   DAT on the r-PRMT and the score distributions of two groups were
   distinctly different with no overlap. On the other hand, the controls
   with non-DS etiologies scored much lower with a wider score spread,
   resulting in significant overlap with the score distribution of the
   participants with DAT. In conclusion, the r-PRMT may be effective in
   identifying persons with DAT among persons with moderate to severe ID
   from DS. However, the r-PRMT may result in a high false positive error
   rate in discriminating those with DAT among persons with moderate to
   severe ID from non-DS etiologies, if the judgment is based on a single
   point assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Microcrystalline silicon solar cells: effect of substrate temperature on
   cracks and their role in post-oxidation}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN PHOTOVOLTAICS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) cells can reach efficiencies up to
   typically 10\% and are usually incorporated in tandem micromorph
   devices. When cells are grown on rough substrates, ``cracks{''} can
   appear in the mu c-Si:H layers. Previous works have demonstrated that
   these cracks have mainly detrimental effects on the fill factor and
   open-circuit voltage, and act as had diodes with a high reverse
   saturation current. In this paper, we clarify the nature of the cracks,
   their role in post-oxidation processes, and indicate how their density
   can be reduced. Regular secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and local
   nano-SIMS measurements show that these cracks are prone to local
   post-oxidation and lead to apparent high oxygen content in the layer.
   Usually the number of cracks can be decreased with an appropriate
   modification of the substrate surface morphology, but then, the required
   light scattering effect is reduced due to a lower roughness. This study
   presents an alternative/complementary way to decrease the crack density
   by increasing the substrate temperature during deposition. These
   results, also obtained when performing numerical simulation of the
   growth process, are attributed to the enhanced surface diffusion of the
   adatoms at higher deposition temperature. We evaluate the cracks density
   by introducing a fast method to count cracks with good statistics over
   approximately 4000 mu m of sample cross-section. This method is proven
   to be useful to quickly visualize the impact of substrate morphology on
   the density of cracks in microcrystalline and in micromorph devices,
   which is an important issue in the manufacturing process of modules.

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this study was to summarize the results of
   language cortex mapping using electrical cortical stimulation with
   modified language tasks for Mandarin-speaking patients with epilepsy.
   Methods: Electrical currents were delivered through implanted subdural
   electrodes to six Mandarin-speaking patients before epilepsy surgery.
   The current intensities inducing any language disturbance during
   comprehension, repetition, and speech tasks were recorded, and
   individual cortical mapping was completed to guide subsequent resection,
   with the distance between mapped language sites and resected zones kept
   at a minimum of 0.5 cm. Language function was reassessed and followed up
   after surgery.
   Results: Language cortices were successfully identified in three
   patients, but demonstrated great variability in distribution. There
   seemed to be no difference in the intensity threshold that induced
   language interference. None of the six patients exhibited language
   deficits postsurgery.
   Conclusions: Electrical cortical stimulation with modified language
   tasks is valid for identification of cortices underlying Mandarin
   processing. The great variability in language cortex distribution
   enhances the necessity of individual language cortical mapping in
   epilepsy surgery. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied whether nephrotoxic drug administration sensitizes to acute
   renal failure (ARF) by administering a sub-nephrotoxic dose of
   gentamicin. This pre-treatment sensitized animals with no sign of renal
   injury to develop ARF when exposed to a second potential nephrotoxic
   drug, also given at sub-nephrotoxic doses that would be otherwise
   harmless to non-sensitized animals. We identified urinary ganglioside M2
   activator protein (GM2AP) as a biomarker of an enhanced sensitivity to
   suffer ARF following subnephrotoxic treatment with gentamicin.
   Sub-nephrotoxic gentamicin did not alter renal GM2AP gene expression or
   protein levels, determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR, western blot,
   and immunostaining, nor was its serum level modified. The origin of
   increased GM2AP in the urine is thought to be a defective tubular
   handling of this protein as a consequence of gentamicin action. Hence,
   markers of acquired sensitivity may improve the prevention of ARF by
   enhancing our capacity to monitor for this condition, in a preemptive
   manner.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of absorbing gas around the central engine of active
   galactic nuclei (AGN) is a common feature of these objects. Recent work
   has looked at the effect of the dust component of the gas, and how it
   enhances radiation pressure such that dusty gas can have a lower
   effective Eddington limit than ionized gas. In this work, we use
   multiwavelength data and X-ray spectra from the 2 Ms exposures of the
   Chandra Deep Field-North and Chandra Deep Field-South surveys to
   characterize the AGN in terms of their Eddington ratio (lambda) and
   hydrogen column density (N-H). Their distributions are then compared
   with what is predicted when considering the coupling between dust and
   gas. Our final sample consists of 234 objects from both fields, the
   largest and deepest sample of AGN for which this comparison has been
   made up to date. We find that most of the AGN in our sample tend to be
   found at low Eddington ratios (typically 10-4 < lambda < 10-1) and high
   N-H (> 1022 cm-2), with black hole masses in the range similar
   to(108-109) M-circle dot. Their distribution is in agreement with that
   expected from the enhanced radiation pressure model, avoiding the area
   where we would predict the presence of outflows. We also investigate how
   the balance between AGN radiation pressure and gravitational potential
   influences the behaviour of clouds in the Galactic bulge, and describe a
   scenario where an enhanced radiation pressure can lead to the
   Fundamental Plane of black hole/galaxy scaling relations.}},

Abstract = {{Context: There are few empirical studies in the empirical software
   engineering research community that describe software projects, at the
   level of the project, as they progress over time.
   Objective: To investigate how to coherently represent a large volume of
   qualitative and quantitative data on a range of project-level attributes
   as those attributes change over time.
   Method: Develop a modelling technique, multi-dimensional timelines
   (MDTs) and undertake a preliminary appraisal of the technique using
   examples from a longitudinal case study of a project at IBM Hursley
   Park.
   Results: MDTs can represent project-level attributes as they change over
   time, provided these attributes, and the empirical data about them, can
   be located in time (an analytical requirement) and can be represented in
   terms of the simple geometrical structures of points, lines and planes
   (a graphical requirement). Changes in attributes are documented at the
   point in time at which the change occurs. There are a number of ways in
   which an attribute can be represented on the MDT: as a quantitative time
   series, as an event, as an event with label containing complex
   qualitative information, or as a schedule. The MDT technique is
   currently not capable of representing relationships between different
   attributes e.g. a causal relationship.
   Conclusion: The initial appraisal of MDTs is encouraging, but further
   work is needed on the development of the MDT technique and on its
   evaluation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a model for a power market with the characteristics of the

   system operator (SO) with a vast authority to define the dispatch of the

   up by the two largest power generators is an anti-competitive project.
   Considering four investment technologies for power generation, namely,
   hydro, coal, diesel, and an advantageous hydro technology which can only
   be built in a large scale (HidroAysen) for the joint venture case, we
   use an oligopolistic Cournot model and a Benevolent Social Planner, both
   calibrated to the Chilean power industry, in order to assess the
   efficiency of alternative investment strategies and conditions whether
   the HidroAysen joint venture project can be barred to be judged as
   anti-competitive. Results suggest that the joint venture is an efficient
   investment and there is a pro-competitive behaviour on the part of the

Abstract = {{Metals (mainly nickel, chrome and cobalt) released from metallic
   implants may become potential allergens under the effect of corrosion in
   contact with body fluids. It would appear that these reactions are very
   rare, as opposed to skin contact allergies to these same metals, and
   difficult to diagnose. A patient presenting with signs of intolerance to
   a metallic implant will often only recover once the suspected material
   is removed (whenever possible), which subsequently makes it possible to
   confirm the involvement of hypersensitivity to one of the implant's
   components (revealed though positive skin tests) during these incidents,
   insofar as it concerns the skin. Moreover, there is no consensus
   attitude in France on the action to be taken in the event of a metallic
   implant fitted in a patient with prior sensitization to one of the
   metals used. Prospective studies with tests before and after the fitting
   of metallic implants are necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Identification of most probable ranges of biodynamic responses of the
   human body exposed to whole-body vibration is essential for developing
   effective integrated human-machine system design tools, improved
   vibration mitigation devices and frequency-weighting for exposure
   assessment. The international standard, ISO-5982 (2001), defines such
   ranges for very limited conditions, namely for body seated without a
   back support and exposed to vertical vibration. The reported data on
   biodynamic responses of the seated and standing human body exposed to
   whole-body vibration along different directions and the associated
   experimental conditions are systematically reviewed in an attempt to
   identify datasets that are likely to represent comparable and practical
   postural and exposure conditions. Syntheses of datasets, selected on the
   basis of a set of criterion, are performed to identify the most probable
   ranges of biodynamic responses of the human body to whole-body
   vibration. These include the driving-point biodynamic responses of the
   body seated with and without a back support while exposed to fore-aft,
   lateral and vertical vibration and those of the standing body to
   vertical vibration, and seat-to-head vibration transmissibility of the
   seated body. The proposed ranges are expected to serve as reasonable
   target functions in various applications involving coupled human-system
   dynamics in the design process, and potentially for developing better
   frequency-weightings for exposure assessments.
   Relevance to the industry: Identification of most probable biodynamic
   responses of the seated and standing human body exposed to whole-body
   vibration is essential for developing anthropodynamic manikins,
   integrated human-machine system design tools for improved vibration
   mitigation devices and frequency-weighting for exposure assessment. This
   study derives ranges of biodynamic responses of the body seated with and
   without the back support, and those of the standing body. The ranges
   would serve as the target response functions for: (i) designs of
   anthropodynamic manikins for assessment of vibration isolation
   effectiveness of coupled seat-occupant system; (ii) development of human
   body models, which are vital for quantifying the vibration-induced

Abstract = {{The present work deals with the evaluation of a combustion model that
   has been developed in order to simulate the power cycle of hydrogen
   spark ignition engines The motivation for the development of such a
   model is to obtain a simple combustion model with few calibration
   constants applicable to a wide range of engine configurations
   incorporated in an in house CFD code using the RNG k-epsilon turbulence
   model The calculated cylinder pressure traces gross heat release rate
   diagrams and exhaust nitric oxide (NO) emissions are compared with the
   corresponding measured ones at various engine loads The engine used is a
   Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine fueled with hydrogen operating at
   a constant engine speed of 600 rpm This model is composed of various sub
   models used for the simulation of combustion of conventional fuels in SI
   engines it has been adjusted in the current study specifically for
   hydrogen combustion The basic sub model incorporated for the calculation
   of the reaction rates is the characteristic conversion time scale method
   meaning that a time scale is used depending on the laminar conversion
   time and the turbulent mixing time, which dictates to what extent the
   combustible gas has reached its chemical equilibrium during a predefined
   time step Also the laminar and turbulent combustion velocity is used to
   track the flame development within the combustion chamber, using two
   correlations for the laminar flame speed and the Zimont/Lipatnikov
   approach for the modeling of the turbulent flame speed whereas the (NO)
   emissions are calculated according to the Zeldovich mechanism From the
   evaluation conducted it is revealed that by using the developed hydrogen
   combustion model and after adjustment of the unique model calibration
   constant, there is an adequate agreement with measured data (regarding
   performance and emissions) for the investigated conditions However there
   are a few more issues to be resolved dealing mainly with the ignition
   process and the applicability of a reliable set of constants for the
   emission calculations (C) 2010 Professor T Nejat Veziroglu Published by

Abstract = {{The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its impact on survival
   have not been widely studied in the Australian liver transplant (OLT)
   population. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of
   CKD stages at various time points, calculate the cumulative incidence of
   progression to severe CKD, and study the impact of CKD stages on patient
   survival and risk factors for severe CKD in a single-center post-OLT
   population. We studied retrospectively 130 patients who underwent OLT in
   South Australia with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up from 1992 to
   2008. CKD was staged according to Kidney Diseases Outcome Quality
   Initiative Guidelines. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated
   using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Multiple pre-
   and post-OLT variables were examined for their association with severe
   CKD. Log-rank tests and Cox regression analysis were performed to
   evaluate the survival data. The cumulative incidences of severe CKD
   (stages 4 and 5) at 2, 5, and 15 years were 3.8\%, 12.7\%, and 14.8\%,
   respectively. Severe CKD was associated with an increased mortality
   (hazard ratio 6.5; 95\% confidence interval = 2.5-17.0; P < .001). Mild
   and moderate CKD stages were not associated with increased mortality.
   Risk factors for severe CKD were: female gender, hepatitis C infection,
   pre-OLT diabetes, acute renal failure post-OLT, and low 1-year GFR. Mild
   and moderate CKD are common post-OLT. The development of severe CKD,
   which can be predicted early in the post-OLT period, is strongly
   associated with an increased mortality rate.}},

   luciferase-expression vectors to determine basal and Tat-induced
   transcriptional activities in the presence and absence of PMA
   stimulation. A high number (37.8\%) of recombinants at LTR/PR regions
   were identified. All HIV-1 promoters presented low basal transcriptional
   activity that was nevertheless induced by Tat and PMA. LTR activity was
   similar across the majority of HIV-1 variants in response to Tat and
   cell activation. Only subtype C and CRF01\_AE LTRs presented higher
   basal and induced-PMA transcription activities than HXB2 clade B
   promoter. No basal or Tat/PMA induced activity was found in those
   promoters presenting G to A hypermutation compared to the wild type
   promoter activities. G to A hypermutation at some important
   transcription binding-factor sites within LTR compromised the activity
   of the viral promoter, decreasing the in vitro viral transcription of
   the luciferase gene. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi is a complex disease that is
   endemic and an important problem in public health in Latin America. The
   T. cruzi parasite is classified into six discrete taxonomic units (DTUs)
   based on the recently proposed nomenclature (TcI, TcII, TcIII, TcIV, TcV
   and TcVI). The discovery of genetic variability within TcI showed the
   presence of five genotypes (Ia, Ib, Ic, Id and Ie) related to the
   transmission cycle of Chagas disease. In Colombia, TcI is more prevalent
   but TcII has also been reported, as has mixed infection by both TcI and
   TcII in the same Chagasic patient. The objectives of this study were to
   determine the T. cruzi DTUs that are circulating in Colombian chronic
   Chagasic patients and to obtain more information about the molecular
   epidemiology of Chagas disease in Colombia. We also assessed the
   presence of electrocardiographic, radiologic and echocardiographic
   abnormalities with the purpose of correlating T. cruzi genetic
   variability and cardiac disease. Molecular characterization was
   performed in Colombian adult chronic Chagasic patients based on the
   intergenic region of the mini-exon gene, the 24S alpha and 18S regions
   of rDNA and the variable region of satellite DNA, whereby the presence
   of T. cruzi I, II, III and IV was detected. In our population, mixed
   infections also occurred, with TcI-TcII, TcI-TcIII and TcI-TcIV, as well
   as the existence of the TcI genotypes showing the presence of genotypes
   Ia and Id. Patients infected with TcI demonstrated a higher prevalence
   of cardiac alterations than those infected with TcII. These results
   corroborate the predominance of TcI in Colombia and show the first
   report of TcIII and TcIV in Colombian Chagasic patients. Findings also
   indicate that Chagas cardiomyopathy manifestations are more correlated
   with TcI than with TcII in Colombia.}},

Abstract = {{A phase I study was performed to determine the maximally tolerated dose
   of carboplatin, ifosfamide, and docetaxel in advanced head and neck
   cancers.
   Carboplatin (week 1) was administered with weekly docetaxel and
   ifosfamide for 3 weeks in an every 4-week cycle. Restaging was done
   after two cycles, while dose level escalation was done in cohorts of
   three patients.
   Fifteen patients (recurrent/metastatic disease, n = 8; bulky locally
   advanced disease, n = 7) were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were
   observed. Toxicities included grade 3 neutropenia and anemia (n = 2,
   each), and grade 2 thrombocytopenia (n = 3). The final level of
   carboplatin AUC = 6 (week 1) with docetaxel 30 mg/m(2) per week and
   ifosfamide 1,000 mg/m(2) per week was chosen for further evaluation.
   This novel regimen of carboplatin with weekly docetaxel and ifosfamide
   has a favorable toxicity profile and is active in this setting. Phase II
   study results are awaited.}},

Abstract = {{A surface micromachining technique for the release of high
   length-to-thickness aspect ratio (800:1) bridge structures is presented.
   During a timed etch release, the remaining side wall geometry of the
   sacrificial layer provides intrinsic support for the structural layer.
   The micromachining process itself is an equipment limited procedure in
   which the wet etchant for the sacrificial layer is replaced in solution
   (i.e., in situ) with a supportive photoresist layer. Once in solid form,
   the photoresist is removed via ashing in an oxygen plasma. This
   combination of controlling the sidewall etch profile of the sacrificial
   layer and its removal technique results in the successful release of
   bridge structures, which are 4000 mu m long and 5 mu m thick, with a 2
   mu m suspension gap. (C) 2010 American Vacuum Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) were developed for
   the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding affinity of non-fluorinated
   and fluorinated cis and trans 3,4',5-substituted resveratrol
   derivatives. Lower quality QSAR fits were found when all compounds were
   modeled together, in contrast to strong correlations with Hammett
   substituent constants and atomic charges for separate
   non-fluorinated/fluorinated and cis/trans groupings. The collective
   findings suggest little promise in developing new resveratrol
   derivatives with significantly higher AhR binding affinity beyond the
   range already mapped by the available experimental data sets. The
   results also suggest that future QSAR searches for AhR binding affinity
   among resveratrol derivatives will likely need to proceed in a more
   constrained class-by-class fashion owing to the potentially different
   mechanistic implications from changes in the types/positions of aromatic
   substitution and the cis/trans geometrical isomerism. The antioxidant
   activity of hydroxystilbenes can be accurately modeled using
   high-quality empirical univariate relationships with various molecular
   descriptors. In comparison, correlations between theoretical bond
   dissociation enthalpies and ionization energies of the molecular and
   dissociated forms yielded lower quality QSAR fits with the antioxidant
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Salt marshes show a characteristic zonation of species distribution,
   which is correlated with marsh elevation. Radiation intensity and
   photoperiod change throughout the tidal frame. Photosynthetic response
   to light regime, 90-2450 mu mol/(m(2) s), was determined in the
   laboratory for four closely related halophytic taxa of the genus
   Sarcocornia (Chenopodiaceae), which inhabit different positions in the
   tidal frame. Sarcocornia fruticosa, which germinates below vegetation
   cover and is found at high levels in the tidal frame, had the lowest
   maximum net photosynthetic rate and stomata conductance values. The two
   S. perennis subspecies demonstrated intermediate maximum net
   photosynthetic rates but S. perennis ssp. alpini reached light
   saturation point at higher light intensities. S. perennis ssp. perennis,
   found in the lowest elevations of the marshes, spends a significant
   proportion of its time submerged and therefore needs to take full
   advantage of available light. S. perennis ssp. alpini is exposed to very
   high light intensities in open salt pans at high elevations. The hybrid,
   S. perennis x fruticosa, which is currently found at intermediate
   elevations with less frequent inundation, had the highest net
   photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll a content. The ability to cope with
   high light levels may help to explain one of the environmental
   parameters, which affects distribution of four taxa throughout the tidal
   frame and also raise intriguing questions about the future role of the
   hybrid in the successive development of these marsh systems.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To evaluate the impact of Finnish tobacco legislation concerning
   restaurants, questionnaire surveys were carried out four times between
   1999 and 2007. Their purpose was to assess the effects of the
   legislation on employees' exposure to tobacco smoke in bars and
   restaurants in Finland before the total prohibition of smoking. Methods:
   National questionnaire surveys on reported exposure to tobacco smoke
   among restaurant workers were conducted in 1999, 2001, 2003, and in the
   spring of 2007 just before the total smoking ban. Results: The data show
   that smoking is more common among restaurant workers than in the Finnish
   population in general. Reported exposure to tobacco smoke in bars and
   restaurants declined slowly after the launch of the renewed Tobacco Act.
   Between 1999 and 2007, it decreased from 73\% to 43\% among waiters who
   were exposed for over four hours per work shift and from 93\% to 67\%
   among bartenders. At the same time, non-exposed waiters increased from
   15\% to 39\% and bartenders from 5\% to 10\%. The number of daily smoked
   cigarettes, however, remained the same among restaurant workers during
   the seven-year follow-up. Conclusions: We conclude that the reform of
   the Finnish tobacco legislation in 2000, which did not totally prohibit
   smoking in restaurants, decreased the exposure to environmental tobacco
   smoke but was not sufficiently effective in protecting restaurant
   workers from occupational exposure to tobacco smoke.}},

Abstract = {{The coelomic cavity is part of the extraembryonic mesoderm, surrounding
   amniotic cavity, embryo, and yolk sac in the early gestation. It is now
   believed to represent an important transfer interface and a reservoir of
   nutrients for the embryo. Coelocentesis by ultrasound-guided
   transvaginal puncture offers an easier access to the early human embryo,
   from 28 days post-fertilization. However, despite some studies about its
   biochemical composition being reported, our knowledge about the presence
   of cellular elements and their quality in this compartment are still
   limited. Here we studied human coelomic fluids sampled from 6.6 (48
   days) to 10 weeks of gestation, demonstrating the presence of functional
   embryonic erythroid precursors, that is, megaloblasts in the coelomic
   cavity. The ease of access of the coelomic cavity could allow the
   development of novel strategies for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes

Abstract = {{Polypropylene (PP) was reinforced with four natural fillers having
   different particle characteristics. Interfacial adhesion was changed by
   the introduction of maleated polypropylene (MAPP). The properties of the
   studied PP/wood composites depended strongly on interfacial adhesion and
   on the particle characteristics of the wood. Coupling with
   functionalized polymer is necessary for the preparation of composites
   with acceptable properties if the size of the particles is large and
   their aspect ratio is small. The effect of adhesion is smaller for
   particles with large aspect ratio. Several micromechanical deformation
   processes may occur in PP/wood composites including matrix yielding,
   debonding, fiber pull-out and fiber fracture both parallel and
   perpendicular to the fiber axis. The processes are competitive and may
   take place simultaneously and/or consecutively. The inherent properties
   of the reinforcement may limit the improvement of composite strength.
   Micromechanical deformation processes determine composite properties

Title = {{Requirement of the CsdA DEAD-box helicase for low temperature
   riboregulation of rpoS mRNA}},
Journal = {{RNA BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{796-802}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The ribosome binding site of Escherichia coli rpoS mRNA, encoding the
   stationary sigma-factor RpoS, is sequestered by an inhibitory stem-loop
   structure (iss). Translational activation of rpoS mRNA at low
   temperature and during exponential growth includes Hfq-facilitated
   duplex formation between rpoS and the small regulatory RNA DsrA as well
   as a concomitant re-direction of RNase III cleavage in the
   5'-untranslated region of rpoS upon DsrA.rpoS annealing. In this way,
   DsrA-mediated regulation does not only activate rpoS translation by
   disrupting the inhibitory secondary structure but also stabilizes the
   rpoS transcript. Although minor structural changes by Hfq have been
   observed in rpoS mRNA, a prevailing question concerns unfolding of the
   iss in rpoS at low growth temperature. Here, we have identified the
   DEAD-box helicase CsdA as an ancillary factor required for low
   temperature activation of RpoS synthesis by DsrA. The lack of RpoS
   synthesis observed in the csdA mutant strain at low growth temperature
   could be attributed to a lack of duplex formation between rpoS and DsrA,
   showing that at low temperature the sole action of Hfq is not sufficient
   to permit DsrA.rpoS annealing. An interactome study has previously
   indicated an association between Hfq and CsdA. However, immunological
   assays did not reveal a physical interaction between Hfq and CsdA. These
   findings add to a model, wherein Hfq binds upstream of the rpoS iss and
   presents DsrA in a conformation receptive to annealing. Melting of the
   iss by CsdA may then permit DsrA.rpoS duplex formation, and consequently
   rpoS translation.}},

Abstract = {{Rank Histograms are suitable tools to assess the quality of ensembles
   within an ensemble prediction system or framework. By counting the rank
   of a given variable in the ensemble, we are basically making a sample
   analysis, which does not allow us to distinguish if the origin of its
   variability is external noise or comes from chaotic sources. The
   recently introduced Mean to Variance Logarithmic (MVL) Diagram accounts
   for the spatial variability, being very sensitive to the spatial
   localization produced by infinitesimal perturbations of spatiotemporal
   chaotic systems. By using as a benchmark a simple model subject to
   noise, we show the distinct information given by Rank Histograms and MVL
   Diagrams. Hence, the main effects of the external noise can be
   visualized in a graphic. From the MVL diagram we clearly observe a
   reduction of the amplitude growth rate and of the spatial localization
   (chaos suppression), while from the Rank Histogram we observe changes in
   the reliability of the ensemble. We conclude that in a complex framework
   including spatiotemporal chaos and noise, both provide a more complete
   forecasting picture.}},

   insight into the response of permafrost to regional warming during the

   Marine Isotope Stage 6 supplemented by paleoecology and non finite C-14
   ages on wood rich organic silts Old Crow tephra overlies several relict
   ice wedges at the Palisades and Thistle Creek indicating that permafrost
   at these sites did not thaw completely during the last interglaciation
   Prominent deposits of last interglacial wood rich organic silt are
   present at multiple sites in eastern Beringia and probably represent
   accumulations of reworked forest vegetation clue to thaw slumping or
   deposition into thermokarst ponds or depressions Consistent
   stratigraphic relations between these deposits Old Crow tephra and ice
   wedge pseudomorphs at our three study sites and at least six other sites
   in eastern Beringia suggest that thaw of shallow permafrost was
   widespread during the last interglaciation Limited stratigraphic
   evidence suggests that thaw was probably on the order of meters rather
   than 10s of meters The ubiquity of shallow permafrost degradation during
   the last interglaciation suggests that current ground warming may
   foreshadow widespread near surface thaw under even modest future warming
   scenarios However the persistence of relict pre last interglacial ice
   wedges highlights the potential for the regional antiquity of
   discontinuous permafrost and provides compelling field evidence for the
   long-term resilience of deep permafrost during sustained periods of

Abstract = {{In music production, ``monitoring{''} refers traditionally to audile
   strategies intended to reveal the ``true{''} sound of mediated audio.
   Here, it is expanded to include new, digital technologies intended to
   better know and control the record-object beyond what listening and
   listening technologies allow. Surveying traditional, contemporary, and
   emerging tools of record production and distribution, this essay
   addresses three types of monitoring: audio, visual, and data.
   In sum, monitoring entails the supplementation and subversion of the ear
   through protocols promising to surmount the biases and distortions of
   audio media. Key technologies include reference speakers, room
   correction systems, digital audio workstations, open mixes, pre-sets,
   social networking sites, and automatic music information retrieval.
   Situating these within a ``techoustemology{''} of monitoring, the
   central argument is that many innovations in digital audio are
   non-auditory and, therefore, displace sound and listening as the central
   means of producing relevant knowledge about music mediated in the
   digital age.}},

Title = {{Varicella Seroprevalence in the US: Data from the National Health and

Abstract = {{Objective. We estimated the varicella seroprevalence among the U.S.
   population aged 6-49 years based on retested National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) specimens collected between 1999
   and 2004-originally tested using a method unsuitable for detecting
   vaccine-induced immunity-and compared it with historical estimates.
   Methods. We performed a confirmatory test suitable for detecting
   vaccine-induced immunity on all available specimens from 6- to
   19-year-olds who originally tested negative (n=633), and on 297 randomly
   selected specimens that had tested positive. Retest results superseded
   original results for determining seroprevalence. We assessed
   seroprevalence for the entire sample aged 6-49 years (n=16,050) by
   participant demographic characteristics and compared it with historical
   estimates (NHANES 1988-1994).
   Results. The percentage of false-negative results for the original test
   was higher for specimens from younger children (6-11 years of age:
   27.5\%; 12-19 years of age: 13.3\%) and for specimens collected most
   recently (2001-2004: 26.0\%; 1999-2000: 12.6\%). The age-adjusted rate
   of varicella seroprevalence for 1999-2004 was 93.6\% for 6- to
   19-year-olds and 98.0\% for adults aged 20-49 years compared with 90.0\%
   and 98.1\%, respectively, for 1988-1994. We found an increase in
   seropositivity between the survey periods, from 93.2\% to 97.2\%
   (p<0.001) among 12- to 19-year-olds. For children, non-Hispanic black
   ethnicity and younger age were associated with lower seroprevalence in
   both survey periods.
   Conclusions. Varicella seroprevalence increased with age among children
   and was uniformly high in the U.S. adult population between 1999 and
   2004. The original testing produced false-negative seroprevalence
   results among children's specimens collected between 1999 and 2004 from
   6- to 19-year-olds.}},

Title = {{Implications of organic matter on arsenic mobilization into groundwater:
   Evidence from northwestern (Chapai-Nawabganj), central (Manikganj) and

Abstract = {{Boreholes (50 m depth) and piezometers (50 m depth) were drilled and
   installed for collecting As-rich sediments and groundwater in the
   Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna flood plains for geochemical analyses.
   Forty-one groundwater samples were collected from the three areas for
   the analyses of cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+), anions (Cl-, NO3-,
   SO42-), total organic carbon (TOC), and trace elements (As, Mn, Fe, Sr,
   Se, Ni, Co, Cu, Mo, Sb, Pb). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray
   fluorescence (XRF) were performed to characterize the major mineral and
   chemical contents of aquifer sediments. In all three study areas,
   results of XRF analysis clearly show that fine-grained sediments contain
   higher amounts of trace element because of their high surface area for
   adsorption. Relative fluorescent intensity of humic substances in
   groundwater samples ranges from 30 to 102 (mean 58 +/- 20, n = 20),
   54-195 (mean 105 +/- 48, n = 10), and 27-243 (mean 79 +/- 71, n = 11) in
   the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna flood plains, respectively. Arsenic
   concentration in groundwater (20-50 m of depth) ranges from 3 to 315 mu
   g/L (mean 62.4 +/- 93.1 mu g/L, n = 20), 16.4-73.7 mu g/L (mean 28.5 +/-
   22.4 mu g/L, n = 10) and 4.6-215.4 mu g/L (mean 30.7 +/- 62.1 mu g/L, n
   = 11) in the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna flood plains, respectively.
   Specific ultra violet adsorption (SUVA) values (less than 3 m(-1) mg(-1)
   L) indicate that the groundwater in the Ganges flood plain has
   relatively low percentage of aromatic organic carbon compared to those
   in the Brahmaputra and Meghna flood plains. Arsenic content in sediments
   ranges from 1 to 11 mg/kg (mean 3.5 +/- 2.7 mg/kg, n = 17) in the three
   flood plains. Total organic carbon content is 0.5-3.7 g/kg (mean 1.9 +/-
   1.1 g/kg) in the Ganges flood plain, 0.5-2.1 g/kg (mean: 1.1 +/- 0.7
   g/kg) in the Brahmaputra flood plain and 0.3-4.4 g/kg (mean 1.9 +/- 1.9
   g/kg) in the Meghna flood plain. Arsenic is positively correlated with
   TOC (R-2 = 0.50, 0.87, and 0.85) in sediments from the three areas.
   Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis of the sediments revealed
   that the functional groups of humic substances in three areas include
   amines, phenol, alkanes, and aromatic carbon. Arsenic and Fe speciation
   in sediments were determined using XANES and the results imply that
   As(V) and Fe(III) are the dominant species in most sediments. The
   results also imply that As (V) and Fe (III) in most of the sediment
   samples of the three areas are the dominant species. X-ray absorption
   fine structure (EXAFS) analysis shows that FeOOH is the main carrier of
   As in the sediments of three areas. In sediments, As is well correlated
   with Fe and Mn. However, there is no such correlation observed between
   As and Fe as well as As and Mn in groundwater, implying that
   mobilizations of Fe, Mn, and As are decoupled or their concentrations in
   groundwater have been affected by other geochemical processes following
   reductive dissolution of Fe or Mn-hydroxides. For example, dissolved Fe
   and Mn levels may be affected by precipitation of Fe- and Mn-carbonate
   minerals such as siderite, while liberated As remains in groundwater.
   The groundwaters of the Brahmaputra and Meghna flood plains contain
   higher humic substances in relative fluorescence intensity (or
   fluorescence index) and lower redox potential compared to the
   groundwater of Ganges flood plain.
   This leads to the release of arseic and iron to groundwater of these
   three plains in considerable amounts, but their concentrations are
   distributed in spatial variations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Pituitary gonadotropins (GTHs), follicle stimulating hormone beta
   (FSH-beta), and luteinizing hormone beta (LH-beta) are the key hormones
   in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis, and form the
   heterodimers between a common alpha subunit (gonadotropin-alpha) and
   FSH-beta and/or LH-beta. To obtain a better understanding on the
   modulation of gonadotropin subunit genes expression upon bisphenol A
   (BPA) exposure in hermaphroditic fish, we studied differential
   regulation of gonadotropin subunit genes from Kryptolebias marmoratus
   after the exposure of several EDCs. Expression profiles of these three
   genes when using quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that
   brain/pituitary tissues were highly expressed in these genes compared to
   other tissues. At different developmental stages, expression of those
   genes dramatically increased over the course of development but showed a
   decrease in expression at the secondary male (showing atresia) stage.
   When adult fish were exposed to BPA (600 mu g/L for 96 h), a significant
   upregulation of these three genes was observed in the brain/pituitary. A
   time course study also revealed the increased expression of gonadotropin
   subunit genes over 12 h with a more pronounced effect on the expression
   of FSH-beta and LH-beta genes, indicating that both genes were
   associated with the BPA exposure on the transcriptional regulation. This
   is the first report of gonadotropin subunit genes from K. marmoratus,
   with particular emphasis on the modulation of their expressions by EDCs.
   In addition, these findings suggest that EDCs modulate the expression of
   gonadotropin subunit genes and would act as potential biomarkers upon
   EDCs exposure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Medical treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is not
   standardized, and there is an enormous diversity in clinical practice.
   Our aim was to demonstrate that uncomplicated diverticulitis can be
   managed with orally administered amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid and a
   short hospital admission.
   A prospective randomized trial was established to compare patients with
   uncomplicated diverticulitis who received oral antibiotic after a short
   course of intravenous antibiotic with those who received intravenous
   antibiotic for a longer period. The antibiotic treatment consisted of
   amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 1 g every 8 h. We included 50 patients,
   25 in each group. Patients in group 1 began oral antibiotic as soon as
   they improved and were discharged the day after. Patients in group 2
   received intravenous antibiotic for 7 days. Both groups received oral
   antibiotic at discharge. The endpoint of the study was ``failure of
   treatment,{''} which was defined as the impossibility of discharging on
   the expected day, emergency admission, or hospital readmission.
   Both groups were comparable in patient demographics and clinical
   characteristics. Most patients clearly improved between 24 and 48 h
   after admission. There were no significant differences between the
   groups when comparing failure of treatment. Treatment of patients in
   group 1 represented a savings in hospitalization costs of 1,244a,not
   sign per patient.
   Most patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis can be managed safely
   with oral antibiotic; thus, a very short hospital stay is a safe option.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the

   Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ICD in CHF patients
   under two perspectives in Brazil: public and supplementary health
   systems.
   Methods: A Markov model was developed to analyze the incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ICD compared to conventional therapy
   in patients with CHF. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted
   life years (QALYs). We searched the literature for data regarding
   effectiveness and complications. Costs were retrieved from public and
   health insurances reimbursement codebooks and from mean cost of
   admissions from a public and a private hospital. One-way sensitivity
   analysis was performed in all variables of the model.
   Results: ICER was R\$ 68,318/QALY in the public and R\$ 90,942/QALY in
   the private perspective. These values are much higher than the one
   suggested by the World Health Organization of 3 times the gross domestic
   product per head (R\$ 40,545 in Brazil). The results were sensitive to
   the cost of the device, battery replacement interval and ICD
   effectiveness. In a simulation resembling MADIT-I population survival
   and ICD benefit, ICER was R\$ R\$ 23,739/QALY in the public and R\$
   33,592/QALY in the private perspective.
   Conclusion: The ICER of ICD is elevated in the general ICC population,
   in either the public or private perspective. A more favorable result
   occurs in patients with a high sudden death risk. (Arq Bras Cardiol

Abstract = {{Recently, a new alkaline protease named HP70 showing highest homology to
   extracellular serine proteases of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and
   Xanthomonas campestris was found in the course of a metagenome screening
   for detergent proteases (Niehaus et al., submitted for publication).
   Attempts to efficiently express the enzyme in common expression hosts
   had failed. This study reports on the realization of overexpression in
   Escherichia coli after structural modification of HP70. Modelling of
   HP70 resulted in a two-domain structure, comprising the catalytic domain
   and a C-terminal domain which includes about 100 amino acids. On the
   basis of the modelled structure the enzyme was truncated by deletion of
   most of the C-terminal domain yielding HP70-C477.
   This structural modification allowed effective expression of active
   enzyme using E. coli BL21-Gold as the host. Specific activity of
   HP70-C477 determined with suc-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide as
   the substrate was 30 +/- 5 U/mg compared to 8 +/- 1 U/mg of the native
   enzyme. HP70-C477 was most active at 40 degrees C and pH 7-11: these
   conditions are prerequisite for a potential application as detergent
   enzyme. Determination of kinetic parameters at 40 degrees C and pH = 9.5
   resulted in K-M = 0.23 +/- 0.01 mM and k(cat) = 167.5 +/- 3.6 s(-1).
   MS-analysis of peptide fragments obtained from incubation of HP70 and
   HP70-C477 with insulin B indicated that the C-terminal domain influences
   the cleavage preferences of the enzyme. Washing experiments confirmed
   the high potential of HP70-C477 as detergent protease. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{P>Objectives:
   To investigate the correlation between cerebral near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS) (rSO2c) and superior vena cava venous oxygen
   saturation (ScvO2) in newborn patients with congenital heart disease
   (CHD).
   Background:
   NIRS is a noninvasive method to monitor hemoglobin oxygen saturation
   using nonpulsatile oximetry.
   Methods:
   We retrospectively analyzed perioperative data from 100 newborn patients
   who underwent cardiac surgery for CHD. rSO2c, ScvO2 from 24 h before to
   72 h after surgery were recorded.
   Results:
   rSO2c had a fair correlation with ScvO2 (r 0.37; P < 0.001). The
   relationship between rSO2c and ScvO2 did not change when analyzed
   between patients with cyanotic or acyanotic CHD. During the preoperative
   period, rSO2c levels overestimated ScvO2; in the first 18 postoperative
   hours, rSO2c underestimated ScvO2; after that period, they showed very
   close trends. Hypocapnia caused rSO2c to underestimate ScvO2; in
   normocapnic patients, rSO2c-ScvO2 average differences were close to
   zero; in hypercapnic neonates, rSO2c tended to overestimate ScvO2. The
   best performance of rSO2c as a surrogate of ScvO2 was found in the
   venous saturation ranges from 40\% to 60\% (r 0.3, P: 0.03).
   Conclusions:
   rSO2c in newborn patients with cyanotic and acyanotic CHD provides a
   continuous noninvasive information with a fair correlation with ScvO2\%:
   some predictable variables (i.e., time from surgery, carbon dioxide, and
   venous saturation levels), should guide the operators to adjust rSO2c
   values in terms of ScvO2. Serial measures of ScvO2 seem recommended to
   tailor rSO2c information on actual venous saturation percentage.}},

Abstract = {{Pestiviruses are pathogens of cloven-hoofed animals, belonging to the
   Flaviviridae. The pestiviral particle consists of a lipid membrane
   containing the three envelope glycoproteins E-rns, E1, and E2 and a
   nucleocapsid of unknown symmetry, which is composed of the Core protein
   and the viral positive-sense RNA genome. The positively charged
   pestiviral Core protein consists of 86 to 89 amino acids. To analyze the
   organization of essential domains, N- and C-terminal truncations, as
   well as internal deletions, were introduced into the Core coding
   sequence in the context of an infectious cDNA clone of classical swine
   fever virus strain Alfort. Amino acids 179 to 180, 194 to 198, and 208
   to 212 proved to be of special importance for the generation of progeny
   virus. The results of transcomplementation of a series of C-terminally
   truncated Core molecules indicate the importance of Ala(255) at the C
   terminus. The plasticity of Core protein was examined by the
   construction of concatemeric arrays of Core coding regions and the
   insertion of up to three yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) genes between
   two Core genes. Even a Core fusion protein with more than
   10-fold-increased molecular mass was integrated into the viral particle
   and supported the production of infectious progeny virus. The unexpected
   plasticity of Core protein brings into question the formation of a
   regular icosahedric particle and supports the idea of a histone-like
   protein-RNA interaction. All viruses with a duplicated Core gene were
   unstable and reverted to the wild-type sequence. Interestingly, a
   nonviable YFP-Core construct was rescued by a mutation within the
   C-terminal domain of the nonstructural protein NS3.}},

Abstract = {{Women with an elevated risk for breast cancer require intensified
   screening beginning at an early age. Such high risk screening differs
   considerably from screening in the general population. After an expert

   no longer recommended. To ensure a high sensitivity and specificity high
   risk screening should be performed only at a nationally or regionally
   approved and audited service. Adequate knowledge about the phenotypical
   characteristics of familial breast cancer is essential. Besides the
   common malignant phenotypes, benign morphologies (round or oval shape
   and smooth margins) as well as a low prevalence of calcifications have
   been described. Using MRI benign contrast media kinetics as well as

   elements of the clinical interview and clinical examination in the
   diagnostic approach to patients with chronic pelvic and perineal pain.
   Patients and methods. - A review of the literature and a description of
   our experience was performed to describe the clinical interview and
   clinical examination of patients with chronic pelvic and perineal pain.
   Results. - Clinical interview of the patient is designed to define the
   characteristics of the pain: mode of installation, topography,
   irradiation, type, remission, nocturnal waking, and aggravating or
   limiting factors. It must also look for associated clinical signs:
   urinary, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, sexual, cutaneous and
   neurological. The intensity of the pain is evaluated on an analogue
   scale. A complete clinical examination of the pelvis and perineum must
   be performed Looking for an organic cause: neurological, dermatological,
   urogenital, spinal, myofascial and sympathetic nervous system. Digital
   rectal and vaginal (pelvic) examinations play an important role in the
   detection of trigger points.
   Conclusion. - A well-conducted clinical interview and clinical
   examination can help to elucidate a large proportion of cases of chronic

Abstract = {{Introduction. - Patients with chronic pelvic and perineal pain often

Title = {{Turn on, tune in, but don't drop out: The impact of neo-liberalism on
   magic mushroom users' (in)ability to imagine collectivist social worlds}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Between 2002 and 2005 fresh or unprepared psilocin-based
   `magic' mushrooms were legal to possess and traffic in the UK, and
   commercial sales demonstrated a significant market for this
   hallucinogenic drug. During and after this time there has been
   relatively little analysis concerning how magic mushroom users accounted
   for their drug use, nor on the wider political and cultural discourses
   that might have shaped this sense making.
   Method: In this paper we present a critical analysis of contemporary
   discourses around magic mushroom use in the UK through a multi-level
   discourse analysis of focus group data from 20 magic mushroom users (13
   male and 7 female, mean age 25 years), taken at a time when magic
   mushrooms were being legally sold in the UK.
   Results: Locating participants' use of magic mushrooms within the
   context of a culture of intoxication, neo-liberalism and the legacy of
   1960s psychedelic philosophy, we identify six interpretative repertoires
   in their talk, which were subsumed within two overarching discourses.
   The first discourse drew on neo-liberal rhetoric, constructing
   participants as rational risk managing subjects engaged in a form of
   calculated hedonism that was legitimated as an act of personal freedom
   and consumer choice. The second discourse, identified as
   `post-psychedelic', both celebrated and problematised a collective,
   connected `hippy' form of spirituality.
   Conclusion: The paper analyses the relationships between identity,
   consumption and citizenship by arguing that people's ability to imagine
   collectivist, spiritual or interconnected social worlds has been
   contained within neo-liberalism rhetoric. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The effect of storage conditions on shelf life of purslane leaves
   (Portulaca oleracea L) was investigated. In a first trial, fresh leaves
   were harvested and stored under different temperatures (0, 5, and 10
   degrees C) for 17 days. Storage temperature significantly affected
   color, visual quality, respiration rate, ethylene production, weight
   loss, vitamin C content, antioxidant activity, total phenolic and total
   and soluble oxalic acid contents. Leaves stored at 10 degrees C did not
   withstand the entire storage period, being judged not marketable after 8
   days, while leaves stored at 0 and 5 degrees C were still marketable
   after 13 and 10 days, respectively. Samples stored at 10 degrees C
   showed a lower hue angle value and a higher chlorophyll loss compared to
   other samples, while no symptom of chilling injury was observed in
   leaves stored at 0 and 5 degrees C. Respiration rate significantly
   increased with increasing storage temperature: ethylene production was
   also affected by storage temperature, although values were very low (<1
   nLC(2)H(4)/kg/h at 10 degrees C). Vitamin C was more sensitive to
   postharvest deterioration during storage and a marked reduction was
   observed in samples stored at 10 degrees C. In addition, purslane was
   found to be high in antioxidants (192 mg TEAC/100g fw, at harvest) and
   total phenols (471 mg GAE/100 g fw) and the decline observed during
   storage was influenced by temperature. A second trial was performed in
   order to evaluate the effect of exogenous ethylene on leaves during
   storage at two temperatures. Fresh leaves were harvested and exposed to
   air (as control), and to 0.1, 1, and 10 mu L/L of ethylene for 15 days
   at 0 and 15 degrees C. Exposure to C2H4 affected respiration rate, color
   and overall appearance but only at 15 degrees C and for high ethylene
   concentrations (1 and 10 mu L/L). Leaves did not withstand the entire
   storage period and marketable life was about 7 days at 15 degrees C,
   except for leaves exposed to 10 mu L/L of C2H4, while for all samples
   held at 0 degrees C marketable life exceeded 10 days. Loss of
   marketability was due to yellowing and discoloration. It is concluded
   that purslane is not chilling sensitive, can be stored successfully at
   low temperatures, produces very small amounts of ethylene and is not
   sensitive to a low concentration of ethylene, especially when exposure
   occurs at low temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To compare the use of film-based periapical radiographs and digital
   panoramic images displayed on monitor and glossy paper in the assessment
   of the periapical status of the teeth. Methodology: A total of 86
   subjects were examined. All participants underwent a full-mouth
   radiographic survey (14 periapical radiographs) and a digital panoramic
   radiography. The periapical status of all appraised teeth was assessed.
   Results: Periapical radiographs allowed the assessment of the periapical
   status of a significantly higher percentage of teeth (87.4\%) Digital
   radiography had a significantly reduced potential to allow assessment of
   the periapical status (p<0.01). Only 58.0\% and 34.3\% of teeth could be
   appraised using digital panoramic images displayed on monitor and glossy
   paper respectively (p<0.01). The total percentage of teeth with
   periapical pathosis was four-fold higher when assessed with digital
   panoramic images displayed on glossy paper compared with periapical
   radiographs (p<0.01). Conclusions: Periapical radiographs allowed the
   assessment of a significantly higher percentage of teeth when comparing
   to digital radiography, which had a significantly lower potency in the
   assessment of periapical status of the teeth. Digital panoramic images
   displayed on a monitor resulted in a significantly higher percentage of
   appraised teeth compared to digital images displayed on glossy paper.
   Apical periodontitis was scored more often on paper than on screen, and
   more often on screen than in periapical radiographs.}},

Abstract = {{Participatory modelling has provided a new approach to overcome the
   problem of data scarcity which formerly interfered with the
   environmental planning for the restoration of the Kolleru-Upputeru
   wetland ecosystem on the east coast of Andhra Pradesh in South India.
   New ways had to be found to address the shortcomings of traditionally
   validated simulation models. The traditional validation process was
   replaced by joint plausibility discussions and shared vision building in
   order to improve the understanding of cause-effect relationships and
   proposals for restoration measures. This study has aimed to match the
   tacit knowledge of the local stakeholders with explicit scientific
   knowledge in order to create (i) a mutual basis for an integrated
   approach as opposed to single-issue measures and (ii) a mutual agreement
   on follow-up steps needed to sustain both the livelihood of the people
   as well as the wetland ecosystem. The challenge was to address the
   hydrological and social complexity. On the basis of a literature review,
   input data for model simulations were generated from the
   location-specific knowledge of stakeholders and a rapid field appraisal.
   The model simulations were used to predict the effects of a number of
   restoration options. In two workshops, these restoration options were
   discussed with the stakeholders in order to improve the mutual
   understanding of the complexity of the wetland system and to reach an
   agreement on the outlines of an integrated action plan. The
   participatory modelling approach proved to be a useful tool to obtain a
   consensus of opinions among the stakeholders. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Mediastinal germ cell tumors are a rare heterogeneous entity. This study
   tries to determine the prognostic factors of these tumors. We designed a
   retrospective study of 31 patients with primary mediastinal germ cell
   tumors treated in three centers, in France, from 1986 to 2009. The data
   were statistically reviewed; univariate and multivariate analyses were
   performed. Twenty-nine patients were males and two were females (sex
   ratio 14.5) with a median age of 28 years (range 16-60 years),
   including: non-seminomatous germ cell tumors 61.3\% (n = 19), seminoma
   32.3\% (n = 10) and immature teratoma 6.4\% (n = 2). They had
   extramediastinal disease at diagnosis in 53\% (n = 16). The five-year
   overall survival (OS) was 56.3\%. Univariate analysis showed that age,
   gender, extent of disease at diagnosis, tumor markers at diagnosis and
   normalization of markers after first-line chemotherapy were not
   statistically significant, meanwhile tumor histology (P = 0.009),
   surgical resection of the tumor (P = 0.023), and pathological evidence
   of persistent viable tumor in resected remnants (P = 0.008) were
   statistically significant. Multivariate analysis identified surgical
   resection of the tumor as an independent favorable factor of OS (OR =
   5.10; 95\% CI 1.49-17.45; P = 0.009). Determining relevant prognostic
   factors has been difficult until now, largely because of the low
   incidence of these tumors. Raising the patient numbers by expanding the
   centers studied may allow the prognostic factors to be identified more
   precisely. (c) 2010 Published by European Association for

Abstract = {{Approximately half of human-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are
   taken up by the land and ocean, and the rest stays in the atmosphere,
   increasing the global concentration and acting as a major greenhouse-gas
   (GHG) climate-forcing element. Although GHG mitigation is now in the
   political arena, the exact spatial distribution of the land sink is not
   well known. In this paper, an estimation of mean European net ecosystem
   exchange (NEE) carbon fluxes for the period 1998-2001 is performed with
   three mesoscale and two global transport models, based on the
   integration of atmospheric CO2 measurements into the same Bayesian
   synthesis inverse approach. A special focus is given to sub-continental
   regions of Europe making use of newly available CO2 concentration
   measurements in this region. Inverse flux estimates from the five
   transport models are compared with independent flux estimates from four
   ecosystem models. All inversions detect a strong annual carbon sink in
   the southwestern part of Europe and a source in the northeastern part.
   Such a dipole, although robust with respect to the network of stations
   used, remains uncertain and still to be confirmed with independent
   estimates. Comparison of the seasonal variations of the inversion-based
   net land biosphere fluxes (NEP) with the NEP predicted by the ecosystem
   models indicates a shift of the maximum uptake period, from June in the
   ecosystem models to July in the inversions. This study thus improves on
   the understanding of the carbon cycle at sub-continental scales over
   Europe, demonstrating that the methodology for understanding regional
   carbon cycle is advancing, which increases its relevance in terms of
   issues related to regional mitigation policies.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Cardiac surgery-related acute kidney injury has short-and
   long-term impact on patients' risk for further morbidity and mortality.
   Consensus statements have yielded criteria-such as the risk, injury,
   failure, loss, and end-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) criteria, and the
   Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria-to define the type and
   consequence of acute kidney injury. We sought to estimate the ability of
   both the RIFLE and and AKIN criteria to predict the risk of in-hospital
   mortality in the setting of cardiac surgery.
   Methods. Data were collected on 25,086 patients undergoing cardiac
   surgery in Northern New England from January 2001 to December 2007,
   excluding 339 patients on preoperative dialysis. The AKIN and RIFLE
   criteria were used to classify patients postoperatively, using the last
   preoperative and the highest postoperative serum creatinine. We compared
   the diagnostic properties of both criteria, and calculated the areas
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
   Results. Acute kidney injury occurred in 30\% of patients using the AKIN
   criteria and in 31\% of patients using the RIFLE criteria. The areas
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve for in-hospital
   mortality estimated by AKIN and RIFLE criteria were 0.79 (95\%
   confidence interval: 0.77 to 0.80) and 0.78 (95\% confidence interval:
   0.76 to 0.80), respectively (p = 0.369).
   Conclusions. The AKIN and RIFLE criteria are accurate early predictors
   of mortality. The high incidence of cardiac surgery postoperative acute
   kidney injury should prompt the use of either AKIN or RIFLE criteria to
   identify patients at risk and to stimulate institutional measures that
   target acute kidney injury as a quality improvement initiative. (Ann

Abstract = {{P>The shallow subsurface structure of the 2009 April 6 M-w 6.3 L'Aquila
   earthquake surface rupture at Paganica has been investigated with ground
   penetrating radar to study how the surface rupture relates spatially to
   previous surface displacements during the Holocene and Pleistocene. The
   discontinuous surface rupture stepped between en-echelon/parallel faults
   within the overall fault zone that show clear Holocene/Pleistocene
   offsets in the top 10 m of the subsurface. Some portions of the fault
   zone that show clear Holocene offsets were not ruptured in 2009, having
   been bypassed as the rupture stepped across a relay zone onto a fault
   across strike. The slip vectors, defined by opening directions across
   surface cracks, indicate dip-slip normal movement, whose azimuth
   remained constant between 210 degrees and 228 degrees across the zone
   where the rupture stepped between faults. We interpret maximum vertical
   offsets of the base of the Holocene summed across strike to be 4.5 m,
   which if averaged over 15 kyr, gives a maximum throw-rate of 0.23-0.30
   mm yr-1, consistent with throw-rates implied by vertical offsets of a
   layer whose age we assume to be similar to 33 ka. This compares with
   published values of 0.4 mm yr-1 for a minimum slip rate implied by
   offsets of Middle Pleistocene tephras, and 0.24 mm yr-1 since 24.8 kyr
   from palaeoseismology. The Paganica Fault, although clearly an important
   active structure, is not slipping fast enough to accommodate all of the
   3-5 mm yr-1 of extension across this sector of the Apennines; other
   neighbouring range-bounding active normal faults also have a role to
   play in the seismic hazard.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of low-cost carbonaceous solids have been successfully tested
   in bioreactors designed for nitrate treatment. In many agricultural and
   wastewater settings, however, such reactors may be practical only if
   they are maintenance free for a number of years after installation.
   Although field installations have demonstrated consistent treatment over
   multi-year timeframes, the ability to accurately quantify slowly
   declining reaction rates in field settings is problematic because of
   variations in reactor flow rates, ambient temperatures and influent
   chemistry. In this study, laboratory column, tests were undertaken on
   four samples of coarse wood particle media (woodchips), two that were
   fresh and two that had been in continuous operation in subsurface
   denitrifying bioreactors for periods of 2 and 7 years respectively. Four
   experimental runs were undertaken at increasing influent NO3-N
   concentrations of from 3.1 to 48.8 mg N L-1. Nitrate mass removal rates
   remained relatively constant and did not systematically increase in
   successive runs at higher NO3 concentrations indicating that NO3 was not
   the rate-limiting substrate at these concentrations. Thus, zero-order
   reaction kinetics were used to model the attenuation reaction
   (presumably denitrification). The 7-year-old media had a mean NO3-N
   removal rate of 9.1 mg N L-1 d(-1) (6.4 g N m(-3) media d(-1)), which
   remained within 75\% of the rate for the 2-year-old media (12.1 mg N L-1
   d(-1) or 8.5 g N m(-3) media d(-11)) and within 40-59\% of the rate for
   the fresh chips (15.4-23.0 mg N L-1 d(-1) or 10.8-16.1 g N m(-3) media
   d(-1)). Results support field experience indicating that woodchips loose
   about 50\% of their reactivity during their first year of operation as
   soluble organic compounds are leached out, but then relatively stable
   rates persist for a considerable number of years thereafter. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for unsupervised subpixel change
   detection using image series. The method is based on the definition of a
   probabilistic criterion capable of assessing the level of coherence of
   an image series relative to a reference classification with a finer
   resolution. In opposition to approaches based on an a priori model of
   the data, the model developed here is based on the rejection of a
   nonstructured model-called a-contrario model-by the observation of
   structured data. This coherence measure is the core of a stochastic
   algorithm which automatically selects the image subdomain representing
   the most likely changes. A theoretical analysis of this model is led to
   predict its performances, in particular regarding the contrast level of
   the image as well as the number of change pixels in the image. Numerical
   simulations are also presented that confirm the high robustness of the
   method and its capacity to detect changes impacting more than 25 percent
   of a considered pixel under average conditions. An application to
   land-cover change detection is then provided using time series of
   satellite images.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1146-1156}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Identification of foraging behaviour and the ability to assess
   foraging success is critical to understanding individual and
   between-species variation in habitat use and foraging ecology. For
   pelagic predators, behaviour-dependent foraging metrics are commonly
   used to identify important foraging areas, yet few of these metrics have
   been validated.
   2. Using the northern elephant seal as a model species, we validated the
   use of a behaviour-independent measure of foraging success (changes in
   drift rate) at the scale of the entire foraging migration, and then used
   this to assess a variety of common foraging metrics that are based on
   movement patterns and dive behaviour. Transit rate consistently provided
   the best estimate of daily foraging success, although the addition of
   other metrics provides insight into different foraging behaviours or
   strategies.
   3. While positive changes in buoyancy occurred throughout most of the
   migrations, implying successful feeding across much of the north
   Pacific, the areas of most rapid changes in buoyancy occurred along a
   latitudinal band (40-50 degrees N) corresponding to a dynamic
   hydrographic region including Subarctic Gyre and Transition Zone waters.
   4. These results support the use of transit rate as an index of foraging

Abstract = {{We propose to analyze carbon black filled elastomers as random
   three-dimensional cellular solids where bending arms are made of carbon
   black clusters coated with bound rubber, and where the matrix is the
   free rubber. Both phases are co-continuous. This work aims at presenting
   a simple but lacking physical model that integrates the to-date
   understanding of rubber reinforcement and can describe the complex small
   strain mechanical behavior that results from adding a colloidal filler
   such as carbon black or silica to a rubber. This analogy is able to
   capture the composite modulus changes with filler content, temperature
   and strain, through the description of the volume fraction of the
   bending arms composing the skeleton. Indeed, the modulus decreases with
   strain as the bending arms are breaking apart (analogy with filler
   network breaking apart through des-agglomeration process) and decreases
   with temperature as the bending arms are getting thinner (analogy with
   the adsorbed layer of rubber on filler disappearing with rising
   temperature).
   Experimental data involving a hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber
   (HNBR) filled with N330 carbon black and resulting from a systematic
   study of strain and temperature influences, agree well with the model.

Title = {{Prospective study of wound infections in Mohs micrographic surgery using

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Molls micrographic surgery (MMS) has a low rate of surgical
   site infection (SSI) without the use of prophylactic antibiotics. In the
   studies to date, there has been variation in the steps taken by each
   surgeon to prevent SSIs but in all cases sterile technique was used
   during wound reconstruction.
   Objective: We sought to evaluate the rate of SSIs among patients
   undergoing MMS with the use of clean surgical technique for all steps of
   MMS including wound reconstruction in the absence of prophylactic
   antibiotics.
   Methods: We prospectively evaluated 1000 patients undergoing MMS using
   clean surgical technique for SSIs. Clean surgical technique includes the
   use of clean surgical gloves and towels and a single pack of sterile
   instruments for all steps including wound reconstruction.
   Results: There were 11 SSIs among 1000 patients with 1204 tumors, with
   an overall rate of infection of 0.91\% (95\% confidence interval
   0.38\%-1.45\%). Three of the 11 infections were complications of
   hematomas. Four of the 11 infections occurred in flap closures, which
   had the highest rate of SS's of 2.67\% (4/150).
   Limitations: The study was a prospective, single-institution
   uncontrolled study.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the
   rate of SSIs with the use of clean surgical technique, in the absence of
   antibiotic prophylaxis, for all steps of MMS including wound
   reconstruction. Our rate of SSIs of 0.91\% is exceedingly low,
   underscoring the overall safety of MMS and its performance in the
   outpatient setting without the use of antibiotic prophylaxis or sterile
   technique. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2010;63:842-51)}},

Abstract = {{Jasmonates are plant hormones involved in wound and defense responses
   against herbivorous arthropods. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is used
   experimentally to induce defense responses in plants. In experiments
   outlined here we utilized a novel preference assay with unwounded plants
   that allowed us to study the impact of a MeJA spray on subsequent
   Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) proliferation and
   preference. Spraying plants with 100 mu m MeJA 1 day before infestation
   caused mites to disperse within 2 days from treated impatiens
   {[}Impatiens wallerana Hook f., `Super Elfin Pink' (Balsaminaceae)],
   pansy {[}Viola x wittrockiana Gams, `Imperial Beaconsfield'
   (Violaceae)], and tomato {[}Solanum lycopersicum L., `Big Boy'
   (Solanaceae)] plants. In addition, MeJA application reduced mite
   proliferation rate on impatiens and pansy by 60\% (measured 22-34 days
   after infestation). Proteinase inhibitor (PI) assays suggested that
   MeJA-induced PIs alone were not responsible for the observed results in
   pansy and impatiens but may have been a factor in tomato. Implications
   of these results in the context of MeJA-induced resistance responses and
   possible directions for future research and application are discussed.}},

Title = {{The Antiemetic 5-HT3 Receptor Antagonist Palonosetron Inhibits Substance
   P-Mediated Responses In Vitro and In Vivo}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{335}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Palonosetron is the only 5-HT3 receptor antagonist approved for the
   treatment of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in
   moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that
   substance P (SP), the endogenous ligand acting preferentially on
   neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors, not serotonin (5-HT), is the dominant
   mediator of delayed emesis. However, palonosetron does not bind to the
   NK-1 receptor. Recent data have revealed cross-talk between the NK-1 and
   5HT(3) receptor signaling pathways; we postulated that if palonosetron
   differentially inhibited NK-1/5-HT3 crosstalk, it could help explain its
   efficacy profile in delayed emesis. Consequently, we evaluated the
   effect of palonosetron, granisetron, and ondansetron on SP-induced
   responses in vitro and in vivo. NG108-15 cells were preincubated with
   palonosetron, granisetron, or ondansetron; antagonists were removed and
   the effect on serotonin enhancement of SP-induced calcium release was
   measured. In the absence of antagonist, serotonin enhanced SP-induced
   calcium-ion release. After preincubation with palonosetron, but not
   ondansetron or granisetron, the serotonin enhancement of the SP response
   was inhibited. Rats were treated with cisplatin and either palonosetron,
   granisetron, or ondansetron. At various times after dosing, single
   neuronal recordings from nodose ganglia were collected after stimulation
   with SP; nodose ganglia neuronal responses to SP were enhanced when the
   animals were pretreated with cisplatin. Palonosetron, but not
   ondansetron or granisetron, dose-dependently inhibited the
   cisplatin-induced SP enhancement. The results are consistent with
   previous data showing that palonosetron exhibits distinct pharmacology
   versus the older 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and provide a rationale for
   the efficacy observed with palonosetron in delayed CINV in the clinic.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first distributed paradigm for multiple users to interact
   simultaneously with large tiled rear projection display walls. Unlike
   earlier works, our paradigm allows easy scalability across different
   applications, interaction modalities, displays and users. The novelty of
   the design lies in its distributed nature allowing well-compartmented,
   application independent, and application specific modules. This enables
   adapting to different 2D applications and interaction modalities easily
   by changing a few application specific modules. We demonstrate four
   challenging 2D applications on a nine projector display to demonstrate
   the application scalability of our method: map visualization, virtual
   graffiti, virtual bulletin board and an emergency management system. We
   demonstrate the scalability of our method to multiple interaction
   modalities by showing both gesture-based and laser-based user
   interfaces. Finally, we improve earlier distributed methods to register
   multiple projectors. Previous works need multiple patterns to identify
   the neighbors, the configuration of the display and the registration
   across multiple projectors in logarithmic time with respect to the
   number of projectors in the display. We propose a new approach that
   achieves this using a single pattern based on specially augmented QR
   codes in constant time. Further, previous distributed registration
   algorithm's are prone to large misregistrations. We propose a novel
   radially cascading geometric registration technique that yields
   significantly better accuracy. Thus, our improvements allow a
   significantly more efficient and accurate technique for distributed

Abstract = {{In this paper, the heat transfer characteristics of a two-dimensional
   steady Benard convection flow with a temperature-dependent viscosity are
   studied numerically by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The
   double-distribution model for LBM is proposed, one is to simulate
   incompressible flow in porous media and the other is to solve the volume
   averaged energy equation. The method is validated by comparing the
   numerical results with those existing literature. The effect of
   viscosity dependent on temperature is investigated. The average Nusselt
   numbers for the cases of exponential form of viscosity-temperature and
   effective Rayleigh number based on average temperature (T-ref = 0.5(T-h
   + T-c)) are compared. A new formula of reference temperature (T-ref =
   T-c + f(b)(T-h -T-c)) is proposed and the numerical results show that
   the average Nusselt numbers predicted by this method have higher
   precision than those obtained by average temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The prognosis of bladder cancer (BC) depends mainly on its
   histology, grade, and stage. Patients with superficial BC (70\% of the
   urothelial carcinomas) have a relatively good prognosis, but patients
   diagnosed with invasive, high grade BC, and those who progress to
   invasive BC, have a poor prognosis and will not survive their disease in
   many cases due to their metastases, despite the currently available
   treatment options. Early detection can only be beneficial regarding
   mortality if the high risk cancers are recognized and treated at a
   localized stage.
   Materials and methods: Previous pilot studies on early detection
   consisted of home-based repeated hematuria testing and, in case of
   hematuria, a urologic evaluation with cytology and cystoscopy was
   carried out. This design resulted in too many cystoscopies. The recently
   initiated {[}Bladder Cancer Urine Marker Project (BLU-P) study
   www.blu-project.ord] assesses the feasibility of a population-based
   screening for BC and at the same time evaluates a screening algorithm
   using next to hematuria testing, sensitive specific urine markers for BC
   (NMP22, FGFR3, MA analyses and MLPa) in an attempt to circumvent the
   high number of cystoscopies.
   Results: So far 1,611 men are included and 23.5\% tested positive for
   hematuria (11.6\% had one or more true positive test results). The
   additional molecular-based screening tests before referring to
   cystoscopy resulted in a decrease of the number of cystoscopies from 378
   to 66 (82.5\%). In those men referred for cystoscopy, so far only 1 BC
   case was detected.
   Conclusions: Further research is needed to evaluate whether this
   extremely low detection rate is caused by, e.g., a healthy screenee bias
   or that the additional selection step using the molecular urine tests is
   too strict and diagnoses are missed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective. This work has aimed to validate the Spanish version of the
   PHQ-15 questionnaire (Patient Health Questionnaire) for its use in
   patients with depression and/or and anxiety disorders.
   Material and methods. An observational, cross-sectional study in which
   the PHQ-15 questionnaire (made up of 15 items on somatic symptoms) was
   administered in the outpatient psychiatric clinics to patients of 18
   years or more, diagnosed of depression and/or anxiety disorder according
   to the DSM-IV criteria. Feasibility (percent of patients without
   response), reliability (in terms of internal consistency) and
   convergent/divergent validity compared to the MADRS scale (by
   correlational analysis), discriminant (with intragroup comparison) and
   predictive (by logistical regression).
   Results. A total of 3362 evaluated patients were included. Of these,
   65.5\% were women, with a mean age of 45.6 years (18.0-90.0). The
   questionnaire was feasible (9.6\% of patients lacking an answer to some
   item), and showed acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach's Alpha
   Coefficient =0.78) with adequate validity, with correlations with the
   MADRS scale between moderate and high (r=0.3-0.7) and differences
   between groups of patients. The factors associated to the profile type
   of the patient with relevant physical symptoms were: being a woman,
   having a background of depression and/or anxiety, anxiety according to
   the DSM-IV, any concomitant condition in general, and specifically
   hepatic-digestive and osteoarticular system affectation and, as
   protective factor, being 70 years of age or older.
   Conclusion. The PHQ-15 questionnaire in its Spanish version has been
   shown to be feasible, reliable and valid to evaluate somatic symptoms in
   patients With depression and/or anxiety disorders in psychiatry.}},

Abstract = {{Petrography-controlled laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry (LAICPMS) analyses of carbonate in fresh shallow level
   sub-volcanic Polino monticellite calcio-carbonatite tuffisite have been
   performed to assess the geochemical differences between fresh igneous,
   epigenetic carbonates and sedimentary accidental fragments. Igneous
   calcite has consistently high LREE/HREE ratios (La/Yb (N) , 15-130) due
   to high LREE (I LREE pound, 425-1,269 ppm). Secondary calcite cements
   are characterized by progressively lower and more variable trace element
   contents, with lower LREE/HREE ratios. A distinguishing geochemical
   feature is progressively increasing negative Ce anomalies observed
   through coarse secondary calcite that can be related to the surface
   environment processes. The limestone accidental fragments in the
   tuffisite have trace element contents almost two orders of magnitude
   lower than igneous carbonate and low LREE (I LREE pound < 9.5 ppm) with
   low LREE/HREE fractionation (La/Yb (N) ratios < 18). The stable isotope
   composition of different carbonate types is consistent with their
   formation in different environments. The tuffisitization processes
   during diatreme formation under high CO(2)-OH fugacity conditions may
   account for the differences noted in the igneous carbonates.}},

   Method:
   Of 301 first episode psychotic patients aged 15-65 years, 147

   Results:
   Multi family group participants had a significantly lower drop-out rates
   at 5-year follow-up than patients who did not participate. However, the
   MFG participants had significantly less improvement in PANSS positive
   and excitative symptoms and had significantly longer duration of

Abstract = {{The potato cyst nematode (PCN). Globodera rostochiensis, has been
   present in Central Saanich on Vancouver Island for at least 45 years.
   Eradication/control efforts have been ongoing, with regulations enacted
   in the early 1980s restricting the planting of host crops and movement
   of soil. Surveys monitoring for cyst populations have been minimal since
   the regulations have been in place with only one limited study in the
   early 1990s. In this report, a survey of eight fields was undertaken,
   chosen as the most likely sites that may still harbor viable PCN cysts.
   Conventional sampling/detection methods were considered inadequate for
   the detection of very low cyst populations, and an innovative bioassay
   was developed to improve detection while minimizing costs and labor.
   Viable cysts were recovered from two fields, both with past quarantine
   infractions. Fields with no known infractions were found free of viable
   cysts. Lack of viable cysts found in fields with no infractions suggests
   that the quarantine restrictions in place since the early 1980s have
   been effective in reducing or eliminating PCN from these fields. Further
   systematic and comprehensive retesting of all fields within the
   quarantine zone is now required, which could lead to the reduction or
   lifting of some quarantine restrictions.}},

Title = {{In-Well Degassing Issues for Measurements of Dissolved Gases in
   Groundwater}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{48}},

Pages = {{869-877}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Measurement of dissolved gases in groundwater is becoming increasingly
   common and important. Many of these measurements involve monitoring or
   sampling within wells or from water pumped from wells. We used total
   dissolved gas pressure (TDGP) sensors placed in the screened section of
   various wells (4 to 72 m deep) to assess the dissolved gas conditions
   for open wells compared to the conditions when sealed (i.e., isolated
   from the atmosphere) with a hydraulic packer (one well) or when pumped.
   When the packer was installed (non-pumping conditions), TDGP rose from
   <1.7 to >3.1 atm (<172 to >314 kPa), with declines noted when the packer
   was removed or deflated. While pumping, TDGP measured in many of the
   wells rose to substantially higher levels, up to 4.0 atm (408 kPa) in
   one case. Thus, when groundwater is gas charged, the background aquifer
   TDGP, and likewise the dissolved gas concentrations, may be
   substantially higher than initially measured in open wells, indicating
   significant in-well degassing. This raises concerns about past and
   current methods of measuring the dissolved gases in groundwater.
   Additional procedures that may be required to obtain representative
   measurements from wells include (1) installing in-well hydraulic packers
   to seal the well, or (2) pumping to bring in fresh groundwater. However,
   observed transient decreased TDGPs during pumping, believed to result
   from gas bubble formation induced by drawdown in the well below a
   critical pressure (relative to TDGP), may disrupt the measurements made
   during or after pumping. Thus, monitoring TDGP while pumping gas-charged
   wells is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{In ruminants, the phenomenon of endometrial tissue remodeling during the
   estrous cycle and early pregnancy is not fully understood. In this
   report, the occurrence of tissue remodeling, if any, in buffalo
   endometrium was studied by detecting gelatinases, matrix
   metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases
   (TIMPs); the key regulators of tissue remodeling, in uterine luminal
   fluids (ULF) of cycling and early pregnant (approx. 43-65 days)
   buffaloes. Each stage of the estrous cycle and pregnant ULF demonstrated
   a unique profile of gelatinase activities compared to serum/follicular
   fluid, with a major gelatinase band of 60 kDa with highest activity in
   early-luteal stage. In addition to a 32 kDa uterus-specific gelatinase
   band detected in both non-pregnant and pregnant ULFs, the pregnant ULF
   displayed three new gelatinase bands of 86, 78, and 57 kDa. Western blot
   technique confirmed the presence of MMP-2 (54 kDa), MMP-9 (76/73 kDa),
   TIMP-1 (32 kDa), TIMP-2(20 kDa), and two molecular weight forms (31 and
   22 kDa) of TIMP-3 in buffalo ULF with varying band intensities. Highest
   MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were observed in follicular and early-luteal
   stage ULFs, respectively. Highest TIMP-1 activity was observed in
   early-luteal ULF. Interestingly, TIMP-2 activity was only detected in
   mid-luteal, late-luteal, and follicular stage ULFs with significantly
   increasing intensities. Highest activities of 31 and 22 kDa TIMP-3 were
   associated with late-luteal and early-luteal stage ULFs, respectively.
   The varied activities of MMPs and TIMPs in buffalo ULF during the
   estrous cycle and early pregnancy might be a reflection of dynamic
   structural remodeling of the endometrium and/or developing conceptus.}},

Abstract = {{A method of simultaneous analysis of staphylococcal enterotoxins using
   hydrogel-based microarrays (biochips) has been developed. The method
   allows simultaneous quantitative detection of seven enterotoxins: A, B,
   Cl, I), E, G, and I in a single sample. The development of the method
   included expression and purification of recombinant toxins, production
   of panels of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the toxins, and design
   and manufacturing of an experimental biochip for the screening of mAbs
   and selection of optimal pairs of primary and secondary antibodies for
   each toxin. The selected mAbs have high affinity toward their targets
   and no cross-reactivity with unrelated enterotoxins. Finally, a
   diagnostic biochip was designed for quantitative analysis of the toxins,
   and the analytical protocols were optimized. The sensitivity of the
   detection reached 0.1-0.5 ng/mL, depending on the type of enterotoxin.
   The evaluation of the resulting biochip using spiked food samples
   demonstrated that the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of
   the proposed test system fully satisfy the requirements for traditional
   immunoanalytical systems. The diagnostic biochips manufactured on
   reflecting metal-coated surfaces shortened the time of analysis from 17
   to 2 h without loss of sensitivity. The method was successfully tested
   on samples of food and biological media.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Anticonvulsant drugs have been used in the treatment of
   alcohol detoxification The purpose of the present study was to evaluate
   the efficacy and safety of zonisamide in a sample of patients presenting
   alcohol withdrawal syndrome
   Method In this 3-week randomized, flexible-dose trial 40 inpatients with
   alcohol dependence disorder received zonisamide or diazepam for
   detoxification Zonisamide was started at a dose of 400-600 mg/day (week
   1), tapering to a minimum dose of 100-300 mg/day (week 3) Diazepam was
   administered using a similar regimen (from 130-50 mg/day tapering to
   5-15 mg/day) Subjects were treated initially (weeks 1 and 2) in an
   inpatient unit and for the final week in an outpatient facility During
   the inpatient period, the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for
   Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) was used to assess the efficacy of each substance
   During the outpatient period the Clinical Institute Withdrawal
   Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale Hamilton
   Depression Rating Scale and a craving scale were used
   Results All subjects completed the study During the inpatient period
   both drugs reduced alcohol withdrawal symptoms, but the decrease was
   more marked in the zonisamide group At the end of the study (week 3)
   participants treated with zonisamide showed lower CIWA-Ar scores than
   subjects receiving diazepam Also individuals in the zonisamide group had
   less craving for alcohol less anxiety and less daytime sedation compared
   with participants treated with diazepam
   Conclusion Zonisamide can be a valuable alternative to benzodiazepines
   in the prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that anodic oxide coatings with a thickness of several to

   The prevailing phase in the coatings is ZrO2 in monoclinic and

   to 20 at \%. Distributions of titanium, zirconium, and oxygen in the
   cross sections of the coatings are obtained, and the effect of Q on the

Abstract = {{Late diagnosis of cancer in CD often occurs, and the prognosis is poor.
   The primary aim of this study was to assess the relationship between
   clinical presentation and diagnosis of intestinal adenocarcinoma in CD;
   the secondary aim was to evaluate the timing of cancer occurrence in CD
   patients.
   Medical records of 12 consecutive patients with intestinal
   adenocarcinoma in CD and of 79 consecutive CD patients undergoing bowel
   surgery were reviewed. Presentation symptoms were analyzed as possible
   predictors. Timing of intestinal adenocarcinoma occurrence in patients
   with CD was analyzed including all the 347 consecutive patients that had
   undergone surgery for CD in our institute from January 1984 to June
   2008. Life table analysis and uni/multivariate analyses were performed.
   Ten men and two women underwent surgery for intestinal cancer in CD with
   a median age of 50 years (31-68). Carcinomas were localized in the
   terminal ileum in four cases, right colon in three, transverse colon in
   one, sigmoid colon in one, rectum in two, and an anorectal fistula in
   one. Only three patients were pre-operatively diagnosed with cancer. At
   multivariate analysis only age (OR 1.057 (95\% CI 0.999-1.107), p =
   0.05) and obstruction (OR 6.530 (95\% CI 1.533-27.806), p = 0.01)
   significantly predicted cancer diagnosis. The risk rate (RR) for cancer
   occurrence started to rise at the end of the third decade of life (RR =
   0.005). The analysis of risk rate for cancer occurrence during overt CD
   showed that it is initially high at onset (RR = 0.001) and after two
   other peaks at 150 months from onset, it began to rise again. The
   presence of Crohn's colitis was associated to a significant risk of
   cancer (HR = 4.790, p = 0.009) while the use of 5-ASA resulted to be a
   protective factor against cancer occurrence (HR = 0.122, p = 0.013).
   In CD, rectal bleeding, the most common alarm symptom for intestinal
   cancer, is not useful for an early diagnosis. CD patients presenting
   with an older age and obstruction should be thoroughly investigated to
   rule out neoplastic lesions. There is probably no safe interval of CD
   where surveillance for intestinal cancer can be omitted. In the
   meantime, even in absence of active disease, all CD patients should
   undergo therapy with 5-ASA.}},

Abstract = {{Background The prognosis of recurrent or progressive medulloblastoma
   (MB) is still poor This study was designed to investigate the potential
   therapeutic benefit of combination therapy with temozolomide (TMZ) and
   oral etoposide (VP 16) in children with progressive or relapsed MB Given
   the oral administration of both drugs the regimen was administered
   outpatient
   Methods A phase I trial was conducted to establish the maximum tolerated
   dose (MTD) of TMZ and oral VP 16 This orally administered combination
   was investigated by classical 3 + 3 design Cohorts of patients were
   enrolled at four different levels (1) TMZ 120 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and VP
   16 50 mg/m(2) on days 1-8 (2) TMZ 150 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and VP 16 50

Abstract = {{Purpose For many image registration tasks, the information contained in
   the original resolution of the image data is crucial for a subsequent
   medical analysis, e. g. accurate assessment of local pulmonary
   ventilation. However, the complexity of a non-parametric registration
   scheme is directly connected to the resolution of the images. Therefore,
   the registration is often performed on a downsampled version in order to
   meet runtime demands and thereby producing suboptimal results. To enable
   the application of the highest resolution at least in regions of high
   clinical importance, an approach is presented replacing the usually
   taken equidistant grids by tensor grids for image representation.
   Methods We employ a non-parametric approach for the registration of a
   respiratory-gated 4D CT thorax scan. Tensor grids are introduced for the
   registration setting and compared to equidistant grids. For ventilation
   assessment, the Jacobian metric is explored.
   Results The application of the tensor grid approach makes the local
   usage of the original resolution feasible; thereby a smaller
   registration error is achieved in regions of higher resolution using the
   tensor grids, while the two types of grids perform similar in regions of
   equal resolution. Concerning the ventilation assessment, the Jacobian
   metric yields reasonable results, showing more detail using the tensor
   grids due to the higher resolution.
   Conclusions The proposed approach using tensor grids preserves
   registration accuracy, while reducing computational demands. The
   application of the Jacobian metric for ventilation assessment in
   conjunction with tensor grids is promising; however, due to a missing
   ground-truth the medical relevance could not be established for the
   ventilation estimation so far.}},

Title = {{Force and tactile feedback in preloaded cantilever snap-fits under
   manual assembly}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{618-628}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the tactile feedback of
   snap-fit fasteners when used in manual assembly. An important aspect of
   this assembly process is the assembler's ability to perceive the
   snap-fit's engagement. This sensing of engagement yields a high level of
   confidence that assembly is both complete and secure. Force and tactile
   feedback are critical elements in this process. Many snap-fits are used
   in conjunction with sealing elements that produce a constant force that
   remains in effect after snap-fit assembly is completed. The effect of
   sealing element preload magnitude and stiffness was studied using a test
   station, force deflection measurements, and jury pool data. A low value
   of preload with low stiffness was determined to be most favorable in
   terms of force and tactile feedback, with no preload only slightly less
   favorable. In order to sense the engagement signal of the catch, some
   resistance to assembly was found to be beneficial. A dimensionless term
   called ``engagement signal-to-hold-force ratio{''} is proposed as an
   additional way of rating the effect of assembly forces for snap-fits. It
   was found that higher signal-to-hold-force ratio, as well as higher
   values of engagement signal, corresponded to higher confidence of
   assembly among experimental subjects.
   Relevance to Industry: In the automotive industry, force and tactile
   feedback are essential for sensing the full engagement of snap-fit parts
   during the assembly of critical components, such as electrical and fuel
   system interconnects. Both the design of the snap-fit and the presence
   or absence of preload will affect force and tactile feedback. Many of
   these applications require the compression of an elastic gasket with a
   preload needed for air, fuel, or electrical isolation. Preload and
   preload stiffness factors are examined in this paper with the aim of
   achieving a better understanding of these effects so that snap-fit
   confidence of assembly and assembly robustness can be enhanced in
   industrial settings. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A disease caused by a parasitic dinoflagellate of the genus Hematodinium
   was identified in red, Paralithodes camtschaticus, and blue,
   Paralithodes platypus, king crabs from the north-east region of the Sea
   of Okhotsk, Russia, during annual stock surveys. No carapace color
   change was observed even in heavily infected crabs, but diseased crabs
   possessed creamy-yellow hemolymph, which was visible through the
   arthrodial membranes of the abdomen and appendages. Several stages of
   the parasite's life history, including trophonts, plasmodia, sporonts
   and macrodinospores, were observed in tissues of infected king crabs.
   Numerous parasite cells were observed in the lumina of the myocardium,
   the gills, the connective tissue of antennal glands and the sinuses of
   nerve ganglia, eyestalks and gastrointestinal tract of king crabs with
   gross signs of infection. Based on sequencing of the 18S rDNA, it
   appears that the Hematodinium sp. found in red and blue king crabs is
   identical or closely related to Hematodinium sp. isolated from crabs of
   the genera Chionoecetes and Lithodes. Observed prevalences were 0.33\%
   in sublegal male red king crabs, 0.18\% in female red king crabs, 0.34\%
   in sublegal male blue king crabs and 0.31\% in female blue king crabs.

Abstract = {{No study has reported on the comparative effect of adefovir (ADV) add-on
   lamivudine (LAM) versus switching to entecavir (ETV) in LAM-resistant
   patients with chronic hepatitis B. From October 2007 to September 2008,
   92 consecutive LAM-resistant patients were enrolled (47 LAM+ADV and 45
   ETV 1mg). All patients were followed for at least 12 months. The
   parameters assessed included normalization of ALT, HBeAg seroconversion,
   undetectable HBV DNA, reduction of HBV DNA, and predictors of virologic
   response. In the LAM+ADV and ETV groups, the baseline DNA levels were
   7.61 (5.19-9.49) and 7.10 (5.43-9.74) log(10) copies/ml, respectively.
   At month 12, a virologic response occurred in 18/47 (38.3\%) and 11/45
   (24.4\%; P = 0.182) patients; ALT normalization, in 39/41 (95.1\%) and
   36/40 (90.0\%; P=0.432); HBeAg seroconversion, in 5.1\% and 2.4\%
   (P=0.606); and virologic breakthrough, in 2.1\% and 11.1\% (P=0.107),
   respectively. The mean reduction from the baseline HBV DNA level was
   greater in the LAM+ADV group at month 12 (3.80 +/- 1.12 vs. 2.72 +/-
   1.32 log(10) copies/ml;P<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the
   independent parameters related to a virologic response at month 12 were
   baseline ALT (OR=1.003, 95\% CI=1.000-1.006, P=0.026) and baseline HBV
   DNA (OR=0.495, 95\% CI=0.298-0.823, P=0.007). Compared with switching to
   ETV monotherapy, ADV add-on LAM therapy was more effective at reducing
   the viral load inpatients with LAM resistance, and the baseline HBV DNA
   and ALT levels were independent predictors of the virologic response.
   However, ADV add-on therapy had limitations in patients with a higher
   baseline HBV DNA in LAM rescue therapy. J. Med. Virol. 82: 1835-1842,

Abstract = {{This paper provides a summary of an energy benchmarking study that uses
   performance data of a sample of Information Technology facilities in
   Bangalore. Information provided by the sample of occupiers was used to
   develop an Energy Performance Index (EPI) and an Annual Average hourly
   Energy Performance Index (AAhEPI), which takes into account the
   variations in operation hours and days for these facilities. The EPI and
   AAhEPI were modelled to identify the factors that influence energy
   efficiency. Employment density, size of facility, operating hours per
   week, type of chiller and age of facility were found to be significant
   factors in regression models with ER! and AAhEPI as dependent variables.
   Employment density, size of facility and operating hours per week were
   standardised and used in a separate regression analysis. Parameter
   estimates from this regression were used to normalize the EN and AAhEPI
   for variance in the independent variables. Three benchmark ranges - the
   bottom third, middle third and top third were developed for the two
   normalised indices. The normalised EPI and AAhEPI of LEED rated
   building, which were also part of the sample, indicate that, on average,
   LEED rated buildings outperform the other buildings. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Since its inception, minimal access surgery has been a
   dynamic field, experiencing successive leaps in technique and
   instrumental design. Each improvement in minimal access surgery must
   demonstrate that patients benefit from the change in approach, without
   compromising the outcome. The present study presents the technical
   considerations and strategic modifications for single-incision
   laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. We also compared the newly adopted
   single-incision laparoscopic approach with conventional multiport
   laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.
   Methods: Of the 26 patients included in the present study, 14 underwent
   single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 12 underwent
   conventional multiport sleeve gastrectomy. All procedures were performed
   by the same surgeon (A.A.S.) during a 12-month period from September
   2008 to August 2009 at Michigan State University Kalamazoo Center for
   Medical Studies.
   Results: The Mann-Whitney U tests showed with 95\% confidence that the
   difference in pain scores and length of hospital stay in the
   single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy group were statistically
   significant. A modest increase occurred in the operative time in the
   single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy group. This difference
   was the least statistically significant of all variables (P = .055).
   Conclusion: Single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was
   associated with less postoperative pain, a lower need for analgesia, and
   a decreased length of hospital stay compared with conventional multiport
   laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. This was achieved without decreasing
   the quality of surgery or the outcomes offered by the conventional
   multiport counterpart. (Surg Obes Relat Dis 2010;6: 658-664.) (C) 2010

Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{11-12}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the Garhwal region, India, the Malari leucogranite cuts the South
   Tibetan detachment system, a large-scale normal fault system at the top
   of the High Himalaya. The leucogranite crosscuts ductile normal-sense
   shear fabrics and has experienced relatively little subsolidus brittle
   deformation or alteration. Its relatively evolved bulk chemical
   composition, high Rb/Sr ratio, and normative corundum indicate a (meta)
   sedimentary source, likely the underlying Greater Himalayan sequence.
   Zircon U-Pb ages, collected by laser-ablation inductively coupled
   plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and corrected for initial U/Th
   disequilibrium, indicate emplacement at 19.0 +/- 0.5 Ma. Thus, ductile
   normal shear on the South Tibetan detachment system must have ceased by
   19 Ma. Studies elsewhere in the Himalaya suggest initiation of South
   Tibetan detachment system ductile movement not earlier than 24 Ma, and
   likely ca. 22 Ma. The short duration of extension (<= 5 and likely
   similar to 3 m.y.) and early cessation contrast with channel-flow models
   that predict long-duration ductile normal shear, and large displacements
   after ca. 20 Ma. Observations are instead better explained by critical
   taper models, in which internal weakening of the wedge, likely from
   partial melting, caused a brief interval of flattening and ductile
   extension in the rear of the wedge.}},

Abstract = {{It is evident that complex animate materials, which operate far from
   equilibrium, exhibit sensory responses to the environment through
   emergent patterns. Formation of such patterns is often the underlying
   mechanism of an active response to environmental changes and can be
   interpreted as a result of the distributed parallel information
   processing taking place within the material. Such emergent patterns are
   not limited to biological entities; indeed there is a wide range of
   complex nonlinear dissipative systems which exhibit interesting emergent
   patterns within a range of parameters. As one example, the present paper
   describes the detection of emergent phenomena associated with surface
   electrochemical processes that allow the system to respond to input
   information through evolving patterns in space and time. Associative
   mapping of this sort offers the opportunity to devise an electrochemical
   cognitive system (ECS), where pattern formation can be looked at as a
   macroscopic phenomenon resulting from the extensive distributive
   computing that occurs at the microscopic level. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in
   methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene are associated with
   prostate cancer risk.
   METHODS. We genotyped three MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T, A1298C, and
   G1793A) and measured serum total homocysteine (tHcy), folate, and
   vitamin B12 levels in a case control study of 174 cases and 348 normal
   healthy controls. The cancer-free controls were frequency matched to the
   cases by age (+/- 2 years), educational level, occupational status,
   ethnicity, and smoking status.
   RESULTS. We found that the MTHFR 677TT and 1298CC genotypes were
   associated with an about 40\% reduction in risk of prostate cancer
   (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95\% CI = 0.41-0.94, and adjusted OR = 0.58, 95\%
   CI = 0.32-0.91, respectively) compared to the 677CC, and 1298AA
   genotypes. The combined variant genotypes of 1298AC + 677CC were
   associated with a 30\% reduction in risk of prostate cancer (OR = 0.70;
   95\% Cl = 0.53-0.79). In contrast, the variant genotypes of 1793GA +
   677CT were associated with slightly increased risk for prostate cancer
   (OR = 1.64; 95\% Cl = 0.86-2.15). Regarding prostate cancer
   aggressiveness, the 677TT genotype was associated with more than 50\%
   decreased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score >7) compared
   with the 677CC and 677CT genotypes (OR = 0.35,95\% Cl = 0.24-0.64; P =
   0.001). There was no significant difference in plasma levels of tHcy,
   folate, and vitamin B12 between the two groups with any genotypes.
   CONCLUSION. These data suggest that all three MTHFR polymorphisms may
   play a pivotal role in the developing prostate cancer. Larger studies in
   different ethnic populations and incorporating dietary folate intake are
   needed to replicate our findings. Prostate 70: 1645-1657, 2010. (C) 2010

   2002, lust after International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial was reported
   RESAT 2 to RESAT 7 were conducted annually between 2003 and 2008 Among
   5,624 patients with ruptured aneurysms treated within 14 days after
   onset, 4,782 patients were treated by dome embolization using platinum

   included 35 8\% aged over 70 years, 36 6\% with posterior circulation
   aneurysms, and 29 3\% with poor grades (Hunt and Kosnik grades IV and V)
   The proportion of patients aged over 70 years tended to increase each

   (good recovery and moderate disability) at discharge was obtained in 88
   0\% of grade I-III cases and 73 6\% of grade I-V cases Procedure-related
   morbidity was 2 9\% and mortality was 0 8\% Despite this survey
   involving high proportions of aged, posterior circulation, and
   poor-grade patients, the technical success rate and immediate clinical
   results were relatively favorable The patient prognosis and aneurysm
   changes must be investigated over a longer period, together with the

Title = {{Placental surface shape, function, and effects of maternal and fetal
   vascular pathology}},
Journal = {{PLACENTA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{958-962}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Goal: In clinical practice, variability of placental surface shape is
   common. We measure the average placental shape in a birth cohort and the
   effect deviations from the average have on placental functional
   efficiency. We test whether altered placental shape improves the
   specificity of histopathology diagnoses of maternal uteroplacental and
   fetoplacental vascular pathology for clinical outcomes.
   Materials and methods: 1225 Placentas from a prospective cohort had
   chorionic plate digital photographs with perimeters marked at 1-2 cm
   intervals. After exclusions of pre-term (n = 202) and velamentous cord
   insertion (n = 44), 979 (95.7\%) placentas were analyzed. Median shape
   and mean perimeter were estimated. The relationship of fetal and
   placental weight was used as an index of placental efficiency termed
   ``beta{''}. The principal placental histopathology diagnoses of maternal
   uteroplacental and fetoplacental vascular pathologies were coded by
   review of individual lesion scores. Acute fetal inflammation was scored
   as a ``negative control{''} pathology not expected to affect shape.
   ANOVA with Bonferroni tests for subgroup comparisons were used.
   Results: The mean placental chorionic shape at term was round with a
   radius estimated at 9.1 cm. Increased variability of the placental shape
   was associated with lower placental functional efficiency. After
   stratifying on placental shape, the presence of either maternal
   uteroplacental or fetoplacental vascular pathology was significantly
   associated with lower placental efficiency only when shape was abnormal.
   Conclusions: Quantifying abnormality of placental shape is a meaningful
   clinical tool. Abnormal shapes are associated with reduced placental
   efficiency. We hypothesize that such shapes reflect deformations of
   placental vascular architecture, and that an abnormal placental shape
   serves as a marker of maternal uteroplacental and/or fetoplacental
   vascular pathology of sufficiently long standing to impact placental
   (and by extension, potentially fetal) development. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The ability of beta-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin,

   of meloxicam through isolated rat skin was evaluated. Carrier complex
   were prepared by kneading method in 1: 1 and 1: 2 in molar ratios for
   beta- cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and in 1: 1, 1: 3
   and 1: 5 in weight ratios for polyvinyl pyrrolidone and urea. The
   complexes were characterized by IR, DSC and evaluated for solubility,
   dissolution and skin permeability. The solubility, dissolution and
   permeability of meloxicam were enhanced by using the carriers. The
   influence of cyclodextrins, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and urea on in vitro
   permeation of meloxicam through rat skin was investigated by
   incorporation of prepared carrier complex in 1\% carbopol gel. The
   prepared gel was evaluated for drug content, pH and viscosity and in
   vitro permeation. All the percutaneous parameters like flux (Jss),
   amount permeated (Q(6)), diffusivity (D), permeability coefficient
   (K-P), partition coefficient (K) and release rate constant (k) were
   calculated statistically. In vitro permeation study showed the trend
   that the penetration flux and enhancement factor increases with
   increasing concentration of beta-cyclodextrin and
   hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin and then decrease dramatically in case
   of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin gel formulation with the increase to
   1: 2 ratio. Similar changes in pattern of permeation were also observed
   with polyvinyl pyrrolidone and urea carrier complex. These findings
   concluded that the carriers cyclodextrins, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and

Abstract = {{Background: Despite the extensive published data regarding the use of
   drains in surgery, it is still controversial. Most bariatric surgeons
   use drains as routinely. However, drains have sometimes have been shown
   to be unhelpful and even to increase the anastomotic leak rates. The
   purpose of the present study was to evaluate the peritoneal inflammatory
   response in the presence of a drain left in place until the seventh
   postoperative day after bariatric surgery.
   Methods: All patients who underwent open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from
   February 2007 to August 2008 were prospectively evaluated. A 24F Blake
   drain was left in place for 7 days. The peritoneal effluent from the
   drain was collected for the determination of cytokine levels and for
   microbiologic analysis.
   Results: A total of 107 obese patients were studied. A marked increase
   in the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta was
   observed by the seventh postoperative day, even in patients without any
   abdominal complications. Bacterial contamination of the peritoneal
   effluent was also demonstrated.
   Conclusion: The results of our study have shown that at 7 days after
   surgery, a marked peritoneal inflammatory response and bacterial
   contamination are present. These findings could have resulted from the
   use of the drain for 7 postoperative days. (Surg Obes Relat Dis

   (PARP1) at the telomeres, forming several ADP-ribose polymers that
   co-localize with the telomeric repeat binding factor 1 protein and are
   inhibited by selective PARP(s) inhibitors or PARP1-specific small
   interfering RNAs. The knockdown of PARP1 prevents repairing of
   RHPS4-induced telomere DNA breaks, leading to increases in chromosome
   abnormalities and eventually to the inhibition of tumor cell growth both
   in vitro and in xenografts. More interestingly, the integration of a
   TOPO1 inhibitor on the combination treatment proved to have a high
   therapeutic efficacy ensuing a complete regression of the tumor as well
   as a significant increase in overall survival and cure of mice even when
   treatments started at a very late stage of tumor growth. Overall, this
   work reveals the unexplored link between the PARP1 and G-quadruplex
   ligands and demonstrates the excellent efficacy of a multi-component
   strategy based on the use of PARP inhibitors in telomere-based therapy.

Title = {{Lack of alpha-Xylosidase Activity in Arabidopsis Alters Xyloglucan
   Composition and Results in Growth Defects}},

Abstract = {{Xyloglucan is the main hemicellulose in the primary cell walls of most
   seed plants and is thought to play a role in regulating the separation
   of cellulose microfibrils during growth. Xylose side chains block the
   degradation of the backbone, and alpha-xylosidase activity is necessary
   to remove them. Two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant lines with
   insertions in the alpha-xylosidase gene AtXYL1 were characterized in
   this work. Both lines showed a reduction to undetectable levels of
   alpha-xylosidase activity against xyloglucan oligosaccharides. This
   reduction resulted in the accumulation of XXXG and XXLG in the liquid
   growth medium of Atxyl1 seedlings. The presence of XXLG suggests that it
   is a poor substrate for xyloglucan beta-galactosidase. In addition, the
   polymeric xyloglucan of Atxyl1 lines was found to be enriched in XXLG
   subunits, with a concomitant decrease in XXFG and XLFG. This change can
   be explained by extensive exoglycosidase activity at the nonreducing
   ends of xyloglucan chains. These enzymes could thus have a larger role
   than previously thought in the metabolism of xyloglucan. Finally, Atxyl1
   lines showed a reduced ability to control the anisotropic growth pattern
   of different organs, pointing to the importance of xyloglucan in this
   process. The promoter of AtXYL1 was shown to direct expression to many
   different organs and cell types undergoing cell wall modifications,
   including trichomes, vasculature, stomata, and elongating anther
   filaments.}},

   portion of a complex of late Holocene ice-cored moraines at the terminus
   of the Klutlan Glacier in southwestern Yukon. Supraglacial debris is
   subject to continuing disturbance by mass wasting and erosion as the
   underlying glacial ice melts, creating a complex mosaic of vegetation
   and soil types. Patches of mature spruce forest with thick (>20 cm)
   forest floors on Brunisolic soils are juxtaposed with Regosols covered
   by shrubs or discontinuous biological soil crusts. This pedological
   diversity will persist until the underlying glacial ice has completely
   melted. Overall, the moderate degree of weathering of the tephra is
   similar to that observed in Brunsolic and Cryosolic soils formed on this
   material elsewhere in southern Yukon. Although ephemeral, this pedogenic
   setting has likely occurred repeatedly in northwestern North America,
   given the level of volcanic activity and glacier extent during the

Abstract = {{We present a general model for a multi-step regenerative irreversible
   Brayton cycle on thermodynamic basis. The model incorporates an
   arbitrary number or turbines and compressors with reheating and
   intercooling intermediate processes. We consider several internal and
   external irreversibility sources that include losses in the
   non-isentropic turbines and compressors, pressure drops in the heat
   input and heat release, irreversibilities in the regenerative heat
   exchanger, heat-leak through the plant to the ambient and non-ideal
   couplings with the external constant-temperature heat reservoirs. The
   general equations for power output and efficiency depend on a reasonable
   low number of parameters, with a clear physical meaning, that account
   for cycle design and geometry, and for the characterization of
   irreversibilities. From this general model several results found in the
   literature could be considered as particular or limit cases. Moreover,
   we explicitly compare our theoretical results with computer simulation
   results in the literature for particular plant arrangements where the
   number of turbines and compressors is not the same. Also, we analyze the
   maximum power and maximum efficiency working regimes in terms of
   internal and external irreversibilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Based on empirical research about teamwork in human service
   organizations in Sweden, the concept of collaborative health (CH)
   encapsulates the physical, psychological and social health resources the
   individual uses in teamwork; resources which at the same time are
   influenced by the teamwork. My argument built on empirical research
   leading up to identifying and defining the core concept in this article,
   is that teamwork affects team members' health and this in turn affects
   the teamwork and its outcome. In this paper collaborative health is
   viewed from a social constructionism perspective and discussed in
   relation to earlier concepts developed in social psychology and working
   life research, including psychosocial stress and burnout. The paper also
   introduces the concept of functional synergy, which in this context is
   defined as the simultaneous presence of sharp goal-orientation and
   synergy in teamwork. The need for a holistic team theory is emphasized
   as a tool in research on teamwork. Such a theory relies on identifying
   sound and illuminating constituent concepts. I suggest that
   collaborative health could be a useful concept for better understanding
   the complex collaborative and co-operative teamwork of human service
   organizations of today.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The objective of this study was to compare the degrees of
   skeletal and dental asymmetry between subjects with Class II subdivision
   malocclusions and subjects with normal occlusions by using cone-beam
   computed tomography. Methods: Thirty subjects with Angle Class II
   subdivision malocclusions (mean age, 13.99 years) and 30 subjects with
   normal occlusions (mean age, 14.32 years) were assessed with
   3-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography scans. Independent t tests
   were used to compare orthogonal, linear, and angular measurements
   between sides and between groups. Results: Total mandibular length and
   ramus height were shorter on the Class II side. Pogonion, menton, and
   the mandibular dental midline were deviated toward the Class II side.
   Gonion and the anterior condyle landmark were positioned more
   posteriorly on the Class II side. The mandibular dental landmarks were
   located more latero-postero-superiorly, and the maxillary dental
   landmarks more latero-antero-superiorly on the Class II side. There was
   loss of maxillary arch length, and the mandibular molar was closer to
   the ramus on the Class II side. Conclusions: The etiology of Class II
   subdivision malocclusions is primarily due to an asymmetric mandible
   that is shorter and positioned posteriorly on the Class II side. A
   mesially positioned maxillary molar and a distally positioned mandibular
   molar on the Class II side are also minor contributing factors. (Am J

Abstract = {{A group of children aged 6-17 years was recruited and followed up for 12
   months to study the impact of schistosome infection on malaria parasite
   prevalence, density, distribution and anemia. Levels of cytokines,
   malaria specific antibodies in plasma and parasite growth inhibition
   capacities were assessed. Baseline results suggested an increased
   prevalence of malaria parasites in children co-infected with
   schistosomiasis (31\%) compared to children infected with malaria only
   (25\%) (p=0.064). Moreover, children co-infected with schistosomes and
   malaria had higher sexual stage geometric mean malaria parasite density
   (189 gametocytes/mu l) than children infected with malaria only (73/mu l
   gametocytes) (p=0.043). In addition, a larger percentage of co-infected
   children (57\%) had gametocytes as observed by microscopy compared to
   the malaria only infected children (36\%) (p=0.06). There was no
   difference between the two groups in terms of the prevalence of anemia,
   which was approximately 64\% in both groups (p=0.9). Plasma from
   malaria-infected children exhibited higher malaria antibody activity
   compared to the controls (p=0.001) but was not different between malaria
   and schistosome plus malaria infected groups (p=0.44) and malaria
   parasite growth inhibition activity at baseline was higher in the
   malaria-only infected group of children than in the co-infected group
   though not reaching statistical significance (p=0.5). Higher prevalence
   and higher mean gametocyte density in the peripheral blood may have
   implications in malaria transmission dynamics during co-infection with
   helminths.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, basic design features of Rayon are documented. One of the
   new design features presented in this work is the Way Rayon handles
   polyhedral grids. Grid definition is combined with the definition of the
   structure of the sparse coefficient matrix, thereby releasing a
   considerable part of the memory used by the grid to store otherwise
   required faces belonging to the cell part of the connectivity
   description. The key idea is to use a uniform way for creating the
   structure of the coefficient matrix from the grid connectivity
   description and to access that data when computing the elements of the
   coefficient matrix. This saving requires many modifications to the
   computational algorithm details, which are addressed. Computational
   method features include a SIMPLE-based pressure-velocity coupling and
   co-located variable arrangement in which all flow variables are stored
   at cell centers, and mass fluxes are stored on face centers. Also
   handling convective and diffusive fluxes is described. The throughput is
   benchmark validated and shows second order truncation properties, both
   in time and space.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to test of effect of treatment with
   fungicides and its combination with hydrothermal on the conservation and
   pos-harvest quality of `Palmer' mangoes (Mangifera indica L.) stored at
   atmosphere conditions for 12 days. The fruits had been harvested in the
   stages of physiological maturation (purple-red rind), transferred to the
   laboratory where they were separated by color and absence of injuries
   and then underwent hydrothermal (53 degrees C for 10') and/or chemical
   treatment with the fungicides dodecil dimethyl ammonium chloride at 120
   ppm (12\%) and imazalil at 1000 ppm (50\%). After drying, fruits were
   stored at room temperature (23 +/- 2 degrees C, 63 +/- 5\% RH) for 12
   days and analyzed every three days for rots, appearance, coloration of
   the rind and the pulp, weight and firmness loss, respiratory rate, and
   levels of soluble solids, titable acidity and ascorbic acid in the pulp.
   The experiment was arranged in completely randomized design, in a 5 x 5
   factorial scheme, with 4 replicates. Experimental units comprised nine
   fruits. No withering signs were observed in any of the treatments until
   the sixth day of storage. The combination of hydrothermal and fungicide
   treatments were not efficient in controlling rots. A shelf life of ten
   days was observed in `Palmer' mangoes stored at 23 degrees C, which was
   limited by fruit appearance.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical weather prediction ensembles are routinely used for
   operational weather forecasting. The members of these ensembles are
   individual simulations with either slightly perturbed initial conditions
   or different model parameterizations, or occasionally both. Multi-member
   ensemble output is usually large, multivariate, and challenging to
   interpret interactively. Forecast meteorologists are interested in
   understanding the uncertainties associated with numerical weather
   prediction; specifically variability between the ensemble members.
   Currently, visualization of ensemble members is mostly accomplished
   through spaghetti plots of a single midtroposphere pressure surface
   height contour. In order to explore new uncertainty visualization
   methods, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to
   create a 48-hour, 18 member parameterization ensemble of the 13 March
   1993 ``Superstorm{''}. A tool was designed to interactively explore the
   ensemble uncertainty of three important weather variables: water-vapor
   mixing ratio, perturbation potential temperature, and perturbation
   pressure. Uncertainty was quantified using individual ensemble member
   standard deviation, inter-quartile range, and the width of the 95\%
   confidence interval. Bootstrapping was employed to overcome the
   dependence on normality in the uncertainty metrics. A coordinated view
   of ribbon and glyph-based uncertainty visualization, spaghetti plots,
   iso-pressure colormaps, and data transect plots was provided to two
   meteorologists for expert evaluation. They found it useful in assessing
   uncertainty in the data, especially in finding outliers in the ensemble
   run and therefore avoiding the WRF parameterizations that lead to these
   outliers. Additionally, the meteorologists could identify spatial
   regions where the uncertainty was significantly high, allowing for
   identification of poorly simulated storm environments and physical
   interpretation of these model issues.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The aim of the study was to assess the susceptibility of
   Salmonella strains to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum
   (NHS) and to analyze the outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles.
   Material and Methods. The clinical strain Klebsiella pneumoniae 20 and
   six Salmonella enterica strains - S. Enteritidis 518, S. Typhimurium 244
   and S. Hadar 55 and their ESBL+ transconjugants S. Enteritidis 518/20,
   S. Typhimurium 244/20 and S. Hadar 55/20, obtained wall K. pneumoniae 20
   as the donor of ESBL plasmid were used. The bactericidal activity of NHS
   was determined as described by Jankowski et al. Isolation of the OMPs
   was performed according to the procedure described by Murphy and Bartos.
   Discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) gel electrophoresis was
   carried out as described by Laemmli.
   Results. This study examined the susceptibility of Salmonella recipient
   strains and their ESBL+ transconjugants belonging to three serovars -
   Enteritidis, Typhimurium and Hadar - to NHS. It was shown that the
   recipient strains (S. Enteritidis 518, S. Typhimurium 244, and S. Hadar
   55) and the ESBL conjugative plasmid donor strain (K. pneumoniae 20)
   were resistant to the bactericidal action of NHS, whereas three
   Salmonella transconjugants identified as ESBL producers (S. Enteritidis
   518/20, S. Typhimurium 244/20 and S. Hadar 55/20) demonstrated high
   sensitivity to serum. SDS-PAGE gel analysis showed that the parental
   strains and transconjugants exhibited different outer membrane protein
   patterns. The observed changes included the presence or absence of
   particular proteins.
   Conclusions. It seems that the acquisition of new plasmids may have
   unfavorable consequences for pathogenic bacteria and increase their
   susceptibility to serum activity (Adv Clin Exp Med 2010, 19, 6,
   669-677).}},

Title = {{Analysis of Air Pollution from Swine Production by Using Air Dispersion

Abstract = {{Swine production, the second most important contributor to Quebec's
   agricultural revenue, faces many problems. Intensive piggeries, with up
   to 599 animal units, are used to raise finishing pigs for slaughter.
   Among the great number of gaseous species emitted to the atmospheric
   environment from livestock buildings and manure storage units is NH3,
   which is one of the most important and most offensive with respect to
   human health. Under appropriate meteorological and topographical
   conditions, gaseous contaminants can spread and cause a public
   nuisance-up to a 1-km radius around the farm. To mitigate these effects,
   the Quebec Government adopted regulations that set minimum buffer
   distances to be observed by any expansion of an existing or new pig
   farm. The objectives of this study were (i) to assess the efficiency of
   the current buffer distance prescriptions in Quebec in mitigating
   effects of air pollution from swine units and (ii) to identify,
   potential areas for establishing pig farm operations that will not be
   offensive to people. The air dispersion American Meteorological
   Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) with
   receptors distributed at 1.6 km around each source was used first,
   followed by a spatial geographic information system (GIS) model. Results
   from the dispersion model showed that the highest hourly concentration
   with a 99.5\% compliance frequency for a single farm was 3078.1 mu
   g/m(3) and exceeded the NH3 odor criterion hourly standard set by the
   Quebec Government at 183.4 mu g/m(3). Thus, for public safety, densely
   populated areas like housing developments must be located >1300 m from a
   pig farm. This distance is in the range of setback distances (723 to
   1447 m) obtained by using abacuses defined in the L'Erable Regional
   County Municipality. That is why we can say the current rules
   established by the Quebec Government, if rigorously applied, can prevent
   odor nuisance, due to NH3 emission, from swine farms. In the spatial
   model, buffer zones were established around houses, roads, waterways,
   and drinking water intakes. By combining layers of information in the
   ArcGIS Model Builder, potential areas in which pig farms can be
   installed, without public odor nuisance, were identified.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of temperature on
   cerebral oxygen metabolism at total body flow bypass and antegrade
   cerebral perfusion (ACP). Neonatal piglets were put on cardiopulmonary
   bypass (CPB) with the initial flow rate of 200 mL/kg/min. After cooling
   to 18 degrees C (n = 6) or 25 degrees C (n = 7), flow was reduced to 100
   mL/kg/min (half-flow, HF) for 15 min and ACP was initiated at 40
   mL/kg/min for 45 min. Following rewarming, animals were weaned from
   bypass and survived for 4 h. At baseline, HF, ACP, and 4 h post-CPB,
   cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using fluorescent microspheres.
   Cerebral oxygen extraction (CEO2) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
   (CMRO2) were monitored. Regional cranial oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) was
   continuously recorded throughout the procedure using near-infrared
   spectroscopy. At 18 degrees C, CBF trended lower at HF and ACP and
   matched baseline after CPB. CEO2 trended lower at HF and ACP, and
   trended higher after CPB compared with baseline. CMRO2 at ACP matched
   that at HF. Cranial rSO(2) was significantly greater at HF and ACP (P <
   0.001, P < 0.001) and matched baseline after CPB. At 25 degrees C, CBF
   trended lower at HF, rebounded and trended higher at ACP, and matched
   baseline after CPB. CEO2 was equal at HF and ACP and trended higher
   after CPB compared with baseline. CMRO2 at ACP was greater than that at
   HF (P = 0.001). Cranial rSO(2) was significantly greater at HF (P =
   0.01), equal at ACP, and lower after CPB (P = 0.03). Lactate was
   significantly higher at all time points (P = 0.036, P < 0.001, and P <
   0.001). ACP provided sufficient oxygen to the brain at a total body flow
   rate of 100 mL/kg/min at deep hypothermia. Although ACP provided minimum
   oxygenation to the brain which met the oxygen requirement, oxygen
   metabolism was altered during ACP at moderate hypothermia. ACP strategy
   at moderate hypothermia needs further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{High grade primary CNS gliomas hold some of the worst prognoses of any
   malignancy, with the vast majority of patients dying within two years of
   diagnosis, even with aggressive modern treatments. Surgical resection
   and radiotherapy are cornerstones of treatment when possible. In spite
   of many years of research, only recently has management with
   chemotherapy been able to prolong survival in patients with high grade
   gliomas, albeit only modestly at best. Topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors
   target an enzyme critical for DNA replication and cell-cycle
   progression; they cross the blood-brain barrier and have antitumor
   activity against glioblastoma cells in vitro. The most frequently
   associated toxicities are neutropenia and diarrhea, but are often
   manageable. The two most used agents are irinotecan and topotecan. Due
   to enhanced cytochrome CY3A4/5 enzyme activity, irinotecan dose must be
   adjusted with concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug usage; the
   data is less clear regarding the effects on topotecan. Clinical trials
   in patients with recurrent malignant glioma have evaluated TOP1
   inhibitors as monotherapy and in combination with other agents. There is
   evidence for using topotecan with radiotherapy. Irinotecan has limited
   efficacy as monotherapy, but shows promise in combination with other
   agents, particularly temozolomide and bevacizumab. Newer generation TOP1
   inhibitors are currently being evaluated in phase I trials. TOP1
   inhibitors show promising activity in patients with primary CNS
   malignancies and warrant further study.}},

Abstract = {{The mature protease from Group N human immunodeficiency virus Type 1
   (HIV-1) (PR1(N)) differs in 20 amino acids from the extensively studied
   Group M protease (PRIM) at positions corresponding to minor
   drug-resistance mutations (DRMs). The first crystal structure (1.09
   angstrom resolution) of PR1(N) with the clinical inhibitor darunavir
   (DRV) reveals the same overall structure as PR1(M), but with a slightly
   larger inhibitor-binding cavity. Changes in the 10s loop and the flap
   hinge propagate to shift one flap away from the inhibitor, whereas L89F
   and substitutions in the 60s loop perturb inhibitor-binding residues
   29-32. However, kinetic parameters of PR1(N) closely resemble those of
   PR1(M), and calorimetric results are consistent with similar binding
   affinities for DRV and two other clinical PIs, suggesting that minor
   DRMs coevolve to compensate for the detrimental effects of drug-specific
   major DRMs. A miniprecursor (TFR1-61-PR1(N)) comprising the transframe
   region (TFR) fused to the N-terminus of PR1(N) undergoes autocatalytic
   cleavage at the TFR/PR1(N) site concomitant with the appearance of
   catalytic activity characteristic of the dimeric, mature enzyme. This
   cleavage is inhibited at an equimolar ratio of precursor to DRV (similar
   to 6 mu M), which partially stabilizes the precursor dimer from a
   monomer. However, cleavage at L34/W35 within the TFR, which precedes the
   TFR1-61/PR1(N) cleavage at pH <= 5, is only partially inhibited.
   Favorable properties of PR1(N) relative to PR1(M) include its
   suitability for column fractionation by size under native conditions and
   >10-fold higher dimer dissociation constant (150 nM). Exploiting these
   properties may facilitate testing of potential dimerization inhibitors
   that perturb early precursor processing steps.}},

Abstract = {{We review the basic microscopic phenomena controlling the extraction of
   energy from the active regions of terahertz quantum cascade lasers.
   Using time-resolved microprobe photoluminescence, we measure the
   in-plane (v(//)) and cross-plane (v perpendicular to) heat transfer
   velocities and find a strong anisotropy, with v(//) slightly reduced by
   30\% and v perpendicular to reduced by a factor of 6.5 with respect to
   the corresponding bulk values. Combining this information with
   measurements of the cross-plane thermal conductivity enables us to
   estimate a phonon mean free path value L similar to 70 nm at 80 K,
   reduced by about one order of magnitude with respect to the bulk value
   in GaAs, but much larger than the average spacing between the interfaces
   in the active region. The latter finding is consistent with a heat
   transport model considering both thermal boundary resistance and phonon
   dispersion modification. (C) 2010 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{After creation of a dialysis access a steal phenomenon (retrograde flow
   in the artery distal to the arteriovenous anastomosis) and mild symptoms
   of ischemia are frequently observed, whereas severe clinically relevant
   steal syndromes rarely occur. A thorough examination of the venous and
   arterial vascular systems allows the individual risk of developing a
   steal syndrome to be estimated. This should be taken into account when
   planning an arteriovenous access in order to minimize the risk as
   details of the access creation can play an important role during the
   later course. After development of a relevant steal syndrome the
   necessity of a correction of the arteriovenous access is determined by
   the character and extent of complaints. All therapeutic efforts aim at a
   relief of symptoms of peripheral ischemia while preserving a functional
   arteriovenous access. Flow and location of an arteriovenous access
   determine the correct procedure for correction. The underlying
   principles are the termination of the retrograde flow distal to the
   arteriovenous anastomosis, the creation of large caliber artificial
   collaterals (bypass) and the transposition of the arteriovenous
   anastomosis to a bigger, more proximal feeding artery.}},

Abstract = {{Run-out distances and flow velocities of snow avalanches are mainly
   determined by frictional processes originating from the interaction with
   the ground. At the SLF snow chute at the Weissfluhjoch near Davos, a
   setup was developed which allowed us to record high-speed movies of the
   basal shear layer of small-scale avalanches with a frame rate of 1000
   frames per second. Shear processes could be observed in high-resolution
   slow motion. Downstream velocity profiles were extracted by a pattern
   matching algorithm. The comparison of computed profiles with velocity
   profiles obtained from optical sensors showed good agreement. However,
   the temporal and spatial resolutions are much higher for the high-speed
   video data. Because the optical velocity sensors are one-dimensional, we
   found that they overestimate the velocities when a flow-normal velocity
   component exists as well. All measured velocity profiles exhibited very
   high shear rates near the ground. The maximum shear rates were up to
   600/s for dry snow and 200/s for wet snow avalanches. The observations
   of the video images suggested a turbulent motion of the snow in the
   basal shear layer. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are a qualitative diagramming language for
   representing feedback-driven systems. One of their conceptual
   cornerstones-polarity-has been critiqued for some shortcomings. However,
   their use has not diminished, and polarity, as well as the relationship
   between behaviour and events continues to be used in a pragmatic way. A
   definition of how events relate to behaviour is proposed for a world of
   continuous behaviour. Then, several previously unconsidered limitations
   of CLDs are discussed, which prove to be closer to the event-related
   thinking and therefore provide little help in avoiding faulty thinking
   about the behavioural consequences of causal structure. Also, the
   reasons underlying previously discussed limitations of CLDs become
   clear. Polarity is shown to be an interface between behaviour and
   structure. Inexperienced users need external help to use polarity in
   going from behaviour to structure and back. Such help could come from
   incorporating behaviour-over-time (BOT) graphs into the diagrams.

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Given the potential environmental consequences of dumped dredged harbour
   sediments it is vital to establish the potential risks from exposure
   before disposal at sea. Currently, European legislation for disposal of
   contaminated sediments at sea is based on chemical analysis of a limited
   number of well-known contaminants for which maximum acceptable
   concentrations, action levels (ALs), have been set. The present paper
   addresses the issue of the applicability of in vitro and in vivo
   bioassays for hazard, risk and local impact assessment of dredged
   polluted sediments to be disposed of at sea. It discusses how and to
   what extent selected bioassays can fill in the gaps left open by
   chemical analysis and the way in which the bioassays may contribute to
   the present licensing system for disposal. Three different purposes for
   application were distinguished: the most basic application (A) is a
   rapid determination of the hazard (potential toxicity) of dredged
   sediments which is then compared to ALs in a licensing system. As with
   chemical analysis on whole sediment extracts, the bioavailability of the
   chemicals is not taken into account. As in vitro assays with sediment
   extracts are not sensitive to matrix effects, a selection of specific in
   vitro bioassays can be suitable fast and standardized additions for the
   licensing system. When the outcome of (A) does not convincingly
   demonstrate whether the sediment is clean enough or too polluted,
   further bioanalysis can help the decision making process (B). More
   aspects of the mostly unknown complex chemical mixtures are taken into
   account, including the bioavailability and chronic toxicity focusing on
   ecologically relevant endpoints. The ecotoxicological pressure imposed
   by the dredged sediments can be quantified as the potentially affected
   fraction (PAF) based on chemical or biological analysis of levels of
   contaminants in sediment or biota. To validate the predicted risk, the
   actual impact of dumped harbour sediments on local ecosystems (C) can be
   determined using a dedicated set of in vitro and in vivo bioassays as
   well as bio-indicators selected based on the information obtained from
   (A) and (B) and on the characteristics of the local ecosystem.
   Conversely, the local sediment impact assessment (C) can direct
   fine-tuning of the selection of chemical and bioassay analyses and for
   setting safe levels in the licensing system. It is concluded that in
   vitro and in vivo bioassays and biological indicators are useful tools
   in the process of hazard, ecotoxicological risk and impact assessment of
   dredged harbour sediments, provided they are consciously chosen and
   quality criteria for assay performance are defined. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   comparison with usual care. Two types of study were compared: (i) those
   using disease activity monitoring with protocolized treatment
   adjustments, and (ii) those using disease activity monitoring without
   protocolized treatment adjustments. The databases PubMed and Cochrane
   were searched from 1995 up to 2009. Primary outcome measure was the mean
   change in the 28-joint DAS (DAS-28), which was used in a random-effects
   meta-analysis.
   Results. Six controlled trials regarding tight control in RA patients
   were included in the meta-analysis. In all trials, patients treated in
   the tight control arms had significantly higher DAS-28 responses than
   patients treated according to usual care {[}weighted mean difference
   (WMD) = 0.59, P < 0.001]. Moreover, tight control was significantly more
   effective (P < 0.001) by means of protocolized treatment adjustments
   (WMD = 0.97) compared with non-protocolized monitoring of disease
   activity (WMD = 0.25).
   Conclusion. Tight control in RA resulted in significantly better
   clinical outcomes than usual care. It is suggested but not proved that
   tight control with protocolized treatment adjustments is more beneficial
   than if no such protocol is used.}},

Abstract = {{Methods: A pre-packed vacuum mixing system (Optipac (R)) was compared
   with two standard systems (Palamix (R) and Easymix (R)) regarding MMA
   emission. The latter systems require loading with the bone cement
   compounds prior to mixing. Following a standardized procedure, 10 mixes
   were performed with each system and the emission of MMA vapours in the
   breathing zone was recorded using photoionization detection over a
   period of 3 min.
   Results: The mean MMA exposure was reduced when using the pre-packed
   system compared to the devices that require filling with the components.
   The highest emission peaks were recorded during the mixing and
   preparation steps in all systems.
   Conclusions: Modern pre-packed vacuum mixing systems further help to
   reduce the occupational hazards created by bone cement preparation.
   However, MMA fumes can still be detected using this technique. Although
   this is an important step in reducing MMA exposure in the operating
   theatre, further technical effort has to be taken to eliminate the
   continuous leakage of monomer from the devices while mixing and to
   minimize necessary manipulation for final delivery.}},

Abstract = {{The grammar of institutions developed by Crawford and Ostrom presents a
   common syntax for analysing institutions and dismantles them into their
   components. This is a promising undertaking given the huge diversity of
   definitions of institutions, even within a single discipline.
   Additionally, the grammar opens a long existing black box regarding why
   individuals do or do not follow an institution. It differentiates
   between formal sanctions ('or elses' in the language of the grammar)
   which are already well analysed and more moral and emotion based factors
   (so called delta parameters). This process of differentiation is
   currently widely observed, particularly in economics. Recognising that
   it is a necessary step forward in analysing institutions, this paper
   analyses and develops the grammar: first, in relation to its syntactical
   clearness; and second, in relation to its particular emphasis on delta
   parameters as central elements for understanding the efficiency and
   effectiveness of institutions.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of dog health is based, at least initially, on observations
   made by health care providers, veterinarians and veterinary technicians,
   and pet owners when they provide history upon presentation of their pet.
   It is therefore important to understand how attachment relationships to
   companion dogs affect the health reports made by pet owners, and how
   health reports are based on multiple facets of companion dog existence.
   The aim of the research was to develop reliable and valid
   multidimensional assessments regarding the quality of life (QoL) and the
   human animal bond (HAB) of companion dog. The first study obtained QoL
   and HAB ratings from 500 owners of companion dogs (a normative sample),
   and the subsequent study obtained ratings from 300 owners of companion
   dogs with an illness that required medical treatment and/or a
   special/prescription diet. Study I revealed that HAB did not influence
   general health ratings above and beyond those predicted by QoL. However,
   Study 2 revealed that, along with QoL, aspects of the HAB predicted
   health evaluations of ill companion dogs. In both studies psychological
   aspects of QoL predicted companion dog health ratings. We also found
   that the surveys differentiated between the normative and ill companion
   dog samples. This research demonstrates the importance of assessing
   multiple components of QoL and HAB, and their relatedness to owners'
   health evaluations. Future research should ascertain questionnaire
   validity against more objective reports, such as veterinarian ratings.
   Ultimately, by understanding the relation of QoL and HAB to companion
   owners' evaluations of dog health, we can help veterinarians to partner
   with owners in providing better companion dog care. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Pediatric traumatic brain injury (pTBI) is the leading cause of
   traumatic death and disability in children in the United States.
   Impaired learning and memory in these young survivors imposes a heavy
   toll on society. In adult TBI (aTBI) models, cognitive outcome improved
   after administration of erythropoietin (EPO) or insulin-like growth
   factor-1 (IGF-1). Little is known about the production of these agents
   in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for learning and memory,
   after pTBI. Our objective was to describe hippocampal expression of EPO
   and IGF-1, together with their receptors (EPOR and IGF-1R,
   respectively), over time after pTBI in 17-day-old rats. We used the
   controlled cortical impact (CCI) model and measured hippocampal mRNA
   levels of EPO, IGF-1, EPOR, IGF-1R, and markers of caspase-dependent
   apoptosis (bcl2, bax, and p53) at post-injury days (PID) 1, 2, 3, 7, and
   14. CCI rats performed poorly on Morris water maze testing of spatial
   working memory, a hippocampally-based cognitive function. Apoptotic
   markers were present early and persisted for the duration of the study.
   EPO in our pTBI model increased much later (PID7) than in aTBI models
   (12 h), while EPOR and IGF-1 increased at PID1 and PID2, respectively,
   similar to data from aTBI models. Our data indicate that EPO expression
   showed a delayed upregulation post-pTBI, while EPOR increased early. We
   speculate that administration of EPO in the first 1-2 days after pTBI
   would increase hippocampal neuronal survival and function.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The Ex Vivo Eye Irritation Test (EVEIT) is used to analyse the
   clinical observations of corneal calcification attributed to the
   presence of phosphate within applied eye-drops used in treating
   glaucoma, Still-Chauffard syndrome, ocular burns and dry eyes.
   Method Live corneas from abattoir rabbit eyes were cultured in order to
   study epithelial healing following mechanical abrasion of the corneal
   surface combined with repeated exposure to various eye-drops.
   Results Obvious corneal calcification of the wound area along with a
   complete epithelial healing covering the calcified area was observed
   following exposure to phosphate hyaluronate eye-drops. Epithelial
   healing without calcification was achieved using citrate hyaluronate
   eye-drops.
   Conclusion Clinical observations show that topical use of artificial
   tears containing phosphate on injured eyes may lead to sight-threatening
   corneal complications. Simulation of such treatment conditions by the
   EVEIT convincingly demonstrates that changes in the composition of the
   pharmaceutically used treatments can prevent this undesired side effect.
   Although considerable healing was achieved during the repeated
   application of eye-drops, using either a phosphate or citrate buffer,
   only the drops containing citrate did not develop corneal calcification
   on the eye. The authors therefore recommend discontinuing the use of
   phosphate-buffered eye-drops, or other topically applied solutions, to
   avoid further injury to the patient.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines return predictability when the investor is uncertain
   about the right state variables. A novel feature of the model averaging
   approach used in this paper is to account for finite-sample bias of the

   international dataset, we find that interest-rate related variables are
   usually among the most prominent predictive variables, whereas valuation
   ratios perform rather poorly. Yet, predictability of market excess
   returns weakens substantially, once model uncertainty is accounted for.
   We document notable differences in the degree of in-sample and
   out-of-sample predictability across different stock markets. Overall,
   these findings suggest that return predictability is neither a uniform,
   nor a universal feature across international capital markets. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The main topics of this second part of a two-part essay are some
   consequences of the phenomenon of vacuum polarization as the most
   important physical manifestation of modular localization. Besides
   philosophically unexpected consequences, it has led to a new
   constructive ``outside-inwards approach{''} in which the pointlike
   fields and the compactly localized operator algebras which they generate
   only appear from intersecting much simpler algebras localized in
   noncompact wedge regions whose generators have extremely mild almost
   free field behavior.
   Another consequence of vacuum polarization presented in this essay is
   the localization entropy near a causal horizon which follows a
   logarithmically modified area law in which a dimensionless area (the
   area divided by the square of dR where dR is the thickness of a
   light-sheet) appears. There are arguments that this logarithmically
   modified area law corresponds to the volume law of the standard heat
   bath thermal behavior. We also explain the symmetry enhancing effect of
   holographic projections onto the causal horizon of a region and show
   that the resulting infinite dimensional symmetry groups contain the
   Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group. This essay is the second part of a
   partitioned longer paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a systematic study of a perfluoropolyether (PFPE)-based
   elastomer as a new biomaterial. Besides its excellent long-term
   stability and inertness, PFPE can be decorated with topographical
   surface structures by replica molding. Micrometer-sized pillar
   structures led to considerably different cell morphology of fibroblasts.
   Although PFPE is a very hydrophobic material we could show that PFPE
   substrates allow cell adhesion and spreading of primary human
   fibroblasts (HDF) very similar to that observed on standard cell culture
   substrates. Less advanced cell spreading was observed for L929 (murine
   fibroblast cell line) cells during the first 5 h in culture which was
   accompanied by retarded recruitment of alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin into
   focal adhesions (FAs). After 24 h distinct FAs were evident also in L929
   cells on PFPE. Furthermore, organization of soluble FN into a fibrillar
   ECM network was shown for hdF and L929 cells.
   Based on these results PFPE is believed to be a suitable substrate for
   several biological applications. On the one hand it is an ideal cell
   culture substrate for fundamental research of substrate-independent
   adhesion signaling due to its different characteristics (e.g.
   wettability, elasticity) compared to glass or TCPS. On the other hand it
   could be a promising implant material, especially due to its
   straightforward patternability, which is a tool to direct cell growth
   and differentiation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   magnetic resonance in close proximity of the aperture. Compared to
   similar configurations presented in the literature, the proposed layout
   allows us to significantly reduce the size of the setup. The
   effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through proper full-wave
   simulations, taking into account material dispersion and losses. In
   addition, it is shown how the nano-ring response can be tuned by
   embedding the structure in a host material, doped with liquid crystals.}},

Title = {{Is Health (Really) Special? Health Policy between Rawlsian and Luck
   Egalitarian Justice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{344-358}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In recent work, Norman Daniels extends the application of Rawls's
   principle of `fair equality of opportunity' from health care to health
   proper. Crucial to that account is the view that health care, and now
   also health, is special. Daniels also claims that a rival theory of
   distributive justice, namely luck egalitarianism (or `equal opportunity
   for welfare'), cannot provide an adequate account of justice in health
   and health care. He argues that the application of that theory to health
   policy would result in an account that is, in a sense, too narrow, for
   it denies treatment to imprudent patients (e.g. lung cancer patients who
   smoked). In a different sense, Daniels argues, luck egalitarian health
   policy would be too wide: it arguably tells us to treat individuals for
   such brute-luck conditions as shyness, stupidity, ugliness, and having
   the `wrong' skin colour. I seek to advance three claims in response to
   Daniels's revised theory, and in defence of a luck egalitarian view of
   health policy. First, I question Daniels's assertion regarding the
   specialness of health. While he is right to abandon his insistence on
   the specialness of health care, it is doubtful that health proper can be
   depicted as special. Second, I try and meet Daniels's objections to luck
   egalitarianism. Luck egalitarian health policy escapes being too narrow
   for it does not in fact require denying basic care to imprudent
   patients. As for it being allegedly too wide, I try to show that it is
   not, after all, counterintuitive to rid individuals of unfortunate and
   disadvantageous biological traits (say, a disadvantageous skin colour).
   And third, I question whether Daniels's own Rawlsian account is in fact
   wide enough. I argue that fair equality of opportunity fails to justify
   some standard medical procedures that many health systems do already
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background: National guidelines for prophylactic oophorectomy in women
   with colorectal cancer are lacking. The aim of this population-based
   cohort study was to report on the prevalence, incidence and prognosis of
   ovarian metastases from colorectal cancer, providing information
   relevant to the discussion of prophylactic oophorectomy.
   Methods: All 4566 women with colorectal cancer in Stockholm County
   during 1995-2006 were included and followed until 2008. Prospectively
   collected data regarding clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome
   were obtained from the Regional Quality Registry.
   Results: The prevalence of ovarian metastases at the time of diagnosis
   of colorectal cancer was 1.1 per cent (34 of 3172) among women with
   colonic cancer and 0.6 per cent (8 of 1394) among those with rectal
   cancer (P = 0.105). After radical resection of stage I-III colorectal
   cancer, metachronous ovarian metastases were found during follow-up in
   1.1 per cent (22 of 1971) with colonic cancer and 0.1 per cent (1 of
   881) with rectal cancer (P = 0.006). Survival in patients with ovarian
   metastases was poor.
   Conclusion: Ovarian metastases from colorectal cancer are uncommon.}},

Abstract = {{Site productivity and disturbances are among the main factors
   determining plant community composition. With increasing site
   productivity, plant diversity is often reduced and the importance of
   traits associated with light competition increases. Small-scale
   disturbances created by mole activity are assumed to affect this
   dynamics by two factors: increasing site heterogeneity and providing
   survival opportunity for weaker light competitors. These effects are
   expected to become stronger with increasing site productivity. To test
   this hypothesis we compared species composition on molehills and in
   undisturbed plots within grasslands and along a productivity gradient.
   The differences in species composition were evaluated both by species
   diversity and by traits representing trade-offs between species'
   response to competition and disturbance. Species diversity generally
   decreased with site productivity, while disturbances had no significant
   contribution to the variation among samples. When analyzing shifts in
   species traits, we found a central role of site productivity, but also a
   significant, though secondary, effect of molehill disturbances. In
   particular, communities showed increased potential height and specific
   leaf area and decreased seed weight and Ellenberg's light indicator
   values with increasing site productivity, supporting the assumption of
   increasing light limitation along the gradient. Species observed on
   molehills were generally less shade tolerant, especially in the more
   productive grasslands. We conclude that, although overall plant
   community composition is mainly shaped by large environmental gradients
   such as site productivity, small-scale disturbances may contribute to
   local environmental heterogeneity and trait variation by enabling
   species less adapted to light competition to survive. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To combat the devastating effects of improvised explosive devices
   (IEDs), body armor that provides extended coverage has been developed.
   However, this extended coverage increases the armor's weight and may
   restrict movement. Throughout this case study, a novel technique to
   assess several armor systems was investigated. Four soldiers performed
   shoulder and trunk movements while wearing each of the six different
   armor inserts. Electromyography (EMG) was used to quantify muscular
   activity and inertial motion sensors were used to determine joint range
   of motion (ROM). Outcome measures included maximum ROM, integrated EMG,
   and the soldiers' subjective rankings. For the shoulder tasks, objective
   ROM and EMG measures were related to each other as well as to subjective
   rankings and armor material properties. Conversely, little agreement was
   found between measures for the trunk tasks. Results of this preliminary
   investigation indicate that combining shoulder ROM and EMG measures has
   the potential to provide an objective assessment of body armor systems.}},

Abstract = {{The first results of the calculations of our program code are shown for
   nanowire models. In our code, the electronic current is treated as
   quantum states and the effects of the coulomb and exchange interaction
   by conductive electrons or electrons in system are included. We show our
   results as the local electronic current density defined by one of the
   authors. The magnetic field induced by the eletronic current is studied
   by including effects of vector potential in electronic state
   calculations. The effects on the electrons in system by the conductive
   electrons are also studied. By the existence of the conductive electrons
   in the system, the energy eigenvalues of higher orbitals rise while the
   lower orbitals are stabilized by the conductive states. It may imply
   that materials is made more conductive by conductive electrons since the
   electrons in the materials are unstabilized by them (C) 2010 The Japan

Abstract = {{Contrast enhancement is important and useful for consumer electronics.
   One widely accepted contrast enhancement method is global histogram
   equalization (GHE), which achieves comparatively better performance on
   almost all types of image but sometimes causes excessive visual
   deterioration. We propose a new extension of bi-histogram equalization
   called Bi-Histogram Equalization with Neighborhood Metric (BHENM). BHENM
   consists of two stages. First, large histogram bins that cause washout
   artifacts are divided into sub-bins using neighborhood metrics; the same
   intensities of the original image are arranged by neighboring
   information. In the second stage, the histogram of the original image is
   separated into two sub-histograms based on the mean of the histogram of
   the original image; the sub-histograms are equalized independently using
   refined histogram equalization, which produces flatter histograms. In an
   experimental trial, BHENM simultaneously preserved the brightness and
   enhanced the local contrast of the original image(1).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the incidence of local and systemic infection in
   a sample of patients catheterized with thoracic catheters (TCs) and to
   identify the prognostic factors for catheter-related infection. Methods:
   A retrospective study involving 48 patients (17 females and 31 males)
   catheterized with TCs between December of 2008 and March of 2009 in the
   Thoracic Surgery Department of the Adnan Menderes University Hospital,
   located in Aydin, Turkey. Blood samples for culture were collected from
   the distal end of each TC and from each of the 48 patients. We looked
   for correlations between positive culture and possible prognostic
   factors for catheter-related infection. Results: Culture results were
   positive in TC samples only for 3 patients, in blood samples only for 2,
   and in both types of samples for another 2. Advanced age correlated
   significantly with positive culture in TC samples and in blood samples
   (r = 0.512 and r = 0.312, respectively; p < 0.05 for both), as did
   prolonged catheterization (r = 0.347 and r = 0.372, respectively; p <
   0.05). There was a significant correlation between having undergone
   surgery and positive culture in TC samples only (p < 0.05). However,
   having an inoperable malignancy correlated with bacterial growth in
   blood and in TC samples alike (p < 0.05 for both). Conclusions: Risk
   factors, such as advanced age, prolonged catheterization, comorbidities,
   and inoperable malignancy, increase the risk of catheter-related
   infection. It is imperative that prophylaxis with broad-spectrum
   antibiotics be administered to patients who present with these risk
   factors and might be catheterized with a TC.}},

Abstract = {{Rho-mediated inhibition of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase (MLCP),
   together with Ca2+-dependent MLC kinase activation, constitutes the
   major signaling mechanisms for vascular smooth muscle contraction. We
   recently unveiled the involvement of Ca2+-induced, phosphoinositide
   3-kinase (PI3K) class II alpha isoform (PI3K-C2 alpha)-dependent Rho
   activation and resultant Rho kinase-dependent MLCP suppression in
   membrane depolarization- and receptor agonist-induced contraction. It is
   unknown whether Ca2+ - and PI3K-C2 alpha-dependent regulation of MLCP is
   altered in vascular smooth muscle of hypertensive animals and is
   involved in hypertension. Therefore, we studied the role of the
   Ca2+-PI3K-C2 alpha-Rho-MLCP pathway in spontaneously hypertensive rats
   (SHRs). PI3K-C2 alpha was readily detected in various vascular beds of
   Wistar-Kyoto rats and activated by high KCl. High KCl also stimulated
   vascular Rho activity and phosphorylation of the MLCP regulatory subunit
   MYPT1 at Thr(853) in a PI3K inhibitor wortmannin-sensitive manner. In
   mesenteric and other vessels of SHRs at the hypertensive but not the
   prehypertensive stage, the activity of PI3K-C2 alpha but not class I
   PI3K p110 alpha was elevated with concomitant rises of Rho activity and
   Thr(853)-phosphorylation of MYPT1, as compared with normotensive
   controls. Infusion of the Ca2+ channel antagonist nicardipine reduced
   blood pressure with suppression of vascular activity of PI3K-C2
   alpha-Rho and phosphorylation of MYPT1 in hypertensive SHRs. Infusion of
   wortmannin lowered blood pressure with inhibition of PI3K-C2 alpha-Rho
   activities and MYPT1 phosphorylation in hypertensive SHRs. These
   observations suggest that an increased activity of the Ca2+-PI3K-C2
   alpha-Rho signaling pathway with resultant augmented MLCP suppression
   contributes to hypertension in SHRs. The Ca2+- and PI3K-C2
   alpha-dependent Rho stimulation in vascular smooth muscle may be a
   novel, promising target for treating hypertension. (Hypertension.

Abstract = {{Objectives To investigate women s attitudes to successive decisions
   possibly involved in Down syndrome screening (i e about ultrasound and
   biochemical screening invasive testing and termination of pregnancy) and
   to compare attitudes and actual decisions
   Methods Four hundred women were invited to complete a self administered
   questionnaire within 3 days postpartum A hierarchical cluster analysis
   identified respondents with similar attitudes and logistic regressions
   assessed the effects of factors relating to decision-making on attitudes
   Results Three hundred and ninety-one women returned the questionnaire
   Three clusters of women were identified Two clusters comprised
   respondents stating that decision-making should be based on attitudes to
   either termination of pregnancy (32 8\%) or invasive testing related
   miscarriage (30 2\%) The third cluster (37 0\%) considered that
   obtaining information about pregnancy should be the main objective when
   deciding about biochemical screening or invasive testing Multivariate
   logistic regressions showed some consistency between attitudes and

Abstract = {{A combination of calcium phosphates with nanofibrous scaffolds holds
   promising potential for bone tissue engineering applications. In this
   study, nanohydroxyapatite (n-HA) was coated on the plasma-treated
   surface of electrospun poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) nanofibers and the
   capacity of fabricated scaffolds for bone formation was investigated in
   vitro using human cord blood derived unrestricted somatic stem cells
   (USSC) tinder osteogenic induction and in vivo after subcutaneous
   implantation. PLEA and n-HA-coated PLLA (n-HA/PLLA) scaffolds exhibited
   a nanofibrous structure with interconnected pores and suitable
   mechanical properties. These scaffolds were also shown to support
   attachment, spreading, and proliferation of USSC, as shown by their
   flattened normal morphology and MTT assay. During osteogenic
   differentiation, significantly higher values of ALP activity,
   biomineralization, and bone-related gene expression were observed on
   n-HA/PLLA compared to PLLA scaffolds. Subsequently, these markers were
   measured in higher amounts in USSC on PLLA nanofibers compared to TCPS.
   According to the in vivo results, ossification and formation of
   trabeculi was observed in the n-HA/PLLA scaffold compared to PLEA.
   Taking together, it was shown that nanofibrous structure enhanced
   osteogenic differentiation of USSC. Furthermore, surface-coated n-HA
   stimulated the effect of nanofibers on the orientation of USSC toward
   osteolineage. In addition, the n-HA/PLLA electrospun scaffold showed the
   capacity for ectopic bone formation in the absence of exogenous cells.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the major factors that will shape the second phase
   of Caspian oil and natural gas export. The article compares the
   prospects of the post-2005 period with the Caspian energy developments
   in the first decade and a half after independence. This article claims:
   One, political considerations will continue to play an important role in
   the decisions on export routes for and participants in Caspian energy
   production and export projects. However, those political considerations
   will produce different policies in phase two of Caspian energy
   production than they did in the first phase. Second, the relative
   influence and interest in the Caspian region of various global and
   regional powers have changed significantly from Caspian energy phase one
   to phase two. Third, the producers in the region are not as anxious for
   foreign investment as they were earlier. The major resources that will
   be developed in Caspian phase two are: new production of Azerbaijan's
   natural gas, extension to new markets and expansion of capacity of
   existing gas export routes: new production projects for Turkmenistan's
   natural gas and new pipelines: and additional Kazakhstani oil production
   and natural gas increased production and initiation of export. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We describe a new approach for algorithmic mediation of a collaborative

   rank-lists based on searchers' queries, fusing these rank-lists, and
   then splitting the combined list to distribute documents among
   collaborators according to their roles. For the work reported here, we
   consider the case of two people collaborating on a search. We assign
   them roles of Gatherer and Surveyor: the Gatherer is tasked with
   exploring highly promising information on a given topic, and the
   Surveyor is tasked with digging further to explore more diverse
   information We demonstrate how our technique provides the Gatherer with
   high-precision results, and the Surveyor with information that is high

Abstract = {{Background: To assess the depressant effects of alcohol on the level of
   consciousness of patients admitted with head injuries, this study
   examined the changes that occur in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of
   traumatic brain injury patients over time.
   Methods: The records of 269 head trauma patients consecutively admitted
   to the neurosurgery intensive care unit were examined retrospectively.
   Eighty-one patients were excluded because of incomplete data. The
   remaining 188 patients were further divided into an intoxicated group
   (blood alcohol concentration {[}BAC] >= 0.08\%, n = 100 {[}53\%]) and a
   nonintoxicated group (BAC <0.08\%, n = 88 {[}47\%]). The GCS in the
   prehospital setting, in the emergency department, and the highest GCS
   achieved during the first 24 hours postinjury were compared.
   Results: The change between emergency department-GCS and the best day 1
   GCS in the intoxicated group was greater than the nonintoxicated group
   and deemed clinically and statistically significant; median change (3
   vs. 0) p < 0.001. To assess whether these results were directly related
   to the BAC\%, piecewise regression using a general linear model was used
   to assess the intercept and slope of alcohol on the changes of GCS with
   cutting point at BAC\% = 0.08. The analysis showed that, in the
   nonintoxicated range, the effect of alcohol was not significantly
   related to the changes of GCS. But in the intoxicated range, BAC\% was
   significantly positively related to the changes of GCS.
   Conclusion: This study concludes that the GCS increases significantly
   over time in alcohol intoxicated patients with traumatic brain injury.}},

Abstract = {{Ipomoea carnea Jacq., a native shrub of South America, grows in dense
   populations along river beds, river banks, canals and other waterlogged
   (wetland) areas. It has become naturalised along canals, drains, road
   sides and field edges in the Nile Delta, Egypt. The rapid growth rate,
   spread and adaptability from xeric to aquatic habitats indicates that
   this plant may potentially become a disastrous invasive species in
   Egyptian water bodies. Fifty established stands covering seven habitats
   (railway sides, waste lands, road sides, drain and canal banks, road
   dividers and field edges) in the Nile Delta were used in this
   experiment. In each stand, 20 ramets were permanently marked to estimate
   the monthly variations in such growth variables as phenology, height and
   diameter of the ramet canopy, number of flowers, leaves and fruits. The
   results showed a significant variation in growth variables relative to
   habitat types. Generally, I. carnea populations along the railway sides
   and field edges had the lowest values for most variables; while those of
   the road dividers, road sides and canal banks produced the highest
   values. The growth of I. carnea follows a seasonal pattern where the
   highest values for most growth variables were obtained during September
   and October and the lowest were recorded during June and July. The
   greatest flower and fruit production was observed between September and
   December. Similarly, it was shown that the flowering time varied in
   relation to habitat types; it began earlier on road sides and canal
   banks, but later on railway sides, road dividers and waste lands. Leaf
   areas of I. carnea populations in the wet habitats (e.g. drain and canal
   banks) were higher than those in other habitats. These results are
   discussed in relation to other related studies.}},

Abstract = {{Jaegwon Kim's causal exclusion argument has rarely been evaluated from
   an empirical perspective. This is puzzling because its conclusion seems
   to be making a testable claim about the world: supervenient properties
   are causally inefficacious. An empirical perspective, however, reveals
   Kim's argument to rest on a mistaken conception about how to test
   whether a property is causally efficacious. Moreover, the empirical
   perspective makes visible a metaphysical bias that Kim brings to his
   argument that involves a principle of non-inclusion.}},

Abstract = {{In 3 experimental runs, the influence of genotype X temperature
   interactions on the reproductive traits (sexual maturity, egg
   production, fertility, hatchability, and chick production) of hens of a
   broiler breeder dam line carrying major genes for dwarfism (dw-) and
   frizzle (F) was investigated. In experiments 1 and 2, the hens were
   caged individually under hot (30 degrees C) and temperate (19 degrees C)
   temperatures, from wk 18 to 72 of age, whereas in experiment 3, hens
   were kept under moderate temperature (24 degrees C). Hens in experiment
   1 were heterozygous for the frizzle gene, and those in experiments 2 and
   3 were homozygous, both with and without the dwarf gene. Hens without
   the above-mentioned major genes (ffDw-) served as control lines. In
   experiment 1, the frizzle gene (Ff) had no significant effect on sexual
   maturity, egg production, fertility, hatchability, and chick number
   under the 2 environmental conditions. In experiment 2, there was a
   significant interaction between feathering genotype (FF) and
   environmental temperature for all traits except sexual maturity. Under
   heat stress, there was a distinct reduction in all reproductive traits
   except sexual maturity for normally feathered hens compared with
   frizzle-feathered hens, whereas under temperate conditions, egg
   production and number of chicks of the FF genotype were reduced and
   sexual maturity was delayed. In experiments 1 and 2, the dw- gene showed
   a depressive effect on the growth of hens. In experiment 1, the
   interaction between dwarf genotype and environmental temperature for egg
   production was significant. Under temperate conditions, the egg
   production of dwarf hens was inferior to that of normally sized birds,
   whereas under hot temperatures, the egg production of the 2 body sizes
   did not differ. In experiment 2, for sexual maturity, egg production and
   fertility locus X locus interactions could be determined. The genotype
   combining the 2 major genes (FFdw-) proved to be inferior to the
   normally feathered dwarf type (ffdw-) for laying performance but
   superior in fertility. Under the conditions in experiment 3, the egg
   production of dwarf birds was significant reduced.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel statistical capacitance extraction
   method for interconnect conductors considering process variations. The
   new method is called statCap, where orthogonal polynomials are used to
   represent the statistical processes in a deterministic way. We first
   show how the variational potential coefficient matrix is represented in
   a first-order form using Taylor expansion and orthogonal decomposition.
   Then, an augmented potential coefficient matrix, which consists of the
   coefficients of the polynomials, is derived. After this, corresponding
   augmented system is solved to obtain the variational capacitance values
   in the orthogonal polynomial form. Finally, we present a method to
   extend statCap to the second-order form to give more accurate results
   without loss of efficiency compared to the linear models. We show the
   derivation of the analytic second-order orthogonal polynomials for the
   variational capacitance integral equations. Experimental results show
   that statCap is two orders of magnitude faster than the recently
   proposed statistical capacitance extraction method based on the spectral
   stochastic collocation approach and many orders of magnitude faster than
   the Monte Carlo method for several practical conductor structures.}},

Abstract = {{High performance composites based on CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) and cyanate
   ester (CE) were successfully developed with desirable dielectric
   properties (high dielectric constant and low dissipation factor),
   outstanding thermal resistance and decreased curing temperature for
   embedded capacitors. CCTO was treated by gamma-aminopropyl triethoxy
   silane, coded as CCTO(KH550), to investigate the interfacial effects on
   properties of composites. The addition of CCTO or CCTO(KH550) can
   significantly reduce the whole curing temperature of CE, while CCTO
   exhibits a higher catalytic capability than CCTO(KH550). Compared with
   cured CE resin, two kinds of composites exhibit greatly improved thermal
   resistance and real permittivity, meanwhile the dissipation factor is
   still very low. Because the interfacial polarization leads to the
   dependence of dielectric properties on the frequency and temperature,
   the improvement of interfacial adhesion for composites is beneficial to
   reduce the variation of dielectric properties with temperature and
   frequency, and thus improve the reliability of dielectric materials in
   applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Coastal drownings claim on average 82 people per year in
   Australia. Beach flags are a primary safety strategy used on beaches.
   They are located away from rip currents, which are the main beach hazard
   affecting swimmers. Little is known about the behavioural and
   motivational factors associated with people choosing where to swim in
   relation to flags and rips.
   Aims: To assess the beliefs and behaviours of beachgoers in relation to
   beach flags and rip currents.
   Methods: Beachgoers at beaches in NSW were interviewed about their
   swimming beliefs and behaviours. They were asked to indicate on pictures
   depicting beach scenarios involving beach flags and fixed rip currents,
   where they would and would not swim. Logistic regression analysis was
   undertaken to determine predictors of correct and incorrect swimming
   behaviour.
   Results: Beachgoers who are aged from 30 to 49 years (OR 0.34, 95\% CI
   0.16, 0.74, p = 0.006) are less likely to choose to swim between the
   flags than other swimmers. In addition, beachgoers who are at the beach
   with children are significantly more likely to choose to swim between
   the flags (OR 2.74, 95\% CI 1.39, 5.40, p = 0.004). Beachgoers with
   basic knowledge about rip currents are significantly more likely to swim
   away from the rip (OR 11.59, 95\% CI 5.89, 22.81, p < 0.001).
   Discussion and conclusions: Ocean swimmers aged from 30 to 49 years may
   choose to swim outside the flags, though they may not necessarily be
   swimming in the rip. Swimming outside of the flags may be linked with
   experience. The flags appear to be attractive to parents and carers of
   children. Whilst the flags indicate a relatively safe area of the beach,
   it is still vitally important for parents and carers to supervise
   children in this area. Basic rip current knowledge is an essential
   component in developing national interventions aimed at reducing coastal
   drowning. Beachgoers clearly need to know what a rip looks like in order
   to actively avoid swimming in it. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: A genome-wide association study and a replication using
   Japanese, Spanish and Greek Caucasian populations have recently
   indicated two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7775228 and
   rs10947262) associated with knee Osteoarthritis (OA) susceptibility. We
   have further evaluated the association in knee OA subjects from Han
   Chinese and Australian Caucasian origin.
   Methods: Two independent case-control association studies were performed
   using Han Chinese and Australian Caucasian populations. The two SNPs
   were genotyped in patients who had primary symptomatic knee OA with
   radiographic confirmation and/or received total knee replacement surgery
   as well as in matched controls. They were subjected to statistic
   analyses.
   Results: A total of 991 OA patients and 1536 controls were genotyped. No
   significant difference was detected in genotype or allele frequencies of
   the two SNPs between knee OA and control groups in the two populations
   (all P>0.05). The association was also negative even after
   stratification by sex, body mass index (BMI) and Kellgren/Lawrence
   scores. The significant heterogeneity was detected between Chinese and
   Japanese (both P<0.05). In the Caucasian samples, no significant
   heterogeneity was detected (both P>0.05). The result of meta-analysis
   showed significant association between knee OA and rs10947262 in total
   subjects {[}summary OR=1.26, 95\%confidence intervals (CI)=1.07-1.27,
   P=3 x 10(-8)] and in Caucasian samples (summary OR=1.28,
   95\%Cl=1.04-1.57, P=0.02).
   Conclusion: We demonstrated no association between the two SNPs in human
   leukocyte antigen (HLA) class region and knee OA in Han Chinese
   population. A significant association was detected between SNP
   rs10947262 and knee OA in Caucasian subjects. Further replication
   studies are required to identify the impact of controversial
   association. (C) 2010 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Abstract = {{Dipterocarpus zhengae sp. nov. is described from the middle Miocene
   Fotan Group of Zhangpu county, Fujian Province, Southeast China on the
   basis of a fruit wing. Three kinds of venation of the calyx longer lobes
   (enlarged sepals) occur in the winged fruits of extant Dipterocarpus.
   The fossil species is referred to the kind having three primary veins
   and within that category is most similar to extant Dipterocarpus
   gracilis Blume in the size of the longer lobe as well as its venation.
   The occurrence of the fruit wing of Dipterocarpus, together with
   palynological evidence, indicates unequivocally that a tropical climate
   and tropical rain forest occurred in Zhangpu during the middle Miocene,
   warmer and more humid than at the present day. The palaeobiogeography of
   Dipterocarpus is reviewed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although it has long been hypothesized that the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
   acts as an interface between limbic and motor regions, direct evidence
   for this modulatory role on behavior is lacking. Using a disconnection
   procedure in rats, we found that basolateral amygdala (BLA) input to the
   core and medial shell of the NAc separately mediate two distinct
   incentive processes controlling the performance of goal-directed
   instrumental actions, respectively: (i) the sensitivity of instrumental
   responding to changes in the experienced value of the goal or outcome,
   produced by specific satiety-induced outcome devaluation; and (ii) the
   effect of reward-related cues on action selection, observed in
   outcome-specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. These results reveal,
   therefore, that dissociable neural circuits involving BLA inputs to the
   NAc core and medial shell mediate distinct components of the incentive
   motivational processes controlling choice and decision-making in
   instrumental conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and FGF receptor (FGFR) are expressed in
   various cells including endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic
   cells. The interaction between FGF and FGFR is associated with the
   proliferation, migration, and survival of these cells. In this report,
   we examined the effects of FGFR2 signaling on hematopoiesis in immature
   hematopoietic cells, using mutant mice in which a constitutively active
   form of FGFR2 mutant was caused to be overexpressed by the Tie2 promoter
   (FGFR2 Tg mice). Under normal conditions, hematopoiesis of FGFR2 Tg mice
   and wild type (Wt) mice do not differ significantly, except for the
   weight and cell numbers of the thymus. However, the
   c-kit(+)Sca-1(+)lineage(-) bone marrow cells (BMCs) of FGFR2 Tg mice
   facilitate the formation of colony-forming units of culture. When these
   BMCs were transplanted into the recipient bone marrow (intra-bone
   marrow-bone marrow transplantation), there was better reconstitution of
   donor hematopoietic cells. In the in vitro experiment, the
   c-kit(+)Sca-1(+)lineage(-) BMCs from FGFR2 Tg mice showed fewer
   apoptotic cells than those from Wt mice. These results suggest that the
   antiapoptotic effect of FGFR2 signaling facilitates the hematopoiesis of
   FGFR2 Tg mice.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the pathogenicity of Perkinsus olseni towards the Manila
   clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, by an experimental challenge. For
   production of prezoosporangia of P. olseni, we injected uninfected
   Manila clams with cells of a pure strain of P. olseni and reared them
   for 7 d. Prezoosporangia were isolated from the soft tissue of the
   injected clams after culturing in Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium.
   Hatchery-reared, uninfected juvenile clams (3-10 mm shell length) were
   challenged by immersion in one of two concentrations of a
   prezoosporangial suspension of P. olseni for 6 d. The challenged clams
   had significantly higher mortality at both the concentrations than the
   unchallenged clams. The mortality due to infection dose-dependently
   began approximately 4 weeks and 7 weeks after challenge in the higher
   and lower concentrations, respectively. This is the first experimental
   evidence that P. olseni causes direct mortality in Manila clams. The
   lethal level of infection was estimated at approximately 10(7) pathogen
   cells/g soft tissue weight. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dual throat nozzle (DTN) is fast becoming a popular technique for thrust
   vectoring. The DTN is designed with two throats, an upstream minimum and
   a downstream minimum at the nozzle exit, with a cavity in between the
   upstream throat and exit. In the present study, a computational work has
   been carried out to analyze the performance of a dual throat nozzle at
   various mass flow rates of secondary flow and nozzle pressure ratios
   (NPR). Two-dimensional, steady, compressible Navier-Stokes equations
   were solved using a fully implicit finite volume scheme. The present
   computational results were validated with available experimental data.
   Based on the present results, the control effectiveness of
   thrust-vectoring is discussed in terms of the thrust coefficient and the
   coefficient of discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms behind the oscillations of a charged spheroidal drop deformed
   at the zero time and the sequence of oscillation modes are investigated.
   It is shown that two modes adjacent to those governing the initial
   deformation are also excited on either side due to interaction between
   the spheroidal deformation and oscillation modes. If the charge of the
   drop is so close to a value critical for electrostatic instability that
   the finite-amplitude virtual initial deformation makes the fundamental
   mode unstable, its amplitude, as well as the amplitude of the nearest
   neighbor coupled to the fundamental mode through deformation, starts to
   exponentially grow with time. If the charge is equal to, or slightly
   exceeds the critical value, the amplitudes of the fundamental mode and
   all modes deformation-coupled with it lose stability almost
   simultaneously. This qualitatively changes the conditions under which
   the charged drop becomes unstable against the self-charge. The
   superposition of higher oscillation modes at the vertices of the
   spheroidal drop generates dynamic (i.e., time-oscillating) hillocks
   emitting an excessive charge.}},

   spectroscopic measurements were shown to be related to a nonuniform
   electron density distribution in CF3 grafted radicals and the special
   features of the structure of CF3 and OMS grafted layers caused by the
   possibility of interaction between the terminal groups of these radicals
   and the surface of the carrier. Modified silicas possessed low surface

Abstract = {{In the area of infectious disease control, Canadian research efforts to
   address the HIV epidemic in Vancouver's Downtown East Side neighbourhood
   have fueled the development of harm reduction and health equity
   perspectives worldwide. These research efforts have, in turn, reshaped
   the field of public health approaches to HIV prevention and control. As
   a result of the intensive and sustained research initiatives led by
   Canadian scientists Drs. Thomas Kerr and Evan Wood, the `HIV problem'
   and public health responses to it have been radically reconceptualized -
   shifting from an exclusive focus on individual choice towards asking
   fundamental questions about our society and the structural features that
   put people at risk for contracting HIV. Their research on harm reduction
   and health equity related to HIV vulnerability and outcomes has informed
   and shaped: 1) the establishment of North America's first supervised
   injection facility, Insite, located in Vancouver's Downtown East Side
   neighbourhood; 2) dramatic changes to Vancouver's needle exchange
   policies; 3) HIV treatment approaches among injection drug using
   populations (IDU). By drawing attention to the ways in which Canadian
   health care policies and programs can be restructured to better support
   the health of vulnerable populations, the work of Drs. Kerr and Wood
   represents a uniquely Canadian public health milestone.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Medication errors are an important public health concern,
   and poor understanding of medication labels are a root cause. Research
   shows that labels are variable, of poor quality, and not
   patient-centered. No real-world trials have evaluated whether improved
   medication labels can affect appropriate medication use, adherence or
   health outcomes.
   Trial design: We developed an evidence-based prescription label that
   addresses both content and format. The enhanced label includes a
   universal medication schedule (UMS) that standardizes the directions for
   use incorporating 1) standard time periods for administration (morning,
   noon, evening, and bedtime), 2) numeric vs. alpha characters, 3)
   `carriage returns' to separate daily dose and 4) a graphic aid to
   visually depict dose and frequency. We will evaluate the effect of
   providing this label to randomly sampled patients who receive their care
   from free clinics, mobile vans and federally qualified health centers
   (FQHCs) in Northern Virginia. We will recruit patients with diabetes or
   hypertension; these patients will be randomly assigned to receive all of
   their medications with improved labels or to receive prescriptions with
   standard labels. The primary outcome will be the patient's ability to
   correctly demonstrate dosing instructions. Other outcomes include
   adherence, error rates and health outcomes.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this trial is the first to evaluate the
   effect of prescription label improvement on understanding, medication
   use and outcomes in a clinical setting. If successful, these findings
   could be implemented broadly to promote safe and appropriate medication
   use and to support evidence-based standards in the development of
   labels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   was 10 9 pg/mg (range = 0 44-268 73 pg/mg) 30 3\% of participants were
   anemic The odds of being anemic increased 21\% (odds ratio {[}OR] 1 21 P

Abstract = {{Context Although pain ranks highly among reasons for seeking care,
   routine pain assessment is often inaccurate
   Objectives This study evaluated factors associated with nurses (e g,
   registered) and other nursing support staff (e g, licensed vocational
   nurses and health technicians) discordance with patients in estimates of
   pain in a health system where routine pain screening using a 0-10
   numeric rating scale (NRS) is mandated
   Methods This was a cross-sectional, visit-based, cohort study that
   included surveys of clinic outpatients (n = 465) and nursing staff (n =
   94) who screened for pain as part of routine vital sign measurement
   during intake These data were supplemented by chart review We compared
   patient pain levels documented by the nursing staff (N-NRS) with those
   reported by the patient during the study survey (S-NRS)
   Results Pain underestimation (N-NRS < S-NRS) occurred in 25\% and
   overestimation (N-NRS > S-NRS) in 7\% of the cases Nursing staff used
   informal pain-screening techniques that did not follow established NRS
   protocols in half of the encounters Pain underestimation was positively
   associated with more years of nursing staff work experience and patient
   anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder and negatively associated with
   better patient-reported health status Pain overestimation was positively
   associated with nursing staffs use of the full NRS protocol and with a
   distracting environment in which patient vitals were taken
   Conclusion Despite a long-standing mandate, pain-screening
   implementation falls short, and informal screening is common J Pain

   particle size distribution in industrial operations. The ability of
   ultrasonic attenuation spectroscopy to determine particle size

   predominantly in the intermediate wave propagation regime at the
   measurement frequencies. This was achieved by accounting for the effect
   of detector size and shift in the frequency spectrum under dense
   conditions in the theoretical model and deconvolution algorithm,

Abstract = {{The AMBER Alert system enjoys widespread public support. Yet evidence
   suggests that the system may be ineffective and have unintended

   and thus are indicative of a problematic social tendency to address
   complex issues through simple solutions. This article utilizes
   principles of social cognition, attitudes, social norms, and symbolic
   interaction to predict that the AMBER Alert system will persevere
   despite its disadvantages. This analysis can help account for the
   popularity of other forms of CCT. It also highlights the need for future
   research aimed at elucidating the processes responsible for the

Abstract = {{In an attempt to understand the changes in asphaltene structure during
   pyrolysis, hydrothermal reactions were performed on Arab Heavy
   atmospheric residue using FCC catalyst, ZSM-5 zeolite, hydrocracking
   catalyst (HC-1) and hydroprocessing (NiMo) catalyst in a bench-scale
   fixed bed reactor. The effect of four different catalysts on pyrolysis
   reactions showed that the cracking of residue is affected by catalyst
   type. All four catalysts used in this study are good for achieving
   hydrocracking selectivity and were found to be effective in conversion
   of large asphaltene molecules into smaller moieties. Detailed analyses
   of asphaltenes were carried out using IR, NMR and HP-GPC techniques.
   These analyses indicated that the mean molecular weight distribution of
   residue and asphaltenes decreased after pyrolysis reactions indicating
   the breaking up of larger molecules. The NMR showed the increase of
   aromatics carbon and aromatic proton contents in asphaltene obtained
   from all reactions except when using ZSM-5 catalyst. IR analysis showed
   that there were significant changes in the chemistry of asphaltenes
   after the pyrolysis of residue. The pyrolysis reactions were performed
   and the following reaction conditions were maintained; reaction time: 1
   h, temperature 400 degrees C, feed amount (Arab Heavy residue): 10 g,
   catalyst amount: 5\% of feed (0.5 g) and hydrogen gas pressure: 900-1300
   psi. The compositional data generated by this work will enhance the
   understanding of asphaltene structure that will be of great value in
   improved refining practices, geochemical studies and in assessing
   performance properties of asphalt. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective The aim of this study was to determine to what extent studies
   published in two German journals took the age of their sample into
   consideration.
   Methods All publications of the two journals were viewed. Only empirical
   research papers were included. It was then assessed whether they
   included information on age of the sample and, if that was the case, the
   studies were further categorized as only giving descriptive sample
   information, reporting age-specific results of dependent variables or
   using age as a predictor in regression analyses. Furthermore, the age
   range covered was assessed.
   Results 88\% of all studies included information on age. Of those, about
   half only provided descriptive information on the age of the study
   sample, while more than one third used the age variable as a predictor
   in multivariate models. Few studies reported age-specific outcomes. Main
   focus of research was on adult populations aged 18 to 65. Only few
   studies concentrated on children and adolescents.
   Conclusions In light of demographic change and age specificity of
   psychological disorders, it will be necessary to further differentiate
   and report age-specific results of psychiatric research. A change in
   what is considered normative aging and developmental tasks for certain
   age groups calls for further research in those age groups.}},

   identifying the epoch and mechanisms of their transformation from

   resulting from minor merging: decoupled gas kinematics, nuclear
   star-forming rings, and multi-tiered oval large-scale stellar disks. The
   weak emission line nucleus of NGC 3599 bears all signs of Seyfert
   activity, according to the line-ratio diagnostics of the gas excitation
   mechanism. We conclude that the transformation of these lenticular
   galaxies took place about 1-2 Gyr ago, through gravitational mechanisms

Abstract = {{This study assesses the security of feedstock supply to satisfy the
   increased demand for bio-ethanol production based on the recent 15 years
   biofuels development plan and target (year 2008-2022) of the Thai
   government. Future bio-ethanol systems are modeled and the feedstock
   supply potentials analyzed based on three scenarios including low-,
   moderate- and high-yields improvement. The three scenarios are modeled
   and key dimensions including availability: diversity: and environmental
   acceptability of feedstocks supply in terms of GHG reduction are
   evaluated through indicators such as net feedstock balances, Shannon
   index and net life cycle GHG emissions. The results show that only the
   case of high yields improvement scenario can result in a reliable and
   sufficient supply of feedstocks to satisfy the long-term demands for
   bio-ethanol and other related industries. Cassava is identified as the
   critical feedstock and a reduction in cassava export is necessary. The
   study concludes that to enhance long-term security of feedstocks supply
   for sustainable bio-ethanol production in Thailand, increasing use of
   sugarcane juice as feedstock, improved yields of existing feedstocks and
   promoting production of bio-ethanol derived from agricultural residues
   are three key recommendations that need to be urgently implemented by
   the policy makers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of the pattern of associations, social interactions,
   coalitions, and aggression among chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas
   ursinus) in the Okavango Delta of Botswana over a 16-year period
   indicate that adult females form close, equitable, supportive, and
   enduring social relationships. They show strong and stable preferences
   for close kin, particularly their own mothers and daughters. Females
   also form strong attachments to unrelated females who are close to their
   own age and who are likely to be paternal half-sisters. Although
   absolute rates of aggression among kin are as high as rates of
   aggression among nonkin, females are more tolerant of close relatives
   than they are of others with whom they have comparable amounts of
   contact. These findings complement previous work which indicates that
   the strength of social bonds enhances the fitness of females in this
   population and support findings about the structure and function of
   social bonds in other primate groups.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper aims to increase the knowledge on the sand fly fauna
   in the cerrado areas of Maranhao state in urban, rural and forest
   environments. The research was carried out from October 2007 to
   September 2008, between 18:00h and 06: 00h, in the municipality of
   Chapadinha, northeast Maranhao. For insect sampling, CDC light traps
   were set up in peridomicile and domicile areas of urban and rural zones
   as well as in Cerrado and Gallery forests. The total of 1,401 specimens
   belonging to 17 species were sampled, all within the genus Lutzomyia.
   Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz \& Neiva) (52.5\%), Lu. evandroi (Costa Lima
   \& Antunes) (18.3\%), Lu. whitmani (Antunes \& Coutinho) (12.1\%), Lu.
   lenti (Mangabeira) (4.7\%) and Lu. termitophila (Martins, Falcao \&
   Silva) (4.0\%) were the most frequently collected. From an
   epidemiological viewpoint, five from all of the collected species are
   vectors of leishmaniasis: Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmani, Lu.
   flaviscutellata (Mangabeira), Lu. gomezi (Nitzulescu) and Lu. chagasi
   (Costa Lima). Lutzomyia chagasi was registered for the first time in
   Maranhao state and Lu. saulensis (Floch \& Abonnenc), Lu. monstruosa
   (Floch \& Abonnenc) and Lu. gomezi were found for the first time in the
   eastern part of the state, since they had been reported only in the
   Amazonian region of Maranhao. Regarding to the studied environments, the
   urban chicken house had the highest number of specimens collected (801),
   while the Gallery Forest was the most diverse (15 species). This study
   demonstrates that the northeast cerrado exhibits a mixed sand fly fauna
   characterized by an extremely important species vectors assortment

Abstract = {{Objectives: Test the biomechanical properties of femurs that have
   undergone reaming with the Reamer Irrigator Aspirator (RIA) device with
   an aim to prove no difference in torsional strength between matched
   pairs.
   Methods: Intact femurs were harvested from embalmed cadavers,
   representing 19 matched pairs. One femur from each pair was randomly
   selected to undergo reaming using the RIA to 15 mm. The bones were then
   cut and potted using a uniform jig for testing. Each specimen was tested
   in torsion and torsional stiffness was calculated for each pair. Samples
   were loaded until fracture or 113 N.m of torque.
   Results: Nine of the reamed specimens and 13 of the unreamed samples
   remained intact until the machine limit of 113 N.m was reached,
   representing approximately four times the peak torque of 30 N.m seen
   with stair climbing {[}Garino J, Beredjiklian P. Core Knowledge in
   Orthopaedics: Adult Reconstruction and Arthroplasty. Chapter 1, page 33.
   Mosby, 2007]. Mean torsional stiffness for the reamed group was 532.1
   N.m/rad (SD = 208.2), and the unreamed was 546.2 N.m/rad (SD = 206).
   Torsional load capacity was calculated for all specimens and compared in
   groups in which both reamed and unreamed specimens failed. In these five
   groups, mean load capacity was 80.6 Nm (SD = 9.5) for the reamed group,
   and 85 Nm (SD = 16.1) for the unreamed group.
   Conclusions: 17 of our reamed specimens and all of our unreamed
   specimens withstood normal physiologic load seen with stair climbing. In
   addition, 16 of 19 reamed specimens remained intact at twice this load.
   The specimen in the reamed group with the lowest torsional load capacity
   was eccentrically reamed in the distal anterior cortex highlighting
   potential complications. Given these findings, reaming the cortex of the
   femur with the RIA device for the purpose of harvesting bone graft does
   not appear to dramatically diminish the mechanical properties of the
   cortex or require postoperative weight bearing restrictions. However,
   careful attention must be paid to technique as eccentric reaming either
   proximally or distally may result in catastrophic failure. Careful
   attention must be paid to the use of irrigating fluid and post operative
   blood loss, and a thorough discussion of risk factors including
   postoperative fracture should be covered when obtaining informed
   consent. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modelling elastic filament dynamics is a topic of high interest due to
   the wide range of applications. However, it has reached a high level of
   complexity in the literature, making it unaccessible to a beginner. In
   this paper we explain the main steps involved in the computational
   modelling of the dynamics of an elastic filament. We first derive
   equations governing the dynamics of an elastic lament suitable for a
   computer simulation implementation. The derivation starts from the
   relation between forces and potential energy in conservative systems in
   order to derive the equation of motion of any bead in the filament. Only
   two-dimensional movements are considered, but extensions to three
   dimensions can follow similar lines. Suggestions for computer
   implementations are provided in Matlab as well as an example of
   application related to the generation of musical sounds. This example
   allows a critical analysis of the numerical results obtained using a
   cross-disciplinary perspective. Since derivations start from basic
   physics equations, use simple calculus and computational implementations
   are straightforward, this paper proposes a different approach to
   introduce simple molecular dynamics simulations or animations of real
   systems in undergraduate elasticity or computer modelling courses.}},

Abstract = {{A commercial field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based
   around a miniature electron beam column includes an integrated
   electrostatic blanker, making the system well-suited for lithography. A
   previous version of the miniature column design demonstrated
   direct-write lithography with 70 nm lines and spaces written into
   resist. That column also demonstrated an 85 MHz blanking speed and a 6
   nA beam current using a condenser lens. This article presents a study of
   the field emission SEM's integrated blanking system, including
   measurements and simulations of the electron beam optics. Rise and
   settle times are discussed, as well as beam extinction ratios under
   various operating conditions. The column's conjugate blanking optics are
   described, and measurements are presented, which suggest that the column
   may be used in a conjugate blanking mode for lithography. Finally, this
   article discusses how these results will feedback into the system design
   in order to improve the SEM's existing lithography capabilities. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a study of the impact of different model groups in the
   detection of circumstellar debris discs. Almost all previous studies in
   this field have used KURUCZ (ATLAS9) model spectra to predict the
   stellar contribution to the flux at the wavelength of observation, thus
   determining the existence of a disc excess. Only recently have other
   model groups or families like MARCS and NEXTGEN (PHOENIX) become
   available to the same extent as ATLAS9. This study aims to determine
   whether the predicted stellar flux of a disc target can change with the
   choice of model family - can a disc excess be present in the use of one
   model family whilst being absent from another. A simple comparison of
   KURUCZ model spectra with MARCS and NEXTGEN model spectra of identical
   stellar parameters was conducted and differences were present at
   near-infrared wavelengths. Model spectra often do not extend in
   wavelength to that of observation and therefore extrapolation of the
   spectrum is required. In extrapolation of model spectra to the Spitzer
   MIPS passbands, prediction of the stellar contribution differed by 5 per
   cent at 70 mu m for F, G and early K spectral types with differences
   increasing to 15 per cent for early M dwarfs. Analysis of the Spitzer
   MIPS 24-mu m observations of 37 F, G and K solar-like stars in the
   Pleiades cluster was conducted. In using KURUCZ model spectra, seven
   disc excesses were detected while only three and four excesses were
   detected in using MARCS and NEXTGEN (PHOENIX) model spectra,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Nanolayered composites are used in a variety of applications such as
   wear resistant coatings thermal barrier coatings optical and magnetic
   thin films and biological coatings Residual stresses produced in these
   materials during processing play an Important role in controlling their
   microstructure and properties In this paper we have studied the residual
   stresses in model metal-ceramic Al/SiC nanoscale multilayers produced by
   physical vapor deposition (magnetron sputtering) X-ray synchrotron
   radiation was used to measure stresses in the multilayers using the
   sin(2)Psi technique The stresses were evaluated as a function of layer
   thicknesses of Al and SIC and also as a function of the number of layers
   The stress state of Al in the multilayer was largely compressive
   compared to single layer Al stresses This is attributed to a peening
   mechanism due to bombardment of the Al layers by SIC and Ar neutrals
   during deposition The stress evolution was numerically modeled by a
   simplified peening process to qualitatively explain the Al
   thickness-dependent residual stresses (c) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights

Abstract = {{We analyze detailed atmospheric gas/aerosol composition data acquired
   during the 2008 NASA ARCTAS (Arctic Research of the Composition of the
   Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites) airborne campaign performed at
   high northern latitudes in spring (ARCTAS-A) and summer (ARCTAS-B) and
   in California in summer (ARCTAS-CARB). Biomass burning influences were
   widespread throughout the ARCTAS campaign. MODIS data from 2000 to 2009
   indicated that 2008 had the second largest fire counts over Siberia and
   a more normal Canadian boreal forest fire season. Near surface arctic
   air in spring contained strong anthropogenic signatures indicated by
   high sulfate. In both spring and summer most of the pollution plumes
   transported to the Arctic region were from Europe and Asia and were
   present in the mid to upper troposphere and contained a mix of forest
   fire and urban influences. The gas/aerosol composition of the high
   latitude troposphere was strongly perturbed at all altitudes in both
   spring and summer. The reactive nitrogen budget was balanced with PAN as
   the dominant component. Mean ozone concentrations in the high latitude
   troposphere were only minimally perturbed (<5 ppb), although many
   individual pollution plumes sampled in the mid to upper troposphere, and
   mixed with urban influences, contained elevated ozone (Delta O-3/Delta
   CO = 0.11 +/- 0.09 v/v). Emission and optical characteristics of boreal
   and California wild fires were quantified and found to be broadly
   comparable. Greenhouse gas emission estimates derived from ARCTAS-CARB
   data for the South Coast Air Basin of California show good agreement
   with state inventories for CO2 and N2O but indicate substantially larger
   emissions of CH4. Simulations by multiple models of transport and
   chemistry were found to be broadly consistent with observations with a
   tendency towards under prediction at high latitudes. Published by

   Significantly higher numbers of CD8+ T cells and lower numbers of CD4+ T
   cells were found in dogs with generalized demodicosis compared to dogs
   with localized demodicosis and healthy controls. Significantly higher
   numbers of CD8+ T cells and lower numbers of CD4+ T cells were also

Abstract = {{Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is an important causative
   factor in the development of several cancers, including nasopharyngeal
   carcinoma (NPC). The one EBV protein expressed in the nucleus of NPC
   cells, EBNA1, has been shown to disrupt promyelocitic leukemia (PML)
   nuclear bodies (NBs) by inducing the degradation of PML proteins,
   leading to impaired DNA repair and increased cell survival. Although
   EBNA1-mediated PML disruption is likely to be an important factor in the
   development of NPC, little is known about its mechanism. We now show
   that an interaction between EBNA1 and the host CK2 kinase is crucial for
   EBNA1 to disrupt PML bodies and degrade PML proteins. EBNA1 increases
   the association of CK2 with PML proteins, thereby increasing the
   phosphorylation of PML proteins by CK2, a modification that is known to
   trigger the polyubiquitylation and degradation of PML. The interaction
   between EBNA1 and CK2 is direct and occurs through the beta regulatory
   subunit of CK2 and EBNA1 amino acids 387 to 394. The binding of EBNA1 to
   the host ubiquitin specific protease USP7 has also been shown to be
   important for EBNA1-mediated PML disruption. We show that EBNA1 also
   increases the occupancy of USP7 at PML NBs and that CK2 and USP7 bind
   independently and simultaneously to EBNA1 to form a ternary complex. The
   combined results indicate that EBNA1 usurps two independent cellular
   pathways to trigger the loss of PML NBs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new five-level inverter topology for open-end winding
   induction-motor (IM) drive is proposed. The open-end winding IM is fed
   from one end with a two-level inverter in series with a capacitor-fed
   H-bridge cell, while the other end is connected to a conventional
   two-level inverter. The combined inverter system produces voltage
   space-vector locations identical to that of a conventional five-level
   inverter. A total of 2744 space-vector combinations are distributed over
   61 space-vector locations in the proposed scheme. With such a high
   number of switching state redundancies, it is possible to balance the
   H-bridge capacitor voltages under all operating conditions including
   overmodulation region. In addition to that, the proposed topology
   eliminates 18 clamping diodes having different voltage ratings compared
   with the neutral point clamped inverter. On the other hand, it requires
   only one capacitor bank per phase, whereas the flying-capacitor scheme
   for a five-level topology requires more than one capacitor bank per
   phase. The proposed inverter topology can be operated as a three-level
   inverter for full modulation range, in case of any switch failure in the
   capacitor-fed H-bridge cell. This will increase the reliability of the
   system. The proposed scheme is experimentally verified on a four-pole
   5-hp IM drive.}},

Abstract = {{The folate receptor a (FR alpha) is critical for normal embryonic and
   fetal development. The receptor has a relatively narrow tissue
   specificity which includes the visceral endoderm and the placenta and
   mediates delivery of folate, inadequacy of which results in termination
   of pregnancy or developmental defects. We have previously reported that
   the FR alpha gene is negatively and directly regulated by estrogen and
   positively but indirectly by progesterone and glucocorticoid. To further
   investigate hormonal control of this gene and in view of the growing
   evidence for the importance of the androgen receptor (AR) in endometrial
   and placental functions, we examined the response of the FR alpha gene
   to androgen. Here we demonstrate that the FR alpha gene is directly
   activated by androgen. The P4 promoter of the FR alpha gene is the
   target of hormone-dependent activation by the androgen receptor (AR) in
   a manner that is co-activator-dependent. The site of functional
   association of AR in the FR alpha gene maps to a 35 bp region occurring
   similar to 1500 bp upstream of the target promoter. The functional
   elements within this region are an androgen response element (ARE)
   half-site and a non-canonical C/EBP element that cooperate to recruit AR
   in a manner that is dependent on the DNA-bound C/EBP alpha Since the
   placenta is rich in C/EBP alpha, the findings underscore the
   multiplicity of mechanisms by which the FR alpha gene is under the
   exquisite control of steroid hormones. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{EFFECT OF CONTROLLED DRAINAGE ON WATER AND NITROGEN BALANCES IN DRAINED

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Field studies have shown that subsurface drainage systems can be managed
   to conserve water and reduce losses of nitrogen (N) to surface waters.
   The practice, called controlled drainage (CD) or drainage water
   management (DWM), is a viable alternative for reducing N loads from
   drained cropland, including millions of acres in the Midwest. This
   article reviews past studies on the effect of CD on drainage volumes and
   N losses for a wide range of soils and climatological conditions and
   uses simulations to examine mechanisms affecting the practice. Results
   published in the literature show that CD has reduced drainage volumes
   and N losses in drainage waters by 17\% to over 80\%, depending on soil
   properties, crops, drainage intensities, control strategies, and
   location. This study resulted in the following conclusions. CD reduces
   subsurface drainage and raises water tables, while increasing ET,
   seepage, and surface runoff Seepage, which depends on soil properties
   and site conditions, is an important factor that often governs the
   effectiveness of CD. Experiments to determine the effect of CD on
   drainage volumes and N losses should be conducted on the field or
   watershed scale so that impacts of seepage are properly represented.
   Increases in ET in response to CD are important but are rarely greater
   than 10\%. The effect of this increase in water use on drainage water
   loss is also less than 10\% for most locations. CD reduces N losses in
   drainage water by about the same percentage as its effect on subsurface
   drainage volume in most cases. The effect of CD on N loss to surface
   waters depends on denitrification, both in the profile and in reduced
   zones along seepage paths. For soils that do not develop reduced zones,
   the effect of CD on N loss may be substantially less than its effect on
   drainage volume.}},

Abstract = {{The complex impedance of an air-cored coil in a conductive tube with
   eccentric inner and outer cylindrical surfaces is calculated. The
   analytic expressions for the induced fields and the impedance variation
   due to the eddy-current flow inside the tube wall are derived using a
   second-order potential approach. The addition theorem of Bessel
   functions is employed to perform the transition between the local
   coordinate systems that conform to the boundaries of the structure.
   Although the model can be used for any coil shape and orientation, we
   focus our study on the configuration of a bobbin coil with axis parallel
   to the axes of the tube surfaces, but not necessarily coinciding with
   either of them. The results of the presented analysis are verified by a
   finite-element-method (FEM) solution.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of law occurs at the boundary between the criminal law and
   the rules of professional responsibility. In their respective
   definitions of lawyers' complicity in their clients' crimes, these two
   systems of rules conflict. The rules of professional responsibility
   exonerate a lawyer for advising a client in committing a crime if the
   lawyer acted in good faith; however, the criminal law convicts the same
   lawyer of aiding and abetting the client's crime even if the lawyer
   believed that the conduct in question was legal. As a result of this
   conflict, choosing which standard of complicity to apply in a given case
   risks undermining the purposes and interests served by the system of
   rules whose standard is not chosen. Perhaps worse, the lack of a
   consistent standard of complicity for lawyers acting as advisors
   forecloses all opportunities to reach a common understanding of when
   lawyers will be held liable for advising on legally dubious conduct. The
   legal profession's ethical crises over lawyers' roles in the ``torture
   memo{''} controversy, the Enron scandal, and the Kaye Scholer affair
   demonstrate the confusion that has ensued from the absence of an
   adequate concept of complicity. This Note uses these crises to examine
   the conflict between the concepts of complicity embodied in the
   professional rules and the criminal law. It then seeks to resolve this
   conflict by exploring whether a coherent concept of lawyers' complicity
   can preserve the principles and purposes served by both systems while
   differentiating the innocent advisor from the culpable accomplice.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatic glycogen is formed by direct and indirect pathways whose
   activities reflect altered nutrition or disease.
   Direct/indirectpathwaymeasurementsofteninvolvetestmealswhere similar to
   10\% of carbohydrate is galactose, but its effects on direct/indirect
   pathway estimates are unknown. Therefore, direct/indirect pathway
   contributions in 24-h fasted rats given 2 g/kg 100\% glucose (GLU, n=6)
   or 90\% glucose-10\% galactose(GLU+GAL, n=6) were measured by {[}U-C-13]
   glucose dilution and by position-5/position-2 glycogen enrichment
   (H5/H2) from 2H(2)O. For GLU+GAL, galactose glycogenesis was
   independently measured with {[}1-C-13] galactose. Glycogenesis was
   equivalent in both groups but for GLU+GAL, 23 +/- 4\% of glycogen was
   derived from galactose. {[}U-C-13]glucose reported a 30 +/- 3\% direct
   pathway contribution to glycogenesis for GLU but only 20 +/- 3\% for
   GLU+GAL (p=0.012 vs. GLU). H5/H2 yielded identical direct pathway
   estimates (32 +/- 3\% GLU, 29 +/- 6\% GLU+GAL). Thus, galactose
   glycogenesis was undetected by H5/H2 while {[}U-C-13]glucose reported a
   reduced direct/indirect pathway ratio. With {[}1-C-13]galactose also
   present, correct glycogenic source contributions were obtained. (C) 2010

Title = {{Impact of myocardial perfusion abnormality on prognosis in patients with

Abstract = {{Background: Myocardial perfusion imaging shows various patterns in
   patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However,
   influences of regional abnormalities of myocardial perfusion or
   ventricular wall motion on prognosis in DCM patients remains to be
   clarified. Accordingly, we investigated a relation between myocardial
   perfusion patterns and long-term prognosis in DCM patients.
   Methods and results: Sixty-two patients were divided into 2 groups
   according to patterns of Tc-99m-Tetrofosmin scintigraphy, i.e. large
   focal defects (focal) and minimally impaired perfusion or multiple small
   defects (non-focal). There were no differences between the 2 groups in
   left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimensions (63.4 +/- 9.1 and 63.8.4
   +/- 7.5 mm, respectively) and LV ejection fraction (30.3 +/- 9.2 and
   27.9 +/- 7.8\%, respectively), indicating LV systolic dysfunction was
   comparable between the groups. The focal group had a higher prevalence
   of brain natriuretic peptide >= 200 ng/dl and plasma norepinephrine >=
   500 pg/ml than the non-focal group (p < 0.05), and had longer QRS
   durations (p < 0.05). The focal group had non-sustained ventricular
   tachycardia (VT) (p < 0.05) on 24-h electrocardiogram recording and a
   history of VT/ventricular fibrillation more frequently (p < 0.05), and
   had higher New York Heart Association functional class than the
   non-focal group (p < 0.05). The mortality was significantly higher in
   the focal group (56.0\%) than in the non-focal group (28.6\%) and the
   survival curves revealed worse prognosis in the focal group during a
   follow-up period of 5.3 +/- 2.8 years.
   Conclusions: Non-ischemic DCM patients with focal defects are
   accompanied by more advanced heart failure and poor prognosis compared
   to those with minimally impaired perfusion or multiple small defects,
   despite comparable LV systolic dysfunction. (C) 2010 Japanese College of

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in scientific understanding of high-temperature
   materials processing using novel experimental methodologies have shed
   light on the complex role of surface and interface phenomena. New
   in-situ studies on molten metal/solid ceramic interactions using a
   unique experimental complex at the Foundry Research Institute, Krakow,
   have revealed a number of unusual observations in materials processing
   at high temperatures. We present some such unusual observations and
   their explanation with reference to liquid metal processing of Al, Ni,
   and Ti, and their alloys in contact with oxide ceramics. In particular,
   we focus on the following aspects: primary oxidation of Al from residual
   water vapor or oxygen, capillary purification to remove surface oxide,
   substrate protection by CVD carbon, roughening due to spinel whisker
   formation, inclusions in castings due to mechanical detachment,
   floatation due to buoyancy forces, and segregation due to directional
   solidification, modification of the solid surface morphology by metal
   vapor ahead of the liquid, and the complication due to multi-component
   alloys melted in crucibles made from complex oxide-based ceramics. In
   the case of Ti, rapid reactions with oxides result in undesirable
   volumetric changes that create difficulty in casting high-quality Ti
   parts, particularly by investment casting. Nanoscale (e.g., colloidal)
   coatings based on Y(2)O(3) protect crucibles and hold ladles against
   such attack. Practical insights and recommendations for materials
   processing emerging from the fundamental studies on high-temperature
   interfacial phenomena have been described.}},

Abstract = {{Switch cost does not disappear as more preparation time for the next

   control mechanisms (anterior attentional network) being activated in the
   random condition because of its overall difficulty. Besides. it has been
   shown that increasing arousal levels inhibits the anterior attentional
   network. Therefore. Tornay and Milan's account predicts that high
   arousal should result in switch cost for the random condition increasing
   to the levels of predictable switching. In this work, this prediction
   was tested by assessing the interaction between increased arousal and

   ultrasound technique, the `reverse-face' view (3D-RF) in prenatal
   evaluation of the involvement of the lips, alveolar ridge and secondary
   palate in suspected isolated orofacial clefting.
   Methods One hundred and twenty-four cases of suspected orofacial
   clefting diagnosed by a routine 2D ultrasound scan were referred for
   specialist ultrasound at 20-34 weeks' gestation for a detailed
   assessment of the lips and palate using both 2D and 3D ultrasound. For
   the 3D examination the lips and alveolar ridges were examined both in
   profile and in the frontal plane. The palate was then assessed in the
   reverse coronal view by rotating the face through 180 degrees on the
   vertical axis to produce the 3D-RF view. Antenatal diagnoses were
   compared with postnatal findings. Left and right lip and alveolar ridge
   defects were counted separately according to the Kernohan `striped Y'
   classification.
   Results Of 124 patients, 110 had isolated facial clefts and were
   available for follow-up; in 10, 3D-RF views were not successfully
   obtained, leaving 100 cases for assessment. The sensitivity of the 2D
   enhanced with 3D-RF technique for the diagnosis of cleft of the lip was
   116/122 (95\%), false-positive rate (FPR) 7.7\%; for alveolar ridge was
   87/103 (84.5\%), FPR 7.2\%; and for hard palate was 61/68 (89.7\%), FPR
   15.6\%.
   Conclusion The data reported represent the largest series of orofacial
   abnormalities diagnosed by 2D ultrasound and enhanced with 3D imaging to
   refine the detection of clefts of the hard palate. The technique is
   feasible in 90\% of patients in whom almost 90\% have a correct
   classification of clefts of the lip, alveolar ridge and palate.

Abstract = {{Passive multiuser communications in shallow water previously was
   demonstrated in the 3-4 kHz band using a time reversal approach. This
   paper extends those experimental results in three respects. First, a
   larger bandwidth at higher frequency (11-19 kHz) is employed allowing
   for the use of various symbol rates (or bandwidths). Second, two
   different shaping pulses are examined: a raised cosine filter and LFM
   (linear frequency modulation) chirp. Third, the adaptive time reversal
   approach with spatial nulling is applied to suppress the crosstalk among
   users. It is shown that the use of a larger bandwidth is beneficial
   along with the time reversal receiver which can handle significant
   intersymbol interference with minimal computational complexity. In
   addition, adding each user degrades the performance by about 4 dB for
   the benefit of linear increase in data rate. It is demonstrated that an
   aggregate data rate of 60 kbits/s can be achieved with a 7.5 kHz
   bandwidth (a spectral efficiency of 8 bits/s Hz) by three users
   distributed over 4.2-m depth at a 2.2 km range in shallow water using
   16-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation). (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of

Title = {{Humic Acid Molecular Weight Estimation by High-Performance
   Size-Exclusion Chromatography with Ultraviolet Absorbance Detection and
   Refractive Index Detection}},
Journal = {{SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{High-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) with ultraviolet
   absorbance detection (UVAD) has been widely utilized to estimate the
   molecular weight (MW) and MW distribution of humic acids (HAs). The MW
   estimated by UVAD was inherently inaccurate, however, because UVAD set
   at 254 nm only detects limited HA components, and the molar
   absorptivities of different HA constituents are not equal. The objective
   of this study was to evaluate the refractive index detection (RID)-based
   HPSEC method for quantifying the MW of HAs. Five HA samples were
   quantified with both UVAD and RID. The chromatograms obtained on the two
   detectors showed that the RID/UVAD response ratios were consistently
   >10, indicating that RID is more sensitive for the detection of HAs. The
   chromatograms obtained with RID had three peaks compared with two peaks
   shown on UVAD chromatograms because RID detected a late-eluting peak
   (F(3)) that was not shown on the UVAD chromatograms. Comparison of the
   RID/UVAD response ratio showed that the highest MW HA fraction (F(1))
   and lowest MW HA fraction (F(3)) have higher RID/UVAD response ratios,
   whereas the medium HA fraction (F(2)) had a lower RID/UVAD response
   ratio. These suggested that F(1) and F(3) may have relatively lower
   contents of UV-sensitive bonds such as C=C double bonds than F(2).
   Compared with HPSEC-UVAD chromatograms, the HPSEC-RID chromatograms
   resulted in higher weight-averaged MWs, lower number-averaged MWs, and
   higher polydispersivity for the tested HA samples. This study indicated
   that RID is less selective than UVAD for detection of structurally
   highly heterogeneous HA molecules and is thus better for characterizing
   the MW distribution of HA molecules.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, Kluyveromyces lactis beta-galactosidase was pretreated
   with lactose to prevent loss of activity during the immobilisation
   process, and glutaraldehyde was used as a linker to immobilise
   beta-galactosidase on the surface of a silica gel. The pretreatment of
   beta-galactosidase strongly improved its activity after immobilisation.
   Specifically, the activity of pretreated immobilised beta-galactosidase
   was 2.6 times greater than that of non-pretreated immobilised
   beta-galactosidase. The optimal temperature, pH and ionic strength of
   buffer for pretreated immobilised beta-galactosidase were 37 degrees C,
   pH 7.5 and 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, respectively. These values
   were shifted by 5 degrees C and pH by 0.5 when compared to the soluble
   beta-galactosidase. Moreover, the pretreated immobilised
   beta-galactosidase showed a better reusability than did non-pretreated
   immobilised beta-galactosidase, with 63.9\% of its original activity
   being retained after 10 reuses. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   concentration of (0.08 +/- 0.03) kg.m(-3) (T = 323.15 K, p = 8.5 MPa) to
   (147 +/- 0.2) kg.m(-3) (T = 323.15 K, p = 20.0 MPa). The lowest octanoic
   acid solubility obtained was a solute concentration of (0.40 +/- 0.1)
   kg.m(-3) (T = 333.15 K, p = 10.0 MPa), while the highest solute
   concentration was (151 +/- 2) kg.m(-3) (T = 333.15 K, p = 26.7 MPa).
   Additionally, solubility experiments were performed for nonanoic acid in
   supercritical carbon dioxide at 323.15 K and pressures of (10.0 to 30.0)
   MPa to add to the solubility data previously published by the authors.
   In general, carboxylic acid solubility increased with increasing solvent
   density. The results also showed that the solubility of the solutes
   decreased with increasing molar mass at constant supercritical-fluid
   density. Additionally, the efficacy of Chrastil's equation and other
   density-based models was evaluated for each fatty acid.}},

Abstract = {{We observed six diatom taxa from North American samples and one taxon
   from China that are considered within the genus Encyonema Kutzing. Two
   of the taxa are described as new, Encyonema reimeri Spaulding. Pool et
   Castro sp. nov. and Encyonema nicafei Spaulding sp. nor. A third taxon,
   Encyonema stoermeri Spaulding, Pool et Castro nom. nov.. slat. nov. is
   assigned a new name and rank. In the past, these taxa have been ascribed
   to several names, but primarily the names Cymbella muelleri Hustedt and
   C. muelleri f. ventricosa (Tempere et Peragallo) Reimer have been used,
   based on their inclusion in the two volumes of ``The Diatoms of the
   United States{''}. We compare the new species with other members of this
   group of taxa, including Encyonema latum Krammer, E. sinicum Krammer and
   E. yellowstonianum Krammer. This group of species shares the features of
   I) a broad axial area, 2) raphe branches curved with the convex side
   toward the dorsal valve margin, 3) slightly expanded and dorsally
   deflected proximal raphe ends, and 4) oval areolae near the axial area,
   becoming lineolate, or transapically elongate, towards the dorsal
   margin. We expect that many of the species reported in the U.S. have
   been identified using names of species from other continents. We also
   expect that critical microscopy and use of original literature is likely
   to clarify the geographic distribution of species within Encyonema. This
   work is important in order to understand, document and protect the
   species diversity of diatoms and their aquatic habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Simple reaction times (RTs) to auditory-somatosensory (AS) multisensory
   stimuli are facilitated over their unisensory counterparts both when
   stimuli are delivered to the same location and when separated. In two
   experiments we addressed the possibility that top-down and/or
   task-related influences can dynamically impact the spatial
   representations mediating these effects and the extent to which
   multisensory facilitation will be observed. Participants performed a
   simple detection task in response to auditory, somatosensory, or
   simultaneous AS stimuli that in turn were either spatially aligned or
   misaligned by lateralizing the stimuli. Additionally, we also informed
   the participants that they would be retrogradely queried (one-third of
   trials) regarding the side where a given stimulus in a given sensory
   modality was presented. In this way, we sought to have participants
   attending to all possible spatial locations and sensory modalities,
   while nonetheless having them perform a simple detection task.
   Experiment I provided no cues prior to stimulus delivery. Experiment 2
   included spatially uninformative cues (50\% of trials). In both
   experiments, multisensory conditions significantly facilitated detection
   RTs with no evidence for differences according to spatial alignment
   (though general benefits of cuing were observed in Experiment 2).
   Facilitated detection occurs even when attending to spatial information.
   Performance with probes, quantified using sensitivity (d'), was impaired
   following multisensory trials in general and significantly more so
   following misaligned multisensory trials. This indicates that spatial
   information is not available, despite being task-relevant. The
   collective results support a model wherein early AS interactions may
   result in a loss of spatial acuity for unisensory information. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Recombinant activated factor VIIa (FVIIa) is a bypassing agent used to
   treat bleeding episodes in haemophilia patients with inhibitors to
   factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX. The pharmacological effect of FVIIa
   is short-lived and therefore with the recommended dose of 90 mu g kg-1,
   a bleeding episode is treated with multiple injections. A long-acting
   form of FVIIa that can ensure adequate haemostasis with a single
   infusion, without increasing the thrombotic risk, would therefore be
   beneficial. PEGylated liposomes (PEGLip) have been shown to bind FVIIa
   and to improve haemostatic efficacy in preclinical experiments. In the
   present phase I/II clinical trial, we assessed the safety and efficacy
   of PEGLip-formulated FVIIa in severe haemophilia A patients (FVIII <
   1\%) with inhibitors to FVIII. Each patient received one prophylactic
   infusion of standard FVIIa and one prophylactic infusion of
   PEGLip-formulated FVIIa. The order of the infusions was randomized and
   the two infusions were separated by a ten-day washout period. Efficacy
   assessed by thromboelastography revealed that PEGLip-FVIIa induced
   significantly shorter clotting times and produced higher clot firmnesses
   than standard FVIIa. Thrombin generation assays showed that PEGLip-FVIIa
   induced faster thrombin generation and higher peak levels of thrombin
   than standard FVIIa. These effects lasted up to 5 h postinfusion.
   Measurements of D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and fibrinogen
   showed no significant differences between the PEGLip-FVIIa and standard
   FVIIa treatments. PEGLip-FVIIa therefore showed improved haemostatic
   efficacy without increased risk of thrombosis and may be further
   developed for the treatment for bleeding episodes in haemophilia
   patients with inhibitors.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Brain plasticity was investigated in 14 Italian children affected by
   developmental dyslexia after 6 months of phonological training. The
   means used to measure language reorganization was the recognition
   potential, an early wave, also called N150, elicited by automatic word
   recognition. This component peaks over the left temporo-occipital cortex
   and its amplitude depends on linguistic expertise. N150 elicited by
   written words was measured both in dyslexic children before and after
   training and in a sample of matched normal readers during phonological,
   semantic and orthographic tasks. After training, dyslexic children
   increased their reading speed. Normal readers showed a typical left
   posterior N150, whereas in dyslexic children it was equally distributed
   across hemispheres before and shifted to left posterior sites after
   training. In addition, dyslexics' left posterior N150 asymmetry on the
   phonological task after training was significantly correlated with
   reading speed improvement, that is, those children who showed the
   greatest left shift in phonological N150 also had the greatest reading
   speed improvement. Source localization of the N150 component was made
   with both the Standard Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography
   software and the classical dipole analysis method termed Brain
   Electrical Source Analysis. The N150 generator lies in the left
   occipito-temporal cortex (Brodmann areas 39, 37 and 19) in good readers,
   but in right homologous areas in dyslexic children before training.
   After the treatment, the dyslexics' main N150 generator shifted to the
   left occipito-inferotemporal cortex (namely Brodmann areas 37 and 19)
   with small differences between tasks. The two source location methods
   provided consistent, converging solutions. Results add to the current
   literature on the phonological hypothesis of dyslexia by showing
   hemispheric reorganization of linguistic networks at the level of early
   word recognition potential. Furthermore, the present work is the first
   to investigate brain reorganization in a regular/transparent language
   like Italian.}},

Abstract = {{Proton resonance frequency shift-based MR thermometry (MRT) is hampered
   by temporal magnetic field changes. Temporal changes in the magnetic
   susceptibility distribution lead to nonlocal field changes and are,
   therefore, a possible source of errors. The magnetic volume
   susceptibility of tissue is temperature dependent. For water-like
   tissues, this dependency is in the order of 0.002 ppm/degrees C. For
   fat, it is in the same order of magnitude as the temperature dependence
   of the proton electron screening constant of water (0.01 ppm/degrees C).
   For this reason, proton resonance frequency shift-based MR thermometry
   in fatty tissues, like the human breast, is expected to be prone to
   errors. We aimed to quantify the influence of the temperature dependence
   of the susceptibility on proton resonance frequency shift-based MR
   thermometry. Heating experiments were performed in a controlled phantom
   set-up to show the impact of temperature-induced susceptibility changes
   on actual proton resonance frequency shift-based temperature maps. To
   study the implications for a clinical case, simulations were performed
   in a 3D breast model. Temperature errors were quantified by computation
   of magnetic field changes in the glandular tissue, resulting from
   susceptibility changes in a thermally heated region. The results of the
   experiments and simulations showed that the temperature-induced
   susceptibility changes of water and fat lead to significant errors in
   proton resonance frequency shift-based MR thermometry. Magn Reson Med

Abstract = {{Metabolic complications continue to play a major role in the management
   of HIV infection. Dyslipidemia associated with HIV infection and with
   the use of combined antiretroviral therapy includes elevations in
   triglycerides, reduced high-density cholesterol, and variable increases
   in low-density and total cholesterol. The association between
   dyslipidemia and specific antiretroviral agents has been underscored.
   Multiple pathogenic mechanisms by which HIV and antiretroviral agents
   lead to dyslipidemia have been hypothesized, but they are still
   controversial. The potential clinical and pathological consequences of
   HIV-associated hyperlipidemia are not completely known, but several
   studies reported an increased risk of coronary artery disease in
   HIV-positive individuals receiving combined antiretroviral therapy.
   HIV-infected persons who have hyperlipidemia should be managed similarly
   to those without HIV infection in accordance with the National
   Cholesterol Education Program. Life style changes are the primary
   target. Statins and fibrates and/or modification in antiretroviral
   therapy are possible approaches to this problem.}},

Abstract = {{In Echinococcus multilocularis metacestodes, the surface-associated and
   highly glycosylated laminated layer, and molecules associated with this
   structure, is believed to be involved in modulating the host-parasite
   interface. We report on the molecular and functional characterisation of
   E. multilocularis phosphoglucose isomerase (EmPGI), which is a component
   of this laminated layer. The EmPGI amino acid sequence is virtually
   identical to that of its homologue in Echinococcus granulosus, and
   shares 64\% identity and 86\% similarity with human PGI. Mammalian PGI
   is a multi-functional protein which, besides its glycolytic function,
   can also act as a cytokine, growth factor and inducer of angiogenesis,
   and plays a role in tumour growth, development and metastasis formation.
   Recombinant EmPGI (recEmPGI) is also functionally active as a glycolytic
   enzyme and was found to be present, besides the laminated layer, in
   vesicle fluid and in germinal layer cell extracts. EmPGI is released
   from metacestodes and induces a humoral immune response in
   experimentally infected mice, and vaccination of mice with recEmPGI
   renders these mice more resistant towards secondary challenge infection,
   indicating that EmPGI plays an important role in parasite development
   and/or in modulating the host-parasite relationship. We show that
   recEmPGI stimulates the growth of isolated E. multilocularis germinal
   layer cells in vitro and selectively stimulates the proliferation of
   bovine adrenal cortex endothelial cells but not of human fibroblasts and
   rat hepatocytes. Thus, besides its role in glycolysis, EmPGI could also
   act as a factor that stimulates parasite growth and potentially induces
   the formation of novel blood vessels around the developing metacestode
   in vivo. (c) 2010 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Bartonella spp are the causative agent of cat scratch disease in humans.
   Cats are the natural reservoir of these bacteria and may infect humans
   through scratches, bites or fleas. Blood samples from 47 cats aged up to
   12 months were collected for this study. All animals were lodged in
   municipal animal shelters in the Vale do Sinos region, Rio Grande do
   Sul, Brazil. Bartonella spp were detected by genus-specific polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) and when the PCR was positive, the species were
   determined by DNA sequencing. A Giemsa-stained blood smear was also
   examined for the presence of intraerythrocytic elements suggestive of
   Bartonella spp infection. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed for
   all positive samples. Using molecular detection methods, Bartonella spp
   were detected in 17.02\% (8/47) of the samples. In seven out of eight
   samples confirmed to be positive for Bartonella spp, blood smear
   examination revealed the presence of intraerythrocytic elements
   suggestive of Bartonella spp. Phylogenetic analysis characterized
   positive samples as Bartonella henselae (5) or Bartonella clarridgeiae
   (3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular study
   demonstrating the presence of Bartonella spp in cats from the Southern

   horizontal area within a boundary, and boundary depth). Empirical data
   from 4 experiments, 54 environments, and 130 participants indicate that
   permeability theory correctly predicted 6 a priori hypotheses and also
   correctly predicted that the remaining 2 hypotheses would have effect
   sizes too small to detect. The main determinants of judged enclosure or

   slightly elevated upon acetylation of the aglycon phenol hydroxyls

   DNA-protector activity of the derivative without the carbohydrate was
   slightly greater than that of the starting SDG. This was explained by

Abstract = {{Alan Greenspan argues that the crisis was unpredictable and inevitable,
   given the `excessive' leverage of the financial intermediaries. I focus
   upon the housing sector, which has been at the origin of the financial
   crisis because the value of the financial derivatives ultimately
   depended upon the ability of the mortgagors to repay their debts. The
   uncertainty concerns the capital gains - housing price appreciation -
   and the rate of interest. I explain why the application of stochastic
   optimal control (SOC) is an effective approach to determine the optimal
   degree of leverage, the optimum and excessive risk and the probability
   of a debt crisis. I show that the theoretically derived early warning
   signal of a crisis is the excess debt ratio, equal to the difference
   between the actual and optimal ratio. The excess debt of households
   starting from 2004-05 indicated that a housing crisis was most likely.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To investigate psychotropic drug use among women ever exposed to
   intimate partner violence (IPV) in relation to mental distress and
   sociodemographic, lifestyle and somatic health characteristics, and to
   assess whether drug use differed for physical and/or sexual violence
   compared with psychological abuse alone. Methods: Cross-sectional data
   from women aged 30-60 years were drawn from self-reported questionnaires
   in the Oslo Health study 2000-2001. Women reporting hypnotic, anxiolytic
   and/or antidepressant drug use in the previous four weeks were defined
   as users. Differences in psychotropic drug use by IPV exposure were
   examined by logistic regression analyses. Results: In total, 880 (14\%)
   of 6,471 included women reported ever experiencing IPV; 494 (8\%)
   reported physical and/or sexual IPV, and 386 (6\%) reported
   psychological IPV alone. Physical and/or sexual IPV was significantly
   associated with use of all psychotropic drugs: hypnotics (odds ratio
   (OR) 2.28; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 1.73-3.00); anxiolytics
   (OR 3.29; 95\% CI, 2.43-4.44); and antidepressants (OR 2.72; 95\% CI,
   1.97-3.76). The associations remained significant for anxiolytics (OR
   1.67; 95\% CI, 1.14-2.45) and antidepressants (OR 1.50; 95\% CI,
   1.02-2.19) after adjusting for mental distress, sociodemographic,
   lifestyle and somatic health characteristics. Psychological IPV alone
   was associated with use of anxiolytics (OR 1.81; 95\% CI, 1.20-2.75) and
   antidepressants (OR 2.38; 95\% CI, 1.64-3.45). After adjustments the
   association persisted for use of antidepressants only (OR 1.64; 95\% CI,
   1.05-2.55). Conclusions: Women exposed to IPV were more likely to report
   use of psychotropic drugs, even after adjusting for mental distress. The
   study indicates that exposure to IPV; including psychological abuse
   should be evaluated as a possible source of distress when psychotropic
   drug treatment is considered.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of life on Earth has produced an organism that is
   beginning to model and understand its own evolution and the possible
   future evolution of life in the universe. These models and associated
   evidence show that evolution on Earth has a trajectory. The scale over
   which living processes are organized cooperatively has increased
   progressively, as has its evolvability. Recent theoretical advances
   raise the possibility that this trajectory is itself part of a wider
   developmental process. According to these theories, the developmental
   process has been shaped by a yet larger evolutionary dynamic that
   involves the reproduction of universes. This evolutionary dynamic has
   tuned the key parameters of the universe to increase the likelihood that
   life will emerge and produce outcomes that are successful in the larger
   process (e.g. a key outcome may be to produce life and intelligence that
   intentionally reproduces the universe and tunes the parameters of
   `offspring' universes). Theory suggests that when life emerges on a
   planet, it moves along this trajectory of its own accord. However, at a
   particular point evolution will continue to advance only if organisms
   emerge that decide to advance the developmental process intentionally.
   The organisms must be prepared to make this commitment even though the
   ultimate nature and destination of the process is uncertain, and may
   forever remain unknown. Organisms that complete this transition to
   intentional evolution will drive the further development of life and
   intelligence in the universe. Humanity's increasing understanding of the
   evolution of life in the universe is rapidly bringing it to the
   threshold of this major evolutionary transition.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the ocular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin and
   moxifloxacin in human conjunctiva and aqueous humor in subjects
   undergoing cataract surgery.
   DESIGN: Multicenter, open-label, randomized study.
   METHODS: Subjects scheduled for routine cataract surgery and with
   normal-appearing conjunctiva were eligible. One conjunctival biopsy
   sample and 1 aqueous humor sample were obtained from subjects randomly
   assigned to 1 of 10 prespecified time points (1 to 312 hours) after
   treatment initiation of azithromycin ophthalmic solution 1\% or
   moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5\%. Samples were assayed using
   liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
   RESULTS: Azithromycin 1\% provided high concentrations (peak level,
   559.7 mu g/g) in human conjunctiva that were sustained at levels 1 to 2
   orders of magnitude higher than those of moxifloxacin 0.5\% throughout
   the 7-day dosing period and for at least 7 days thereafter. Azithromycin
   also showed an extended half-life (65.7 hours) in conjunctiva relative
   to that of moxifloxacin (28.6 hours). Accordingly, the concentration of
   azithromycin was maintained well above the minimum inhibitory
   concentration required for inhibition of growth of 90\% of tested
   bacterial isolates for at least 7 days, whereas moxifloxacin
   conjunctival levels fell to levels at or less than the minimum
   inhibitory concentration required for inhibition of growth of 90\% of
   tested bacterial isolates approximately 24 hours after the last dose.
   Peak aqueous humor concentration of moxifloxacin was higher (0.77 mu
   g/mL) than that of azithromycin (0.053 mu g/mL). No clinically relevant
   safety findings were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin 1\% demonstrated high, therapeutic levels in
   the conjunctiva that were maintained up to 7 days after completion of a
   1-week dosing regimen. Aqueous humor levels, however, were
   subtherapeutic with this dosing regimen. In comparison, moxifloxacin
   achieved lower conjunctival tissue levels, but higher aqueous humor
   levels. (Am J Ophthalmol 2010;150:744-751. (C) 2010 by Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Comparison of different treatment options for palm oil production waste
   on a life cycle basis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{907-915}},

Abstract = {{Globally, 45 million metric tonnes of palm oil has been produced in
   2009. The production of 1 t crude palm oil requires 5 t of fresh fruit
   bunches (FFB). On average, processing of 1 t FFB in palm oil mills
   generates 230 kg empty fruit bunches (EFB) and 650 kg palm oil mill
   effluent (POME) as residues. These residues cause considerable
   environmental burdens, particularly greenhouse gas emissions. In order
   to reduce those emissions, four waste management options are compared in
   the present study using 1,000 kg of FFB as functional unit.
   A detailed life cycle model has been used to calculate the environmental
   impacts of POME and EFB treatment. The options under investigation are:
   (1) dumping EFB and storing POME and ponds, (2) returning EFB to the
   plantation and POME as before, (3) using EFB and POME for co-composting
   and returning the produced compost to the plantation, (4) generating
   biogas from POME and thereafter as in (3). The CML 2001 method included
   in the GABI 4.3 software package has been used for the impact
   calculations. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to
   estimate the influence of good and poor management practice on the
   environmental performance.
   The main contributor to the GWP is methane from POME and EFB dumping.
   The GWP of palm oil mill waste treatment can be reduced from 245 kg
   CO2eq per ton FFB to up to 5 kg CO2eq per ton FFB due to reduced methane
   emissions and nutrient recycling. Co-composting of POME and EFB leads to
   considerable nutrient recovery, in addition to GWP reduction. Thus, the
   composting process reduces not only environmental burdens; it also leads
   to net environmental benefit regarding most environmental impact
   categories, e.g., acidification potential, eutrophication potential,
   ozone layer depletion potential, etc. due to the avoided emissions from
   inorganic fertilizer production. The recovery of nutrients in EFB can be
   achieved by solely returning it to the plantation, but only the combined
   treatment of EFB and POME allows nutrient recovery from POME while
   methane emissions from pond systems are avoided simultaneously. The
   fermentation of POME to produce biogas reduces environmental burdens
   when operating under best practice conditions. However, fugitive biogas
   emissions of more than 2\% reverse that beneficial effect.
   A life-cycle-based comparison of conventional and advanced treatment
   systems for EFB and POME can support decision makers regarding waste
   treatment options and provide information on technology risks involved.
   The results of this study may be used as basic calculation data for
   clean development mechanism for palm oil mills. LCA is shown to be a
   powerful tool to estimate and compare environmental impacts of different
   options. Unfortunately, it is rarely used in the palm oil industry in
   order to improve or optimize palm oil production systems. This study has
   shown that nutrient recovery from POME and EFB offers considerable
   environmental and economic benefits to palm oil production systems.
   However, using EFB for energy production, as it is discussed and
   realized by some palm oil mills, prohibits environmental beneficial POME
   utilization. Best waste management practice reduces emissions at palm
   oil mills and consequently the carbon footprint of palm oil products.
   Co-composting of EFB and POME, with or without prefermentation of POME
   in a biogas plant, is a profitable way to use the nutrients from both
   POME and EFB.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To characterise contemporary results of aortic valve
   replacement in relation to type of prosthesis and subsequent competing
   hazards.
   Methods 5470 procedures in 5433 consecutive patients with aortic valve
   replacement 6 coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were studied.
   Microsimulation of survival and valve-related outcomes was performed
   based on meta-analysis and patient data inputs, with separate models for
   age, gender and CABG. Survival was validated against the UK Heart Valve
   Registry.
   Results Patient survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 90\%, 78\% and 57\%,
   respectively. The crossover points at which bioprostheses and mechanical
   prostheses conferred similar life expectancy (LE) was 59 years for men
   and women (no significant difference between prosthesis types between
   the ages of 56 and 69 for men, and 58 an 63 for women). The improvement
   in event-free LE for mechanical valves was greater at younger ages with
   a crossover point of 66 years for men and 67 years for women. Long-term
   survival was independently influenced by age, male gender and
   concomitant CABG, but not by type of prosthesis. In bioprostheses the
   most common long-term occurrence was structural deterioration. For men
   aged 55, 65 and 75 at initial operation it had a lifetime incidence of
   50\%, 30\% and 13\%, respectively. The simulation output showed
   excellent agreement with registry data.
   Conclusion Bioprostheses can be implanted selectively in patients as
   young as 56 without significant adverse effects on life expectancy,
   although event-free life expectancy remains significantly lower with
   bioprostheses up to age of implant of 63.}},

Title = {{Increased Risk of Esophageal Varices, Liver Cancer, and Death in
   Patients With Alcoholic Liver Disease}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims:
   During the last decades, a multitude of different treatments for chronic
   liver disease have been introduced. New surveillance programs have been
   established to detect esophageal varices and liver cancer. The aims of
   our study were to assess whether the prognosis for patients hospitalized
   with liver diseases between 1969 and 2006 had improved and to study the
   differences in mortality and complications between patients with
   alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic liver diseases.
   Methods:
   We used the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and Cause of Death
   Register at the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden between
   1969 and 2006 to identify and follow-up a cohort of patients with liver
   disease according to the International Classification of Diseases-8, -9,
   and -10.
   Results:
   There were 36,462 patients hospitalized with alcoholic and 95,842 with
   nonalcoholic liver diseases. The main finding was that patients
   hospitalized with alcoholic liver disease had an increased mortality
   risk, compared to patient with nonalcoholic liver disease, 1.89 (1.85 to
   1.92). In addition, the patients with alcoholic liver disease had an
   increased risk for esophageal varices and liver cancer. There was a
   reduced risk for hospitalization with esophageal varices for patients
   with nonalcoholic liver disease up to 1998.
   Conclusions:
   We found that the prognosis for patients hospitalized with chronic liver
   diseases had not improved. Patients with alcoholic liver disease have an
   increased risk of complications, which suggest that the disease is more
   aggressive and are in need of closer follow-up than other chronic liver
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Optical frequency combs can be employed over a broad spectral range to

   calibration of laser wavelength, including a discussion of ancillary
   measurements such as determining the mode order. The underlying purpose
   of these calibrations is to provide traceable standards in support of
   length measurement. The relative uncertainty needed to fulfill this goal
   is typically 10(-8) and never below 10(-12), very modest requirements
   compared to the capabilities of comb-based frequency metrology. In this
   accuracy range the Global Positioning System (GPS) serves as an
   excellent frequency reference that can provide the traceable
   underpinning of the measurement. This article describes techniques that
   can be used to completely characterize measurement errors in a GPS-based
   comb system and thus achieve full confidence in measurement results.}},

Abstract = {{The simple organoselenium compound diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)(2) is a
   promising new pharmacological agent. However, few toxicological
   evaluations of this molecule have been reported. We evaluated the
   effects of acute administration of (PhSe)(2) on toxicological parameters
   in rabbits. Adult New Zealand rabbits were exposed to (PhSe)(2) (5-500
   mu mol kg(-1), intraperitoneally) once a day for 5 days. Exposure to 500
   mu mol kg(-1) caused 85\% mortality. Exposure to 50 mu mol kg(-1) of
   (PhSe)(2) increased the glutathione levels in the hippocampus, kidney,
   heart, muscle and blood, whereas lipoperoxidation (TBARS) decreased in
   the cerebellum and kidney after exposure to 5 mu mol kg(-1). The
   activity of glutathione peroxidase increased in the heart and muscle of
   rabbits treated with 50 mu mol kg(-1) of (PhSe)(2) and glutathione
   reductase activity was reduced in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and
   kidney. Treatment with (PhSe)(2) reduced the activity of
   delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase in the hippocampus and increased this
   activity in the heart, but did not alter the activity of complexes I and
   II of the respiratory chain in the liver and brain. Hepatic and renal
   biochemical and histological parameters were not modified by (PhSe)(2)
   and apoptosis was not detected in these tissues; however, the hepatic
   cells tended to accumulate fat vacuoles. These results indicated that
   acute toxicology to (PhSe)(2) in rabbit is dependent on the dose, which
   should motivate further experiments on the therapeutic properties of
   this compound. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{International mandates for smart metering are enabling variable and
   real-time pricing regimes such as dynamic peak pricing (DPP), which
   charges 10-40 times the off-peak rate for electricity during short
   periods. This regime aims to reduce peak electricity demand
   (predominantly due to increase in residential air-conditioning usage)
   and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Although trials indicate that DPP can
   achieve significant demand reductions, particularly in summer, little is
   known about how or why households change their cooling practices in
   response to this strategy. This paper discusses the outcomes of a small
   qualitative study assessing the impact of a DPP trial on household
   cooling practices in the Australian state of New South Wales. The study
   challenges common assumptions about the necessity of air-conditioning
   and impact of price signals. It finds that DPP engages households as
   co-managers of their cooling practices through a series of notification
   signals (SMS, phone, in-home display, email, etc.). Further, by linking
   the price signal to air-conditioning, some householders consider this
   practice discretionary for short periods of time. The paper concludes by
   warning that policy makers and utilities may serve to legitimise
   air-conditioning usage and/or negate demand reductions by failing to
   acknowledge the non-rational dynamics of DPP and household cooling
   practices. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over recent years, changes of erythrocytic nuclei have been increasingly
   used to evaluate genotoxic effects of different compounds such as
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo-a-pyrene, naphthalene,
   beta-naphthoflavone), heavy metals (cadmium, mercury), textile mill
   effluent especially in aquatic ecosystem. However, in fish, both
   micronuclei and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities also appear
   spontaneously and their frequency can be seasonally dependent. The aim
   of the study was to evaluate the frequency of micronuclei (MN), nuclear
   abnormalities (NA) including vacuolated nuclei (VN) and cytoplasmic
   vacuoles (CV) in erythrocytes of Balkan whip snake Hierophis gemonensis
   and establish the level of spontaneous appearance during the annual
   cycle. Average frequency of NA was 10.89 +/- A 4.72\% while the MN (0.03
   +/- A 0.03\%) and VN (0.04 +/- A 0.08\%) were seldom detected. NA
   significantly positively correlated with MN (r = 0.319; P < 0.05) and VN
   (r = 0.363; P < 0.05). Appearance of CV did not correlate with other
   measured parameters and average frequency was 11.06 +/- A 8.33\%.
   Significant seasonal variation was found in NA appearance with the
   lowest value in spring and the highest in winter. VN increase was
   observed in autumn. MN and CV levels varied between seasons but not
   significantly. Considering the biological cycle, frequency of NA, VN, MN
   and CV recorded in pre-hibernation/hibernation increased compared to the
   active phase, but only NA elevation was significant. Although the
   obtained results showed differences according to sex, statistical
   analysis of measured parameters showed the same pattern of seasonal
   variation in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Some works have been done in analyzing and improving the throughput
   capacity of ad hoc networks, by exploiting the properties of physical
   constraints such as mutual interference, limited bandwidth,
   characteristics of nodes' distribution and so on. In particular, scaling
   laws have received the most attention as they quantify the capacity of
   an ad hoc wireless network. In this paper, the general expressions are
   derived for the capacity scaling laws. It is found that the strategy of
   an individual node dominates the throughput capacity of a wireless ad
   hoc network. We show that there exist some optimal strategies that can
   maximize the throughput capacity of the network. Using a game theoretic
   approach, we further illustrate that the optimal strategies can achieve
   Nash equilibria and maintain evolutionarily stable.}},

Abstract = {{Aquaporin-8 (AQP8) is a water channel expressed extensively in male and
   female reproductive systems. But its physiological functions are largely
   unknown. In the present study, we first found significantly increased
   number of offspring delivered by AQP8(-/-) mothers compared with
   wild-type mothers in cross-mating experiments. Comparison of ovulation
   in the two genotypes demonstrated that AQP8(-/-) ovaries released more
   oocytes (9.5 +/- 1.9 vs. 7.1 +/- 2.1 in normal ovulation and 37.8 +/-
   6.7 vs. 27.9 +/- 5.7 in superovulation). Histological analysis showed
   increased number of corpus luteums in mature AQP8(-/-) ovaries,
   suggesting increased maturation and ovulation of follicles. By RTPCR,
   western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses, we determined the
   expression of AQP8 in mouse ovarian granulosa cells. Granulosa cells
   isolated from AQP8(-/-) mice showed 45\% of decreased membrane water
   permeability than wild-type mice. As the atresia of ovarian follicles is
   primarily due to apoptosis of granulosa cells, we analyzed the apoptosis
   of isolated granulosa cells from wild-type and AQP8(-/-) mice. The
   results indicated significantly lower apoptosis rate in AQP8(-/-)
   granulosa cells (21.3 +/- 3.6\% vs. 32.6 +/- 4.3\% in AQP8(+/+)
   granulosa cells). Taken together, we conclude that AQP8 deficiency
   increases the number of mature follicles by reducing the apoptosis of
   granulosa cells, thus increasing the fertility of female mice. This
   discovery may offer new insight of improving female fertility by
   reducing granulosa cell apoptosis through AQP8 inhibition. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Diffusion bonding was carried out between titanium alloy (TC4) and
   oxygen free copper (OFC) in vacuum and good transition joints were
   formed. The microstructure and elements' composition were characterized
   by XRD, SEM and EDX. The tensile strength of the welding joint was
   measured. The results show that with the welding temperature increasing,
   the tensile strength of the welding joint increased first and then
   decreased. Thus the optimum welding parameters were 800 degrees C, 5 MPa
   and 30 min. The interdiffused layer with gradually varied element
   composition was formed at the interface of TC4/OFC welding joint.
   Cu(3)Ti(2), Cu(4)Ti(3), CuTi and Cu(4)Ti were formed at the interface of
   titanium and copper. The fracture morphology indicates that the fracture
   mainly took place at the weak bond of TC4/OFC interface. And the pores
   at the joints and species and thickness of the intermetallics played an
   important role in the bond strength of TC4/OFC.}},

Abstract = {{In order to provide better diagnosis and treatment of infertility and to
   develop better contraceptive methods, more needs to be learned about how
   sperm move through the female reproductive tract. Crucial phases of
   mammalian sperm transport include passage through the cervix and
   uterotubal junction, storage in the oviductal sperm storage reservoir,
   release from the reservoir, and location of the egg. There is some
   evidence for the existence of special passageways for sperm in the
   cervix, but this needs to be demonstrated and the mechanism of guiding
   sperm through the cervix needs to be elucidated. Passage of sperm
   through the uterotubal junction requires sperm to have certain proteins,
   but how these proteins function is not known. To release themselves from
   the oviductal storage reservoir, sperm undergo motility hyperactivation;
   however, the process is not understood. Finally, chemotactic agents
   emanating from the vicinity of the egg may modulate sperm flagellar
   movement; however, little is known about how motility is regulated and
   how changes in flagellar beat patterns enable sperm to reach the egg.
   There are three main areas in which bioengineers can provide crucial
   help for elucidating these mysteries: (1) by developing a method for
   measuring and comparing sperm flagellar bending patterns, (2) by
   improving optical methods for envisioning the movement of sperm within
   the female reproductive tract, and (3) by developing chambers that mimic
   the physical environment of the tract so that molecular mechanisms that
   regulate sperm movement can be identified.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition performance does not usually change along the lifespan, but
   the response criterion usually does, and in general, it changes from
   being conservative during youth to being liberal, in old age. The focus
   of the present study is to analyze the changes that take place, both in
   discrimination and response criterion, as a result of aging in two
   recognition tasks: one with neutral images, and the other with faces
   showing positive and negative emotional expressions. Two groups of
   participants performed both tasks: young (N = 21; age range, 17-33
   years), older (N = 21; age range, 65-91 years). The analyses of several
   discrimination parameters (d' and probability of recognition) and the
   response criterion yielded significant age differences. Thus, results
   indicated that the ability to discriminate of older participants was
   better than that of younger participants when having to recognize
   neutral images, and faces with negative emotional expressions. The
   response criterion of younger participants was always conservative,
   whereas older participants only showed liberal criteria in front of
   faces with emotional expressions. In relation to the neutral images, the
   response criterion of older participants was optimum, because it led to
   more hits, without increasing the false alarms. The results are
   partially explained by the tasks differential difficulty, and are
   discussed within the frame of Simulation theory.}},

Abstract = {{Object. Definitive data allowing clinicians to predict which meningioma
   patients will fail to respond to conservative management are lacking. To
   address this need, the authors systematically reviewed the published
   literature regarding the natural history of small, untreated
   meningiomas.
   Methods. The authors performed a systematic review of the existing
   literature on untreated meningiomas that were followed with serial MR
   imaging. They summarize the published linear rates of tumor growth, and
   the risk factors for development of new or worsened symptoms during
   follow-up by using a stratified chi-square test.
   Results. The search methods identified 22 published studies reporting on
   675 patients with untreated meningiomas followed by serial MR imaging.
   Linear growth rates varied significantly: no growth was the most common
   rate, although reports of more aggressive tumors noted growth rates of
   up to a 93\% linear increase in size per year. The authors found that
   few patients with initial tumor diameters < 2 cm went on to develop new
   or worsened symptoms over a median follow-up period of 4.6 years.
   Patients with initial tumor diameters of 2-2.5 cm demonstrated a marked
   difference in the rate of symptom progression if their tumors grew >
   10\% per year, compared with those tumors growing <= 10\% per year (42\%
   vs 0\%; p < 0.001, chi-square test). Patients with tumors between > 2.5
   and 3 cm in initial size went on to develop new or worsened symptoms
   17\% of the time.
   Conclusions. This systematic review of the literature regarding the
   clinical behavior of untreated meningiomas suggests that most
   meningiomas <= 2.5 cm in diameter do not proceed to cause symptoms in
   the approximately 5-year period following their discovery. Those that do
   cause symptoms can usually be predicted with close radiographic
   follow-up. Based on these findings, the authors suggest the importance
   of observation in the early course of treatment for small asymptomatic
   meningiomas, especially those with an initial diameter < 2 cm. (DOI:

Abstract = {{We developed a new apoptosis imaging probe with gold nanoparticles
   (AuNPs). A near-infrared fluorescence dye was attached to AuNP surface
   through the bridge of peptide substrate (DEVD). The fluorescence was
   quenched in physiological conditions due to the quenching effect of
   AuNP, and the quenched fluorescence was recovered after the DEVD had
   been cleaved by caspase-3, the enzyme involved in apoptotic process. The
   adhesion of DEVD substrates on AuNP surface was accomplished by
   conjugation of the 3,4-dihydroxy phenylalanine (DOPA) groups which are
   adhesive to inorganic surface and rich in mussels. This surface
   modification with DEVD substrates by DOPA groups resulted in increased
   stability of AuNP in cytosol condition for hours. Moreover, the cleavage
   of substrate and the dequenching process are very fast, and the cells
   did not need to be fixed for imaging. Therefore, the real-time
   monitoring of caspase activity could be achieved in live cells, which
   enabled early detection of apoptosis compared to a conventional
   apoptosis kit such as Annexin V-FITC. Therefore, our apoptosis imaging
   has great potential as a simple, inexpensive, and efficient apoptosis

Abstract = {{Posttranscriptional gene silencing, also known as RNA interference,
   involves degradation of homologous mRNA sequences in organisms. In
   plants, posttranscriptional gene silencing is part of a defense
   mechanism against virus infection, and double-stranded RNA is the
   pivotal factor that induces gene silencing. In this paper, we got seven
   hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs) constructs against different hot-spot sequences of
   Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or Potato virus Y (PVY) genome. After
   expression in Escherichia coli HT115, we extracted the seven hpRNAs for
   the test in tobacco against TMV or PVY infection. The data suggest that
   different hpRNAs against different hot-spot sequences of TMV or PVY
   genome had different ability to protect tobacco plants from viral
   infection. The resistance to TMV conferred by the hpRNA against the TMV
   movement protein was stronger than other TMV hpRNAs; the resistance to
   PVY conferred by the hpRNA against the PVY nuclear inclusion b was
   better than that induced by any other PVY hpRNAs. Northern blotting of
   siRNA showed that the resistance was indeed an RNA-mediated virus
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{We simulate the density and temperature of laser-produced plasmas for
   various atomic number Z materials covering from Li to Au. In the range
   of the intensity from 10(9) to 10(14) W/cm(2) of 1 ns and 1.06 mu m
   wavelength Nd:YAG lasers, the ablated plasma is modeled well by the
   constant temperature expansion model. We carried out radiation
   hydrodynamic simulations for the density scale length around the
   electron density of 10(23) to 10(20) cm(-3), to examine its dependence
   on the atomic number Z. At the laser intensity of 10(10) W/cm(2), our
   simulation shows that the Z dependence of the scale length is
   proportional to Z(1/2). For more intense laser, the Z dependence
   weakens, and the scale length becomes almost independent of Z. We point
   out that the simulated profiles, such as the density and temperature,
   and especially the double ablation structure of high Z material, are
   rather sensitive to use of different radiation opacity models. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have compared the merits of different working fluids
   for use in Rankine power systems. Most often, however, these have
   considered a limited number of specific fluids for which the
   thermodynamic properties are known. In the investigation summarized
   here, the Redlich-Kwong fluid model was used to develop a thermodynamic
   similarity framework that can be used as a comparative model for
   evaluating the performance of Rankine cycle working fluids. This can be
   viewed as a reduced order model that, based on thermodynamic similarity,
   quantifies the characteristics of the working fluids in terms of a
   single dimensional coordinate space defined by the choice of critical
   temperature. The advantage of this framework is that it allows
   exploration of the performance advantages of working fluids for which
   full thermodynamic properties are not yet available. Predictions of the
   model for common fluids were examined and conclusions regarding optimal
   fluids for solar Rankine systems are discussed. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Background: This study looked at the association of cystatin-C (cys-C)

   Methods: Five sets of normal glucose tolerance subjects were recruited
   from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES), a
   population-based study in southern India: 43 subjects with no metabolic
   risk factors, 44 subjects with one metabolic risk factor, 37 subjects
   with two risk factors, 40 subjects with three risk factors, and 40
   subjects with four or five metabolic risk factors. Metabolic syndrome
   was defined using National Cholesterol Education Program criteria for
   adults modified for waist measured using the World Health Organization
   Asia Pacific guidelines. Serum cys-C was estimated by a high-sensitivity
   particle-enhancing nephelometry assay.
   Results: Subjects with four or five metabolic abnormalities had the
   highest cys-C levels, and with decreasing number of metabolic
   abnormalities, the cys-C levels decreased linearly (P for trend <0.001).
   Regression analysis showed a linear increase in cys-C levels with
   increasing number of metabolic abnormalities.
   Conclusion: Cys-C levels are highly correlated with the number of
   metabolic abnormalities in Asian Indians.}},

Title = {{Massive-Training Artificial Neural Network Coupled With
   Laplacian-Eigenfunction-Based Dimensionality Reduction for
   Computer-Aided Detection of Polyps in CT Colonography}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in the current computer-aided detection (CAD) of
   polyps in CT colonography (CTC) is to reduce the number of
   false-positive (FP) detections while maintaining a high sensitivity
   level. A pattern-recognition technique based on the use of an artificial
   neural network (ANN) as a filter, which is called a massive-training ANN
   (MTANN), has been developed recently for this purpose. The MTANN is
   trained with a massive number of subvolumes extracted from input volumes
   together with the teaching volumes containing the distribution for the
   ``likelihood of being a polyp;{''} hence the term `` massive
   training.{''} Because of the large number of subvolumes and the high
   dimensionality of voxels in each input subvolume, the training of an
   MTANN is time-consuming. In order to solve this time issue and make an
   MTANN work more efficiently, we propose here a dimension reduction
   method for an MTANN by using Laplacian eigenfunctions (LAPs), denoted as
   LAP-MTANN. Instead of input voxels, the LAP-MTANN uses the dependence
   structures of input voxels to compute the selected LAPs of the input
   voxels from each input subvolume and thus reduces the dimensions of the
   input vector to the MTANN. Our database consisted of 246 CTC datasets
   obtained from 123 patients, each of whom was scanned in both supine and
   prone positions. Seventeen patients had 29 polyps, 15 of which were 5-9
   mm and 14 were 10-25 mm in size. We divided our database into a training
   set and a test set. The training set included 10 polyps in 10 patients
   and 20 negative patients. The test set had 93 patients including 19
   polyps in seven patients and 86 negative patients. To investigate the
   basic properties of a LAP-MTANN, we trained the LAP-MTANN with actual
   polyps and a single source of FPs, which were rectal tubes. We applied
   the trained LAP-MTANN to simulated polyps and rectal tubes. The results
   showed that the performance of LAP-MTANNs with 20 LAPs was advantageous
   over that of the original MTANN with 171 inputs. To test the feasibility
   of the LAP-MTANN, we compared the LAP-MTANN with the original MTANN in
   the distinction between actual polyps and various types of FPs. The
   original MTANN yielded a 95\% (18/19) by-polyp sensitivity at an FP rate
   of 3.6 (338/93) per patient, whereas the LAP-MTANN achieved a comparable
   performance, i.e., an FP rate of 3.9 (367/93) per patient at the same
   sensitivity level. With the use of the dimension reduction architecture,
   the time required for training was reduced from 38 h to 4 h. The
   classification performance in terms of the area under the
   receiver-operating-characteristic curve of the LAP-MTANN (0.84) was
   slightly higher than that of the original MTANN (0.82) with no
   statistically significant difference (p-value= 0.48).}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims O-6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
   removes methyl adducts from O-6-guanine. Known as methylation tolerance,
   selection for mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient cells that are unable to
   initiate lethal processing of O-6-methylguanine-induced mismatches in
   DNA is observed in vitro as a consequence of MGMT deficiency. It was
   therefore hypothesised that an MGMT field defect may constitute a
   preneoplastic event for the development of MMR-deficient tumours
   displaying microsatellite instability (MSI).
   Methods MGMT expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry and the
   methylation status of the gene promoter by PCR in neoplastic, adjacent
   and distant mucosal tissues of patients with MSI or non-MSI (MSS)
   colorectal cancer (CRC). The cancers were familial (42 MSI, 13 MSS) or
   sporadic (40 MSI, 49 MSS) in origin, or arose in the context of
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; 13 MSI, 36 MSS). Colonic mucosa from
   patients with diverticulitis (n=20) or IBD (n=39 in 27 patients) without
   cancer served as controls.
   Results Loss of MGMT expression was more frequent in MSI than MSS CRC
   (p=0.047). In comparison with MSS tumours, MSI CRC occurred more
   frequently adjacent to patches of mucosa that lacked MGMT expression
   (p=0.002). Overall, loss of MGMT expression was associated with MGMT
   gene promoter methylation (p=0.03).
   Conclusion MGMT field defects are more frequently associated with MSI
   than MSS CRC. These findings indicate that methylation tolerance may be
   a crucial initiating step prior to MMR deficiency in the development of
   MSI CRC in familial, sporadic and IBD settings.}},

Abstract = {{The water quality of the Seto Inland Sea has recently improved compared
   with that in the 1970s and early 1980s, but the fisheries yield of
   species such as sardine and short-neck clam has decreased. Since 2002,
   the Nori (Porphyra) culture has been particularly heavily damaged due to
   a lack of nutrients. In this paper, we review our previous water quality
   results of the Seto Inland Sea, which focused on the Nori culture
   directly influenced by the nutrient concentrations. Moreover, we discuss
   the potential mechanism for low levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen
   (DIN) concentrations and poor Nori production. Our results suggest that
   the reasons for the recent decreases in nutrient concentrations are (1)
   decrease of nutrient loading from riverine sources, (2) an increase of
   nutrient uptake by phytoplankton growth due to an increase of euphotic
   depth, (3) the diffusion of nutrients in the bottom marine layer due to
   a decrease in stratification, and (4) a decrease of the upward nutrient
   flux across the overlying water-sediment interface.}},

   With US guidance, the radiologist can visualize the needle tip

Abstract = {{The long-term deflection behavior of two reinforced concrete (RC) beams
   with similar dimensions and material properties was monitored. One beam
   was externally strengthened with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) strips,
   whereas the other was used as a control specimen. Both beams have been
   subjected to sustained loading for over 6-1/2 years.
   The objective of the experiments was to assess the significance of creep
   in the epoxy adhesive and whether such creep might allow the FRP strips
   to unload over time. Slip movements at the ends of the FRP strips were
   also monitored. The experimental deflections have been compared to
   deflection predictions using ACI 209R-92 and CEB-FIP MC 90. The creep
   deformations of the FRP-strengthened beam are not as predicted from the
   control beam. Two analytical approaches are used: a step-by-step in-time
   analysis and finite element (FE) modeling. Both techniques demonstrate
   that creep of the adhesive layer can account for the differences
   observed between the predicted and actual behaviors of the beams.}},

Abstract = {{French and US endocrine societies recommend using GC-MS or RIA after
   purification (extraction + chromatography) to assess blood levels of
   testosterone in women. However, most of laboratories use automatized
   methods that have to be reserved to measure testosterone levels in men.
   The aim of this study was to show the consequences of analytical
   discrepancies of some immunological methods on the diagnostics values of
   testosterone levels assayed in women. Compared to GC-MS the correlations
   of the assayed levels varied (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients:
   0.935; 0.793; 0.841; 0.852 respectively for RIA Immunotech (TM) with
   extraction and chromatographic purification; Testosterone Access-DxI800
   (R); Testosterone Immulite 2000 (R); Testosterone II Cobas E601 (R)).
   The testosterone levels allowed an accurate conclusion in 95.2 \%; 75.8
   \%; 77.4 \%; 89.8 \% of patients, respectively. The agreement with GC-MS
   results was very good for RIA method (kappa=0,840), moderate for DxI800
   (R) method (kappa=0,414), moderate for Immulite (R) method
   (kappa=0,467), good for Cobas (R) method (kappa=0,667). Most of
   discordances are false hypertestosteronemia. The use of non recommended
   methods may leads to nosological errors (misclassification rates of 10
   to 25\% with automatized methods) that causes loss of chance in part of
   female patients.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) deficiency is associated with development of
   hypertension. We examined whether melatonin protects against the blood
   pressure increase is because of the restoration of the NO pathway.
   Spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and control normotensive Wistar
   Kyoto (WKY) rats aged 4 weeks were assigned to four groups (N = 6 for
   each group): untreated SHR and WKY, melatonin-treated SHR and WKY.
   Melatonin-treated rats received 0.01\% melatonin in drinking water for 8
   wks. All rats were sacrificed at 12 wk of age. SHR had higher blood
   pressure than WKY, which melatonin prevented. Plasma asymmetric
   dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels were elevated in SHR, combined with a
   reduction in plasma L-arginine to ADMA ratio (AAR). In the kidney,
   L-arginine, ADMA, and AAR were not different between SHR and WKY rats,
   whereas L-citrulline level was increased in SHR. Melatonin decreased
   plasma ADMA level and restored plasma AAR. Renal dimethylarginine
   dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH, ADMA-metabolizing enzyme) activity was
   lower in SHR than WKY rats, which melatonin therapy prevented. Also,
   melatonin elevated both L-arginine and ADMA but reduced L-citrulline
   level in the kidney in SHR, which was associated with the prevention of
   reduced renal argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) expression in SHR. Moreover,
   melatonin reduced the degree of oxidative damaged DNA product, 8-
   hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) immunostaining in SHR. The observed
   antihypertensive effects of melatonin in young SHR are because of the
   restoration of the NO pathway by reduction of plasma ADMA, restoration
   of plasma AAR, preservation of renal L-Arg availability, and attenuation
   of oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we present a case of post-operative liver metastases from
   pancreatic head cancer in a patient with leukocytopenia, who was safely
   treated by hepatic arterial infusion (HAD chemotherapy consisting of
   gemcitabine and 5-FU. The patient was a 61-year-old woman who underwent
   pancreatico-duodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer, but was found to be
   an unsuitable candidate for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy due to the
   presence of leukocytopenia. Five months after surgery, a follow-up CT
   revealed two liver metastases. Intravenous systemic chemotherapy was
   also contraindicated due to the leukocytopenia. In the apparent absence
   of recurrence, excepting the liver metastases, we decided to administer
   HAT chemotherapy, which had already been administered following the
   curative surgery. HAI chemotherapy has been shown to be associated with
   a lower incidence of systemic side effects. Gemcitabine at a close of
   400 mg was administered via a bedside pump and infused over 30 min.
   After gemcitabine infusion, 250 mg of 5-FU was infused continuously over
   24 h from clays 1 to 5. This comprised I cycle of therapy. The treatment
   cycles were continued biweekly. After 10 cycles without severe side
   effects, it was found that though the size of the metastatic tumors was
   not reduced, tumor vascularity was. However, after the 13th treatment
   cycle, local recurrence and lymph node metastases were detected. By this
   time, the patient had recovered from the leukocytopenia, and could thus
   be administered systemic chemotherapy. In conclusion, HAI chemotherapy
   is useful and safe for the treatment of malignancies confined to the
   liver, even in cases where the patient is in a reduced physical
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the measurement reliability and the kinetic chain of
   the thickness of the transverse abdominal muscle (TA) and the action
   potential of the levator ani muscle (LA). In other words, the change in
   the muscle output was examined during simultaneous contraction of both
   TA and LA. {[}Subjects] The subjects were seven healthy adult women
   (40.1+/-12.8 years). {[}Method] Thicknesses of TA and integration
   electromyograms (iEMG) of LA were measured in five tasks in the supine
   position. The tasks were: 1) Resting state, 2) Maximal contraction of
   TA, 3) Maximal contraction of LA, 4) Maximal simultaneous contraction of
   both TA and LA, and 5) Maximal simultaneous contraction of both TA and
   LA with resistance added to both knees. To examine the measurement
   reliability, the tasks were tested twice. {[}Results] The interclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) of the thickness of TA and the iEMG of LA
   showed high reproducibility during maximal simultaneous contraction. The
   thicknesses of TA during maximal simultaneous contraction and maximal
   simultaneous contraction with resistance were greater than during the
   resting state and maximal contraction of TA. The iEMG of LA during
   maximal simultaneous contraction was greater than during the resting
   state, maximal contraction of TA and maximal contraction of LA. In
   regression analysis, a significant relationship was found between the
   thickness of TA and iEMG of LA. {[}Conclusion] The muscle output during
   simultaneous contraction was larger than that of each individual muscle,
   suggesting that it is easier to contract LA when TA is contracted from
   the aspect of the kinetic chain.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Root hair formation is induced in lettuce seedlings when the seedlings
   are transferred from a liquid medium at pH 6.0 to one at pH 4.0. Auxin,
   ethylene, and light are also required for the induction of root hair
   formation. To investigate the mechanism by which ethylene production is
   regulated during root hair formation, we isolated three
   1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase genes (Ls-ACO1, 2,
   and 3) from lettuce, each of which exists as a single copy in the
   genome. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the three ACO
   proteins as well as a phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ls-ACO3 was
   the most divergent among the ACO family. Northern hybridization analyses
   revealed that the mRNA levels of Ls-ACO2, but not Ls-ACO1 and Ls-ACO3,
   increased in the primary root after the transfer to a pH 4.0 medium.
   Addition of ACC or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to the pH 6.0 medium
   induced root hair formation, and a concomitant accumulation of Ls-ACO2
   mRNA was observed. In contrast, the mRNA levels of Ls-ACO1 and Ls-ACO3
   were unaffected by either ACC or IAA treatment. Furthermore, white light
   irradiation of dark-grown seedlings following the transfer to pH 4.0
   medium induced the accumulation of all three ACO mRNAs. However,
   accumulation of Ls-ACO2 mRNA was also observed in non-irradiated
   seedlings, suggesting that the expression of Ls-ACO2 was induced not by
   light but by low pH. These results suggest that among the differentially
   regulated ACO genes, Ls-ACO2 plays a key role in ethylene production
   during low-pH-induced root hair formation in lettuce.}},

Abstract = {{Aprepitant is a new neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist developed as
   a treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). To
   evaluate the efficacy and safety of aprepitant used in combination with
   standard therapy (granisetron and dexamethasone), we conducted a
   multicenter, phase II, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized
   study in Japanese cancer patients who received cancer chemotherapy
   including cisplatin (>= 70 mg/m2). Aprepitant was administered for 5
   days. A total of 453 patients were enrolled. In the three study groups,
   (i) standard therapy, (ii) aprepitant 40/25 mg (40 mg on day 1 and 25 mg
   on days 2-5) and (iii) aprepitant 125/80 mg (125 mg on day 1 and 80 mg
   on days 2-5), the percentage of patients with complete response (no
   emesis and no rescue therapy) was 50.3\% (75/149 subjects), 66.4\%
   (95/143 subjects) and 70.5\% (103/146 subjects), respectively. This
   shows that efficacy was significantly higher in the aprepitant 40/25 mg
   and 125/80 mg groups than in the standard therapy group (chi 2 test
   {[}closed testing procedure]: P = 0.0053 and P = 0.0004, respectively)
   and highest in the aprepitant 125/80 mg group. The delayed phase
   efficacy (days 2-5) was similar to the overall phase efficacy (days
   1-5), indicating that aprepitant is effective in the delayed phase when
   standard therapy is not very effective. In terms of safety, aprepitant
   was generally well tolerated in Japanese cancer patients.

Abstract = {{Objective. - The objective of this study was to explore factors
   associated with hara-kiri as a method of suicide and suicidal behavior
   in contemporary Japan.
   Methods. - A retrospective study was conducted on medical records of 421
   patients (174 male; 247 female) who were considered suicidal and treated
   at the Kitasato University Hospital Emergency Medical Center in Japan
   between January 2006 and March 2008. We compared hara-kiri and all other
   methods regarding sociodemographics and clinical features of all
   suicidal patients.
   Results. - Instances of hara-kiri suicide attempt had the highest
   proportion of males (63\%) among all suicide and suicidal behavior.
   One-way analysis of variance revealed significant differences between
   hara-kiri and other suicide attempt methods in the age of the suicidal
   patients. Result of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that
   those who attempted hara-kiri suicide were likely to be male, be
   diagnosed with schizophrenia, survive, and be married.
   Conclusion. - Our findings indicate that hara-kiri as a method of
   suicide and suicidal behavior remain prevalent in Japan, and the study
   findings also suggest that both clinical and cultural factors might play
   a role in hara-kiri as a method of suicide and suicidal behavior. (C)

Abstract = {{Workplace Bullying could Play Important Roles in the Relationships

   Jiro TAKAKI, et al. Department of Public Health, Okayama University
   Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical
   Sciences-Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess whether
   workplace bullying mediates between job strain, evaluated by the job
   demand control model, and symptoms of depression and sleep disturbance.
   Methods: The subjects in this cross-sectional study were recruited from
   all the workers (N=2,634) at 50 organizations in Japan. Due to missing
   data, the numbers of subjects included in the analyses varied from 1,646
   to 2,062 (response rates varied from 62.5\% to 78.2\%). Job strain and
   workplace social support, workplace bullying, depression, and sleep
   disturbance were assessed using the Japanese versions of the Job Content
   Questionnaire, the Negative Acts Questionnaire, the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
   Index, respectively. Mediation analysis followed the approach outlined
   by Baron and Kenny. We quantitatively estimated the mediation effects
   and tested their significance after adjustment for various combinations
   of demographic variables and workplace social support. Results: Total
   effects of job strain index on depression or sleep disturbance were all
   positive and significant (p<0.05) in both genders. Mediation effects of
   workplace bullying were also all positive and significant (p<0.05) in
   both genders. Even after adjustment for workplace social support, the
   mediation effects were decreased, especially in women, but remained
   significant (p<0.05). Conclusions: Workplace bullying seems to play
   important roles in the relationships of job strain with depression or
   sleep disturbance in both genders. (J Occup Health 2010; 52: 367-374)}},

   (21.1-67.2 mm SL), collected within 1-8 m of the seafloor in Suruga Bay,

   each other by the following adult-like characters: membrane morphology
   between the vertical fin rays and procurrent caudal-fin rays (separated
   in L. lubricum vs. continuous in L. retropinnum), numbers of dorsal-fin
   rays (34-40 vs. 45-52) and anal-fin rays (50-57 vs. 65-72), and caudal
   peduncle length (11.7-13.4\% SL vs. 4.5-5.9\% SL), in addition to
   several other body proportional differences. Unique characters in the
   larval stages of Leptoderma include a translucent occipital region,
   horizontally elongated eye, and head below the upper margin of the orbit
   and abdominal cavity densely covered by melanophores, ontogeny being
   characterized by the acquisition of general adult characters to the
   postflexion stage, indistinct transformation, and the retention of few
   larval characters until almost the end of the juvenile stage, as in
   other known alepocephalids. In addition to the near-bottom larval and
   juvenile collections of both species, the occurrences of benthic or
   near-bottom taxa, including Harpacticoida, in their gut contents
   confirmed the early life history dependence of the former on the
   near-bottom.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of and in situ observation of the transport and
   distribution of water in carbon-paper gas diffusion layers (GDLs) using
   non-destructive imaging techniques is critical for achieving high

   the behavior of water in GDLs of PEFCs, phase-contrast X-ray imaging via
   X-ray interferometric imaging (XII) and diffraction-enhanced imaging
   (DEI) were performed using 35 keV X-rays. The XII technique is useful
   for the radiographic imaging of GDLs and in situ observations of water
   evolution processes in operating PEFCs. DEI provides a way for
   tomographic imaging of GDLs in PEFCs. Because high-energy X-rays are
   applicable to the imaging of both carbon papers and heavy materials,
   which make up PEFCs, phase-contrast X-ray imaging techniques have proven
   to be valuable for investigation of GDLs.}},

Abstract = {{Cotreatment with testosterone (T) and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) is an
   established regimen for inducing of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
   (PIN) and prostate cancer in rodent models. We previously used the pure
   antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI) and bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor
   agonist, to inhibit PIN induction and systemic hyperprolactinemia in
   Noble rats and found that the carcinogenic action of T + E2 is mediated
   directly by the effects of E2 on the prostate and/or indirectly via
   E2-induced hyperprolactinemia. In this study, we delineate the specific
   action(s) of E2 and prolactin (PRL) in early prostate carcinogenesis by
   an integrated approach combining global transcription profiling, gene
   ontology, and gene-network mapping. We identified 2504 differentially
   expressed genes in the T + E2-treated lateral prostate. The changes in
   expression of a subset of 1990 genes (similar to 80\%) were blocked upon
   cotreatment with ICI and bromocriptine, respectively, whereas those of
   262 genes (similar to 10\%) were blocked only by treatment with ICI,
   suggesting that E2-induced pituitary PRL is the primary mediator of the
   prostatic transcriptional response to the altered hormone milieu.
   Bioinformatics analyses identified hormone-responsive gene networks
   involved in immune responses, stromal tissue remodeling, and the ERK
   pathway. In particular, our data suggest that IL-1 beta may mediate, at
   least in part, hormone-induced changes in gene expression during PIN
   formation. Together, these data highlight the importance of pituitary
   PRL in estrogen-induced prostate tumorigenesis. The identification of
   both E2- and pituitary PRL-responsive genes provides a comprehensive
   resource for future investigations of the complex mechanisms by which
   changes in the endocrine milieu contribute to prostate carcinogenesis in
   vivo. (Molecular Endocrinology 24: 2207-2217, 2010)}},

Abstract = {{Because interstellar dust is closely related to the evolution of matter
   in the galactic environment and many other astrophysical phenomena, the
   laboratory synthesis of interstellar dust analogs has received
   significant attention over the past decade. To simulate the ultraviolet
   (UV) interstellar extinction feature at 217.5 nm originating from
   carbonaceous interstellar dust, many reports focused on the UV
   absorption properties of laboratory-synthesized interstellar dust
   analogs. However, no general relation has been established between UV
   interstellar extinction and artificial interstellar dust analogs. Here,
   we show that defective carbon nanostructures prepared by high-energy
   collisions exhibit a UV absorption feature at 220 nm which we suggest
   accounts for the UV interstellar extinction at 217.5 nm. The morphology
   of some carbon nanostructures is similar to that of nanocarbons
   discovered in the Allende meteorite. The similarity between the
   absorption feature of the defective carbon nanostructures and UV
   interstellar extinction indicates a strong correlation between the
   defective carbon nanostructures and interstellar dust.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a sales forecasting model for new-released products
   with a knowledge-based database. Though forecasting future demand is an
   essential part of business planning and operation, most major
   forecasting methods are applied only to regular consuming items, showing
   gradual sales trend caused by seasonal cycles. Most retail products are,
   however, irregular consuming products characterized by fluctuated and
   nonlinear sales trends. In this study, using high correlations between
   short- and long-term accumulated sales within similar products groups, a
   new forecasting model is presented. Based on the correlation database of
   short- and long-term accumulations, the model provides a prediction of
   long-term forecast using the sales result of the product's very early
   release. For practical use, the model is designed to deal with the
   following three points: accuracy; timing of forecast release; and the
   broad coverage of items. As a case study, we applied the model to books
   and consumer electronics sold in Japan. The model enables us to obtain a
   practical sales forecast throughout the lifecycle of the item one or two
   week after its release, and furthermore provides valuable information on
   reprint decision-making. This experiment will prove the reliability in
   accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with
   existing established ones. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-component organic thermochromic materials, consisting of a leuco
   dye, a weak acid acting as the colour developer, and a low-melting
   organic solvent, can change their colour in response to temperature
   changes. Although widely used in applications, their detailed
   thermochromic mechanism is not fully understood. The present study
   delineates the role of subtle changes in the solvent's molecular
   structure and concentration in the crystal violet lactone (CVL,
   dye)/lauryl gallate (LG, developer)/1-alcohol (dodecanol (DD),
   tetradecanol (TD), hexadecanol (HD), or octadecanol (OD); solvent)
   system. Through inkjet printing of the components directly onto a
   substrate, combinatorial approaches reveal differences when the alkyl
   chain length of the alcohol solvent is changed slightly. During the
   process of heating to the melt, followed by cooling to room temperature,
   CVL/LG/DD showed no colour change. On the other hand, CVL/LG/TD
   exhibited reversible thermochromism with colour forming in the molten
   state and colour loss in the solid state. In the composition range
   investigated, the CVL/LG/HD system showed no colour change during
   heating, but on cooling from the molten state, at first a blue colour
   appeared just below the freezing point, and this was followed by a slow
   colour fading on further cooling. A significant new finding is that the
   orientationally disordered alpha-phase of the solvent is required to
   support the dye-developer complex that provides colour. Furthermore,
   there is an optimal solvent chain length for thermochromism: if too
   short, there is no disordered phase and no colour; if too long, the
   formation of the coloured developer-dye complex is prevented in the
   melt.}},

Abstract = {{The geometrical model is used to investigae the orientation of dendrite
   growth in a laser weld single crystal and the variation of the
   distribution of orientation zones when angle xi between the laser
   scanning direction and the {[}100] orientation in (001) surface changes.
   With the increase of xi, the {[}0 (1) over bar0] zone increases whereas
   the {[}010] zone shrinks. Meanwhile, the growth velocities of dendrite
   are different in different orientation zones inside the weld pool. The
   undercooling region is then constructed on the basis of the calculation
   results. It is found that the undercoolings are larger at the boundaries
   than in the grains for all orientation zones, which makes the boundaries
   vulnerable to the CET transition and production of the new grains.
   Moreover, with the increase of xi, the abilities to form the new grains
   are different on the two sides of the weld pool. For comparison, the DD3
   single crystals are laser welded and the experimental results are in
   good agree meent with theoretical ones.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass leaf area Index (LA!) and nitrogen status are important
   parameters for indicating crop growth potential and photosynthetic
   productivity in wheat Nondestructive quick assessment of leaf dry weight
   LAI and nitrogen content is necessary for nitrogen nutrition diagnosis
   and cultural regulation in wheat production. In order to establish the
   monitoring model of nitrogen richness in winter wheat of growth anaphase
   studying the relationship between the nitrogen richness (NR) containing
   nitrogen density LAI and leaf dry weight and the difference of
   hyperspectral reflectance rates (Delta R) we conducted a comparable
   experiment with five winter wheat varieties under nitrogen application
   level of 0 100 200 and 400 kg N ha(-1) The results indicated the NRs of
   the different varieties of winter wheat leaves increased with increasing
   growth stage while in the different nitrogen levels it was sequenced as
   N0>N3>N1>N2 Twelve vegetation indices were compared with corresponding
   NR The NR had significantly negative correlation to TCARI and VD672 in
   those vegetation Indices and their correlations (r) arrived at 0 870 and
   0 855 respectively The coefficients of determination (R-2) of two models
   were 0 757 and 0 731 by erecting model with the two indexes and NR. Root
   mean square error (RMSE) relative error (RE) and determination
   coefficient between measured and estimated NR were employed to test the
   model reliability and predicting accuracy Accuracy rates of the models
   based on TCARI and VD672 achieved 84 56\% and 80 13\% The overall
   results suggested that leaf nitrogen status of growth anaphase in winter
   wheat has stable relationships with some vegetation indexes especially
   index of TCARI and VD672}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the stochastic equation used to predict the
   fluctuating velocity of a fluid particle in a nonhomogeneous turbulent
   flow, in the frame of probability density function (PDF) approaches It
   is shown that a Langevin-type equation is appropriate provided its
   parameters (drift and diffusion matrices) are suitably specified By
   following the approach proposed in the literature for homogeneous
   turbulent shear flows, these parameters have been identified using data
   from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of both channel and pipe flows
   Using statistics extracted from the computation of the channel flow, it
   is shown that the drift matrix of the stochastic differential equation
   can reasonably be assumed to be diagonal but not spherical This behavior
   of the drift coefficients is confirmed by the available results for a
   turbulent pipe flow at low Reynolds number Concerning the diffusion
   matrix, it is found that this matrix is anisotropic for low Reynolds
   number flows, a property which has been observed earlier for a
   homogeneous turbulent shear flow The pertinence of the present
   estimation of the drift and diffusion tensors is assessed through
   different kinds of tests including the incorporation of these parameters
   in a purely Lagrangian, or stand-alone, PDF computation (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common identifiable
   cause of diarrhoea in hospitalized patients. Current therapies rely on
   the administration of metronidazole or vancomycin, which reduce
   vegetative populations of C. difficile in the bowel. Recurrence of the
   disease when treatment with these antibiotics ceases indicates that
   metronidazole and vancomycin affect not only C. difficile but also
   commensal populations that normally mediate competitive exclusion.
   Fidaxomicin is a new antibiotic that inhibits C. difficile. Our study
   shows that fidaxomicin had little effect on the composition of the
   faecal microbiota in terms of its major phylogenetic clusters. Notably,
   clostridial clusters XlVa and IV, and Bifidobacterium, were much less
   affected by fidaxomicin compared to vancomycin treatment. These findings
   help to explain the substantially reduced rates of relapse following
   treatment of CDI with fidaxomicin in recent clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide ((NO)-N-center dot) elicit
   numerous processes in plants. However, our knowledge of H2O2 and
   (NO)-N-center dot-responsive proteins is limited. The present study
   aimed to identify proteins whose accumulation levels were regulated by
   these signaling molecules in citrus leaves. To address this question,
   hydroponically grown citrus plants were treated by incubating their
   roots in the presence of H2O2 or the (NO)-N-center dot donor, sodium
   nitroprusside (SNP). Both treatments induced H2O2 and (NO)-N-center dot
   production in leaves, indicating occurrence of oxidative and nitrosative
   stress conditions. However, treated plants maintained their normal
   physiological status. The vascular system was shown to be involved in
   the H2O2 and (NO)-N-center dot systemic signaling as evidenced by
   real-time labeling of the two molecules. Comparative proteomic analysis
   identified a number of proteins whose accumulation levels were altered
   by treatments. They were mainly involved in photosynthesis, defense and
   energy. More than half of them were commonly modulated by both
   treatments, indicating a strong overlap between H2O2 and (NO)-N-center
   dot responses. Using a redox proteomic approach, several proteins were
   also identified as being carbonylation targets of H2O2 and SNP. The
   analysis reveals an interlinked H2O2 and (NO)-N-center dot proteins
   network allowing a deeper understanding of oxidative and nitrosative
   signaling in plants.}},

Abstract = {{Peppermint is one of the most important aromatic plants because it has
   wide range of industrial uses and is widely accepted by the public for
   its flavoring and pharmaceutical properties. Hot air or natural drying
   of medicinal and aromatic plants, including peppermint, is a common
   postharvest operation. Drying the product reduces biochemical and
   microbiological degradation. However, many studies in the literature
   report the results of drying only a small amount of plant material (less
   than 1 kg) and do not consider the performances of industrial scale
   dryers in terms of their effect on product quality, energy consumption
   and throughput. A rotary drum dryer was used to dry 15 kg of fresh
   chopped peppermint plant. The rotary drum dryer was programmed to
   operate under two different drying schemes: constant air temperature
   drying and rectangular wave-shaped drying air temperature profiles. The
   drying durations were 15-18 h and 12-15 h for constant temperature
   profile and rectangular wave-shaped temperature profiles, respectively.
   Hot air drying caused considerable darkening of the dried peppermint
   leaves. Essential oil contents of peppermint samples dried by the two
   different drying procedures were relatively unaffected by drying scheme
   (2.08-2.7 mL 100 g dry matter(-1)). The menthol content of the leaves
   increased from 32.52\% (fresh) up to 44.52\% (dried), their menthone
   content decreased from 24.85\% (fresh) down to 9.07\% (dried). However,
   the variations within replications were relatively high in terms of the
   menthol (25.39-44.52\%) and menthone (9.07-18.49\%) contents of the
   dried leaves. These variations might have been caused by the
   uncontrolled morphological and physiological changes of the fresh
   peppermint materials associated with their maturity. These variations
   are the main obstacle to obtaining reproducible results and therefore
   dried peppermint products with consistent quality. The specific energy
   consumption values ranged from 7.88 to 15.08 MJ (kg water removed)(-1).
   Daily fluctuations in ambient air conditions directly affected the
   specific energy consumption of rotary drum dryer. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feedback and the
   satisfaction levels of the adolescents and their parents who received
   treatment in the newly opened inpatient unit. The results of the
   questionnaire evaluating the quality of the mental health service
   provided by the inpatient unit were examined retrospectively. The
   participants were the adolescents and their parents who received
   treatment and were discharged between January 2006 and May 2007. They
   were asked to give feedback on their observations and perceptions about
   the treatment they received, starting from the admission assessment
   until the time they were discharged. The satisfaction level of young
   people and their families regarding the service they received during
   their stay in the unit were determined to be high. The results of the
   questionnaires completed by adolescents and parents showed that the
   availability and the helpfulness of the staff, the admission process was
   given the highest satisfaction scores. Information about the
   adolescents' and their parents' experience of the treatment they
   received is essential and valuable in terms of promoting the quality of
   service and better treatment outcomes of an inpatient unit.}},

Abstract = {{The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem composed mainly of
   uncultured bacteria. It plays an essential role in the catabolism of
   dietary fibers, the part of plant material in our diet that is not
   metabolized in the upper digestive tract, because the human genome does
   not encode adequate carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes). We describe a
   multi-step functionally based approach to guide the in-depth
   pyrosequencing of specific regions of the human gut metagenome encoding
   the CAZymes involved in dietary fiber breakdown. High-throughput
   functional screens were first applied to a library covering 5.4 X 10(9)
   bp of metagenomic DNA, allowing the isolation of 310 clones showing
   beta-glucanase, hemicellulase, galactanase, amylase, or pectinase
   activities. Based on the results of refined secondary screens,
   sequencing efforts were reduced to 0.84 Mb of nonredundant metagenomic
   DNA, corresponding to 26 clones that were particularly efficient for the
   degradation of raw plant polysaccharides. Seventy-three CAZymes from 35
   different families were discovered. This corresponds to a fivefold
   target-gene enrichment compared to random sequencing of the human gut
   metagenome. Thirty-three of these CAZy encoding genes are highly
   homologous to prevalent genes found in the gut microbiome of at least 20
   individuals for whose metagenomic data are available. Moreover, 18
   multigenic clusters encoding complementary enzyme activities for plant
   cell wall degradation were also identified. Gene taxonomic assignment is
   consistent with horizontal gene transfer events in dominant gut species
   and provides new insights into the human gut functional trophic chain.

Abstract = {{The impact of the spacer length at the source (L-s) and drain (L-d) on
   the performance of symmetrical lightly-doped double-gate (DG) MOSFET
   with gate length L = 20 nm is analyzed, with the type and doping
   concentration of the spacers kept the same as in the channel material.
   Using the transport parameters extracted from experimental data of a
   double-gate FinFET, simulations were performed for optimization of the
   underlapped gate-source/drain structure. The simulation results show
   that the subthreshold leakage current is significantly suppressed
   without sacrificing the on-state current for devices designed with
   asymmetrical source/drain extension regions, satisfying the relations
   L-s = L/2 and L-d = L. In independent drive configuration, the top-gate
   response can be altered by application of a control voltage on the
   bottom-gate. In devices with asymmetrical source/drain extension
   regions, simulations demonstrate that the threshold voltage
   controllability is improved when the drain extension region length is
   increased. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Stachys sylvatica that are relevant to understanding its ecological
   characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the
   standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles:
   distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,
   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral
   and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation.
   2. A rhizomatous perennial herb, with strong far-creeping stolons,
   Stachys sylvatica is a polymorphic native herb of open woodlands,
   hedgerows, banks of rivers and streams, widespread throughout most of
   the British Isles.
   3. Stachys sylvatica occurs in light to moderate shade. It is suggested
   that the red/far red ratio is more critical than reduced irradiance in
   the plant's response to shading.
   4. Stachys sylvatica occurs on moist or damp but not wet, weakly acid to
   weakly basic soils, and has been described as a nitrate indicator on
   base-rich soils.
   5. Stachys sylvatica depends on seedlings established close to the
   parent plant for maintaining population density. Stolons are probably
   effective in extending the area of clones.
   6. The hybrid between Stachys sylvatica and Stachys palustris, Stachys x
   ambigua, is most frequent in northern and western Britain, and occurs as
   an introduction outside the native range of Stachys sylvatica.}},

   that the nature of impact surface and the crystalline structure of the

Abstract = {{Essential oil accumulation and compositions in aromatic plants depend
   upon various factors such as genetic structure, environmental factors
   and agronomic practices. Spearmint (Mentha spicata L) is one of the
   major aromatic plants cultivated for spice and essential oil
   productions. Field experiments were carried out to determine
   environmental variation in the new Turkish pulegone-piperitone rich
   chemotype, so, its cuttings were transplanted in four different
   locations of Turkey. Essential oil composition was determined with
   GC-MS. As a result of the research, herb essential oil contents of the
   chemotype were between 2.41 and 2.74\%. Oxygenated monoterpenes
   including main components, pulegone and piperitone, were the major
   terpenoid group in the essential oil. Different environmental factors of
   the locations affected quantitatively oil compositions. The results
   revealed that monoterpene hydrocarbons such as D-limonene and
   beta-phellandrene were higher in temperate climate with high altitude.
   On the other hand, trans-beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D. major
   sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in the oil, were higher in warmer ecologies
   resulting similar trend in total sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons. Main
   component pulegone and piperitone and other oxygenated monoterpene
   1,8-cineole also showed significant variation in the different
   ecologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Asymmetric transformations catalyzed by small chiral organic molecules,
   the so-called enantioselective organocatalysis, have been developed as
   an efficient protocol for obtaining optically active products in modern
   organic synthesis. In organocatalytic transformations, the activation of
   reactants through hydrogen bonding interactions has proven to be a
   brilliant strategy to provide a chiral environment for the transient
   assembly of reactants and organocatalysts. In this context, we were
   interested in the characteristic properties of guanidines, namely, their
   strong basic character and their ability to act as recognition elements
   through two parallel hydrogen bonds, which can be manipulated to enable
   their use as enantioselective organocatalysts. Thus, guanidines are
   expected to capture nucleophilic components through hydrogen bonding
   interactions without forming loose ion pairs, after deprotonation from
   pro-nucleophiles. In addition, the N-H proton would function as a
   Bronsted acidic site and hence could convey the acid/base dual function
   even to monofunctional guanidine catalysts. From these basic ideas, we
   aimed to develop novel axially chiral guanidines as enantioselective
   Bronsted base catalysts. In this account article, we present our recent
   achievements in the development of enantioselective transformations
   using these axially chiral guanidine catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Cheetahs and certain other felids consistently ejaculate high
   proportions (>= 60\%) of malformed spermatozoa, a condition known as
   teratospermia, which is prevalent in humans. Even seemingly normal
   spermatozoa from domestic cat teratospermic ejaculates have reduced
   fertilizing capacity. To understand the role of sperm metabolism in this
   phenomenon, we conducted a comparative study in the normospermic
   domestic cat versus the teratospermic cat and cheetah with the general
   hypothesis that sperm metabolic function is impaired in males producing
   predominantly pleiomorphic spermatozoa. Washed ejaculates were incubated
   in chemically defined medium containing glucose and pyruvate. Uptake of
   glucose and pyruvate and production of lactate were assessed using
   enzyme-linked fluorescence assays. Spermatozoa from domestic cats and
   cheetahs exhibited similar metabolic profiles, with minimal glucose
   metabolism and approximately equimolar rates of pyruvate uptake and
   lactate production. Compared to normospermic counterparts, pyruvate and
   lactate metabolism were reduced in teratospermic cat and cheetah
   ejaculates, even when controlling for sperm motility. Rates of pyruvate
   and lactate (but not glucose) metabolism were correlated positively with
   sperm motility, acrosomal integrity, and normal morphology.
   Collectively, our findings reveal that pyruvate uptake and lactate
   production are reliable, quantitative indicators of sperm quality in
   these two felid species and that metabolic function is impaired in
   teratospermic ejaculates. Furthermore, patterns of substrate utilization
   are conserved between these species, including the unexpected lack of
   exogenous glucose metabolism. Because glycolysis is required to support
   sperm motility and capacitation in certain other mammals (including
   dogs), the activity of this pathway in felid spermatozoa is a target for
   future investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Pure and iron incorporated nanostructured Tungsten Oxide (WO3) thin
   films were investigated for gas sensing applications using noise
   spectroscopy. The WO3 sensor was able to detect lower concentrations
   (1-10 ppm) of NH3, CO, CH4, and Acetaldehyde gases at operating
   temperatures between 100 degrees C to 250 degrees C. The iron-doped
   Tungsten Oxide sensor (WO3:Fe) showed some response to Acetaldehyde gas
   at relatively higher operating temperature (250 degrees C) and gas
   concentration of 10 ppm. The sensitivity of the WO3 sensor towards NH3,
   CH4 and Acetaldehyde at lower operating temperatures (50 degrees C-100
   degrees C) was significant when the sensor was photo-activated using
   blue light-emitting diode (Blue-LED). From the results, photo-activated
   WO3 thin film that operates at room temperature appeared to be a
   promising gas sensor. The overall results indicated that the WO3 sensor
   exhibited reproducibility for the detection of various gasses and the
   WO3:Fe indicated some response towards Acetaldehyde gas.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Electrocardiographic (ECG) errors due to electrode cable
   reversal confuse physicians and provoke unnecessary diagnostic tests.
   They occur in approximately 4\% of ECGs performed in the intensive care
   unit (ICU). We aimed to investigate whether this frequency could be
   reduced by an appropriate intervention.
   Methods: All ECGs from consecutive patients were collected at ICU
   discharge and analyzed by the investigators. Before collecting a second
   set of ECGs, we educated our ICU staff and performed technical
   improvements on the electrocardiographs (system approach).
   Electrocardiographic errors were identified applying previously
   published morphologic criteria.
   Results: We collected and analyzed 1123 ECGs from 416 patients. Nine
   hundred ten ECGs (81\%) were recorded in the ICU; and the frequencies of
   electrode cable misplacements before and after the intervention were
   4.8\% and 1.2\%, respectively (P = .002).
   Conclusions: Using a system approach, we were able to significantly
   reduce the frequency of ECG errors due to electrode cable switches by
   75\%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on biodiesel production from residues in particular
   tallow and used cooking oil (UCO). Ireland has 8\% of the EU cattle herd

   potential associated with slaughter wastes and UCO is estimated to be
   7.07 PJ/a; 61\% of which is suitable for biodiesel production. The
   potential quantity of biodiesel is equivalent to 2.1\% of predicted
   transport fuel use in 2010; three quarters of the 2010 biofuels target.
   Biodiesel production from these two residue streams may be expressed as

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies show that some children develop wheezing after 3
   yr of age which tends to persist. It is unknown how this starts or
   whether there is a period of asymptomatic inflammation. The aim of this
   study is to determine whether lower airway allergic inflammation
   pre-exists in late onset childhood wheeze (LOCW). Follow-up study of
   children below 5 yr who had a non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage
   (BAL) performed during elective surgery. The children had acted as
   normal controls. A modified ISAAC questionnaire was sent out at least 7
   yr following the initial BAL, and this was used to ascertain whether any
   children had subsequently developed wheezing or other atopic disease
   (eczema, allergic rhinitis). Cellular and cytokine data from the
   original BAL were compared between those who never wheezed (NW) and
   those who had developed LOCW. Eighty-one normal non-asthmatic children
   were recruited with a median age of 3.2 . Of the 65 children
   contactable, 9 (16.7\%) had developed wheeze, 11 (18.5\%) developed
   eczema and 14 (22.2\%) developed hay fever. In five patients, wheeze
   symptoms developed mean 3.3- yr (range: 2-5 yr) post-BAL. Serum IgE and
   blood eosinophils were not different in the LOCW and NW, although the
   blood white cell count was lower in the LOCW group. The median BAL
   eosinophil \% was significantly increased in the patients with LOCW
   (1.55\%, IQR: 0.33 to 3.92) compared to the children who never wheezed,
   NW (0.1, IQR: 0.0 to 0.3, p = 0.01). No differences were detected for
   other cell types. There were no significant differences in BAL cytokine
   concentrations between children with LOCW and NW children. Before late
   onset childhood wheezing developed, we found evidence of elevated
   eosinophils in the airways. These data suggest pre-existent airways
   inflammation in childhood asthma some years before clinical
   presentation.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmodium falciparum genotyping has recently undergone a revolution,
   and genome-wide genotype datasets are now being collected for large
   numbers of parasite isolates. By contrast, phenotyping technologies have
   lagged behind, with few high throughput phenotyping platforms available.
   Invasion of human erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum is a phenotype
   of particular interest because of its central role in parasite
   development. Invasion is a variable phenotype influenced by natural
   genetic variation in both the parasite and host and is governed by
   multiple overlapping and in some instances redundant
   parasite-erythrocyte interactions. To facilitate the scale-up of
   erythrocyte invasion phenotyping, we have developed a novel platform
   based on two-color flow cytometry that distinguishes parasite invasion
   from parasite growth. Target cells that had one or more receptors
   removed using enzymatic treatment were prelabeled with intracellular
   dyes CFDA-SE or DDAO-SE, incubated with P. falciparum parasites, and
   parasites that had invaded either labeled or unlabeled cells were
   detected with fluorescent DNA-intercalating dyes Hoechst 33342 or SYBR
   Green I. Neither cell label interfered with erythrocyte invasion, and
   the combination of cell and parasite dyes recapitulated known invasion
   phenotypes for three standard laboratory strains. Three different dye
   combinations with minimal overlap have been validated, meaning the same
   assay can be adapted to instruments harboring several different
   combinations of laser lines. The assay is sensitive, operates in a
   96-well format, and can be used to quantitate the impact of natural or
   experimental genetic variation on erythrocyte invasion efficiency. (C)

Abstract = {{The Nutrition, Prevention and Health for Children and Teenagers in
   Aquitaine program is a regional implementation of the French National
   Program of Nutrition and Health (PNNS). The first of two surveys of a
   representative sample of Aquitaine preschools was conducted in
   2004-2005. This survey showed that more than 2/3 of teachers offered a
   morning snack to their pupils at around 10 o'clock in the morning,
   mainly composed of sweet cakes, cookies, or candies. Following this
   initial survey, actions were implemented starting in September 2005,
   aiming to stop systematic morning snacks or improve their composition.
   The same survey was repeated during 2007-2008 in order to analyze the
   changes in morning snack practices in preschools between 2004-2005 and
   2007-2008. Data were collected from teachers of Aquitaine's preschools
   who filled out questionnaires. Schools were randomly chosen according to
   their size and whether or not they belonged to a priority education zone
   (ZEP). The results show that 57.9\% of teachers organized a morning
   snack in 2007-2008, versus 68.7\% in 2004-2005. In 2004-2005, 22\% of
   teachers considered the morning snack as ``unjustified{''} compared to
   44\% in 2007-2008. The composition of morning snacks improved: 17.7\% of
   teachers offered fruit and/or milk in 2007-2008 versus 8.5\% in
   2004-2005. Morning snacks composed of other foods (such as sweets,
   chocolate pieces, cookies, pastries, bread, fruit juice) decreased from
   60.2\% in 2004-2005 to 40.2\% in 2007-2008. In 2007-2008, 19\% of the
   teachers reported that children had snacks in their schoolbag versus
   34\% in 2004-2005. The proportion of teachers reporting children having
   snacks in their schoolbag decreased from 34\% in 2004-2005 to 19\% in
   2007-2008. Comparison between these two surveys is encouraging as it
   shows an improvement of the perception and practices of teachers
   regarding morning snacks. These results encourage the partners of this
   program to continue the fieldwork actions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

   further increased with exercise training Exercise training did not
   attenuate the decrease in twitch or tetanic tension of the GAS/Plan or
   SOL It did however prevent the increase in twitch half relaxation time

Abstract = {{As optical lithography advances toward the 10 nm mark, much effort is
   being expended to push electron beam lithography into the deep sub-10-nm
   regime. A significant issue at this length scale is the ability to
   accurately measure and compare linewidths. Measurements using secondary
   electron micrographs have a bias of a few nanometers and are therefore
   difficult to interpret in the sub-10-nm regime. Transmission electron
   microscopy can give greater accuracy but requires significant effort.
   This article shows that the use of a backscattered electron image
   together with a metal coating where appropriate can yield better
   measurement results than by using secondary electrons. With the use of a
   suitable model, linewidths for sub-10-nm hydrogen silsesquioxane lines
   were extracted with an estimated error of 1 nm. (C) 2010 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{Background: TNF-alpha inhibitors are potent anti-inflammatory drugs that
   have revolutionized the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Delayed
   gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) is a non-invasive method
   to study cartilage quality, in particular the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
   content.
   Purpose: To evaluate knee cartilage quality before and after treatment
   with a TNF-alpha inhibitor (infliximab) in patients with RA using
   dGEMRIC and to study clinical parameters and serum cartilage oligomeric
   protein (COMP) after the same treatment.
   Material and Methods: Seven patients with chronic RA received infusions
   of 3 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, and 22. Clinical
   examination, serum COMP level, and dGEMRIC scans (1.5 T) were performed
   at baseline and after 7 months. The dGEMRIC index (ms), reflecting
   cartilage GAG content, was calculated using an inversion recovery
   sequence in the femoral weight-bearing cartilage. Seven years after
   treatment, charts were reviewed regarding joint replacement surgery
   (TKA).
   Results: Clinical parameters showed an improvement for all patients
   after the 7-month treatment period. Serum COMP decreased from 13 +/- 4.5
   to 11 +/- 3.4 (mu g, mean +/- SD) mu g/ml (P < 0.05). The dGEMRIC index
   was lower at follow-up than at baseline, 332 +/- 85 and 382 +/- 69 (ms,
   mean +/- SD), respectively (P < 0.05), indicating loss of GAG. The two
   patients with the lowest dGEMRIC index had received a TKA 7 years after
   treatment.
   Conclusion: This longitudinal study indicates a substantial GAG loss
   from the knee cartilage matrix in patients with chronic RA. Treatment
   with infliximab does not seem to protect the cartilage from further
   deterioration despite improvements in clinical parameters and decreased
   serum COMP.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The carbon dioxide laser (002) has been proven to be an
   effective device for the treatment of photoaging. However, it is
   associated with adverse side effects including prolonged erythema,
   edema, burning, milia, acne, crusting and hypo-/hyperpigmentation.
   Delayed onset hypopigmentation after CO2 laser resurfacing can markedly
   detract from clinical outcomes. To overcome the disadvantages of
   traditional ablative and non-ablative resurfacing, fractional
   photothermolysis (FP) has been introduced. FP has been demonstrated in
   early case reports and case series to produce significant improvement in
   hypopigmentation of acne and surgical scars.
   Case Report: A 53-year-old Caucasian female with Fitzpatrick type I skin
   presented with a nine-month history of delayed onset hypopigmentation
   following ablative CO2 laser resurfacing. After a series of three
   treatments at eight-week intervals with an ablative fractionated CO2
   laser device, the hypopigmentation and line of pigmentary demarcation
   between the face and neck improved by 75 percent.
   Conclusion: Ablative fractional resurfacing is a safe and potentially
   effective modality for the treatment of CO2 laser induced

Abstract = {{The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was investigated on carbon (XC-72)
   supported platinum nanoparticles, generated via the carbonyl chemical
   route and on oxide composites supported platinum generated via the
   UV-photo-deposition technique in sulfuric acid medium. The behavior of
   Pt/C was examined using a careful dosing of the catalyst loading
   spanning the range from 4.3 to 131 mu g cm(-2). The ORR electrochemical
   response of Pt/C (in line with recent literature data) is put into
   contrast with the Pt/oxide-composite systems. Our results point out that
   it is possible to use smaller amounts of catalyst for the ORR when
   platinum atoms interact with the oxide (anatase) surface of the
   substrate composite. Evidence of the incipient metal-substrate
   interaction is discussed in the light of the results of XRD experiments.

Abstract = {{As the world's largest importer of marine ornamental species for the
   aquaria, curio, home decor, and jewelry industries, the United States
   has an opportunity to leverage its considerable market power to promote
   more sustainable trade and reduce the effects of ornamental trade stress
   on coral reefs worldwide. Evidence indicates that collection of some
   coral reef animals for these trades has caused virtual elimination of
   local populations, major changes in age structure, and promotion of
   collection practices that destroy reef habitats. Management and
   enforcement of collection activities in major source countries such as
   Indonesia and the Philippines remain weak. Strengthening US trade laws
   and enforcement capabilities combined with increasing consumer and
   industry demand for responsible conservation can create strong
   incentives for improving management in source countries. This is
   particularly important in light of the March 2010 failure of the parties
   to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
   to take action on key groups of corals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{No evidence for ovarian synchrony or asynchrony in hamadryas baboons}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{The tendency for females to have synchronous or asynchronous ovarian
   cycles has been reported in several species, including hamadryas
   baboons, Papio h. hamadryas. Both fitness benefits and costs have been
   postulated for each condition; however, these remain to be demonstrated.
   Moreover, uncertainty remains about whether these ovarian cycle patterns
   are `real' or an artefact of sampling and statistical design. We used a
   null model incorporating a bootstrap randomization procedure to examine
   whether ovarian cycles were more synchronous or asynchronous than
   expected by chance in a large captive hamadryas colony. Male
   contraception meant that all female colony members underwent repeated
   ovarian cycling throughout the 1-year study. No pairing or group of
   females had synchronous or asynchronous ovarian cycles. Rather, females
   oscillated between pseudosynchronous and pseudoasynchronous states,
   because ovarian cycle length varied between and within females. We
   outline why the absence of synchrony and asynchrony and variation in
   cycle length in this and other studies are explicable when one considers
   (1) the brief ovarian cycle bouts typical of natural fertility
   populations and (2) the type of synchrony or asynchrony measures that
   were employed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while variation in
   ovarian cycle length appears to be ubiquitous among animals with these
   cycles, this does not rule out the possibility of synchrony and
   asynchrony occurring in natural fertility populations. Further research
   on this phenomenon in hamadryas and other species is justified,
   therefore, albeit with a focus on natural fertility populations and
   employing null-model techniques similar to that used here. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{Fatty acids and their metabolites regulate immune cell function. The
   present study was undertaken to examine the detailed distribution of
   fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), the cytosolic chaperones of fatty

   FABP7 was localized to the alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA)(+)
   fibroblastic reticular cells, which construct the stromal reticula in
   the T cell areas of the peripheral lymph nodes and spleen.
   Immunoelectron microscopy showed that FABP7(+) cells enclosed the
   collagen fibers, forming a conduit system, which transport lymph and
   associated low-molecular-mass proteins. In contrast, FABP5(+) cells were
   distributed throughout the lymph node and contained well-developed
   lysosome and phagocytic materials within the cytoplasm. The mesenteric
   lymph nodes of FABP7 knockout mice showed normal histological features,
   but the percentage of CD4(+) cells was significantly increased compared
   with that in wild-type mice. These data indicate that FABP7 may be
   involved in T cell homeostasis, possibly by modulating lipid metabolism
   in fibroblastic reticular cells within the peripheral lymph nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Scars arise in the late phase of wound healing and are characterized by
   fibroplasia. Previous controversial studies have discussed the
   regenerative wound healing capacity of Murphy Roths Large (MRL) mice.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of improved
   wound healing in a skin transplantation model. Skin grafts from MRL and
   haplotypically identical B10.BR mice were cross-transplanted. At day 10,
   B10.BR and MRL grafts on B10.BR recipients deposited collagen and showed
   severe apoptosis. Grafts of MRL recipients were not affected by such
   alterations and showed an enhanced healing progress. They were
   characterized by higher partial pressure of tissue oxygen, increased
   microcirculation, exceptionally intense neovascularization, and a
   blunted inflammatory response. This phenotype was accompanied by
   increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression, augmented by
   enhanced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
   phosphorylation. These effects were combined with a decreased STAT1
   expression and phosphorylation. STAT1 pattern variation was associated
   with decreased Smad7 levels. Furthermore, MRL recipients showed improved
   stem cell recruitment to the wound area. The basic accelerated wound
   healing mechanism in MRL mice found in this skin transplantation model
   is improved engraftment; this is based on enhanced neovascularization
   and reduced inflammation. These effects are most likely due to higher
   vascular endothelial growth factor levels and changes in the STAT/Smad
   signal pathway, which may enhance transforming growth factor-beta
   signaling, reducing proinflammatory responses.}},

Abstract = {{We report chemical shifts for H-N, N, and C' nuclei in the His-tagged B1
   domain of protein G (GB1) over a range of pH values from pH 2.0 to 9.0,
   which fit well to standard pH-dependent equations. We also report a 1.2
   angstrom resolution crystal structure of GB1 at pH 3.0. Comparison of
   this crystal structure with published crystal structures at higher pHs
   provides details of the structural changes in GB1 associated with
   protonation of the carboxylate groups, in particular a conformational
   change in the C-terminus of the protein at low pH. An additional change
   described recently is not seen in the crystal structure because of
   crystal contacts. We show that the pH-dependent changes in chemical
   shifts can be almost entirely understood based on structural changes,
   thereby providing insight into the relationship between structure and
   chemical shift. In particular, we describe through-bond effects
   extending up to five bonds, affecting N and C' but not H-N;
   through-space effects of carboxylates, which fit well to a simple
   electric field model; and effects due to conformational change, which
   have a similar magnitude to many of the direct effects. Finally, we
   discuss cooperative effects, demonstrating a lack of cooperative
   unfolding in the helix, and the existence of a beta-sheet ``iceberg{''}
   extending over three of the four strands. This study therefore extends
   the application of chemical shifts to understanding protein structure.}},

Abstract = {{Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, INAD, is a severe progressive
   psychomotor disorder with infantile onset and characterized by the
   presence of axonal spheroids throughout the central and peripheral
   nervous systems. A subset of INAD patients shows also brain iron
   accumulation which represents instead the distinctive feature of the
   idiopathic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, NBIA. These
   diseases share the same causative gene, PLA2G6, encoding iPLA2-VIA, a
   calcium-independent phospholipase. Mutations that lead to a complete
   absence of protein are associated with a severe INAD profile, while
   compound heterozygous mutations with possibly a residual protein
   activity are instead associated with the less severe NBIA phenotype.
   Here we describe two INAD patients both with an unusually rapid disease
   progression and a peculiar neuroradiological presentation in one of
   them. Compound heterozygosity for a large intragenic deletion and a
   nonsense mutation was found in one of them while the other is carrying
   two novel splice-site mutations. Breakpoint-sequence analysis suggests a
   non-allelic-homologous-recombination (NAHR) event, probably underlying
   the rearrangement. These findings, while supporting the
   genotype-phenotype correlation already observed in INAD patients,
   provide the first sequence characterization of a genomic rearrangement
   in PLA2G6 gene, thus orienting the search for missing mutant alleles in
   PLA2G6 related diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The vibration control of rotors for gas or steam turbines is usually
   performed using passive dampers when hydrodynamic bearings are not used.
   In layouts where the rotating parts are supported by rolling bearings,
   the damping is usually provided by squeeze film dampers. Their passive
   nature and the variability of their performances with temperature and
   frequency represent the main disadvantages. Dampers with
   magnetorheological and electrorheological fluid allow solving only a
   part of the abovementioned drawbacks. Active magnetic bearings (AMBs)
   are promising since they are very effective in controlling the vibration
   of the rotor and offering the possibility of monitoring the rotor's
   behavior using their displacement sensors. However they show serious
   drawbacks related to their stiffness. Electromagnetic dampers seem to be
   a valid alternative to visco-elastic, hydraulic dampers due to, among
   the others, the absence of all fatigue and tribology issues resulting
   from the absence of contact, the small sensitivity to the working
   environment, the wide possibility of tuning even during operation, the
   predictability of the behavior, the smaller mass compared with AMBs, and
   the failsafe capability. The aim of the present paper is to describe a
   design methodology adopted to develop electromagnetic dampers to be
   installed in aero-engines. The procedure has been validated using a
   reduced scale laboratory test rig. The same approach has then been
   adopted to design the electromagnetic dampers for real civil aircraft
   engines. The results in terms of achievable vibration reductions, mass,
   and overall dimensions are hence presented. A trade-off between the
   various proposed solutions has been carried out evaluating quantitative
   performance parameters together with qualitative aspects that this
   ``more electric{''} technology implies. {[}DOT: 10.1115/1.4000801]}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate the Cambridge
   Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) in a Norwegian group
   of patients undergoing surgery for middle fossa arachnoid cysts (AC). We
   also wanted to assess health related quality of life (HRQOL) in these
   patients to see if it could be improved by decompression of the AC.
   Adult patients (>18 years) with unilateral middle fossa AC and no
   previous history of neurological disease, head injury, or a psychiatric
   disorder were eligible for inclusion. We used four tests from CANTAB to
   assess the level of neuropsychological performance: paired associate
   learning (PAL) and delayed matching to sample (DMS) assessed temporal
   lobe functions, while Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) and intra-extra
   dimensional (IED) shift focused on frontal lobe functions. Patients with
   postoperative cerebral complications were reported, but excluded from
   neuropsychological follow-up. In addition to the CANTAB data, pre- and
   postoperative clinical and radiological data were collected. HRQOL was
   assessed using Short Form 36 (SF-36) pre- and postoperatively. We found
   significant improvement in the two temporal tests assessing memory, but
   no improvement in the two frontal tests assessing executive function.
   HRQOL was significantly reduced preoperatively in two of eight SF-36
   domains and improved significantly in four domains postoperatively.
   CANTAB facilitates detection of cognitive improvements after
   decompression of the cyst in patients with AC in the middle fossa. The
   improvements were detected on the tests sensitive to temporal lobe
   problems only, not on the tests more sensitive to frontal lobe
   affection. This establishes construct validity for CANTAB for the first
   time in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this study is to determine the correlation of
   clinical symptoms of UAO (upper airway obstruction) with radiographic
   evaluation of adenoidal obstruction and tonsil size in children with
   adenotonsillar hypertrophy and to evaluate the usefullness of lateral
   neck radiography.
   Study design: Prospective study.
   Setting: Haydarpasa Numune Research and Education Hospital, Istanbul,
   Turkey.
   Subjects and methods: This study analyses 95 children with one or more
   of the symptoms of UAO. Clinical symptoms were assessed by a
   standardized questionnaire evaluating the severity of symptoms. All
   patients underwent otolaryngologic examination and their tonsil sizes
   were graded. 74 of 95 patients underwent digital lateral soft tissue
   radiographs. Assessment of nasopharyngeal obstruction in radiographs was
   done according to four different methods.
   Results: We did not find statistically siginificant correlation between
   symptom scores and radiologic measurements according to Johanneson (r =
   0.072, p = 0.544, p > 0.05) and Crepeau (r = 0.034, p = 0.773, p >
   0.05). The correlations between OSA score and Cohen and Konak's method
   and AN ratio were weak and not statistically siginificant (p = 0.133, r
   = 0.176; p = 0.290, r = 0.125 respectively; p > 0.05). But, we found a
   statistically siginificant correlation between the tonsil grade and
   symptom scores (r = 0.216, p = 0.036, p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our results have demonstrated that radiologic measurements
   of the nasopharyngeal obstruction do not correlate with clinical
   symptoms of UAO, but clinical assessment of tonsil size does. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Purpose: Conventional computer-assisted detection (CADe) systems in
   screening mammography provide the same decision support to all users.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a
   context-sensitive CADe system which provides decision support guided by
   each user's focus of attention during visual search and reporting
   patterns for a specific case.
   Methods: An observer study for the detection of malignant masses in
   screening mammograms was conducted in which six radiologists evaluated
   20 mammograms while wearing an eye-tracking device. Eye-position data
   and diagnostic decisions were collected for each radiologist and case
   they reviewed. These cases were subsequently analyzed with an in-house
   knowledge-based CADe system using two different modes: Conventional mode
   with a globally fixed decision threshold and context-sensitive mode with
   a location-variable decision threshold based on the radiologists' eye
   dwelling data and reporting information.
   Results: The CADe system operating in conventional mode had 85.7\%
   per-image malignant mass sensitivity at 3.15 false positives per image
   (FPsI). The same system operating in context-sensitive mode provided
   personalized decision support at 85.7\%-100\% sensitivity and 0.35-0.40
   FPsI to all six radiologists. Furthermore, context-sensitive CADe system
   could improve the radiologists' sensitivity and reduce their performance
   gap more effectively than conventional CADe.
   Conclusions: Context-sensitive CADe support shows promise in delineating
   and reducing the radiologists' perceptual and cognitive errors in the
   diagnostic interpretation of screening mammograms more effectively than
   conventional CADe. (C) 2010 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated gene (Arc, also known as
   Arg3.1) is an effector immediate-early gene rapidly induced by strong
   neural activity. Although a number of studies have revealed significant
   functions of Arc and Arc has come into widespread use as a neural
   activity marker in behavioral studies, the mechanisms regulating Arc
   transcription remain unclear. Here, we examined the conditions of Arc
   transcription in acute slices of dentate gyrus. Surprisingly, kainic
   acid (1 mu M to 10 mM) application to slices did not induce Arc
   transcription, although intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (20
   mg/kg) induced robust Arc transcription. No types of high-frequency
   stimulation examined induced Arc transcription in acute slices. These
   findings indicate that Arc transcription is dramatically suppressed in
   acute slices of the dentate gyrus, in which background neural activity
   is markedly reduced. Burst stimulation increased the number of
   Arc-expressing cells in the presence of picrotoxin, in which excitation
   was maintained even after the end of stimulation. Moreover, the
   involvement of background neural activity in Arc transcription was
   tested by application of carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist.
   Carbachol also increased the number of Arc-expressing cells, which was
   blocked by atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Taken together,
   these findings suggest that persistent background activity is critical
   for Arc transcription. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   controlled trial of RF compared with standard care. All participants
   received standard follow-up services, but participants in the RF group
   were also assigned a resource facilitator to assist them in returning to
   work. Results: Participation increased significantly for both groups (F

Journal = {{GEOTECTONICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{510-528}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical and applied implications of the study of active faults and
   their identification and parametrization are discussed. The term active
   fault is defined as a fault with displacements that occurred in the late
   Pleistocene and Holocene and are expected to resume in the future. The
   displaced young landforms, late Quaternary sediments, and man-made
   constructions are the main reference marks to recognize active faults
   and estimate their kinematics and intensity. Since the structural
   pattern and parameters of all active faults are referred to the same,
   geologically short time interval, they are important for the study of
   recent geodynamics and young tectogenesis on the global, regional, and
   local scales. The opportunities that are opened for such investigations
   are illustrated by verification of the real existence of the Okhotsk and
   Bering minor plates. With allowance for active faults, it is possible to
   make tectonic and geodynamic reconstructions of the past events more
   plausible. Natural hazards, primarily, earthquakes, are related to
   active faults. The geological and geomorphic assessment of the seismic
   potential of active fault zones is discussed with emphasis on the
   maximum possible magnitude of earthquakes (M (max)) estimated from the
   segmentation of the active zones, the length of particular segments (L),
   the empirical relationships M (max)/L for strong recent earthquakes, as
   well as the resumption periods of strong earthquakes and measurement of
   particular seismogenic offsets by trenching and other techniques,
   including archeoseismological methods. A question is posed about
   possible perennial variations in the stress-and-strain state of active
   zones, which are expressed on the scale of large seismoactive regions in
   oscillations of released seismic energy and should be taken into account
   by assessment of the seismic hazard.}},

Abstract = {{The ISO/IEEE 11073 (x73) family of standards is a reference frame for
   medical device interoperability. A draft for an ECG device
   specialization (ISO/IEEE 11073-10406-d02) has already been presented to
   the Personal Health Device (PHD) Working Group, and the Standard
   Communications Protocol for Computer-Assisted ElectroCardioGraphy
   (SCP-ECG) Standard for short-term diagnostic ECGs (EN1064: 2005+A1:2007)
   has recently been approved as part of the x73 family (ISO 1107391064:
   2009). These factors suggest the coordinated use of these two standards
   in foreseeable telecardiology environments, and hence the need to
   harmonize them. Such harmonization is the subject of this paper. Thus, a
   mapping of the mandatory attributes defined in the second draft of the
   ISO/IEEE 11073-10406-d02 and the minimum SCP-ECG fields is presented,
   and various other capabilities of the SCP-ECG Standard (such as the
   messaging part) are also analyzed from an x73-PHD point of view. As a
   result, this paper addresses and analyzes the implications of some
   inconsistencies in the coordinated use of these two standards. Finally,
   a proof-of-concept implementation of the draft x73-PHD ECG device
   specialization is presented, along with the conversion from x73-PHD to
   SCP-ECG. This paper, therefore, provides recommendations for future
   implementations of telecardiology systems that are compliant with both
   x73-PHD and SCP-ECG.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of alphamethrin (0.04 ppm, 0.08 ppm, 0.16 ppm, 0.32 ppm) on some
   metabolic dehydrogenases and proteins for 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 16 days
   using three ecologically different earthworm species
   (Perionyxsansibaricus, Lampito mauritii and Metaphire posthuma) were
   studied. The first significant effect was on 2nd/3rd day and maximum
   response was achieved on 16th day of exposure of alphamethrin at all
   concentrations. Similarly, maximum effect was obtained at 0.32 ppm
   alphamethrin at different exposure periods. It showed a dose- and
   duration-dependent inhibitory effects of a pyrethroid on enzymes and
   proteins of earthworms. There were approximately 47\%, 43\% and 41\%
   declines in specific activities of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase
   (cMDH) of P.sansibaricus, L mauritii and M. posthuma, respectively, in
   response to 0.32 ppm exposure of alphamethrin for 16 days. In case of
   similar treatment, specific activities of mitochondrial malate
   dehydrogenase (mMDH) showed 57\%, 51\% and 45\% reductions in epigeic
   (P. sansibaricus), anecic (L mauritii) and endogeic (M. posthuma)
   earthworms, respectively. Exposure of alphamethrin (0.32 ppm) also
   decreased the specific activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by 47\%
   (P. sansibaricus), 35\% (L mauritii) and 39\% (M. posthuma) in different
   types of earthworms. The reductions in specific activities of a Krebs
   cycle enzyme (mMDH) were greater than that of a glycolytic enzyme (LDH).
   The protein contents declined significantly in the earthworms exposed to
   alphamethrin. The decreases of 41\%, 36\% and 30\% were obtained in
   cytoplasmic proteins of P. sansibaricus, L mauritii and M. posthuma,
   respectively. However, the mitochondrial proteins showed reductions of
   45\% in P. sansibaricus, 46\% in L mauritii and 38\% in M. posthuma in
   response to alphamethrin (0.32 ppm) intoxication for 16 days. The
   decrease in the protein content reflected an inhibitory effect of
   alphamethrin on protein turnover. The most pronounced effect of
   alphamethrin was on metabolic enzymes and proteins of P. sansibaricus
   and least effect was found on M. posthuma. This clearly showed that
   surface dwelling species of earthworms (epigeic) are more vulnerable to
   toxic chemical than deep burrowing species (endogeic). Thus a possible
   ecophysiological link exists between the toxicological responses and
   ecological categories at metabolic level in tropical earthworms. (C)

Abstract = {{We have studied the modulation by 5-HT of the synaptic excitatory
   responses evoked by callosal fibers on cortical pyramidal neurons. We
   have used a mouse brain slice preparation that preserves the callosal
   fibers and allows their selective activation. EPSCs evoked by callosal
   stimulation (ccEPSCs) were recorded with patch electrodes from pyramidal
   neurons identified visually. We observed that 5-HT (10-40 mu M)
   inhibited the ccEPSCs peak amplitude in 64\% of the neurons; 5-HT had no
   effect in the remaining neurons. 5-HT also increased the frequency and
   amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs. This inhibition was accompanied with an
   increase in the coefficient of variation of the fluctuations of the
   ccEPSCs amplitude and with an increase in the ratio of the amplitudes of
   paired ccEPSCs. Agonists of 5-HT receptor subtypes 5-HT1A (8-OH-DPAT)
   and 5-HT2A (DOI) mimicked the effect of 5-HT; also, the effect of
   8-OH-DPAT and DOI was blocked in the presence of specific blockers of
   5-HT1A (WAY 100135) and 5-HT2A (MDL 11,939) receptors. Application of
   5-HT did not change the amplitude of currents evoked by direct
   application of glutamate to neurons in which 5-HT decreased the
   amplitude of ccEPSC. The effects of 5-HT on ccEPSCs and on the synaptic
   currents evoked by intracortical stimulation were not correlated; this
   suggests that the effect of 5-HT was specific to particular synaptic
   inputs to a neuron. These results demonstrate the presynaptic modulation
   of the callosal synaptic responses by 5-HT and the implication of 5-HT1A
   and 5-HT2A receptors in this effect.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a High Availability Open Shortest Path First
   (HA-OSPF) router which consists of two OSPF router modules, active and
   standby, to support a high availability network. First, we used the
   continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) to analyze the steady-state
   availability of an HA-OSPF router with one active router and N standby
   routers (1 + N redundancy model). Then, with the failure detection and
   recovery rate considered, from analytic results, we show that the
   HA-OSPF router with 1 + 1 redundancy model, one active and one standby,
   is the preferred model for enhancing router availability. We also show
   that the carrier-grade HA-OSPF router availability (i.e., five-nine
   availability) can be achieved under an appropriate combination of the
   router module failure rate (lambda), repair rate (mu), and the failure
   detection and recovery rate (delta). Since there is a lack of research
   on the integration of the redundancy model, link state information
   backup, and failure detection and recovery, we propose a high
   availability management middleware (HAM middleware) framework to
   integrate these three elements. The HAM middleware consists of
   Availability Management Framework (AMF) service, Checkpoint service, and
   Failure Manager. It supports health check, state information exchange,
   and failure detection and recovery. Each HA-OSPF router was designed to
   have a Linux operating system, HAM middleware, and OSPF process. We have
   implemented the HA-OSPF router on a PC-based system. Experimental
   results show that the failure detection and recovery times of the
   proposed PC-based HA-OSPF router were reduced by 98.76\% and 91.45\%
   compared to those of an industry standard approach, VRRP (Virtual Router
   Redundancy Prctocol), for a software failure and a hardware failure,
   respectively. In addition, we have also implemented the HA-OSPF router
   on an ATCA (Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture) platform, which can
   provide an industrial standardized modular architecture for an
   efficient, flexible, and reliable router design. Based on our ATCA-based
   platform with 1/delta = 217 ms for a software failure and 1/delta = 1066
   ms for a hardware failure, along with the router module data, 1/lambda =
   7 years and 1/mu = 4 hours, obtained from Cisco, the availabilities of
   the proposed ATCA-based HA-OSPF router are 99.99999905\% for a software
   failure and 99.99999867\% for a hardware failure. Therefore, the
   experimental results have shown that both our proposed ATC A-based and
   PC-based HA-OSPF routers with 1 + 1 redundancy model can easily meet the
   requirement of carrier-grade availabilities with five-nine.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the analysis and design of single-to-balanced combline

   create two transmission zeros that can be located independently in

   line coupling on the filter response is properly addressed, and an
   efficient way to compensate it is proposed. Also, the issue of a
   frequency-dependent J-inverter in bandpass filter design is also well
   treated. The proposed filter can be implemented using the
   low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) process to achieve very compact
   circuit size, in which the combline line lengths are as small as
   lambda/15. Specifically, two third-order single-to-balanced combline
   bandpass filters in LTCC are implemented. Good balance performance, low
   loss, good selectivity, and compact size are achieved.}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that play important roles in
   cellular processes and disease pathogenesis via the control of specific
   targeted gene expression. The miR-196s miRNA is encoded at three
   paralogous loci in three HOX clusters and acts as an oncogenic miRNA in
   cancer progression. Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression
   of miR-196b increases cell proliferation and survival in leukemic cells.
   Here, we used a sequential methylation analysis to reveal that the
   methylation status correlated well with miR-196b expression in different
   cell lines. Treatment with the demethylating drug 5-Aza-dC reactivated
   miR-196b transcription in methylation-silenced cells. Using in vitro
   methylation approach, we further provide evidences that promoter
   hypermethylation represses miR-196b transcriptional activation tightly
   in human cancer cell lines. We also demonstrate that the expression of
   miR-196b is significantly elevated in gastric cancer and that
   hypomethylation status of miR-196b CpG islands frequently is observed in
   primary gastric tumors. Our results provide important information on
   miR-196s regulation and demonstrate that abnormal DNA hypomethylation
   induces overexpression of miR-196b in gastric cancer. (C) 2010

   This study explores the association between different aspects of social
   capital and psychiatric morbidity in rural communities of the Greek
   North Aegean islands. A large number of individual and community
   characteristics that may influence psychiatric morbidity are
   concurrently examined in multilevel models to account for the clustering
   of individuals within rural settings. The current findings indicate that
   psychiatric morbidity is, to a large extent, clustered within rural
   communities. Individuals' perceived divisions in the community, i.e.,
   political party preference, landholdings, low social support networks,
   and lack of perceived solidarity, are associated with psychiatric
   morbidity according to theoretical expectation. At the community level,
   this risk is lower in villages with over 250 residents, where there are
   youth clubs or a common threat, for instance, properly crime. (C) 2010

   diabetes, 83\% with hypertension and 30\% smokers) followed for a period
   of 14 years. Left ventricular mass index was assessed at baseline,
   whereas kidney function and blood pressure levels were determined at
   both baseline and the end of the follow-up period. Renal outcomes were
   doubling of serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate
   (eGFR) below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and incident hemodialysis.
   Results During the follow-up, 5.8\% (n = 356), 7\% (n = 429) and 2.7\%
   (n = 165) of men fulfilled the above-mentioned three outcomes,
   respectively. After adjustment, for each 42 g/m(2) (1 SD) increase in
   left ventricular mass index, there was a rise in risk of all renal
   outcomes by 45.7\% (95\% confidence interval 28.5-58.3) for doubling of
   serum creatinine, 51.9\% (95\% confidence interval 39.7-65\%) for eGFR
   below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and 58.3\% (95\% confidence interval
   39.7-79.3) for hemodialysis (P < 0.001 for all). Severe LVH (160 < left
   ventricular mass index <= 180 g/m(2)) compared with non-LVH predicted a
   significant increase in: doubling of serum creatinine by 103.8\%,
   eGFR-guided outcome by 109.1\% and hemodialysis by 74.1\%. In those with
   LVH and impaired kidney function at baseline (GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73
   m(2)) compared with those without such entities, serum creatinine, eGFR
   and hemodialysis-guided outcomes were increased by four-fold, 15-fold
   and 16-fold, respectively.
   Conclusion Increased left ventricular mass is a predictor of subsequent
   kidney dysfunction and should be considered in renal risk stratification
   in a broad spectrum of men with high cardiovascular risk. J Hypertens

Abstract = {{Optimal acetabular cup position is an important determinant of the
   success of total hip arthroplasty (THA), and navigation systems have
   been developed and applied to improve placement precision. However, the
   registration method touching bony landmarks through soft tissues may
   decrease the accuracy in obese cases and in patients with acetabular
   dysplasia.
   Placement accuracy in 69 joints in which THA was performed with
   imageless navigation was calculated by comparing the placement angle in
   the anterior pelvic plane and the placement angle in the x-ray table
   plane with the patient in the supine position. We defined the difference
   between the placement angle in the anterior pelvic plane and the angle
   displayed on the navigation screen as the error and the difference
   between the placement angle in the plane of the x-ray table and the
   target angle of acetabular component position as the difference in
   target angle. Patients were divided into obese (BMI a parts per thousand
   yen 25) and nonobese (BMI < 25) groups and into acetabular dysplasia and
   nondysplasia groups.
   The mean +/- SD navigation errors for all cases were 2.4A degrees +/-
   2.0A degrees for inclination and 3.7A degrees +/- 2.3A degrees for
   anteversion. The mean difference in target angle for all cases was 2.8A
   degrees +/- 2.5A degrees for inclination and 4.2A degrees +/- 3.0A
   degrees for anteversion. The error in anteversion was significantly
   higher in the obese group (4.8A degrees +/- 2.5A degrees) than in the
   nonobese group (3.2A degrees +/- 2.6A degrees) (P = 0.01). No
   significant difference was observed between the acetabular dysplasia and
   nondysplasia groups.
   Imageless navigation can be performed with an error of approximately 3A
   degrees at the anterior pelvic plane. However, accuracy was found to
   decrease in obese cases.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an analysis of the effects introduced by finite-accuracy and
   round-off arithmetic on numerical computations of discrete dynamical
   systems. Our method, which uses the statistical tool of the decay of
   fidelity, computes the error by directly comparing the numerical orbit
   with the exact one (or, more precisely, with another numerical orbit
   computed with a much higher accuracy). Furthermore, as a model of the
   effects of round-off arithmetic on the map, we also consider a random
   perturbation of the exact orbit with an additive noise, for which exact
   results can be obtained for some prototype maps. We investigate the
   decay laws of fidelity and their relationship with the error probability
   distribution for regular and chaotic maps, for both additive and
   numerical noise. In particular, for regular maps we find an exponential
   decay for additive noise, and a power-law decay for numerical noise. For
   chaotic maps, numerical noise is equivalent to additive noise, and our
   method is suitable for identifying a threshold for the reliability of
   numerical results, i.e., the number of iterations below which global
   errors can be ignored. This threshold grows linearly with the number of
   bits used to represent real numbers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Isolation of a subclavian artery is an uncommon congenital anomaly of
   the aortic arch in which one subclavian artery loses its connection with
   the aorta and originates from the homolateral pulmonary artery by way of
   a ductus arteriosus. Isolation of the left subclavian artery in patients
   with a right aortic arch is well known. However, isolated right
   subclavian artery with a left-sided aortic arch is an extremely rare
   condition. In this report, we present multidetector computed tomographic
   (MDCT) angiography findings of an isolated right subclavian artery
   associated with a common carotid trunk and an anomalous origin and
   proximal interruption of the left pulmonary artery.}},

   hoarding at a community mental health center, 6 completed an average of
   35 sessions of therapy administered by a BA.-level therapist trained and
   supervised in CBT methods. Treatment consisted of weekly home visits
   that included motivational interviewing, organizing and decision-making
   skills, cognitive therapy regarding hoarding and related beliefs, and
   practice sorting, discarding, and not acquiring. Modest improvement was
   evident in ratings of clutter, risky situations in. the home, and
   functioning. Clients were generally satisfied with treatment. Challenges
   in treating hoarding in elderly clients include health and safety risks

Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique of modeling and minimization of speed
   ripples of a vector-controlled faulty induction motor (IM) with broken
   rotor bars. First, the performance of the faulty IM is investigated in
   terms of speed ripples under the open-loop condition. Then, a new IM
   model is developed, incorporating the speed ripples. Consequently, a new
   neuro-fuzzy controller (NFC) is proposed to tolerate the fault effect
   under an indirect field-oriented control scheme. The proposed NFC can
   compensate the motor rotation imperfections by minimizing the supply
   frequency-related speed ripples instead of directly working on the
   low-frequency speed ripples exhibited by a faulty IM. A novel
   self-tuning algorithm is proposed to adjust the weight of the developed
   NFC, and its training convergence is investigated by simulation. The
   effectiveness of the developed NFC is verified by both simulation and
   experimental tests.}},

Abstract = {{Methods. Serum samples were obtained from 146 SSc patients. Anti-CCP Ab,
   anti-agalactosyl (AG) IgG Ab, IgM-RF, IgG-RF and MMP-3 were determined,
   respectively.
   Results. The presence of anti-CCP Ab was found in 18/146 (12\%) patients
   with SSc. Elevated levels of anti-AG IgG Abs, IgM- and IgG-RFs were
   observed in 50/146 (34\%), 17/146 (12\%) and 4/146 (3\%), respectively.
   Serum anti-CCP Ab levels were significantly elevated in SSc-RA overlap
   patients compared with SSc patients with or without arthralgia (P < 0.05
   or P < 0.001, respectively). Serum MMP-3 levels did not correlate with
   the presence of arthritis or arthralgia but were significantly
   associated with modified Rodnan total skin thickness score. In SSc-RA
   overlap patients, 10/11 (91\%) patients were positive for two or more
   RA-related Abs.
   Conclusions. The serum titre of anti-CCP Ab is higher in SSc-RA overlap
   patients than in SSc patients with or without arthralgia. The finding of
   high titres of anti-CCP Abs and the elevated levels combinatory with
   other RA-related Abs may help to define the diagnosis of SSc-RA overlap.
   MMP-3 might be a better marker to assess skin involvement rather than
   joint involvement in SSc patients.}},

Abstract = {{Problem of relative pose estimation between a camera and rigid object
   given an object model with feature points and image(s) with respective
   image points (hence known correspondence) has been extensively studied
   in the literature We propose a correspondenceless method called
   gravitational pose estimation (GPE) which is inspired by classical
   mechanics GPE can handle occlusion and uses only one image (le
   perspective projection of the object) GPE creates a simulated
   gravitational field from the image and lets the object model move and
   rotate in that force field starting from an initial pose Experiments
   were carried out with both real and synthetic images Results show that
   GPE is robust consistent and fast (runs in less than a minute) On the
   average (including up to 30\% occlusion cases) it finds the orientation
   within 6 degrees and the position within 17\% of the object s diameter
   SoftPOSIT was so far the best correspondenceless method in the
   literature that works with a single image and point-based object model
   like GPE However SoftPOSIT s convergence to a result is sensitive to the
   choice of initial pose Even random start SoftPOSIT which performs
   multiple runs of SoftPOSIT with different initial poses can often fail
   However SoftPOSIT finds the pose with great precision when it is able to
   converge We have also integrated GPE and SoftPOSIT into a single method
   called GPEsoftPOSIT which finds the orientation within 3 degrees and the
   position within 10\% of the object s diameter even under occlusion In
   GPEsoftPOSIT GPE finds a pose that is very close to the true pose and
   then SoftPOSIT is used to enhance accuracy of the result Unlike
   SoftPOSIT GPE also has the ability to work with three points as well as
   planar object models (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Background: Depression has a significant prevalence in patients
   following a stroke. Studies have found rates to be between 25-54\%.
   Aims: Within this audit we aimed to ascertain the proportion of patients
   who have been identified as having depression, and explore the methods
   employed to identify depressed patients. We also looked to assess the
   number of these patients who have been treated for depression and to
   explore the medications used for the treatment of depression.
   Methods: This audit was conducted in two phases. Initially an audit was
   conducted to establish the current prevalence, screening and management
   of depression in post-stroke patients. Following this, we introduced the
   PHQ-9 as a screening tool for depression and a re-audited at four
   months. In phase 2, All patients admitted to the stoke ward in Bedford
   hospital between 10/9/09 and 13/12/09 were included in the audit.
   Patients were screened for depression using the PHQ-9 questionnaire two
   weeks after admission.
   Results: The incidence of depression within the phase one group was
   28\%. In 9 of these cases there was no record of mood assessment or
   diagnosis of depression in the medical notes. Thirteen out of 60
   patients were prescribed psychotropic agents during their stay. In phase
   2, Of the 18 patients screened, 10 patients (56\%) scored 5 or above,
   which according to the scoring system of the PHQ-9 is indicative of
   depression. One patient scored 10 indicative of moderate depression and
   one patient scored 19 indicative of moderately severe depression.
   Discussion: Phase I of this audit revealed that there was no formal
   screening tool in use to identify depression in post stroke patients.
   Consequently we found the prevalence to be 28\%. This correlates with
   the lower end of the rate expected within this group according to the
   literature. As no screening tool was being used, practice was not in
   accordance with the standards set by NICE guidelines. This led us to
   introduce the PHQ-9 screening tool in phase 2. Following this, we found
   the prevalence of depression had increased from 28\% to 56\%.
   Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of formal screening
   in order to reliably identify patients who have signs of depression.}},

Abstract = {{Finding similar substrings/substructures is a central task in analyzing
   huge string data such as genome sequences, Web documents, log data,
   feature vectors of pictures, photos, videos, etc. Although the existence
   of polynomial time algorithms for such problems is trivial since the
   number of substrings is bounded by the square of their lengths,
   straightforward algorithms do not work for huge databases because of
   their high degree order of the computation time. This paper addresses
   the problem of finding pairs of strings with small Hamming distances
   from huge databases composed of short strings of a fixed length.
   Comparison of long strings can be solved by inputting all their
   substrings of fixed length so that we can find candidates of similar
   non-short substrings. We focus on the practical efficiency of
   algorithms, and propose an algorithm that runs in time almost linear in
   the input/output size. We prove that the computation time of its variant
   is linear in the database size when the length of the short strings is
   constant, and computational experiments for genome sequences and Web
   texts show its practical efficiency. Slight modifications adapt to the
   edit distance and mismatch tolerance computation. An implementation is
   available at the author's homepage.}},

Abstract = {{Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells involved in antiviral
   defence and tumour surveillance. To fulfil these tasks, NK cells make
   use of two major effector functions, cytokine and chemokine release and
   cytotoxicity. In addition, NK cells proliferate in response to cytokines
   such as IL-2. NK cells possess a large array of activating and
   inhibitory receptors and their activation demands a complex crosstalk
   between those receptors. The signalling pathways leading to NK-cell
   activation are a field of intensive research. The first clue for signal
   specificity was provided by studies showing that a pathway leading to
   NF-kappa B activation selectively induces cytokine release, but is
   dispensable for cytotoxicity. Here, we demonstrate that in human NK
   cells caspase activity is required for the upregulation of select
   activation markers and IFN-gamma and TNF production, but not for
   cytotoxicity. Interestingly, caspases have previously been linked in T
   cells to the same mechanism of NF-kappa B induction that is active in NK
   cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that caspases are involved in
   IL-2-induced proliferation. Thus, our data provide the basis for a novel
   approach using caspase inhibitors to generate cytotoxic NK cells, while
   simultaneously suppressing cytokine release.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increasing interest in the discursive aspects of strategy, few
   studies have examined strategy texts and their power effects. We draw
   from Critical Discourse Analysis to better understand the power of
   strategic plans as a directive genre. In our empirical analysis, we
   examined the creation of the official strategic plan of the City of
   Lahti in Finland. As a result of our inductive analysis, we identified
   five central discursive features of this plan: self-authorization,
   special terminology, discursive innovation, forced consensus and
   deonticity. We argue that these features can, with due caution, be
   generalized and conceived as distinctive features of the strategy genre.
   We maintain that these discursive features are not trivial
   characteristics; they have important implications for the textual agency
   of strategic plans, their performative effects, impact on power

Abstract = {{Conventional bumping processes used in the fabrication of hybrid pixel
   detectors for High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments use electroplating
   for Under Bump Metallization (UBM) and solder bump deposition. This
   process is laborious, involves time consuming photolithography and can
   only be performed using whole wafers. Electroplating has been found to
   be expensive when used for the low volumes which are typical of HEP
   experiments. In the low-cost bump bonding development work, electroless
   deposition technology of UBM is studied as an alternative to the
   electroplating process in the bump size / pitch window beginning from 20
   pm / 50 p m. Electroless UBM deposition used in combination with solder
   transfer techniques has the potential to significantly lower the cost of
   wafer bumping without requiring increased wafer volumes.
   A test vehicle design of sensor and readout chip, having daisy chains
   and Kelvin bump structures, was created to characterize the flip chip
   process with electroless UBM. Two batches of test vehicle wafers were
   manufactured with different bump pad metallization. Batch \#1 had
   AlSi(1\%) metallization, which is similar to the one used on sensor
   wafers, and Batch \#2 had AlSi(2\%)Cu(1\%) metallization, which is very
   similar to the one used on readout wafers. Electroless UBMs were
   deposited on both wafer batches. In addition, electroplated Ni UBM and
   SnPb solder bumps were grown on the test sensor wafers. Test assemblies
   were made by flip chip bonding the solder-bumped test sensors against
   the test readout chips with electroless UBMs. Electrical yields and
   individual joint resistances were measured from assemblies, and the
   results were compared to a well known reference technique based on
   electroplated solder bumps structures on both chips. The electroless
   UBMs deposited on AlSi(2\%)Cu(1\%) metallization showed excellent
   electrical yields and small tolerances in individual joint resistance.
   The results from the UBMs deposited on A1Si(1\%) metallization were
   non-uniform and closer inspection revealed micro cracks at aluminum
   electroless nickel interface. UBM deposition was also done for Timepix
   wafers and solder ball placement process was prototyped with 40 mu m
   balls.}},

Abstract = {{Although the transparency of a writing system is hypothesized to
   systematically influence the cognitive skills associated with reading
   development results of cross language investigations are inconsistent
   and usually do not address this issue in a developmental context We
   therefore investigated the cognitive dynamics of reading fluency of
   different word types in Grades 1-4 in three orthographies differing in
   degree of transparency (Hungarian Dutch and Portuguese) The overall
   results showed that the relative strength of the contributions of
   phonological awareness and rapid naming to word reading fluency shifted
   as a function of reading expertise The contribution of phonological
   awareness remained significant in all grades but decreased as a function
   of grade whereas the contribution of rapid naming increased Orthographic
   depth systematically modulated the strength of the cognitive
   contributions to reading but not the overall developmental pattern
   Together these results indicate that the cognitive development of
   reading skill is fairly universal (at least for alphabetic scripts) and
   that differences in orthographic depth will not recruit different
   cognitive processes but will mainly be expressed in rate of reading
   development}},

Abstract = {{More than 20 years of serological approach to diagnosis of celiac

   children with CD followed in our institution between 1991 and 2007,
   considering weight, height and body mass index (BMI), both at diagnosis
   and after at least 12 months of gluten-free diet (GFD). In all, 11\% of
   patients had BMI z-score >+1 and 3\% were obese (z-score >+2) at
   presentation. In our population, there was a significant (P = 0.008)
   increase in BMI z-score after GFD and the percentage of overweight
   (z-score >+1) subjects almost doubled (11 vs 21\%, P=0.03). Our data
   suggest the need for a careful follow-up of nutritional status after

Abstract = {{Novel acetone and aldimine covalent adducts were identified on the
   N-termini and lysine side chains of recombinant monoclonal antibodies.
   Photochemical degradation of citrate buffers, in the presence of trace
   levels of iron, is demonstrated as the source of these modifications.
   The link between degradation of citrate and the observed protein
   modifications was conclusively established by tracking the citrate
   decomposition products and protein adducts resulting from photochemical
   degradation of isotope labeled C-13 citrate by mass spectrometry. The
   structure of the acetone modification was determined by nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on modified-free glycine and found to
   correspond to acetone linked to the N-terminus of the amino acid through
   a methyl carbon. Results from mass spectrometric fragmentation of
   glycine modified with an acetone adduct derived from C-13 labeled
   citrate indicated that the three central carbons of citrate are
   incorporated onto protein amines in the presence of iron and light.
   While citrate is known to stoichiometrically decompose to acetone and
   CO2 through various intermediates in photochemical systems, it has never
   been shown to be a causative agent in protein carbonylation. Our results
   point to a previously unknown source for the generation of reactive
   carbonyl species. This work also highlights the potential deleterious
   impact of trace metals on recombinant protein therapeutics formulated in
   citrate buffers.}},

Abstract = {{The historical record of snow duration (from 1950 to 2009) and of
   snowfall (from 1960 to 2009) collected in the Italian Alps are presented
   and analysed. A reduction of the snow cover duration and of the snowfall
   stronger in springtime was detected during the last 40 years with the
   greatest decreasing rate during the 1990s. The last decade is
   characterised by a recovery from the documented decreasing trend mainly
   evident between 800 m and 1500 m. Principal component trend analysis of
   the snow duration and of the snowfall showed a long term decreasing
   trend. The change point test showed the existence of breakpoints between
   1984 and 1994 that characterise the snow duration and snowfall time
   series analysed by elevation range and by seasons. These breakpoints
   mark a drastic trend variability in the time series: a positive trend
   characterises the time series before the breakpoint and a decreasing
   trend characterises the historical record after the breakpoint. The
   described negative trends result from the documented decrease in winter
   and spring precipitation. This in turn may either relate to a change in
   fraction of liquid to solid precipitation, and/or be associated to an
   increase of the temperatures. Northern Hemisphere and Italian Alps snow
   cover trends strongly correlate in the frequency domain. Among the
   dominant frequencies the 11.2 period was detected that may relate to the
   11-year solar activity cycle. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Individual patients' predictors of survival may change across time,
   because people may change their lifestyles. Standard statistical methods
   do not allow adjustments for time-dependent predictors. In the past
   decade, time-dependent factor analysis has been introduced as a novel
   approach adequate for the purpose. Using examples from survival studies,
   we assess the performance of the novel method. SPSS statistical software
   is used (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Cox regression is a major
   simplification of real life; it assumes that the ratio of the risks of
   dying in parallel groups is constant over time. It is, therefore,
   inadequate to analyze, for example, the effect of elevated low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol on survival, because the relative hazard of
   dying is different in the first, second, and third decades. The
   time-dependent Cox regression model allowing for nonproportional hazards
   is applied and provides a better precision than the usual Cox regression
   (P = 0.117 versus 0.0001). Elevated blood pressure produces the highest
   risk at the time it is highest. An overall analysis of the effect of
   blood pressure on survival is not significant, but after adjustment for
   the periods with highest blood pressures using the segmented
   time-dependent Cox regression method, blood pressure is a significant
   predictor of survival (P = 0.04). In a long-term therapeutic study,
   treatment modality is a significant predictor of survival, but after the
   inclusion of the time-dependent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   variable, the precision of the estimate improves from a P value of 0.02
   to 0.0001. Predictors of survival may change across time, e. g., the
   effect of smoking, cholesterol, and increased blood pressure in
   cardiovascular research and patients' frailty in oncology research.
   Analytical models for survival analysis adjusting such changes are
   welcome. The time-dependent and segmented time-dependent predictors are
   adequate for the purpose. The usual multiple Cox regression model can
   include both time-dependent and time-independent predictors.}},

Title = {{Sequence Motifs in MADS Transcription Factors Responsible for
   Specificity and Diversification of Protein-Protein Interaction}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Protein sequences encompass tertiary structures and contain information
   about specific molecular interactions, which in turn determine
   biological functions of proteins. Knowledge about how protein sequences
   define interaction specificity is largely missing, in particular for
   paralogous protein families with high sequence similarity, such as the
   plant MADS domain transcription factor family. In comparison to the
   situation in mammalian species, this important family of transcription
   regulators has expanded enormously in plant species and contains over
   100 members in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we
   provide insight into the mechanisms that determine protein-protein
   interaction specificity for the Arabidopsis MADS domain transcription
   factor family, using an integrated computational and experimental
   approach. Plant MADS proteins have highly similar amino acid sequences,
   but their dimerization patterns vary substantially. Our computational
   analysis uncovered small sequence regions that explain observed
   differences in dimerization patterns with reasonable accuracy.
   Furthermore, we show the usefulness of the method for prediction of MADS
   domain transcription factor interaction networks in other plant species.
   Introduction of mutations in the predicted interaction motifs
   demonstrated that single amino acid mutations can have a large effect
   and lead to loss or gain of specific interactions. In addition, various
   performed bioinformatics analyses shed light on the way evolution has
   shaped MADS domain transcription factor interaction specificity.
   Identified protein-protein interaction motifs appeared to be strongly
   conserved among orthologs, indicating their evolutionary importance. We
   also provide evidence that mutations in these motifs can be a source for
   sub- or neo-functionalization. The analyses presented here take us a
   step forward in understanding protein-protein interactions and the
   interplay between protein sequences and network evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The functional programming languages Clean and Haskell have been around
   for over two decades. Over time, both languages have developed a large
   body of useful libraries and come with interesting language features. It
   is our primary goal to benefit from each other's evolutionary results by
   facilitating the exchange of sources between Clean and Haskell and study
   the forthcoming interactions between their distinct languages features.
   This is achieved by using the existing Clean compiler as starting point,
   and implementing a double-edged front end for this compiler: it supports
   both standard Clean 2.1 and (currently a large part of) standard Haskell
   98. Moreover, it allows both languages to seamlessly use many of each
   other's language features that were alien to each other before. For
   instance, Haskell can now use uniqueness typing anywhere, and Clean can
   use newtypes efficiently. This has given birth to two new dialects of
   Clean and Haskell, dubbed Clean{*} and Haskell{*}. Additionally,
   measurements of the performance of the new compiler indicate that it is
   on par with the flagship Haskell compiler GHC.}},

Title = {{Subsurface iron and arsenic removal for shallow tube well drinking water
   supply in rural Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Subsurface iron and arsenic removal has the potential to be a
   cost-effective technology to provide safe drinking water in rural
   decentralized applications, using existing shallow tube wells. A
   community-scale test facility in Bangladesh was constructed for
   injection of aerated water (similar to 1 m(3)) into an anoxic aquifer
   with elevated iron (0.27 mmol L-1) and arsenic (0.27 mu mol L-1)
   concentrations. The injection (oxidation) and abstraction (adsorption)
   cycles were monitored at the test facility and simultaneously simulated
   in the laboratory with anoxic column experiments.
   Dimensionless retardation factors (R) were determined to represent the
   delayed arrival of iron or arsenic in the well compared to the original
   groundwater. At the test facility the iron removal efficacies increased
   after every injection-abstraction cycle, with retardation factors (R-Fe)
   up to 17. These high removal efficacies could not be explained by the
   theory of adsorptive-catalytic oxidation, and therefore other ((a)biotic
   or transport) processes have contributed to the system's efficacy. This
   finding was confirmed in the anoxic column experiments, since the
   mechanism of adsorptive-catalytic oxidation dominated in the columns and
   iron removal efficacies did not increase with every cycle (stable at
   R-Fe = similar to 8). RA, did not increase after multiple cycles, it
   remained stable around 2, illustrating that the process which is
   responsible for the effective iron removal did not promote the
   co-removal of arsenic. The columns showed that subsurface arsenic
   removal was an adsorptive process and only the freshly oxidized adsorbed
   iron was available for the co-adsorption of arsenic. This indicates that
   arsenic adsorption during subsurface treatment is controlled by the
   amount of adsorbed iron that is oxidized, and not by the amount of
   removed iron. For operational purposes this is an important finding,
   since apparently the oxygen concentration of the injection water does
   not control the subsurface arsenic removal, but rather the injection
   volume. Additionally, no relation has been observed in this study
   between the amount of removed arsenic at different molar Fe:As ratios
   (28, 63, and 103) of the groundwater. It is proposed that the removal of
   arsenic was limited by the presence of other anions, such as phosphate,
   competing for the same adsorption sites. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Objective: In vitro and in vivo studies in animal models have shown that
   parathyroid hormone (PTH) inhibits the expression of the SOST gene,
   which encodes sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived negative regulator of
   bone formation. We tested the hypothesis that chronic PTH excess
   decreases circulating sclerostin in humans.
   Design: We studied 25 patients with elevated serum PTH concentrations
   due to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and 49 patients cured from
   PHPT after successful parathyroidectomy (PTx; euparathyroid controls
   (EuPTH)).
   Methods: We measured plasma PTH and serum sclerostin levels and the
   serum markers of bone turnover alkaline phosphatase, P1NP, and beta-CTX.
   Results: As expected by the design of the study, mean plasma PTH was
   significantly higher(P<0.001) in PHPT patients (15.3 pmol/l; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 11.1-19.5) compared with that of EuPTH
   controls (4.1 pmol/l; 95\% CI: 3.6-4.5). PHPT patients had significantly
   lower serum sclerostin values compared with those in EuPTH subjects
   (30.5 pg/ml; 95\% CI: 26.0-35.1 vs 45.4 pg/ml; 95\% CI: 40.5-50.2;
   P<0.001) and healthy controls (40.0 pg/ml; 95\% CI: 37.1-42.9; P=0.01).
   Plasma PTH concentrations were negatively correlated with serum
   sclerostin values (r=-0.44; P<0.001). Bone turnover markers were
   significantly correlated with PTH, but not with sclerostin.
   Conclusion: Patients with PHPT have significantly lower serum sclerostin
   values compared with PTx controls with normal PTH concentrations. The
   negative correlation between PTH and sclerostin suggests that SOST is
   downregulated by PTH in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Falls in older people are a common presenting complaint.
   Knowledge of modifiable risk factors may lead to a more tailored
   approach to prevent recurrent falls and/or fractures. We investigated
   prevalence of 8 modifiable risk factors for recurrent falling and/or a
   serious consequence of the fall among older patients visiting the
   emergency department after a fall with the Combined Amsterdam and
   Rotterdam Evaluation of Falls Triage Instrument (CTI), a
   self-administrated questionnaire that consists of questions concerning
   demographics, possible cause(s) of the fall, and questions relating to
   (modifiable) risk factors for falling.
   Methods: After treatment for their injuries, 1077 consecutive patients
   65 years or older visiting the accident and emergency department due to
   a fall were evaluated by the CTI. The following were assessed: impaired
   vision, mobility disorder, fear of falling, mood disorder, high risk of
   osteoporosis, orthostatic hypotension, incontinence, and polypharmacy.
   Results: The percentage of respondents who returned the questionnaire
   was 59.3\%. The mean (SD) age was 78.5 (7.5) years, and 57.8\%
   experienced a fall with serious consequences. There were 60.9\% of
   patients with a recurrent fall versus 51\% with a first fall who
   experienced with a serious consequence (P = .025). Age and risk factors
   mobility disorder (odds ratio {[}OR], 1.9; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}Cl], 1.1-3.3), high risk of osteoporosis (OR, 2.0; 95\% Cl, 1.2-3.2),
   incontinence (OR, 1.7; 95\% Cl, 1.0-2.7), fear of falling (OR, 2.2; 95\%
   Cl, 1.3-3.7), and orthostatic hypotension (OR, 2.4; 95\% Cl, 1.4-4.2)
   were independently associated with a recurrent fall. Age and high risk
   of osteoporosis were the only risk factors predicting a serious
   consequence of a fall (OR, 4.6; 95\% Cl, 2.9-7.2).
   Conclusions: Age and 5 modifiable risk factors assessed with the CTI
   were independently associated with a recurrent fall. Only high risk of
   osteoporosis was associated with a serious consequence. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A sensitive hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-tandem
   mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the analysis of
   13 pharmaceuticals (omeprazole, pantoprazole, ranitidine, citalopram,
   fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, tramadol, nebivolol, metoprolol,
   atenolol, bisoprolol and metformin) in influent wastewater. The analytes
   were selected from the list of top-sold prescription pharmaceuticals in
   Belgium. The HILIC separation was optimised to achieve quantification of
   all analytes in real influent wastewater samples where other compounds,
   mainly metabolites of some of the pharmaceuticals, were found to
   interfere even with mass-spectrometric detection in multiple reaction
   monitoring (MRM) mode. Sample cleanup and preconcentration was based on
   solid-phase extraction, and Oasis HLB cartridges were chosen after
   optimization. The method was validated by assessing the following
   parameters: specificity, selectivity, lower limit of quantification
   (LLOQ), linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery and matrix effects. For
   each analyte, LLOQs were sufficiently low to provide a good analytical
   performance at concentrations expected in real influent samples. Typical
   LLOQs were 1 ng/L, except for metformin (500 ng/L). Six deuterated
   analogues were used as internal standards. A total of 22 influent
   wastewater samples collected from 18 different wastewater treatment
   plants in Belgium were analysed. Most analytes were present in the
   samples at concentrations above the LLOQ and were in agreement with
   other results from the literature. Nebivolol was for the first time
   found in influent wastewater. In the future, this analytical method will
   be used to determine if there is a relationship between pharmaceutical
   sales figures and concentrations of these compounds in influent
   wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the 115 and H7
   subtypes primarily infect poultry but are occasionally transmitted to
   humans and other mammalian species, often causing severe disease.
   Previously we have shown that HPAIV H5N1 causes severe systemic disease
   in cats. In this study, we investigated whether HPAIV H7N7 isolated from
   a fatal human case is also able to cause disease in cats. Additionally,
   we compared the cell tropism of both viruses by immunohistochemistry and
   virus histochemistry. Three domestic cats were inoculated
   intratracheally with HPAIV H7N7. Virus excretion was restricted to the
   pharynx. At necropsy, 7 days post inoculation, lesions were restricted
   to the respiratory tract in all cats. Lesions consisted of diffuse
   alveolar damage and colocalized with virus antigen expression in type II
   pneumocytes and nonciliated bronchiolar cells. The attachment patterns
   of HPAIV H7N7 and H5N1 were similar: both viruses attached to
   nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells, type H pneumocytes, as well as
   alveolar macrophages. These data show for the first time that a non-H5
   HPAIV is able to infect and cause respiratory disease in cats. The
   failure of HPAIV H7N7 to spread beyond the respiratory tract was not
   explained by differences in cell tropism compared to HPAIV H5N1. These
   findings suggest that HPAIV H5N1 possesses other characteristics that
   allow it to cause systemic disease in both humans and cats. (Am J Pathol

Abstract = {{Background. Guidelines have set goals for risk factor management in
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. These goals are often not met. In
   this analysis, we set out to assess the quality of risk factor
   management in CKD and to identify factors that determine the quality of
   care (QoC). For that purpose, baseline data of the MASTERPLAN
   (Multifactorial Approach and Superior Treatment Efficacy in Renal
   Patients with the Aid of Nurse practitioners) study have been used.
   MASTERPLAN is a multicentre study which evaluates the effect of a
   multifactorial intervention in prevalent CKD patients on cardiovascular
   (CV) events and progression of kidney failure.
   Methods. QoC was quantified using a score based on the number of 11
   defined treatment goals on target. The maximum score per patient was 11.
   Results. The average (+/- SD) QoC score was 6.7 (+/- 1.5). The average
   score per centre ranged from 5.9 to 6.9. In a multivariable analysis,
   centre proved to be a significant, independent determinant of QoC with a
   difference up to 0.7 between centres. This difference remained when
   adjustments were made for those risk factors primarily treated by
   pharmacotherapy. Other factors that were significantly related to the
   QoC were estimated glomerular filtration rate, Caucasian race, diabetes
   mellitus, diabetic nephropathy as cause of kidney disease and previous
   kidney transplantation.
   Conclusions. In CKD patients, risk factors for progression of kidney
   failure and CV events were inadequately controlled. Treatment centre
   proved to be an important determinant of QoC. This data may point
   towards the physician's interest and preference as important
   determinants of QoC. This is a potentially modifiable determinant of the
   quality of patient care {[}Trial registration ISRCTN registry: 73187232

   higher MZ than DZ wave shape correlations (.71 vs. .44 and .52 vs. .35

Abstract = {{Brain energy disorders can be present in aged men and animals. To this
   respect, the mitochondrial and free radical theory of aging postulates
   that age-associated brain energy disorders are caused by an imbalance
   between pro- and anti-oxidants that can result in oxidative stress. Our
   study was designed to investigate brain energy metabolism and the
   activity of endogenous antioxidants during their lifespan in male Wistar
   rats. In vivo brain bioenergetics were measured using P-31 nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and in vitro by polarographic
   analysis of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. When compared to
   the young controls, a significant decrease of age-dependent
   mitochondrial respiration and adenosine-3-phosphate (ATP) production
   measured in vitro correlated with significant reduction of forward
   creatine kinase reaction (kfor) and with an increase in phosphocreatine
   (PCr)/ATP, PCr/Pi and PME/ATP ratio measured in vivo. The levels of
   enzymatic antioxidants catalase, GPx and GST significantly decreased in
   the brain tissue as well as in the peripheral blood of aged rats. We
   suppose that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative inactivation of
   endogenous enzymes may participate in age-related disorders of brain

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the incidence, prevalence, and outcome of
   amyloidosis associated with inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
   Methods: An observational study was performed in the outpatient
   department of Kainuu Central Hospital from 1993 to 2007. The following
   criteria were used for the performance of abdominal subcutaneous fat
   aspiration (ASFA) and/or rectal biopsies: erythrocyte sedimentation rate
   (ESR) > 40 mm/h at two consecutive visits; and proteinuria (> 0.5 g/day)
   or serum creatinine > 150 mu mol/L. Renal biopsy was performed when
   there was a high suspicion of amyloidosis in cases with negative
   findings in the above-mentioned biopsies. In addition, amyloid staining
   was used routinely for mucosal specimens taken in gastroscopy and
   colonoscopy. The patients were followed until death or to the end of
   2007.
   Results: New diagnoses of amyloidosis in the consecutive 5-year periods
   from 1993 onwards numbered 11, 3, and 5, respectively. During the study
   period, there was a mean annual incidence of amyloidosis of 1.8 {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.8)/100 000]. At the end of 2007 there
   were eight subjects with amyloidosis, giving a point prevalence of
   12.0/100 000 (95\% CI 5.2-23.6). Five patients out of the 19 underwent
   haemodialysis because of terminal uraemia and three of them also had
   renal transplantation. Overall, 12 (63\%) patients died after a median
   survival time of 6 (95\% CI 4-8) years, one-third from amyloidosis. The
   5-year survival rate of the series was 67\% (95\% CI 41-86).
   Conclusion: Amyloidosis is rarely encountered today. ASFA or rectal
   biopsy facilitates its early diagnosis.}},

   that, when adolescents ended up in a mode of education that was
   congruent with their skills, their intrinsic reasons for goal strivings
   and goal progress increased. Moreover, progress towards goal attainment
   contributed to self-esteem, and self-esteem also predicted goal

Abstract = {{Today many companies in many industries put a lot of efforts into
   monitoring and investigating emerging drivers of change in their
   business environment, particularly in relation to new technologies and
   events in the social, economic, political and ecological landscapes
   which surround their industry. So far scholars in the literature on
   foresight and future studies focused on the techniques and practices for
   analysing the ``state{''} uncertainty about the likely path of evolution
   of emerging drivers of change. Anyway, less attention was devoted to the
   ``effect{''} uncertainty about the impact of drivers of change on the
   competitive position of the firm and to the ``response{''} uncertainty
   about how to take advantage of these drivers. These are the main issues
   we take into account, through a field research on firms that,
   notwithstanding they were able to properly assess the likely evolution
   (state uncertainty) of relevant drivers of change in their industry,
   either were successful or dramatically failed in handling the effect and
   response uncertainty of these drivers. Moreover, we carried out multiple
   case studies of some large companies that have established an
   organizational unit dedicated to strategic foresight. Overall, the
   results of our research may contribute to improve the effectiveness of
   strategic foresight and to increase its value added to the planning
   process of corporate firms, while providing helpful insight to public
   organizations that promote foresight exercises for enhancing the
   competitiveness of local firms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Methionine is the first-limiting amino acid in corn and soybean
   meal-based poultry diets. Therefore, its supplementation level is of
   primary economic importance to poultry production. The responses to the
   methionine sources DL-methionine (DLM) and methionine-hydroxy
   analog-free acid (HMTBA) have been compared using various methodologies.
   The so-called common plateau nonlinear model has been used to estimate
   relative bioavailabilities of the sources. This model has a coefficient
   that is used as a single value to compare the relative bioavailabilities
   of the sources for independent technical parameters like gain and feed
   efficiency. This model was used previously in a meta-analysis of
   published experiments, and 79 and 81\% relative biological efficiencies
   of HMTBA were found for DLM for ADG and feed utilization efficiency,
   respectively. Because different sources would have different optimal
   feeding levels to maximize profits, we demonstrate the challenge of
   calculating a single optimal level for the different methionine sources.
   Further, we apply an economic analysis to results of the previous
   meta-analysis to demonstrate that the relative values of HMTBA and DLM
   for BW and ADG are between 81 and 86\%, depending on the value of a
   broiler and the costs of feed and DLM.}},

Abstract = {{The causes of the current distribution of a warm temperate tree Myrsine
   seguinii population were studied from topographic, geographical, and
   historical perspectives, and future land management to conserve this
   species. The study site is the Tokyo University forest located in Chiba
   Prefecture, at the northern distribution limit of this species. Presence
   and absence of individuals was surveyed in 10 x 10 m plots along the
   census line, making a total of 9,697 plots. The current distribution was
   modeled by multivariate logistic regression using environmental
   variables determined based on 10-m mesh digital elevation model
   (elevation, slope, solar radiation, topographic wetness index, surface
   curvature), 1-km mesh climatic information, and current (2005) and
   historic (1900) land-use maps. It was clarified that the current
   distribution area coincides with a Pinus densiflora forest present by
   the end of the 19th-century Meiji era, where 88.6\% of individuals of M.
   seguinii were found. Inland suitable areas show small patches
   distributed among the ridges and mountainsides facing south, decreasing
   as the average monthly minimum winter temperature decreases. Simulated
   scenarios showed that in the future the potential distribution area of
   the studied species would decrease in the case of a complete coverage of
   Cryptomeria or Chamaecyparis plantation, and the case of evergreen
   broadleaf forest coverage would be better than these plantations. The
   strong effect of past land use suggests vulnerability and difficulty in
   the rapid recovery of M. seguinii population from human disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The operation of a ferroelectric plasma source-assisted hollow anode
   (HA) electron source in a vacuum diode powered by an similar to 200 kV
   and similar to 400 ns pulsed generator was studied using time-and
   space-resolved laser induced fluorescence diagnostics. It was found that
   the plasma ion ``temperature{''} in the vicinity of the HA output grid
   increases up to similar to 15 eV during the accelerating pulse, which is
   consistent with a model of the potential screening of the grid by the
   randomly moving ions {[}Phys. Plasmas 13, 073506 (2006)]. Also it was
   shown that the increase in the HA plasma potential up to several
   kilovolts because of the appearance of a noncompensated ion charge in
   the HA bulk plasma due to electrons fast extraction, leads to explosive
   emission centers being generated at the HA grid and to nonuniformity in
   the cross-sectional electron beam current density. Finally, the plasma
   prefilled mode of diode operation was studied using a simple
   one-dimensional model of the plasma erosion and the HA plasma electron
   heating by energetic ions was considered. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{A number of experiments have demonstrated that the classical

   case, perturbations in the laminar region take the form of
   three-dimensional stream wise-elongated structures, the Klebanoff modes,
   also called streaks, which may be strongly amplified, resulting in an
   early bypass transition. This amplification is described by the
   transient-growth theory. In the present paper, a semi-empirical model
   has been developed for the prediction of this type of bypass transition.
   It is based on the resolution of two parabolic linear transport
   equations for the longitudinal velocity and the temperature
   fluctuations. A transition criterion is then formed based on the ratio
   of streak production and dissipation. Several sets of experimental data
   were used for validation of the proposal model, assessing the effects of
   pressure gradients and of freestream turbulence properties.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the bond
   of veneering porcelain to a ceramic core in bilayered ceramics was
   similar to that of the metal ceramic control of well known behaviour.
   Study design: Six groups of nine specimens each were fabricated, whose
   dimensions were 15 mm long and 8 mm in diameter at the core, and 2 mm
   long and 8 mm in diameter for the veneer. The groups were GR. 1 (control
   group): CrNi alloy/d.SIGN (Ivoclar), GR. 2: IPS e.maxPress/IPS
   e.maxCeram (Ivoclar), GR. 3: IPS e.maxZirCad/IPS e.maxZirPress
   (Ivoclar), GR. 4: IPS e.maxZirCad/IPS e.maxCeram (Ivoclar), GR. 5: Lava
   Frame (3M ESPE)/Lava Ceram (3M ESPE) and GR. 6: Lava Frame (3M ESPE)/IPS
   e.maxCeram (Ivoclar).
   A shear strength test was used in all samples with a universal testing
   machine. The chosen crosshead speed was of 0.50 mm/min. The obtained
   results were analyzed using a one way analysis of variance test (ANOVA)
   to determine whether significant differences existed between the groups
   (p<0.05). A Student Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test was used.
   Results: GR. 1: 13.45 MPa, GR. 2: 24.20 MPa, GR. 3: 12.70 MPa, GR. 4:
   7.86 MPa, GR. 5: 10.20 Mpa and GR. 6: 4.62 Mpa.
   Conclusions: The bond strength of group 1 (control) was similar to
   groups 3 and 5. Group 2, whose core and veneer are both porcelains with
   a similar chemical composition, with silica as their main component,
   achieved the best adhesive results between both porcelains. The
   technique on zirconia cores that showed the higher results was the
   pressed technique. The lowest results were for the group using
   porcelains from different manufacturers.}},

Abstract = {{Otitis externa in cats is relatively uncommon. This report describes a
   case of a rare, visually distinctive, proliferative and necrotising
   otitis in a three-month-old Persian kitten. The cat had proliferative,
   erythematous and necrotic tissue covering most of the proximal pinnae
   and vertical ear canals. On histopathological examination, the most
   striking feature was the existence of scattered apoptotic-appearing
   keratinocytes within severely hyperplastic epithelium. For the first
   time, immunohistochemistry was used to show a closed association between
   CD3+ T cells and caspase-3 stained keratinocytes, consistent with a
   keratinocyte apoptosis by epidermal-infiltrating T cells. Treatment was
   initiated using topical tacrolimus twice daily and an ear cleanser once
   daily. A marked improvement was observed after 10 days of treatment and
   the lesions completely resolved over a period of three weeks. The origin
   of T cells directed against keratinocytes is currently unknown.}},

Abstract = {{To clarify the effects of lead on fetal premature rupture of the
   membranes (PROM), blood lead concentrations were measured using
   inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in 332 women, aged 16-35
   years, during their early pregnancy period (8-12 weeks). Blood lead
   concentrations were significantly higher in the 36 PROM deliveries than
   in the 296 non-PROM deliveries (mean +/- SD, 4.61 +/- 2.37 and 3.69 +/-
   1.85 mu g/dl, respectively; p < 0.05). The logistic regression analysis
   revealed that a 1-unit increase in the logarithm of the blood lead level
   led to a several-fold increase in the risk of PROM (unit risk = 17.98,
   95\% CI 1.6-198.6). Thus, it is suggested that lead can increase the
   risk of PROM in pregnant women with mean blood lead less than 5 mu g/dl.

Abstract = {{Background: Lymphangioma circumscriptum, a rare, benign disease that can
   be either congenital or acquired, involves the deep dermis and
   subcutaneous lymphatics. Objective: This study aims to analyse the
   efficacy of surgical resection of vulva lymphangioma circumscriptum
   (VLC). Materials and
   Methods: Between January 2000 and December 2008, eight consecutive women
   referred to our centre and treated surgically for VLC were included in
   the study. VLC was responsible for recurrent lymph oozing in seven
   cases. All women were treated by the same plastic surgeon specialising
   in lymphatic diseases.
   Results: The first surgery was performed after a median interval of 5.4
   years since VLC onset. The first cutaneous resection included the labia
   majora of all women and labia minora of five and clitoral hood of four.
   Five women experienced rapidly recurrent vesicles associated with lymph
   oozing and underwent resection again (once: two women, twice: three
   women). The second resection was performed 4-6 months after the first,
   whereas the third took place 1-6 years after the second. Five women had
   moderate and transitory post-surgical lymph oozing. After a median
   follow-up of 53 months after the last surgery, seven of the eight women
   were free from symptom.
   Conclusion: Surgical resection is an effective and well-tolerated
   therapy for VLC in most women. Lesion recurrence is frequent but
   resection can be repeated several times with no adverse effects. (c)

Abstract = {{The taxonomic status of Basileuterus culicivorus complex has been under
   debate for a long time. There are uncertainties about the relationships
   among recognized species (B. culicivorus and B. hypoleucus), and whether
   B. culicivorus can be considered as a single species. In order to
   elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among these species and their
   biogeographic history we used a broad geographic sampling from Mexico to
   Argentina of B. culicivorus and B. hypoleucus. Using a mitochondrial
   gene, a nuclear intron and microsatellites we identified highly
   structured groups according to their spatial distribution. The known
   subspecies of B. culicivorus formed monophyletic groups, except two ones
   from Brazil and Paraguay. Basileuterus hypoleucus sequences did not form
   a monophyletic clade, being more related to B. culicivorus from Brazil
   and Paraguay. The divergence time analysis indicated that the deep
   separation of the basal lineages of B. culicivorus occurred in Late
   Pliocene. Contrasting with the other geographically structured
   populations from Central and South America, the clade of birds from
   Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina showed a remarkably high population
   growth starting in the mid-Pleistocene, according to the most plausible
   evolutionary scenario expected for parulid birds of a range expansion
   directed southwards. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In common with the rest of the UK, child care and protection practice in
   Scotland has undergone unprecedented change over the last ten years,
   including a wide-ranging three-year Child Protection Reform Programme.
   In 2006, The University of Dundee's Centre for Child Care and Protection
   and Barnardo's Scotland Research and Development team were commissioned
   by the then Scottish Executive to undertake a process review of the
   Child Protection Reform Programme (Daniel et al., 2007). Drawing on
   findings from the process review, this article considers the impact of
   the Child Protection Reform Programme. The process review concluded
   that, in the view of the respondents, the Child Protection Reform
   Programme made a substantive contribution towards the improvement and
   delivery of child protection services in Scotland, particularly in terms
   of raising awareness and increased multi-agency working. It was beyond
   the scope of the review to measure outcomes for children as a result of
   the reforms. Since the completion of the Child Protection Reform
   Programme, national policy emphasis has broadened from `child
   protection' towards integrated support for children under the Getting it
   Right for Every Child reforms of children's services. The paper
   concludes with a discussion around where `child protection' now fits
   within this context of universal support for children and argues that
   there is a need to ensure that the valuable work which was done to
   improve child protection services in Scotland under the Child Protection
   Reform Programme is not lost. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {{Measuring the 3D clustering of undetected galaxies through cross
   correlation of their cumulative flux fluctuations from multiple spectral
   lines}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{We discuss a method for detecting the emission from high redshift
   galaxies by cross correlating flux fluctuations from multiple spectral
   lines. If one can fit and subtract away the continuum emission with a
   smooth function of frequency, the remaining signal contains fluctuations
   of flux with frequency and angle from line emitting galaxies. Over a
   particular small range of observed frequencies, these fluctuations will
   originate from sources corresponding to a series of different redshifts,
   one for each emission line. It is possible to statistically isolate the
   fluctuations at a particular redshift by cross correlating emission
   originating from the same redshift, but in different emission lines.
   This technique will allow detection of clustering fluctuations from the
   faintest galaxies which individually cannot be detected, but which
   contribute substantially to the total signal due to their large numbers.
   We describe these fluctuations quantitatively through the line cross
   power spectrum. As an example of a particular application of this
   technique, we calculate the signal-to-noise ratio for a measurement of
   the cross power spectrum of the OI(63 mu m) and OIII(52 mu m) fine
   structure lines with the proposed Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology
   and Astrophysics (SPICA). We find that the cross power spectrum can be
   measured beyond a redshift of z = 8. Such observations could constrain
   the evolution of the metallicity, bias, and duty cycle of faint galaxies
   at high redshifts and may also be sensitive to the reionization history
   through its effect on the minimum mass of galaxies. As another example
   of this technique, we calculate the signal-to-noise ratio for the cross
   power spectrum of CO line emission measured with a large ground based
   telescope like the Cornell Caltech Atacama Telescope (CCAT) and 21-cm
   radiation originating from hydrogen in galaxies after reionization with
   an interferometer similar in scale to the Murchison Widefield Array
   (MWA), but optimized for post-reionization redshifts.}},

Abstract = {{A model for ideological struggles is formulated. The underlying set is a
   closed one, like a country but in which the population size is variable
   in time. The dynamics of the struggle is described by model equations of
   Verhulst-Lotka-Volterra kind. Several ``ideologies{''} compete to
   increase their number of adepts. Such followers can be either converted
   from one ideology to another or become followers of an ideology though
   being previously ideologically-free. A reverse process is also allowed.
   Two kinds of conversions are considered: unitary conversion, e.g. by
   means of mass communication tools, or binary conversion, e.g. by means
   of interactions between people. It is found that the steady state, when
   it exists, depends on the number of ideologies. Moreover when the number
   of ideologies increases some tension arises between them. This tension
   can change in the course of time. We propose to measure the ideology
   tensions through an appropriately defined scale index. Finally it is
   shown that a slight change in the conditions of the environment can
   prevent the extinction of some ideology; after almost collapsing the
   ideology can spread again and can affect a significant part of the
   country's population. Two kinds of such resurrection effects are
   described as phoenix effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Medical error has reached epidemic proportions, and researchers have
   developed insufficiently sophisticated models of safety culture to match
   the complexity of the challenge of safety in health care. This has left
   providers and researchers with an inadequate conceptual toolkit for
   improving safety. To rectify the resulting crisis we consolidate
   fragments of management research into a comprehensive and integrative
   framework of how patient safety is produced and sustained through safety
   culture. Safety culture involves actions that single out and focus
   safety-relevant premises and cultural practices that reduce harm. This
   entails (a) enabling, which consolidates the premises for a safety
   culture; (b) enacting, which translates consolidated premises into
   concrete practices that prioritize safety; and (c) elaborating, which
   enlarges and refines the consolidation and translation. We close by
   discussing the implications of our framework for future research on key
   issues such as efficiency-safety trade-offs, interactions among
   components of the framework, and feedback loops.}},

Abstract = {{Gamma-ray astronomy presents an extraordinary scientific potential for
   the study of the most powerful sources and the most violent events in
   the Universe. In order to take full advantage of this potential, the
   next generation of instrumentation for this domain will have to achieve
   an improvement in sensitivity over present technologies of at least an
   order of magnitude. The DUAL mission concept takes up this challenge in
   two complementary ways. While the Wide-Field Compton Telescope (WCT)
   accumulates data from the full gamma-ray sky (100 key-10 MeV) over the
   entire mission lifetime, the Laue-Lens Concentrator (LLC) focuses on
   Co-56 emission from SNe la (800-900 key), collecting gamma-rays from its
   large area crystal lens onto the WCT. A boom or two separated spacecraft
   flying in formation will maintain the gamma-ray optics and detector at
   the lens' focal distance. The sensitive gamma-ray spectroscopy that can
   be performed by DUAL addresses a wide range of fundamental astrophysical
   questions such as the life cycles of matter and the behaviour of matter
   under extreme conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The subset of patients suffering from meningiomas truly
   originating in or extending into the internal auditory canal is not well
   described in the literature.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate postoperative facial motor and hearing outcomes
   in patients undergoing resection of meningiomas originating in or
   extending into the internal auditory canal.
   METHODS: Chart reviews were done of 19 consecutive patients undergoing
   surgery for meningiomas originating in or extending into the internal
   auditory canal at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, with emphasis on clinical
   exam and audiometry.
   RESULTS: Median follow-up for the entire group was 29 months.
   Seventy-four percent of patients had stable facial nerve function. One
   patient experienced improvement. Postoperative cochlear nerve function
   was unchanged in 74\% of patients and worsened in 21\% of patients. One
   patient with a sudden preoperative hearing loss improved to full hearing
   at 3 months.
   CONCLUSION: Every attempt should be made to preserve hearing and facial
   motor function in surgical removal of posterior fossa meningiomas that
   originate in or extend into the internal auditory canal. Normal or
   nearly normal facial nerve function can be preserved in 88\% of patients
   presenting with normal facial nerve function; serviceable hearing can be
   preserved in 92\% of patients who present with normal hearing. A
   standard retrosigmoid craniotomy with drilling of the posterior canal
   wall of the internal auditory canal worked well in the majority of
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated by us and other authors that first nervous
   cells in developing larvae from various trochozoan groups differentiate
   at the periphery. These pioneer neurons are distinguished by the set of
   characters. They are located outside the forming central ganglia;
   outgrowing fibers of central neurons use their processes as a
   ``scaffolding{''} transmitter expression in these neurons is transient.
   On the one hand, pioneer neurons mark the ``frame{''} of the adult
   nervous system and thus play a limiting role. On the other hand,
   pioneering navigation provides possible mechanisms for evolutional
   plasticity of the nervous system in adults. In addition, pioneer neurons
   can underlie functional adaptation of trochophore animals, which
   minimizes fitness decrease during the transition from the larval to the

Abstract = {{Aim: The study was designed to establish relationship between the plasma
   concentration and QTc interval prolonging effect of fexofenadine and
   demonstrate the phenomenon of anticlockwise hysteresis.
   Materials and Methods: Six subjects were given fexofenadine 60 mg tablet
   orally under stable conditions, and their drug concentrations were
   measured at regular intervals. At predetermined time, their ECGs were
   recorded. Data were analyzed and plotted graphically.
   Design and Setting: Randomized parallel design, single group study
   conducted at clinical research organization of Ahmadabad.
   Results: In all subjects time taken for maximum plasma concentration of
   fexofenadine (T-max) was around 3 h and the value of average maximum
   plasma concentration was 460.63 ng/mL, the effect of fexofenadine on the
   heart (measured as QTc interval prolongation) was maximum (E-max) after
   6 h and average QTc interval was 469.75 ms. Thus, the time to maximum
   concentration of fexofenadine did not match with the maximum effect on
   the heart as measured by QTc interval.
   Conclusion: The relationship between the drug concentration and drug
   effect on the heart are at two different time scales. It can be
   understood by two-compartment model of pharmacokinetics, and this
   retardation or lagging of an effect behind the concentration is known as
   hysteresis. The increase of QTc was not beyond 500 ms and not sustained,
   demonstrating overall cardiac safety of fexofenadine.}},

Abstract = {{Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis occurs in renally impaired patients who
   have undergone contrast enhanced MR examination using intravenous
   gadolinium-based contrast agents. The effect of impaired kidney function
   on the biodistribution of gadolinium-based contrast agents was
   investigated using radiolabeled (153/Nat)gadolinium-DOTA,
   (153/Nat)gadolinium-DTPA, and (153/Nat)gadolinium-DTPA-BMA in a
   transgenic mouse model of renal impairment. Renally impaired animals had
   more activity associated with their tissues than did control mice, and
   this increase varied according to the radiotracer injected. For example,
   after 7 days, renally impaired animals that received Gd-153/Nat-DOTA had
   3-fold (P < 0.037) more activity in their bone tissue, whereas renally
   impaired animals receiving Gd-153/Nat-DTPA and Gd-153/Nat-DTPA-BMA had
   8-fold (P < 0.0001) and 24-fold (P < 0.0001) more activity in their bone
   tissue, respectively. These findings demonstrate that renal impairment
   dramatically alters the tissue distribution of Gd3+ ions in vivo, which
   are likely a critical factor in the development of nephrogenic systemic
   fibrosis. Magn Reson Med 64:1274-1280,2010. (C)2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Bone sialoprotein (BSP) belongs to the small integrin-binding ligand,
   N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) family, whose members play multiple and
   distinct roles in the development, turnover, and mineralization of bone
   and dentin. The functions of BSP in bone remodeling are not yet well
   established. We previously showed that BSP knockout (BSP(-/-)) mice
   exhibit a higher trabecular bone volume, concomitant with lower bone
   remodeling, than wild-type (BSP(+/+)) mice. To determine whether bone
   turnover can be stimulated in the absence of BSP, we subjected BSP(+/+)
   and BSP(-/-) mice to catabolic {[}ovariectomy (OVX)] or anabolic
   (intermittent PTH administration) hormonal challenges. BSP(-/-) mice
   progressively develop hypocalcemia and high serum PTH between 2 and 4
   months of age. Fifteen and 30 d after OVX, microtomography analysis
   showed a significant decrease of trabecular bone volume in tibiae of
   both genotypes. Histomorphometric parameters of bone formation and
   resorption were significantly increased by OVX. PTH treatment resulted
   in an increase of trabecular thickness and both bone formation and
   resorption parameters at all skeletal sites in both genotypes and a
   decrease of trabecular bone volume in tibiae of BSP(+/+) but not
   BSP(-/-) mice. PTH increased cortical thickness and bone area in
   BSP(+/+) but not BSP-/- mice and stimulated the bone formation rate
   specifically in the endosteum of BSP(-/-) mice and the periosteum of
   BSP(-/-) mice. PTH enhanced the expression of RANKL, MEPE, and DMP1 in
   both genotypes but increased OPG and OPN expression only in BSP(-/-)
   mice. In conclusion, despite the low basal turnover, both catabolic and
   anabolic challenges increase bone formation and resorption in BSP(-/-)
   mice, suggesting that compensatory pathways are operative in the
   skeleton of BSP-deficient mice. Although up-regulation of one or several
   other SIBLINGs is a possible mechanism, further studies are needed to
   analyze the interplay and cross-regulation involved in compensating for
   the absence of BSP. (Endocrinology 151: 5103-5113, 2010)}},

Abstract = {{As firms concentrate on their core competencies, they become more
   dependent on suppliers who possess technological competencies and
   manufacturing capacities that the firms themselves do not have. As a
   consequence, firms must maintain a network of capable and reliable
   suppliers. Supplier development activities can often support suppliers'
   improvement efforts. This research shows that indirect supplier
   development improves suppliers' product and delivery performance and
   supplier capabilities, and that direct supplier development strongly
   improves supplier capabilities. However, supplier development efforts
   are less effective if indirect and direct supplier developments are
   applied simultaneously. Therefore, at any given time, firms should
   engage in either indirect or direct supplier development, not in both.
   The study contends that supplier development-if conducted properly-can
   be a powerful supplier relationship management practice.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine use of and outcomes from adjuvant locoregional
   radiotherapy (LRRT) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for women with
   breast cancer with 1-3 positive nodes (1-3 N+) before and after the 1997
   publication of radomised trial evidence of a survival advantage from
   post-mastectomy LRRT.
   Methods: Data were analysed for 2768 women diagnosed between 1989 and
   2005 and referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency with newly
   diagnosed pT1-3 breast cancer with 1-3 N+, treated with BCS and RT. LRRT
   use was analysed over time. Ten-year Kaplan-Meier locoregional control
   (LRC), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS)
   curves were compared using the long-rank test. Cox regression modeling
   of LRC and BCSS were performed.
   Results: LRRT use in patients with 1-3 N+ increased from 23\% before
   1997 to 57\% after 1997. LRRT was associated with significant
   improvements in LRC, but not in DRFS, BCSS, or 10-year LRC was 89\% with
   local RT alone and 93\% with LRRT (p = 0.006). On multivariable
   analysis, LRRT was associated with improved LRC compared to local RT
   alone (HR 0.55, 95\% CI: 0.40-0.77), but not with significant BCSS
   differences. Margin status, grade, \% positive nodes, and hormonal
   therapy were significant predictors for LRC, while tumour size, grade,
   \% positive nodes, and hormonal therapy significantly affected BCSS.
   Conclusion: Post-BCS LRRT use in British Columbia increased almost
   threefold in patients with 1-3 N+ after 1997. Adjuvant LRRT was
   associated with improved LRC, but not with improved BCSS compared to
   breast RT alone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{19, SI}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the adsorption of arsenate, As(V), on goethite
   (alpha-FeO(OH)) and oil-coated goethite at experimental conditions
   chosen to mimic settings of wastewater from oil fields being released
   into marine and freshwater bodies. Similarities are evident between the
   As (V)-goethite and AsM-oil-goethite systems: i) Adsorption is fast and
   saturation is achieved within 180 min, ii) Reaction rates approximate to
   a pseudo second order rate expression and range between 6.5 and 52.3 x
   10(-4) g/mu mol/min, iii) Adsorption mechanisms are best described with
   a Langmuir model, and iv) Adsorption capacity rises with decreasing pH
   reflecting the increase of positive charges on the goethite surface. A
   difference is discernable in that the adsorption of As(V) is reduced
   significantly when the goethite is coated with oil. The similar
   experimental macroscopic observations for both systems, i.e., Langmuir
   model fits, reaction rates, and the effect of pH and ionic strength (I),
   suggest that the oil reduces the effective and/or reactive surface area.
   The zeta potential () indicates that the oil coating also changes the
   surface charge of the goethite, shifting the pH point of zero charge
   from 9.8 to about 3, thus contributing to the reduced As(V) adsorption.
   FTIR spectra show that As(V) interacts with the carbonyl functional
   groups of the oil. Our results suggest that oil-covered goethite
   significantly reduces the adsorption of As(V) and this points to a
   potentially significant indirect effect of oil on the cycling of As(V)
   and other oxyanions in oil polluted waters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{336}},

Abstract = {{As with many grasslands globally, the Highveld grasslands of South
   Africa are tree-less, despite having a climate that can support tree
   growth. Models predict that fire maintains these grasslands. The
   question arises as to why fire-tolerant savanna trees do not survive in
   these ecosystems? Savanna tree survival in mesic areas is restricted by
   demographic bottlenecks, specifically limitations to sapling-escape from
   fire. It was hypothesised that ancient highly leached soils from
   grassland areas would prevent saplings from growing fast enough to
   escape the fire-trap. Growth rates of savanna tree seedlings (Acacia
   karroo Hayne and Acacia sieberiana Burtt Davy) were measured in a common
   garden experiment using soils from ten sites collected along a
   savanna-grassland continuum. Soils from grassland sites were relatively
   nutrient-poor compared to those from savannas with lower pH, and
   associated cations. A. sieberiana growth rates responded to pH and these
   nutrients, whereas A. karroo growth was less strongly linked to specific
   nutrients. Even so, both species accumulated more biomass when grown in
   soils from savanna sites compared to grassland sites. An exception was a
   low elevation low nutrient savanna site that resulted in poor growth,
   yet sustains high tree biomass in situ. Differences between growth in
   grassland and savanna soils were small. They may contribute to, but are
   unlikely to explain, the treeless nature of these grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Production losses from abortions, stillbirths, and early calf mortality
   were described for the 2002 calf crop in 203 beef herds in western
   Canada. A total of 1689 calves were examined. A summary diagnosis was
   reported for 64\% of aborted calves, 78\% of stillborn calves, 88\% of
   neonatal calves, and 94\% of the calves > 3 d of age. Diagnoses for
   aborted calves included: thyroid gland lesions, pneumonia, developmental
   anomalies, placentitis, and myocardial necrosis or myopathy. For
   stillborn calves, diagnostic findings included: dystocia, thyroid gland
   lesions, myocardial necrosis or myopathy, developmental anomalies, and
   skeletal myopathy or necrosis. The most common diagnoses for neonatal
   calves (<= 3 d) were: pneumonia, skeletal myopathy or necrosis,
   myocardial necrosis or myopathy, accident or trauma, and septicemia. For
   older calves (3 d to 3 mo), the most common diagnoses included:
   starvation, abomasal ulcer or perforation, enteritis or colitis,
   pneumonia, and intestinal volvulus, obstruction, or perforation.}},

Title = {{Awareness of risk factors among persons at risk for lung cancer, chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease and sleep apnea: A Canadian
   population-based study}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To assess awareness among persons at risk for lung cancer,
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and sleep apnea regarding
   symptoms and risk factors of the disease, and their attitudes regarding
   the disease and toward those who are affected.
   METHODS: A quantitative hybrid telephone and Internet survey of a
   representative population of Canadian adults at risk for at least one of
   the three diseases was conducted. To measure the awareness and attitudes
   of First Nations, Inuit and Metis people to these diseases, a
   proportionate number were also surveyed.
   RESULTS: A total of 3626 individuals were contacted. Of these, 3036
   (84\%) were eligible to participate. Of those at risk for lung cancer
   and COPD, 65\% and 69\%, respectively, were due to tobacco smoke
   exposure. Among those at risk, 72\% believed that they were informed
   about lung cancer compared with 36\% for COPD and 56\% for sleep apnea.
   Most respondents were knowledgeable about the common symptoms of lung
   cancer, COPD and sleep apnea, but were less aware of the impact
   lifestyle choices could have on the development of these disorders and
   the availability of treatment. Most of the participants (77\%) believed
   that smoking was an addiction rather than a habit (19\%). There were no
   significant differences in the awareness of risk factors, symptoms and
   attitudes toward all three lung diseases between First Nations, Inuit
   and Metis people and the general population.
   CONCLUSIONS: Canadians are reasonably aware of risk factors and symptoms
   for lung cancer and sleep apnea. However, there is poor awareness of
   COPD as a disease entity. There is a lack of appreciation for the impact
   lifestyle choices and changes can have on lung diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The photo-induced insulator-metal transition for silicon-based VO2
   nanofilm is studied by THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). Obvious
   variations of THz ray transmittance are observed before and after the CW

   the THz region is calculated in the thin film approximation. According
   to the measured results, the metallic-phased VO2 film is characterized
   equivalently with Drude ` s model, and complex conductivity, dielectric
   function and refractive index are acquired by the model. As an
   examination on the equivalent Drude model, numerical simulation based on
   the finite integral method in time domain is carried out. The results
   show that they are in good agreement with the experimental results. This

Abstract = {{This research optimized the extraction of different protein fractions
   from barley grains and assessed the physicochemical properties of the
   fractions obtained. Pearling was first used to remove the grain's outer
   layers (mainly bran and germ) so that the barley cytoplasmic proteins
   (albumin and globulin) would be enriched in the pearling flour (PF),
   while endosperm proteins (hordein and glutelin) would be enriched in the
   pearled grain flour (PGF). Salt, alcohol, and alkaline solutions were
   then used to extract different barley protein fractions from PF and PGF.
   The effects of extraction solvent type, pH, temperature, and extraction
   time on protein content and extraction efficiency were studied. Aqueous
   ethanol (55\%, v/v) efficiently extracted barley hordein from PGF at 60
   degrees C, whereas pH 11.5 alkaline solution was the most efficient for
   extracting both cytoplasmic and endosperm proteins from barley PF and
   PGF at 23 degrees C. Subunit molecular weight, amino acid composition,
   and the functional properties of each isolated barley protein fraction
   were investigated. Barley glutelin demonstrated superior oil-binding
   property and emulsifying stability, whereas barley hordein exhibited
   good foaming capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional porous NiO is prepared on Ni foam by a thermal
   treatment method at various temperatures. The morphology and structure
   of porous NiO are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical
   properties of three-dimensional porous NiO anode are evaluated by
   galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling, cyclic voltammery, and impedance
   spectral measurements on cells with lithium as the counter and reference
   electrodes. Results show that porous NiO delivers a stable capacity of
   520 +/- 20 mAh g(-1) with no noticeable capacity fading up to 30 cycles
   when cycled in the voltage range 0.05-3.0 V at rate of 0.2 C. The porous
   NiO exhibits higher reversible capacity, better cycleability, as well as
   higher rate capability in comparison to NiO foil. The observed cyclic
   voltammograms and impedance spectra are analyzed and interpret a redox
   reaction of NiO-Ni-0 with formation and decomposition of Li2O. The
   excellent electrochemical performance of porous NiO can be attributed to
   its large surface area, which lowers the current density of NiO reaction
   interface, and then an alternative anode is provided for lithium-ion
   batteries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, based on the classical laminated plate theory, a new
   static deflection model for CPUAs subjected to voltage is established
   and the bonding layer is taken into account as an individual layer.
   According to the established analytical model, the influences of the
   structural parameters and material properties of the CPUA on the
   transverse deflection are numerically simulated and the static and
   dynamic characteristics of the CPUA are experimentally tested. The
   research results show that the predicted static deflections of the CPUA
   by the established deflection model in this article agree well with the
   measured results, the established static deflection model considering
   the bonding layer is more accurate than the existing model neglecting
   the bonding layer, and the maximum relative error is reduced by 8.45\%.
   The static deflections of the CPUA are apparently affected by the
   structural parameters and the material properties, which indicate that
   the performance of the CPUA can be optimized by the structural
   parameters and material properties. Because the hysteresis of the
   piezoelectric material is not considered when establishing the static
   deflection model, the apparent error exists when utilizing the static
   deflection model to predict the dynamic characteristics of the CPUA.}},

   The system without any perturbation is assumed to have such a periodic

   perturbation has a small norm. The goal of this research is to restore
   the periodic property for the system, with a small perturbation, through
   utilizing such a control that is optimal in certain sense. It also aims
   to study characteristics of such an optimal control. The existence and
   uniqueness of the optimal control is obtained. Furthermore, a necessary
   and sufficient condition for the optimal control is established.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified mesh-free method with embedded discontinuities is
   presented. In this method, the crack can be arbitrarily oriented, but
   its growth is represented discretely by activation of crack surfaces at
   individual particles, so no representation of the crack surface is
   needed. The crack is modeled by a local enrichment of the test and trial
   functions with a sign function, so that the discontinuities are along
   the direction of the crack. The discontinuity consists of cohesive crack
   segments that pass through the entire domain of influence at the node. A
   set of cracking rules is developed to avoid spurious cracking. We show
   by numerical experiments that complicated crack patterns with branching
   cracks can be modeled independent of the mesh. Copyright (C) 2009 John

Abstract = {{We have shown previously that activation of STAT1 contributes to the
   pathogenesis of Wilms tumor. This neoplasm caricatures metanephric
   development and is believed to originate from embryonic renal
   mesenchymal progenitors that lose their ability to undergo
   mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Therefore, we hypothesized that
   STAT1 is also activated and functional during metanephric development.
   Here we have demonstrated that both STAT1 and STAT3 are activated during
   normal development of the embryonic kidney. Furthermore, activation of
   STAT1 stimulated the proliferation of metanephric mesenchymal cells, but
   it prevented MET and tubulogenesis induced by leukemia inhibitory
   factor, which preferentially activates STAT3. Consistent with its
   negative regulation of metanephric mesenchymal differentiation,
   inhibition of STAT1 activation with protein kinase CK2 inhibitor TBB or
   RNAi-mediated knockdown of STAT1 promoted differentiation of metanephric
   progenitors and abolished the effect of cytokine-induced STAT1
   activation in these cells. Additionally, a cell-permeable peptide that
   inhibits STAT1-mediated transactivation by targeting the STAT1 N-domain
   also blocked cytokine-induced STAT1-dependent proliferation in
   metanephric progenitors and promoted LIF-induced MET and tubulogenesis.
   Finally, the STAT1 peptide inhibitor caused the down regulation of
   survival/anti-apoptotic factors, Mcl-1 and Hsp-27, and induced apoptosis
   in renal tumor cells with constitutively active STAT1, indicating that
   STAT1 is required for these cells to survive. These findings show that
   both metanephric progenitors and renal tumor cells utilize a
   STAT1-dependent mechanism for growth or survival. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of cardiac
   ultrasound in diagnosing acute heart failure (AHF) in patients with
   acute dyspnea with available plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
   level.
   Methods: Patients with acute dyspnea presenting to the emergency
   department (ED) of a tertiary medical center were prospectively
   enrolled. The enrolled 84 patients received both BNP tests and cardiac
   ultrasound studies and were classified into AHF and non heart failure
   groups.
   Results: Plasma BNP levels were higher in the AHF group (1236 +/- 1123
   vs 354 +/- 410 pg/mL; P < .001). The AHF group had larger left
   ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD; 32 +/- 7 vs 27 +/- 4
   mm/m(2); P <.001) and worse left ventricular ejection fraction (52\% +/-
   18\% vs 64\% +/- 15\%; P = .003). Multiple logistic regression analysis
   showed that both BNP levels more than 100 pg/mL and LVEDD were
   independent predictors for AHF. In patients with plasma BNP levels
   within gray zone of 100 to 500 pg/mL, LVEDD was larger in the Al-IF
   group than that in the non heart failure group (29 +/- 4 vs 26 +/- 4
   mm/m(2); P = .044).
   Conclusion: Both LVEDD by cardiac ultrasound and BNP levels can help
   emergency physicians independently diagnose AHF in the ED. In patients
   with plasma BNP levels within 100 to 500 pg/mL, cardiac ultrasound can
   help differentiate heart failure or not. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

   in upland areas. Farmers who have adopted both technology components
   have been able to increase the upland rice yield substantially. Income
   from rice production was similarly found to be higher for adopters than
   for nonadopters. In addition, there was evidence that increased rice
   yield helped reduce the pressure from intensifying food production in
   these fragile uplands because farmers were able to meet their food needs
   from smaller areas. Implications of these findings for sustainable
   development of uplands in Yunnan and in countries in the region are

Abstract = {{Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB), produced by certain virulent Shiga
   toxigenic Escherichia coli strains, causes hemolytic uremic
   syndrome-like pathology in mice, including extensive microvascular
   thrombosis. SubAB acts by specifically cleaving the essential
   endoplasmic reticulum chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP).
   BiP has been reported to inhibit the activation of tissue factor (TF),
   the major initiator of extrinsic coagulation. We hypothesized that the
   apparent prothrombotic effect of SubAB in vivo may involve the
   stimulation of TF-dependent procoagulant activity. TF-dependent
   procoagulant activity, TF messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, and BiP cleavage
   were therefore examined in human macrophage cells and primary human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to SubAB. In both types of
   cells, SubAB significantly increased TF-dependent procoagulant activity,
   induced TF mRNA expression, and mediated BiP cleavage. No effects were
   seen when cells were treated with a nonproteolytic mutant toxin,
   SubA(A272)B. Our results suggest that the procoagulant effect of SubAB
   may be dependent on both the up-regulation of TF expression and the
   activation of TF by means of BiP cleavage.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we suggest an anticipating projective response scheme in
   coupled dynamical systems, from which a large class of different
   drive-response systems can be constructed by choosing different
   functions and changing the scaling factor. A specific case of the
   scheme, which is named the accelerative anticipating projective response
   scheme, is studied in detail. In this specific scheme, the amplitudes of
   the drive and response systems synchronize up to a scaling factor and
   the response system evolves with a faster speed. Further, the robustness
   of this scheme is proved under the existence of the small disturbance of
   the driving term, interference of the driving signal and parameter
   mismatches.}},

   on the linkage of the neighboring tetrahedron and ring types The
   phosphorus oxygen tetrahedron exhibits regulative ability of bond angle
   and conductive ability of stress so that the vibrational wavenumbers of

Abstract = {{Calcyclin-binding protein or Siah-1-interacting protein (CacyBP/SIP) is
   a target protein of the S100A6, which is a member of the S100 family. It
   has been shown that CacyBP/SIP plays important roles in cell cycle
   progression, differentiation, and carcinogenesis. The purpose of this
   study was to explore the correlation of CacyBP/SIP expression and
   clinical significance in breast cancer.
   Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the CacyBP/SIP expression
   in 79 pairs of breast cancer tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues.
   Western blot analysis and semiquantitative RT-PCR were used to measure
   CacyBP/SIP protein and mRNA levels in three pairs of fresh breast cancer
   tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues. The clinical data were collected
   by telephone follow-up for 5 years.
   CacyBP/SIP mRNA and protein levels in breast cancer tissues were
   significantly higher compared with adjacent nontumor tissues. Poor
   cellular differentiation, lymph node invasion, and clinicopathological
   staging in breast cancer were associated with CacyBP/SIP expression.
   Other factors, such as age, menses, and tumor size, were not related to
   CacyBP/SIP expression. The up-regulation of CacyBP/SIP expression also
   was shown to increase recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer and to
   correlate with short overall survival rate.
   CacyBP/SIP expression is evident in more advanced clinical progression
   of breast cancer, and it might be a biomarker for poor prognosis and a
   potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To determine if the drug doses and administration schedules of
   carboplatin and gemcitabine combination affect antitumor effects.
   Materials and Methods: The inhibition of cell viability was measured by

   cytotoxicity activity of carboplatin and gemcitabine combination. Cell
   cycle changes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Synergism was
   observed when the bladder cancer cell line 5637 cells were treated with
   gemcitabine followed by carboplatin or concurrent
   carboplatin/gemcitabine. In contrast, moderate antagonism was observed
   when cells were treated with carboplatin followed by gemcitabine. Cell
   cycle analysis showed that the combined effect of these two drugs was
   cell cycle disturbance. Conclusion: Different doses and administration
   schedules affect the antitumor effect of carboplatin/ gemcitabine
   combination that may have clinical significance in the treatment for
   bladder cancer.}},

   Magnetoencephalography (MEG) enables a noninvasive interface with the
   brain that is potentially capable of providing movement-related
   information similar to that obtained using more invasive neural
   recording techniques. Previous studies have shown that movement
   direction can be decoded from multichannel MEG signals recorded in
   humans performing wrist movements. We studied whether this information
   can be extracted without overt movement of the subject, because the
   targeted users of brain-controlled interface (BCI) technology are those
   with severe motor disabilities. The objectives of this study were
   twofold: 1) to decode intended movement direction from MEG signals
   recorded during the planning period before movement onset and during
   imagined movement and 2) to localize cortical sources modulated by
   intended movement direction. Ten able-bodied subjects performed both
   overt and imagined wrist movement while their cortical activities were
   recorded using a whole head MEG system. The intended movement direction
   was decoded using linear discriminant analysis and a Bayesian
   classifier. Minimum current estimation (MCE) in combination with a
   bootstrapping procedure enabled source-space statistical analysis, which
   showed that the contralateral motor cortical area was significantly
   modulated by intended movement direction, and this modulation was the
   strongest similar to 100 ms before the onset of overt movement. These
   results suggest that it is possible to study cortical representation of
   specific movement information using MEG, and such studies may aid in
   presurgical localization of optimal sites for implanting electrodes for
   BCI systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a sensitive technique for
   studying cerebral white matter. Only a few studies have examined the
   association between changes in extratemporal integrity and cognition in
   temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), especially in Chinese patients. Aim: We
   used DTI to characterize microstructural changes and investigate their
   associations with cognition in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.
   Patients and Methods: We studied 27 adult patients with TLE and 21
   healthy controls. A standardized neuropsychological evaluation and
   diffusion tensor imaging examination were conducted on each subject.
   Eight patients were excluded because T2-weighted magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) results showed visible lesions. Furthermore, we determined
   mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the
   different regions of interest normal - appearing white matter (NAWM) in
   the frontal lobe white matter, the occipital lobe white matter, the
   corpus callosum, the internal capsules, the external capsules: and
   normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM) in the caudate nucleus head, the
   putamens and the thalami. These diffusion measurements were compared
   between the two groups, and we examined the correlations between DTI
   values and clinical characteristics. In addition, multiple linear
   regression analysis was used to study the association of DTI values with
   cognitive function. Results: Compared with normal controls, TLE patients
   demonstrated decreased FA in NAGM of both thalami and NAWM of the
   posterior limb of the left internal capsule (P<.01). In patients with
   temporal lobe epilepsy, right thalamus FA showed a tendency to correlate
   with age at seizure onset (beta=0.47, P=.045), and left thalamus MD
   showed a tendency to correlate with the duration of epilepsy (beta=0.54
   P=.038). Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy showed significantly
   poorer performance on nearly all tasks concerning category fluency and
   other executive functions (P<.01). In patients with TLE, there was a
   positive correlation between category fluency scores and FA in the white
   matter of the left frontal lobe (beta=0.429, P=.041) and the right
   occipital lobe (beta=0.613, P=.001). Conclusions: Our results suggested
   that the thalamus might be a potentially important extratemporal
   structure involved in temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, a longer
   duration of epilepsy or an earlier age at onset may result in more
   abnormalities in the thalamus. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
   showed significantly poorer performance on nearly all tasks concerning
   category fluency and other executive functions. Our results showed that
   frontal lobe white matter contributed to category fluency impairment in
   patients with TLE, but other areas might also contribute to these
   impairments.}},

Abstract = {{The paper proposes an IPv6 address configuration scheme for wireless

   method of the hash function to allocate the IPv6 addresses for the
   cluster heads and cluster members and to utilize linear probing to deal
   with assigned address collision. From the perspectives of duplicate
   address detection cost, address configuration cost and address
   configuration delay time, the paper analyzes and compares the
   performances of Strong DAD, MANETConf and the proposed scheme.

Title = {{Effects of Bagging on Volatiles and Polyphenols in ``Wanmi{''} Peaches

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{75}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fruits of the late-ripening peach cultivar ``Wanmi{''} were bagged at
   the early period of fruit endocarp hardening, and the bags were removed
   1 wk before maturity harvest. The effects of bagging on volatile
   compounds and polyphenols were studied. Total volatiles and the sum of
   C-6 compounds, esters from bagged fruits were significantly lower than
   from nonbagged fruits from the beginning of the final rapid fruit growth
   stage to maturity. As the most dominant compounds of C-6 compounds and
   esters, the lower contents of hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, hexyl acetate,
   cis-3-hexenyl acetate, and trans-2-hexenyl acetate attributed to the
   lower content of C-6 compounds and esters in bagged fruit.
   gamma-Hexalactone and delta-decalactone were produced earlier in bagged
   fruits than in nonbagged ones, suggesting that bagging accelerates fruit
   maturity. Level of. gamma-decalactone in bagged fruits was significantly
   lower than in nonbagged fruits at 159 days after full blossom (DAFB), so
   did delta-decalactone at 166 DAFB. Bagging did not affect chlorogenic
   acid and catechol contents of either fruit peel or flesh, nor did it
   affect contents of keracyanin or quercetin-3-rutinoside in fruit flesh
   during fruit development. However, keracyanin and quercetin-3-rutinoside
   levels were significantly reduced in bagged fruit peels before ripening
   compared to nonbagged fruit peels. Considering the large changes in
   volatiles and polyphenols, the key stage for ``Wanmi{''} fruit maturity
   was between 126 DAFB and 147 DAFB, about 1 mo ahead of maturity.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates a stabilisation problem of two-time scale
   systems with a finite feedback data rate. The uniform estimate of the
   state growth rate over each sampling interval is first provided, which
   is shown to be independent of the small parameter. Then, based on the
   given uniform estimate and the decoupled form of the two-time scale
   systems, the requirement, which is independent of the small parameter,
   on the necessary data rate for the channel is derived through the design
   of a quantiser. Based on this requirement, the authors obtain the
   detecting systems, which are two-time scale hybrid systems with
   impulsive. Then, under the assumption of strong controllability of the
   original two-time scale systems, it is shown that there exists a bound
   of the small parameter such that the original two-time scale systems are
   stabilised by a quantised state via a finite feedback data rate channel
   for a small parameter within the bound. Finally, a simulation example

Abstract = {{Meshless collocation methods for the numerical solutions of PDEs are
   increasingly adopted due to their advantages including efficiency and
   flexibility, and radial basis functions are popularly employed to
   represent the solutions of PDEs. Motivated by the advantages of ridge
   basis function representation of a given function, such as the
   connection to neural network, fast convergence as the number of terms is
   increased, better approximation effects and various applications in
   engineering problems, a meshless method is developed based on the
   collocation method and ridge basis function interpolation. This method
   is a truly meshless technique without mesh discretization: it neither
   needs the computation of integrals, nor requires a partition of the
   region and its boundary. Moreover, the method is applied to elliptic
   equations to examine its appropriateness, numerical results are compared
   to that obtained from other (meshless) methods, and influence factors of
   accuracy for numerical solutions are analyzed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Mobilisation of sedimentary monosulfidic black ooze (MBO) may result in
   rapid deoxygenation and acidification of surface waters, and release of
   potentially toxic metals. This study examines the extent and nature of
   MBO accumulation in the Geographe Bay area, Western Australia. MBO
   accumulations were found to be widespread in benthic sediments of the
   Geographe Bay area with acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) contents as high as
   320 mu mol g(-1). The MBO materials often had unusually high dissolved
   sulfide (S-11) concentrations in their pore-waters (up to 610 mg L-1)
   and elevated elemental sulfur (S-0) contents (up to 51 mu mol g(-1)).
   Dissolved S-11 is able to accumulate due to limited iron availability
   and S-0 is largely its partial oxidation product. The availability of
   organic carbon and Fe limited MBO accumulation at many sites. A
   comparison of AVS and simultaneously extracted metal (SEM)
   concentrations has shown that metals are likely to be bound in sulfide
   complexes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{P>Aims:
   In breast-conserving surgery, the width of free margin around a tumour
   to ensure adequate excision is controversial. The aim of this study was
   first to evaluate the frequency of residual disease in wider excision
   specimens in patients who undergo further surgery because of close
   margins of < 5 mm. Secondly, the ability of demographic and
   tumour-related factors to predict the close margins was appraised.
   Patients and methods:
   Three-hundred-and-three patients were included in the study. Patients
   undergoing wider excision were assessed for the presence of residual
   disease, and this was tested for association with the width of the
   initial free margin. Various factors were studied for association with
   close or involved margins by univariate analysis.
   Results:
   Fifty-three per cent of patients were eligible for re-excision based on
   the need for a 5-mm clearance. With a free margin of 2 mm or more from
   invasive tumour, the probability of finding residual disease was 2.4\%.
   The probability of residual disease was higher for ductal carcinoma in
   situ (DCIS) and did not decline with increasing the free margin width.
   Tumour size, lobular cancer type, vascular invasion and nodal
   involvement were associated with close margins.
   Conclusions:
   We suggest that a free margin of 2 mm from invasive tumour is adequate
   to minimise residual disease, whereas the equivalent free margin for
   DCIS remains unclear. Patients with large tumours and lobular cancer
   type should be counselled at the time of first surgery concerning the
   higher risk of further excision and mastectomy.}},

Abstract = {{STUDY DESIGN Controlled laboratory study
   OBJECTIVES To measure the architectural properties of rat supraspinatus
   muscle after a complete detachment of its distal tendon
   METHODS Supraspinatus muscles were released from the left humerus of 29
   Sprague Dawley rats (mass 400 450 g) and the animals were returned to
   cage activity for 2 weeks (n = 12) 4 weeks (n = 9) or 9 weeks (n = 8)
   before euthanasia Measurements of muscle mass perination angle fiber
   bundle length (sarcomere number) and sarcomere length permitted
   calculation of normalized fiber length serial sarcomere number and
   physiological cross sectional area
   RESULTS Coronal oblique sections of the supraspinatus confirmed surgical
   transection of the supraspinatus muscle at 2 weeks with reattachment by
   4 weeks Muscle mass and length were significantly lower in released
   muscles at 2 weeks 4 weeks and 9 weeks Sarcomere lengths in released
   muscles were significantly shorter at 2 weeks but not different by 4
   weeks Sarcomere number was significantly reduced at 2 and 4 weeks but
   returned to control values by 9 weeks The opposing effects of smaller
   mass and shorter fibers produced significantly smaller physiological
   cross sectional area at 2 weeks but physiological cross sectional area
   returned to control levels by 4 weeks
   CONCLUSIONS Release of the supraspinatus muscle produced early radial
   and longitudinal atrophy of the muscle The functional implications of
   these adaptations would be most profound at early time points
   (particularly relevant for rehabilitation) when the muscle remains
   smaller in cross sectional area and due to reduced sarcomere number
   would be forced to operate over a wider range of the length tension
   curve and at higher velocities all adaptations resulting in compromised
   force generating capacity These data are relevant to physical therapy
   because they provide tissue level insights into impaired muscle and
   shoulder function following rotator cuff injury J Orthop Sports Phys

Abstract = {{The expression of secondary sexual traits in females has often been
   attributed to a correlated response to selection on male traits. In rare
   cases, females have secondary sexual traits that are not homologous
   structures to secondary sexual traits in males and are thus less likely
   to have evolved in females because of correlated selection. In this
   study, we used the dung beetle Onthophagus sagittarius, a species with
   sex-specific horns, to examine the environmental and quantitative
   genetic control of horn expression in males and females. Offspring
   subjected to different brood mass manipulations (dung addition/removal)
   were found to differ significantly in body size. Brood mass manipulation
   also had a significant effect on the length of male horns; however,
   female horn length was found to be relatively impervious to the
   treatment, showing stronger patterns of additive genetic variance than
   males. We found no correlations between horn expression in males and
   females. We therefore conclude that the horns of O. sagittarius females
   are unlikely to result from genetic correlations between males and
   females. Rather, our data suggest that they may be under independent
   genetic control.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Advantages of direct peroral cholangioscopy (DPOCS) by using
   an ultraslim endoscope include a single-operator platform, image quality
   equal to that of standard endoscopy, and separate water and air
   channels. However, DPOCS has significant limitations, including
   cumbersome biliary access, en-face position with the ampulla, and
   gastric looping of the endoscope. A newly designed anchoring balloon may
   overcome these challenges.
   Objective: To report the feasibility of DPOCS with the anchoring
   balloon.
   Design: Pilot study, porcine model.
   Setting: Animal resources center.
   Intervention: The anchoring balloon system developed by Cook Medical
   (Winston-Salem, NC) was used for DPOCS.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Primary: Feasibility of biliary access
   maintenance and intraductal mobility. Secondary: Feasibility of
   intraductal therapeutic procedures.
   Results: Four animal subjects underwent DPOCS with the anchoring
   balloon. Ductal access was achieved with sphincterotomy in 2 subjects
   and with a balloon sphincteroplasty in 2 subjects. Intraductal placement
   of the ultraslim endoscope was achieved in all biliary access attempts
   without balloon migration or deflation. Common bile duct, cystic duct,
   bifurcation, and main right and left duct direct visualization was
   achieved in all cases. Therapeutic interventions by DPOCS, including
   intraductal biopsy, balloon dilatation, and intraductal bilateral metal
   stent placement, were all completed successfully. Biliary perforation
   occurred in one case because of balloon overinflation and in a second
   case because of sphincterotomy.
   Limitations: Prototype study in an animal model and small study size.
   Conclusion: Our results show that the novel anchoring balloon system
   successfully and safely enables DPOCS for both diagnostic and
   therapeutic interventions. If corroborated in human trials, it could
   offer a new platform for biliary interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Two pedestrian bridges, which were equipped with tuned mass dampers
   almost two decades ago, have been evaluated for their long-term
   performance. The response due to pedestrian action is compared to the
   response at installation. Forced vibration tests are used to identify
   system parameters of the bridges and the tuned mass dampers. The
   assessment shows that both bridges and tuned mass dampers are still
   working well. Detuning has been observed in one of the two bridges,
   which is, however believed to have existed already at installation.
   Parameters of the tuned mass dampers are shown to depend significantly
   on seasonal temperatures, which gives some practical limits to exact
   optimal tuning.
   Difficulties may arise in system identification when only the deck
   response can be measured. Since both inherent bridge damping and
   absorber effects reduce the overall response, it is difficult to
   separate the two effects. In some cases even a negative bridge damping
   together with a high absorber mass has been identified. For reliable
   results, one of these parameters has to be fixed to a reasonable value.
   The concept of effective damping is used to show the correlation between
   the two effects. This concept permits separating the effects of bridge
   damping, absorber mass, and detuning in an approximate manner. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Wild potatoes are of increasing interest as a gene pool in breeding. In
   this study, 23 genotypes of two cultivated (S. tuberosum subsp.
   andigena, S. phureja) and two wild Solanum species (S. chacoense, S.
   pinnatisectum) were evaluated for contents of soluble phenols and
   soluble proteins as well as their antioxidant capacity measured as
   ascorbic acid and trolox equivalent. Amounts of phenols present in tuber
   tissue ranged from 0.25 to 2.84 mg kg(-1) fw. On average, S.
   pinnatisectum (pnt) exhibited 3.9-fold greater quantities of phenols in
   its tuber tissue than the other Solanum species. In pnt tissue, high
   phenol content coincided with high levels of soluble proteins and
   antioxidants. It is concluded that an involvement of individual
   accessions of pnt in breeding could be profitable for the antioxidant
   potential and thus for the nutritional value of new potato cultivars.
   The results also revealed that soluble phenols as well as proteins
   present in tuber tissue substantially contributed to the total
   antioxidant capacity of potatoes. Moreover, it was found that quantities
   of soluble phenols, proteins and antioxidants increased notably upon
   wounding the tubers, a fact which underlines the role of all these
   components in wound stress responses of potatoes.}},

Abstract = {{We revised the quantum model of Amovilli and Mennucci (J. Phys. Chem. B
   1997, 101, 1051) to include the dispersion contribution to the solvation
   free energy within the framework of continuum models. Our revised
   formulation makes use of a single adjustable solvent-dependent
   parameter, and it can be readily generalized to different quantum
   mechanical descriptions. In particular, we made use of DFT and applied
   the model to investigate dispersion effects on vertical excitation
   energies within a time-dependent DFT framework. Our findings show that
   dispersion effects constitute a significant component of the absolute
   solvent effect but when relative solvent solvent shifts are considered a
   cancellation effect is observed.}},

Title = {{Detrital zircon provenance from three turbidite depocenters of the

Abstract = {{To test the idea that the voluminous upper Middle to Upper Triassic
   turbidite strata in the Songpan-Ganzi complex of central China archive a
   detrital record of Dabie ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terrane unroofing, we
   report 2080 single detrital U-Pb zircon ages by sensitive
   high-resolution ion microprobe-reverse geometry (SHRIMP-RG) and laser
   ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)
   analysis from 29 eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex sandstone samples. Low
   (<0.07) Th/U zircons, consistent with crystallization under UHP
   conditions, are rare in eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex zircon, and U-Pb
   ages of low Th/U zircons are incompatible with a Dabie terrane source.
   An unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean nearest-neighbor
   analysis of Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test results reveals that the
   eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex is not a single contiguous turbidite
   system but is instead composed of three subsidiary depocenters, each
   associated with distinct sediment sources. The northeastern depocenter
   contains zircon ages characterized by Paleozoic and bimodally
   distributed Precambrian zircon populations, which, together with south-
   to southeast-directed paleocurrent data, indicate derivation from the
   retro-side of the Qinling-Dabie (Q-D) collisional orogen wedge. In the
   central depocenter, the dominantly Paleozoic detrital zircon signature
   and south- to southwest-oriented paleocurrent indicators reflect a
   profusion of Paleozoic zircon grains. These data are interpreted to
   reflect an influx of material derived from erosion of Paleozoic
   supra-UHP rocks of the Dabie terrane in the eastern Qinling-Dabie
   orogen, which we speculate may have been enhanced by development of a
   monsoonal climate. This suggests that erosional unroofing played a
   significant role in the initial phase of UHP exhumation and likely
   influenced the petrotectonic and structural evolution of the
   Qinling-Dabie orogen, as evidenced by compressed Triassic
   isotherms/grads reported in the Huwan shear zone that bounds the Dabie
   terrane to the north. The central depocenter deposits reflect a later
   influx of bimodally distributed Precambrian zircon, signifying either a
   decrease in the influx of Paleozoic zircon grains due to stalled UHP
   exhumation and/or dilution of the same influx of Paleozoic zircons by
   spilling of Precambrian zircon from the northeastern depocenter into the
   central depocenter basin, perhaps due to infilling and bypass of
   sediment from the northern depocenter or due to initial collapse and
   constriction of the eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex basin. The
   southeastern depocenter of the eastern Songpan-Ganzi complex bears
   significant Paleozoic, Neoproterozoic, and Paleoproterozoic zircon
   populations derived from the South China block and Yidun arc complex,
   likely recording nascent uplift of the Longmenshan deformation belt due
   to impingement of the Yidun arc complex upon the western margin of the
   South China block.}},

Abstract = {{Poor hatchability can occur due to eggshell bacterial contamination,
   which can be decreased by UV light or H2O2 alone. However, antimicrobial
   effects of these 2 treatments combined, as well as optimum length of UV
   exposure, are not known. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to
   determine the optimum length of UV exposure for maximum bacterial
   reduction and to determine if a greater bacterial reduction would occur
   using a combination of UV and H2O2 compared with either treatment alone.
   The first experiment was conducted to determine the optimum length of UV
   exposure by exposing eggs to 4, 8, 16, and 32 min of UV. Three
   experiments were also conducted to determine what concentration of H2O2
   in combination with UV exposure would yield maximum bacterial reduction.
   For experiment 2, treatments consisted of a control and UV alone as well
   as 0, 1, 2, and 3\% H2O2 alone and in combination with UV for 8 min. In
   experiment 3, treatments consisted of a control, UV alone, 3\% H2O2
   alone, as well as 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3\% H2O2 in combination
   with UV for 8 min. Experiment 4 used 10 treatments including a control
   and 1.5, 2, and 2.5\% H2O2 at UV exposure times of 2, 4, and 8 min for
   each H2O2 concentration. Results indicated that every control eggshell
   contained bacteria, resulting in an average bacterial count of 4 log
   cfu/egg. Exposure to UV alone for 8 min yielded significant bacterial
   reductions without excessive egg heating. When administered
   independently, H2O2 and UV each reduced eggshell bacterial counts by 2
   log cfu/egg. The combination of 1.5\% H2O2 and UV for 8 min reduced
   bacterial counts by a maximum of 3 log cfu/egg, with only 35\% of the
   eggs positive for bacteria. Because bacterial contamination was further
   reduced by using a combination of UV and H2O2, it is possible that
   hatchability and chick quality of breeder eggs might be improved by such
   treatments.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2446-2456}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of permeant
   lipophilicity on permeant uptake into and transport across human sclera
   for transscleral delivery.
   Model permeants with a wide range of lipophilicities were selected and
   studied with human sclera. Uptake experiments were carried out to
   measure permeant partitioning into the sclera. Transport experiments
   were performed in side-by-side diffusion cells, and the permeability
   coefficients and transport lag times of the permeants across the sclera
   were evaluated.
   Permeants with higher lipophilicity showed higher partition coefficients
   to human sclera, and the apparent transport lag time also increased
   significantly as the permeant lipophilicity increased. No correlation
   between the permeability coefficients and lipophilicity of the model
   permeants was observed in this study with human sclera. A hypothesis on
   the different findings between the present and previous studies was
   proposed.
   Permeants with higher lipophilicity exhibited stronger binding to human
   sclera and would therefore lead to larger permeant partitioning to the
   sclera and longer transport lag time. The steady-state permeability
   coefficients of the permeants were not significantly affected by
   permeant lipophilicity.}},

Abstract = {{The gradient-structural design method of concrete due to underground

   following evidence: 1) the swelling value of the GSC system declined by
   approximately 60 to 74\% in 44 weeks; 2) the corrosion resistance
   coefficient K increased and the K-210 value was still larger than 1,
   compared to that of a conventional single-layer structure system; and 3)
   the change in electric flux of the GSC system only increased from 149 to
   252 coulomb (1 coulomb = 1A x sec.), whereas conventional single-layer

   dissociated by inclined deposition at temperature of 10 K, but can
   stable adsorb on top site by normal deposition. The change of bond

Abstract = {{In radio interferometry, information about a small region of the sky is
   obtained in the form of samples in the Fourier transform domain of the
   desired image. Since this sampling is usually incomplete, the missing
   information has to be reconstructed using additional assumptions about
   the image. The emerging field of compressed sensing provides a promising
   new approach to this type of problem that is based on the supposed
   sparsity of natural images in some transform domain. We present a
   versatile CS-based image reconstruction framework called SparseRI, an
   interesting alternative to the CLEAN algorithm, which permits a wide
   choice of different regularizers for interferometric image
   reconstruction. The performance of our method is evaluated on simulated
   data as well as on actual radio interferometry measurements from the
   VLA, showing that our algorithm is able to reproduce the main features
   of the test sources. The proposed method is a first step toward an
   alternative reconstruction approach that may be able to avoid typical
   artifacts like negative flux regions, to work with large fields of view
   and noncoplanar baselines, to avoid the gridding process, and, in
   particular, to produce results not far from those achievable by
   human-assisted processing in CLEAN through an entirely automatic
   algorithm, making it especially well suited for automated processing
   pipelines.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE- Evaluate use of a web-based shared medical record (SMR)
   between older patients with diabetes and providers.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS- This was a retrospective cohort study.
   Health records and SMR use patterns of 6,185 enrollees aged >= 65 years
   with diabetes were analyzed from implementation of a SMR in August 2003
   through December 2007. We analyzed baseline predictors of age, sex,
   distance from clinic, socioeconomic status, insulin use, morbidity, and
   associated primary care provider's (PCP) secure messaging use on
   patients' initial and subsequent use of the SMR. Changes in morbidity,
   PCP, or diabetes treatment were evaluated for impact on outcomes.
   RESULTS- A total of 32.2\% of enrollees used the SMR; median rate was
   1.02 user-days/month. Numbers of users and rate of use continued to
   increase. In adjusted analyses, likelihood of SMR use was associated
   with younger age, male sex, and higher socioeconomic status
   neighborhood, as well as clinical characteristics of overall morbidity
   and assigned PCP's use of secure messaging. Initial SMR use was more
   likely within 3 months of an increase in morbidity (hazard ratio
   1.61,95\% CI 1.28-2.01) and within 1 month of changing to a PCP with
   higher use (3.02, 1.66-5.51).
   CONCLUSIONS- Four years after implementation, one-third of older
   individuals with diabetes had used the web-based SMR. Higher morbidity
   predicted initial and continued use of SMR services. Providers' use of
   the communication feature was associated with higher likelihood of SMR
   engagement by their patients. Web-based SMRs may be an effective form of
   non-visit-based health care for older individuals with diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Stem cell therapy presents an opportunity to replace photoreceptors that
   are lost as a result of inherited and age-related degenerative disease.
   We have previously shown that murine postmitotic rod photoreceptor
   precursor cells, identified by expression of the rod-specific
   transcription factor Nrl, are able to migrate into and integrate within
   the adult murine neural retina. However, their long-term survival has
   yet to be determined. Here, we found that integrated Nrl.gfp(+ve)
   photoreceptors were present up to 12 months post-transplantation, albeit
   in significantly reduced numbers. Surviving cells had rod-like
   morphology, including inner/outer segments and spherule synapses. In a
   minority of eyes, we observed an early, marked reduction in integrated
   photoreceptors within 1 month post-transplantation, which correlated
   with increased numbers of amoeboid macrophages, indicating acute loss of
   transplanted cells due to an inflammatory response. In the majority of
   transplants, similar numbers of integrated cells were observed between 1
   and 2 months post-transplantation. By 4 months, however, we observed a
   significant decrease in integrated cell survival. Macrophages and T
   cells were present around the transplantation site, indicating a chronic
   immune response. Immune suppression of recipients significantly
   increased transplanted photoreceptor survival, indicating that the loss
   observed in unsuppressed recipients resulted from T cell-mediated host
   immune responses. Thus, if immune responses are modulated, correctly
   integrated transplanted photoreceptors can survive for extended periods
   of time in hosts with partially mismatched H-2 haplotypes. These
   findings suggest that autologous donor cells are optimal for therapeutic
   approaches to repair the neural retina, though with immune suppression
   nonautologous donors may be effective. STEM CELLS 2010;28:1997-2007}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Computationally intensive structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches
   have been in development over much of the 20th century, initiated by the
   seminal work of Sewall Wright. To this day, sample size requirements
   remain a vexing question in SEM based studies. Complexities which
   increase information demands in structural model estimation increase
   with the number of potential combinations of latent variables; while the
   information supplied for estimation increases with the number of
   measured parameters times the number of observations in the sample size
   - both are non-linear. This alone would imply that requisite sample size
   is not a linear function solely of indicator count, even though such
   heuristics are widely invoked in justifying SEM sample size. This paper
   develops two lower bounds on sample size in SEM, the first as a function
   of the ratio of indicator variables to latent variables, and the second
   as a function of minimum effect, power and significance. The algorithm
   is applied to a meta-study of a set of research published in five of the
   top MIS journals. The study shows a systematic bias towards choosing
   sample sizes that are significantly too small. Actual sample sizes
   averaged only 50\% of the minimum needed to draw the conclusions the
   studies claimed. Overall, 80\% of the research articles in the
   meta-study drew conclusions from insufficient samples. Lacking accurate
   sample size information, researchers are inclined to economize on sample
   collection with inadequate samples that hurt the credibility of research
   conclusions. Guidelines are provided for applying the algorithms
   developed in this study, and companion software encapsulating the
   paper's formulae is made available for download. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The importance of ethnic-racial socialization and ethnic-racial identity
   as protective factors in the psychological and social adjustment of
   Black youth is well established in the literature. Whaley (2003)
   developed a cognitive-cultural model of identity to explicate the
   process by which ethnic-racial socialization impacts ethnic-racial
   identity and subsequent social and behavioral outcomes among adolescents
   of African descent. The present study tests the cognitive-cultural model
   of identity utilizing pilot data from a modified Africentric
   intervention program. Both explicit and implicit aspects of
   ethnic-racial identity were evaluated between two cohorts: one group in
   2003, which represented historical controls, and another group in 2008
   which received the intervention and has pre-test and post-test data. We
   hypothesized that the evaluation of underlying implicit or schematic
   processes would be more sensitive to changes in ethnic-racial identity
   resulting from cohort and intervention effects. Our results confirmed
   this hypothesis. Implications of applying mainstream behavioral science
   research paradigms to issues of special concern to the Black community

Abstract = {{Background The field of orthopaedic oncology in North America has been
   formalized over the past 30 years with the development of the
   Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) and fellowship education
   opportunities.
   Questions/purposes To characterize current practices we assessed the
   fellowship education, practice setting, constitution of clinical
   practice, bone and soft tissue sarcoma treatment volume, perceived
   challenges and rewards of the career, and the nonclinical activities of
   orthopaedic oncologists.
   Methods Members of the MSTS and attendees of the 2009 AAOS-MSTS
   Specialty Day meeting were invited to participate in a twenty-three
   question online survey. One hundred and four surgeons including 99 of
   the 192 (52\%) MSTS members completed the online survey.
   Results Sixty-nine of the 104 (66\%) responding surgeons completed a
   1-year musculoskeletal oncology fellowship. Thirty-eight (37\%)
   completed an additional orthopaedic subspecialty fellowship.
   Seventy-four (79\%) work in an academic practice and 70 (+/- 16) \% of
   clinical time is spent practicing musculoskeletal oncology. An average
   of 20 (+/- 16) bone and 40 (+/- 36) soft tissue sarcomas were treated
   annually. Insufficient institutional support, reimbursement, and
   emotional stresses were perceived as the most important challenges in a
   musculoskeletal oncology practice. Sixty-seven (64\%) of the surgeons
   reported serving in a leadership position at the departmental or
   national level.
   Conclusions Professional time distribution is similar to other academic
   orthopaedists. The members of the MSTS are responsible for the treatment
   of more than two-thirds of bone and soft tissue sarcomas in the United
   States.}},

Abstract = {{An electric arc furnace, a ladle melt furnace, a single-tank vacuum

   and casting operation that supports a rod and bar-in-coil rolling mill.
   This paper describes the design, analysis, and operation of the
   electrical distribution system for these modern electric arc furnace and
   ladle melt furnace. First, the design of the electrical distribution
   system provided adequate capacity to support simultaneous operation of
   both the electric arc furnace and the ladle melt furnace in support of
   melt-shop operations. Next, harmonic analysis and flicker analysis of
   the circuit supplying the furnaces resulted in specification of a
   multistage filter that insured acceptable levels of harmonic distortion
   and voltage flicker on the utility supply as well as voltage support
   during all stages of arcing. Finally, operation experience gained from
   furnace performance during the initial startup led to subsequent
   fine-tuning to achieve higher levels of production.}},

Abstract = {{We attempt to measure possible miscalibration of the wavelength scale of
   the VLT-UVES spectrograph. We take spectra of QSO HE0515-4414 through
   the UVES iodine cell which contains thousands of well-calibrated iodine
   lines and compare these lines to the wavelength scale from the standard
   thorium-argon pipeline calibration. Analyzing three exposures of this z
   = 1.71 QSO, we find two distinct types of calibration shifts needed to
   correct the Th/Ar wavelength scale. First, there is an overall average
   velocity shift of between 100 m s(-1) and 500 m s(-1) depending upon the
   exposure. Second, within a given exposure, we find intra-order velocity
   distortions of 100 m s(-1) up to more than 200 m s(-1). These
   calibration errors are similar to, but smaller than, those found earlier
   in the Keck HIRES spectrometer. We discuss the possible origins of these
   two types of miscalibration. We also explore the implications of these
   calibration errors on the systematic error in measurements of Delta
   alpha/alpha, the change in the fine-structure constant derived from
   measurement of the relative redshifts of absorption lines in QSO
   absorption systems. The overall average, exposure-dependent shifts
   should be less relevant for fine-structure work, but the intra-order
   shifts have the potential to affect these results. Using either our
   measured calibration offsets or a Gaussian model with sigma of around 90
   m s(-1), Monte Carlo mock experiments find errors in Delta alpha/alpha
   of between 1 x 10(-6)N(sys)(-1/2) and 3 x 10(-6)N(sys)(-1/2), where
   N(sys) is the number of systems used and the range is due to dependence
   on how many metallic absorption lines in each system are compared.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity is commonly encountered in the
   Emergency Department. Until 2004, treatment consisted of either oral
   N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or filtered oral NAC administered intravenously
   (i.v.). Intravenous acetylcysteine (Acetadote) is a new Food and Drug
   Administration-approved i.v. formulation of acetylcysteine manufactured
   by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals in Nashville, Tennessee. Little
   post-marketing data exists on the effectiveness and safety of i.v.
   acetylcysteine. Objectives: We evaluated the clinical presentations and
   outcomes of patients treated with i.v. acetylcysteine for APAP toxicity.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients treated
   with i.v. acetylcysteine for APAP ingestion. The primary outcome
   measures were: adverse reactions to and effectiveness of i.v.
   acetylcysteine, as defined by elevation of transaminases, liver failure,
   renal failure, death, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Data collected
   included: comorbidities, allergies, intentionality, timing and dosing of
   i.v. acetylcysteine, hospital LOS, transaminases > 1000 IU/L,
   development of liver failure requiring transplant, development of renal
   failure requiring hemodialysis, death, and anaphylactoid reactions.
   Results: Sixty-four patients met our study criteria. Overall, 16 (25\%)
   patients developed transaminases > 1000 IU/L, 4 (6\%) of them died and 2
   (3\%) received liver transplants. Of the 15 patients (23\%) treated
   within 8 h, none died or developed liver or renal failure, and only 1
   developed transient transaminase elevation > 1000 IU/L. In the patients
   treated outside of 8 h, the median LOS was 3 days, whereas the group
   treated within 8 h had a median LOS of only 1 day. Six (9\%) patients
   developed anaphylactoid reactions, 2 of whom received the i.v.
   acetylcysteine bolus over 15 min. Five of these patients were treated
   pharmacologically and completed treatment, and one had treatment
   discontinued for undocumented reasons. Conclusion: Intravenous
   acetylcysteine seemed to be a safe and effective formulation of
   N-acetylcysteine. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the intensity and spatial patterns of animal transfers is
   of prime importance as geographical moves play an important part in the
   spread and potential control of contagious animal diseases of veterinary
   importance. For the purpose of visualizing all registered between-herd
   animal movements in Sweden between 1 July 2005 and 31 December 2008 by
   map animation, a grid network technique based on the Bresenham line
   algorithm was developed. Potential spatio-temporal clustering of animals
   registered as sold or purchased based on location and month of trade was
   also detected and tested using a spatial scan statistic. Calculations
   were based on data from 31,375 holdings and 3,487,426 head of cattle. In
   total, 988,167 between-herd movements of individual bovines were
   displayed in a sequence of maps covering three and a half years by
   2-week intervals. The maps showed that several cattle movements, both
   short-and long-distance, take place in Sweden each week of the year.
   However, most animals (75\%) were only registered at one single holding
   during the study period and 23\% were sold to a different holding once.
   Spatial scan statistics based on data from the year 2008 indicated
   uneven distributions of purchased or sold animals in space and time.
   During each autumn, there was an increase in cattle movements and
   October and November showed significantly more cases of sold or
   purchased animals (relative risk similar to 1.7, p = 0.001). Based on
   the results, we conclude that cattle trade is constantly active at a
   considerable level. This, in combination with possibly insufficient
   biosecurity routines applied on many farms, constitutes a risk that
   contagious diseases are spread in the population. The grid network maps
   were generated through the use of open-source tools and software in
   order to decrease software costs and facilitate sharing of programme
   code. In addition, the technique was based on scripts that allow for the
   inclusion of iterative processes and that comprise all main parts of map
   creation. Thereby, a large number of maps can be generated and the
   demands for high reproducibility are met.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess a baseline level of maternity care knowledge of the
   population and of care providers in rural areas in Kyrgyzstan and
   Tajikistan (Central Asia).
   Methods: Interviews with pregnant women and with men about their
   knowledge of key danger signs, serious health problems during pregnancy,
   labour and childbirth, and knowledge of basic infant care.
   Questionnaires about maternity care knowledge for providers, and
   checklists about providers' communication and counselling skills and
   about facilities completed by observers.
   Results: Level of knowledge among the population about possible
   complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period was low.
   Physicians in Kyrgyzstan scored an average of 55.2\% correct answers on
   52 knowledge questions about maternity care. Midwives and nurses in
   Kyrgyzstan, physicians and midwives in Tajikistan, scored on average
   less than 50\% correct answers. In Kyrgyzstan, in seven out of 15
   facilities (47\%) staff was permanently available for treatment and
   referral of patients (24 h a day, 7 days a week). In Tajikistan this was
   the case in only 2 of 17 facilities (12\%).
   Conclusion: Kyrgyz and Tajik women and men have limited knowledge about
   possible complications during pregnancy, childbirth, and the period
   after childbirth. Service providers do not have an adequate professional
   level of knowledge of perinatal health issues and lack basic skills to
   monitor their work. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the number of neurological second opinions (SOs) and tertiary
   referrals (TRs) is increasing, only little is known about expectations
   and patient satisfaction in this group of patients. Therefore, the
   purpose of this study was to explore expectations of patients who get a
   neurological SO or TR and to assess patient satisfaction in these groups
   of patients. All new patients attending an academic neurological
   day-care clinic in a 6-month period were investigated. Demographic
   characteristics, duration of symptoms, expectations and motivation, new
   diagnoses and treatment consequences were studied, and patient
   satisfaction with the previous physician and the day-care clinic
   physician was assessed. Three hundred consecutive patients (183 SOs and
   117 TRs) were evaluated. SO patients were younger (47 years vs. 51
   years), and their duration of symptoms was longer (24 vs. 13 months)
   than TR patients. Most patients expected a new diagnosis or treatment
   (60\%). SO patients were equally as satisfied with the day-care clinic
   consultation as TR patients (overall satisfaction using a VAS-score
   ranging 0-10: 7.4 vs. 7.5; p = 0.81), and significantly less satisfied
   with the referring physician (overall satisfaction: 5.6 vs. 7.0; p <
   0.001). SO patients, in particular, were more satisfied with the degree
   of information and emotional support provided by the consulting
   neurologist as compared to the referring physician. Receiving a new
   diagnosis and/or treatment advice did not influence satisfaction. A
   day-care admission for neurological SO and TR leads to an increase of
   patient satisfaction, irrespective of making a new diagnosis or
   initiation of a new treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the genus Borrelia are among the most common infectious
   agents causing tick-borne disease in humans worldwide. Here, we
   developed a Light Upon eXtension (LUX) real-time PCR assay that can
   detect and quantify Borrelia species in ticks that have fed on humans,
   and we applied the assay to 399 such ticks. Borrelia PCR-positive ticks
   were identified to species level by sequencing the products of
   conventional PCR performed using Borrelia group-specific primers. There
   was a 19\% prevalence of Borrelia spp. in the detached ticks, and the
   number of spirochetes per Borrelia PCR-positive tick ranged from 2.0 x
   10(2) to 4.9 x 10(5), with a median of 7.8 x 10(3) spirochetes. Adult
   ticks had a significantly larger number of spirochetes, with a median of
   8.4 x 10(4) compared to the median of nymphs of 4.4 x 10(4). Adult ticks
   also exhibited a higher prevalence of Borrelia (33\%) than nymphs
   (14\%). Among the identified species, Borrelia afzelii was found to
   predominate (61\%) and was followed by B. garinii (23\%), B. valaisiana
   (13\%), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (1\%), B. lusitaniae (1\%), and B.
   miyamotoi-like (1\%). Also, 3\% of the ticks were coinfected with
   multiple strains of B. afzelii. Notably, this is the first report of B.
   lusitaniae being detected in ticks in Sweden. Our LUX real-time PCR
   assay proved to be more sensitive than a corresponding TaqMan assay. In
   conclusion, the novel LUX real-time PCR method is a rapid and sensitive
   tool for detection and quantification of Borrelia spp. in ticks.}},

Abstract = {{In mammalian hosts, Leishmania parasites are obligatory intracellular
   organisms that invade macrophages (M phi) and dendritic cells (DC). In
   MO, the production of nitric oxide (NO) catalyzed by the inducible
   nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been implicated as a major defense
   against Leishmania infection. The modulation of this microbicidal
   mechanism by different species of Leishmania has been well studied in M.
   Although DC are permissive for infection with Leishmania both in vivo
   and in vitro, the effect of this parasite in the expression of iNOS and
   NO production in these cells has not been established. To address this
   issue, we analyzed the regulation of iNOS by Leishmania mexicana
   amastigotes in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC)
   stimulated with LPS and IFN-gamma. We show that the infection of BMDC
   with amastigotes down regulated NO production and diminished iNOS
   protein levels in cells stimulated with LPS alone or in combination with
   IFN-gamma. The reduction in iNOS protein levels and NO production did
   not correlate with a decrease in iNOS mRNA expression, suggesting that
   the parasite affects post-transcriptional events of NO synthesis.
   Although amastigotes were able to reduce NO production in BMDC, the
   interference with this cytotoxic mechanism was not sufficient to permit
   the survival of L. mexicana. At 48 h post-infection, BMDC stimulated
   with LPS + IFN-gamma were able to eliminate the parasites. These results
   are the first to identify the regulation of iNOS by L mexicana
   amastigotes in DC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Combination chemotherapy is standard care for feline lymphoma, although
   clinically relevant improvements in remission duration are unlikely to
   result from manipulations of chemotherapy agents alone. Lymphopoietic
   tissues generally are sensitive to radiation, and support for
   chemoradiotherapy as a treatment for lymphoma is found in both humans
   and dogs. The goal of this prospective pilot study was to determine the
   normal tissue tolerance to 15 Gy total abdomen fractionated radiation
   therapy following induction chemotherapy in cats with lymphoblastic
   lymphoma. Eight cats with lymphoblastic gastrointestinal or multicentric
   lymphoma confined to the abdominal cavity were treated with a 6-week
   combination chemotherapy protocol followed 2 weeks later by
   whole-abdomen radiation therapy consisting of 10 daily fractions of 1.5
   Gy. Treatment was well tolerated; renal insufficiency documented in one
   cat at the start of radiation therapy progressed to stable chronic renal
   failure. One cat not in complete remission at the time of radiation
   therapy relapsed 2 weeks later, one cat with multicentric lymphoma
   relapsed with hepatic large granular lymphoma, and one cat was
   euthanatized 3 weeks following completion of radiation therapy for other
   reasons; no evidence of lymphoma or radiation toxicoses was identified
   on post mortem evaluation. The remaining five cats remain in remission
   at least 266 days after starting therapy; median remission duration has
   not been reached (range, >266 to > 1332 days). Results of this study
   suggest that 15 Gy total abdomen fractionated radiation therapy after
   induction chemotherapy is tolerated satisfactorily. This protocol is
   suitable for further testing to quantify efficacy. (C) 2010 Veterinary

Abstract = {{The emission-line Be star HD 215227 lies within the positional error
   circle of the newly identified gamma-ray source AGL J2241+4454. We

   and variability similarities to other Be binaries. An analysis of the
   available optical photometry indicates a variation with a period of
   60.37 +/- 0.04 days, which may correspond to an orbital modulation of
   the flux from the disk surrounding the Be star. The distance to the star
   of 2.6 kpc and its relatively large Galactic latitude suggest that the
   binary was ejected from the plane by a supernova explosion that created
   the neutron star or black hole companion. The binary and runaway
   properties of HD 215227 make it an attractive candidate as the optical

Abstract = {{Elaborate visual communication signals characterize many animal
   lineages. Often sex-limited, these signals are generally assumed to
   result from sexual selection, and in many cases, their evolution is
   thought to play a central role in speciation. The co-evolution of male
   visual signals and female preferences is hypothesized to result in
   behavioral isolation between divergent lineages; however, for many
   lineages characterized by elaborate visual signals, the importance of
   visual differences in behavioral isolation is not well established.
   Darters (fish genus Etheostoma) are particularly appropriate for
   examining the role of visual signals in behavioral isolation. They
   comprise one of the most diverse groups of North American freshwater
   fish, and nearly every species is characterized by unique nuptial
   coloration. Multiple darter species co-exist in sympatric populations,
   indicating that reproductive barriers are central to maintaining these
   extraordinarily diverse color patterns. This study demonstrates the
   presence of behavioral isolation between a pair of distinctly colored
   sympatric darter species, Etheostoma barrenense and Etheostoma zonale,
   through experimental observations using an artificial stream. In
   addition, a series of dichotomous mate-choice trials indicate that
   females prefer conspecific males over heterospecifics based on visual
   differences alone. We therefore provide the first evidence that visual
   signals are a critical trait maintaining behavioral isolation in
   darters, a lineage of fishes with spectacular diversification in visual
   communication.}},

   fluids, common to all developmental stages. These cellulolytic enzymes
   were localized to foregut and midgut regions of the D. carolina
   digestive tract. Cellulases were purified from D. carolina head and gut
   fluid extracts by liquid chromatography to obtain N-terminal amino acid
   sequence tags. Database searches with sequence tags from head fluids
   indicated high similarity with invertebrate, bacterial and plant beta
   1,4-endoglucanases, while no homologues were identified for the
   gut-derived protein. Our data demonstrate the presence of cellulolytic
   activity in the digestive system of D. carolina and suggest that
   cellulases of endogenous origin are present in this organism.
   Considering that this grasshopper species is a pest of grasses,
   including switchgrass that has been suggested bioethanol feedstock,
   characterization of insect cellulolytic systems may aid in developing
   applications for plant biomass biodegradation for biofuel production.

Abstract = {{Background: Antibiograms must use a standard format to present
   microbiologic data.
   Objective: When antibacterials are selected for the treatment of
   infections, knowledge of the locally most likely causative organisms and
   the prevalence of resistant pathogens to antibacterial agents are
   essential. This involves generating a cumulative antibiogram. We
   designed an in-house novel software to prepare our antibiogram, validate
   data, and analyze results and assessed the performance of this
   technology. It should be noted that analysis of specific antibiotic
   resistance patterns were not a focus of this study.
   Setting: The study was conducted at Al Khor Hospital, Hamad Medical
   Corporation, a 110-bed acute care hospital that serves patients in the
   northern area of Qatar. Positive microbiology cultures excluding
   surveillance samples, isolated in the microbiology laboratory from
   January 2008 to December 2008, were entered into an in-house software,
   ABSOFT, designed by one of the authors.
   Results: The software produced the antibiogram in a fixed format.
   Epidemiologic data and comparison of our data to the National Nosocomial
   Infection Surveillance benchmark for multidrug-resistant organism
   distribution were also presented real time. Automatic color-coded
   results in tabular format were printed instantaneously without errors,
   thus eliminating the need to be reviewed.
   Conclusion: The paper highlights real-time validation and presentation
   of the cumulative antibiogram, additionally suggesting the format for
   reporting using a novel in-house software ABSOFT. This technology
   provided us an accurate, simple, cost-effective solution to present
   validated data real-time in a transparent and consistent manner. To our
   knowledge to date, no uniform format has been recommended for the
   presentation of cumulative antibiograms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Information regarding the safety and feasibility of
   EUS-guided FNA (EUS/FNA) in surgically altered anatomy is limited.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to describe EUS outcomes for
   Billroth I and II, Whipple, Puestow, Roux-en-Y (including gastric
   bypass), esophagectomy, and Nissen fundoplication surgeries.
   Design: Retrospective study.
   Setting: Single tertiary-care center.
   Patients: This study involved 188 EUS procedures performed in patients
   with surgically altered anatomy by 6 endosonographers from July 1995 to
   October 2008.
   Intervention: EUS and FNA.
   Main Outcome Measurements: Type of surgery, EUS indication, limitations
   to imaging, reasons for limitations, FNA results, and EUS/FNA
   complications.
   Results: Of 188 patients, 96 were men (mean age 57 years; range, 16-92
   years). Of patients with Billroth II anatomy (n = 39), 10 had limited
   (common bile duct {[}CBD], head of pancreas {[}HOP]) imaging because
   intubation of the afferent limb failed (n = 6) or was not attempted (n =
   4). Roux-en-Y (n = 18) encompased a variety of surgeries, but in general
   (n = 13) the proximal duodenum was not reached and the HOP and CBD were
   not imaged. For Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 7), the HOP and CBD were
   not imaged, with the exception of 1 case (in which staple-line
   dehiscence permitted access to the proximal duodenum). For the remaining
   procedures, EUS and FNA were successful with few exceptions. There were
   no significant adverse events (95\% confidence interval, 0\% to 1.9\%).
   Limitations: Retrospective descriptive study.
   Conclusion: EUS is generally successful and safe in patients with
   surgically altered anatomy in this tertiary-care setting, and a very low
   rate of adverse events is possible. Exceptions included imaging the HOP
   and CBD after Roux-en-Y surgery. After Billroth II surgery, if the
   afferent limb was intubated, the majority of patients were able to have
   a complete pancreaticobiliary examination, including FNA. (Gastrointest

Abstract = {{Quality improvement (QI) in health care involves activities ranging from
   enhancing personal practice to reforming the larger health care system.
   The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education recognizes this
   broad definition of QI in its requirement that physicians-intraining
   demonstrate competence in practice-based learning and improvement (PBLI)
   and systems-based practice (SBP). Creative metaphors have been used to
   teach the PBLI and SBP competencies, but conceptual frameworks
   describing the relationship between these competencies are needed.
   Transformative learning is an adult education theory that states
   individuals must critically reflect on life events in order to change
   their beliefs or behaviors. The authors propose that critical reflection
   during transformative learning can conceptually link PBLI and SBP.
   Reflection on personal experience with suboptimal patient care leads to
   recognizing personal or system limitations. Addressing personal
   limitations improves individual practice (PBLI), whereas applying QI
   methodologies leads to large-scale improvements (SBP). Educators who
   adopt the transformative learning framework should be able to design
   meaningful QI curricula that encourage residents to be reflective and
   empower them with QI skills.}},

Abstract = {{Attenuated Salmonella Enteriditis (Delta SE) recombinant vaccine vectors
   incorporating a Salmonella flagellar filament protein (fliC) subunit, a
   putative cell-mediated epitope, for expression of the lamB gene
   (encoding a maltose outer membrane porin), with or without co-expression
   of a putative immune-enhancing CD154 oligopeptide, were developed and
   compared with wild-type Salmonella Enteriditis (experiments 1 and 2) or
   the attenuated Delta SE empty vector (experiment 3) as initial vaccine
   candidates against Salmonella infection. A total of 3 experiments were
   performed to assess the infection and clearance rate of each of these
   constructs. Each construct or Salmonella Enteriditis was orally
   administered to broiler chicks at day of hatch by oral gavage (similar
   to 10(8) cfu/chick). In experiments 1 to 3, liver-spleen and cecal
   tonsils were removed aseptically for recovery of wild-type Salmonella
   Enteriditis or Delta SE mutants. These experiments suggested that cell
   surface expression of fliC alone markedly increased the clearance rate
   of the vector at or before 21d postvaccination in all 3 experiments. In
   a fourth experiment, broilers were vaccinated with one of the vaccine
   constructs or the Delta SE empty vector and then challenged with
   wildtype Salmonella Typhimurium. At 19 d posthatch, 16 d postinfection,
   neither candidate protected against challenge significantly better than
   the Delta SE empty vector, although there was significantly less
   Salmonella recovered from vaccinated chickens as compared with
   non-vaccinated controls. These experiments indicate that these
   experimental vaccines did not protect against heterologous challenge or
   enhance clearance after Salmonella Typhimurium challenge; as such, their
   value as vaccines is limited. The increased clearance of the candidate
   vaccines, particularly the vector expressing fliC alone, may have value
   in that the fliC epitope may decrease the clearance time of other
   recombinant vectored Salmonella vaccines.}},

Title = {{Expression of serotonin (5-HT) during CNS development of the cephalopod

Abstract = {{Cephalopods are unique among mollusks in exhibiting an elaborate central
   nervous system (CNS) and remarkable cognitive abilities. Despite a
   profound knowledge of the neuroanatomy and neurotransmitter distribution
   in their adult CNS, little is known about the expression of
   neurotransmitters during cephalopod development. Here, we identify the
   first serotonin-immunoreactive (5-HT-ir) neurons during ontogeny and
   describe the establishment of the 5-HT system in the pygmy squid,
   Idiosepius notoides. Neurons that are located dorsally to each optic
   lobe are the first to express 5-HT, albeit only when the lobular
   neuropils are already quite elaborated. Later, 5-HT is expressed in
   almost all lobes, with most 5-HT-ir cell somata appearing in the
   subesophageal mass. Further lobes with numerous 5-HT-ir cell somata are
   the subvertical and posterior basal lobes and the optic and superior
   buccal lobes. Hatching squids possess more 5-HT-ir neurons, although the
   proportions between the individual brain lobes remain the same. The
   majority of 5-HT-ir cell somata appears to be retained in the adult CNS.
   The overall distribution of 5-HT-ir elements within the CNS of adult I.
   notoides resembles that of adult Octopus vulgaris and Sepia officinalis.
   The superior frontal lobe of all three species possesses few or no
   5-HT-ir cell somata, whereas the superior buccal lobe comprises many
   cell somata. The absence of 5-HT-ir cell somata in the inferior buccal
   lobes of cephalopods and the buccal ganglia of gastropods may constitute
   immunochemical evidence of their homology. This integrative work forms
   the basis for future studies comparing molluscan, lophotrochozoan,
   ecdysozoan, and vertebrate brains.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The purpose of the present study was to test a theoretical model
   linking authentic leadership with staff nurses' trust in their manager,
   work engagement, voice behaviour and perceived unit care quality.
   Background Authentic leadership is a guide for effective leadership
   needed to build trust and healthier work environments because there is
   special attention given to honesty, integrity and high ethical standards
   in the development of leader-follower relationships. Methods A
   non-experimental, predictive survey design was used to test the
   hypothesized model in a random sample of 280 (48\% response rate)
   registered nurses working in acute care hospitals in Ontario.
   Results The final model fitted the data acceptably (chi(2) = 17.24, d.f.
   = 11, P = 0.10, IFI = 0.99, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.045). Authentic
   leadership significantly and positively influenced staff nurses' trust
   in their manager and work engagement which in turn predicted voice
   behaviour and perceived unit care quality.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that authentic leadership and trust
   in the manager play a role in fostering trust, work engagement, voice
   behaviour and perceived quality of care.
   Implications for nursing management Nursing leaders can improve care
   quality and workplace conditions by paying attention to facilitating
   genuine and positive relationships with their staff.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of Kasai portoenterostomy has dramatically improved the
   management and survival of children with biliary atresia. The success
   rate of this operation worldwide varies with different centers. In this
   respect, many authors have studied the correlation of a successful
   outcome with various factors, such as the experience and workload of the
   surgical center, the use of postoperative steroids, the underlying
   biliary anatomy, as well as the age of patients at the time of the
   operation. Indeed, the age of 60 days has been used by clinicians as a
   critical time beyond which the rate of success of the Kasai operation
   markedly reduces. Despite this worldwide adoption, clear evidence
   supporting this critical operative time is still lacking. We undertook a
   review of our experience in the management of children with biliary
   atresia and focused specifically on the issue of the timing of
   operation. We showed that performing the Kasai operation beyond the age
   of 60 days was not associated with a worse outcome and that a high
   percentage of patients could still achieve good bile flow with normal
   bilirubin postoperatively. Thus, we believe that until the age of 100
   days, the age of the patients does not play a significant role in
   determining the success of the Kasai operation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Most continuous cell lines with erythroid characteristics are
   derived from patients with myelogenous leukemia or erythroleukemia Among
   them, a few cell lines have been reported to be positive for CD36 We
   tried to establish a continuous erythroid cell line from the primary
   CD36(+) erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) by the lentivirus mediated
   gene transduction system
   Materials and Methods A lentiviral vector carrying 5V40T, hTERT, or the
   human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6 and E7 (E6/E7) viral oncogenes,
   was Introduced Into CD36 EPCs, singularly or combined Transformed cells
   were characterized in terms of histology, phenotype, karyotype, and gene
   expression profile
   Results The lentiviral vector carrying HPV16 E6/E7 genes successfully
   transformed CD36(+) EPCs, creating a continuous cell line, CD36E
   Immunophenotype analysis revealed that the CD36E cells had
   characteristics of erythroid progenitors, among which about 27\% of the
   cell population produced hemoglobin Colony forming cell assay
   demonstrated that the CD36E cells were capable of forming erythroid
   colonies Using cytokines or chemical agents, attempts were made to
   Induce differentiation of the CD36E cells but were ineffective,
   indicating the irreversible erythroid lineage commitment of the cells
   The gene expression profile of the CD36E cells displayed a marked
   difference from that of the CD36(+) EPCs
   Conclusions The continuous CD36E cell line is an erythroid progenitor
   cell line possessing the ability to produce hemoglobin The CD36E cell
   line would be an excellent tool for applied research involving erythroid
   lineage cells and comparative studies with primary CD36(+) EPCs

Abstract = {{Background. Tools chosen to measure poststroke upper-extremity
   rehabilitation outcomes must match contemporary theoretical expectations
   of motor deficit and recovery because an assessment's theoretical
   underpinning forms the conceptual basis for interpreting its score.
   Objective. The purpose of this study was to investigate the theoretical
   framework of the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) by (1) determining
   whether all items measured a single underlying trait and (2) examining
   the congruency between the hypothesized and the empirically determined
   item difficulty orders. Methods. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and
   Rasch analysis were applied to existing WMFT Functional Ability Rating
   Scale data from 189 participants in the EXCITE (Extremity
   Constraint-Induced Therapy Evaluation) trial. Fit of a 1-factor CFA
   model (all items) was compared with the fit of a 2-factor CFA model
   (factors defined according to item object-grasp requirements) with fit
   indices, model comparison test, and interfactor correlations. Results.
   One item was missing sufficient data and therefore removed from
   analysis. CFA fit indices and the model-comparison test suggested that
   both models fit equally well. The 2-factor model yielded a strong
   interfactor correlation, and 13 of 14 items fit the Rasch model. The
   Rasch item difficulty order was consistent with the hypothesized item
   difficulty order. Conclusion. The results suggest that WMFT items
   measure a single construct. Furthermore, the results depict an item
   difficulty hierarchy that may advance the theoretical discussion of the
   person ability versus task difficulty interaction during stroke
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To test the hypothesis that a decrease in confidence on a
   well-learned task will increase effort and performance.
   Design: A 2 (group: control, experimental) x 2 (trial: practice,
   competition) mixed-model with repeated measures on the second factor.
   Method: Expert skippers' (n = 28) self-confidence was reduced via a
   combination of task (i.e., change of rope) and competitive demands.
   Performance was the number of skips in a 1-min period. On-task effort
   was measured via the verbal reaction time to an auditory probe.
   Results: The group x trial interaction (F (1, 26) = 6.73, p < .05,
   eta(2) =.21) supported the hypothesis: Post-hoc tests revealed a
   significant decrease in self-confidence and a significant improvement in
   performance from practice to competition for the experimental group
   only. No significant effort effects were revealed.
   Conclusions: Some self-doubt can benefit performance, which calls into
   question the widely accepted positive linear relationship between
   self-confidence and performance. As effort did not increase with
   decreased confidence, the precise mechanisms via which self-confidence
   will lead to an increase or a decrease in performance remain to be
   elucidated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   wound healing and cancer cell metastasis. The study of cell adhesion has
   gained momentum in recent years, in large part because of the emergence
   of imaging techniques that have facilitated detailed analysis of the
   molecular composition and dynamics of the structures involved. In this

Journal = {{PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many new initiatives for population health improvement feature
   partnerships of leaders and organizations across multiple sectors of
   society. The purpose of this article is to review 1) the rationale for
   such partnerships as an important, if not essential, tool for population
   health improvement; 2) key organizational and contextual factors that
   appear to be associated with effective multisector partnerships; and 3)
   the limited evidence regarding the effect of such partnerships on
   population health outcomes. We conclude that systems thinking -
   accounting for the collective effect of many actors and actions - is
   essential to organizing and sustaining efforts to improve population
   health, and to evaluating them. More research is needed to understand
   how and why multisector partnerships are formed and sustained and the
   conditions under which multisector partnerships are necessary or more
   effective than other strategies for population health improvement.
   Research on and evaluation of multisector partnerships also need to
   incorporate more standard measures of partnership contexts,
   characteristics, and strategies and adopt longitudinal and prospective
   designs to accelerate social learning in this area. Finally, studies of
   multisector partnerships must be alert to the value of such initiatives
   to individuals and communities apart from any direct and measurable
   impact on population health.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{273-286}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Two matching-to-sample (MTS) and four same/different (S/D) experiments
   employed tests to distinguish between item-specific learning and
   relational learning. One MTS experiment showed item-specific learning
   when concept learning failed (i.e., no novel-stimulus transfer). Another
   MTS experiment showed item-specific learning when pigeons'
   novel-stimulus transfer decreased because they chose familiar training
   comparisons instead of matching novel comparisons. In 8-item and 3-item
   S/D tasks, pigeons and monkeys were accurate with unfamiliar
   training-stimulus pairings, stimulus inversions, and distorted stimuli,
   suggesting relational learning within a domain restricted to the
   training stimuli (i.e., no novel-stimulus transfer). In S/D tasks,
   pigeons with previous 8-item training showed less transfer than those
   without prior training, suggesting a carryover of restricted-domain
   relational learning. Pigeons shifted from 1024-item to 8-item S/D tasks
   showed reinstatement of restricted-domain relational learning. These
   findings are important in specifying which types of learning occur in
   these tasks, showing that subjects failing novel-stimulus transfer are
   not required to switch from item-specific to relational learning as a
   training set is expanded, and demonstrating that concept learning
   failure is not proof of item-specific learning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Adult guardianship is a coercive exercise of the state's power over an
   innocent individual, justified only by: 1) the ward's incapacity; and 2)
   the need to protect the ward's well-being. The raison d'etre of
   guardianship is to improve the well-being of the incapacitated ward.
   Studies of actual guardianship proceedings have long indicated serious
   ongoing concerns with the process. Repeated revisions of statutes have
   attempted to improve guardianship procedures, with some success.
   However, relatively little attention has been paid to the actual effect
   of guardianship on the well-being of respondents and wards, when the
   system functions as intended. The presumption that guardianship, when
   not abused, is in the best interests of an incapacitated adult is called
   into serious question by empirical research into the role of internal
   locus of control and autonomy on human well-being. Indeed, a wide range
   of data indicates that guardianship itself can have significant negative
   effects on the physical and mental well-being of respondents and wards.
   The guardianship system must be reformed to maximize the therapeutic
   effects of guardianship and to minimize the unnecessarily
   anti-therapeutic effects. I examine the effects of guardianship from a
   therapeutic jurisprudence perspective and propose and analyze
   modifications that could enhance the therapeutic effects of
   guardianship. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) in Saudi Arabia is listed as
   `vulnerable' by the IUCN. At present the species' survival is secured by
   extensive captive-breeding programs and re-introductions into protected
   areas. Post-monitoring of released individuals is essential for
   evaluating the success of such re-introductions but managers have
   difficulties in deciding whether food, water and other resources are
   sufficient to sustain a stable population. This study reports on data
   collected during standardized road transect counts in two wadis of the
   Ibex Reserve into which gazelles were previously released, and aims to
   compare the success of both re-introduction attempts with resource
   availability and home range size. Results from step-wise backward
   multiple regressions identified food availability and population density
   as significant predictors for home range size. The low amount of
   available food may have increased the competition between non-related
   females and therefore led to an increased overlap between non-group
   members resulting in increased dispersal rates. This information will
   allow interpretation of habitat suitability and provides possible
   reasons for the population decrease at both study sites. The data will
   enable conservation mangers to identify future re-introduction sites and
   will help improving the success of future re-introductions in Saudi
   Arabia or other parts of the species range. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {{721-754}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We develop a theoretical definition of operational capabilities, based
   on the strategic management and operations management literature, and
   differentiate this construct from the related constructs of resources
   and operational practices, drawing upon the resource-based view of the
   firm as our foundation. We illustrate the key features of operational
   capabilities using the illustration of a restaurant kitchen. Because the
   traits of operational capabilities are distinct, they create a barrier
   to imitation, making them a potential source of competitive advantage.
   However, operational capabilities are particularly challenging to
   measure, because they emerge gradually and are tacit, embedded, and
   manifested differently across firms. In solving this measurement
   conundrum, we draw upon similar situations experienced by Schein (2004)
   and Eisenhardt and Martin (2000) in operationalizing organizational
   culture and dynamic capabilities. A taxonomy of six emergent operational
   capabilities is developed: operational improvement, operational
   innovation, operational customization, operational cooperation,
   operational responsiveness, and operational reconfiguration. A set of
   measurement scales is developed, in order to measure each of the
   operational capabilities, and validated using two different datasets.
   This allows replication of the psychometric properties of the multi-item
   scales and helps to ensure the validity of the resulting measures.}},

Abstract = {{Phytophthora root and stem rot of soybean caused by Phytophthora sojae
   is a destructive disease affecting soybean production regions throughout
   the world. The utilization of resistant cultivars is the most economical
   and environmentally safe method for controlling this disease. This work
   aims to screen the effective sources of special and partial resistance
   for the development of resistant cultivars. A total of 611 soybean
   germplasm lines from three ecological regions were evaluated for their
   responses to three P. sojae strains, namely, PNJ1, PNJ3, and PNJ4, using
   the hypocotyl inoculation technique. The soybean germplasm lines
   elicited eight different reaction types with three strains. Among these,
   106 were resistant and 253 were susceptible to the three strains. A
   total of 123 soybean germplasm lines identified as susceptible to the
   three strains by the hypocotyl inoculation method were evaluated for
   partial resistance to PNJ1 using the slant board assay. Thirty-nine
   cultivars displayed high levels of partial resistance to PNJ1. The
   results of this study can be utilized to plant appropriately resistant
   cultivars in infected fields and to provide good breeding materials.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm for
   recognizing military-specific, physically demanding activities using
   body-fixed sensors. To develop the algorithm, the first group of study
   participants (n = 15) wore body-fixed sensors capable of measuring
   acceleration, step frequency, and heart rate while completing six
   military-specific activities: walking, marching with backpack, lifting
   and lowering loads, lifting and carrying loads, digging, and running.
   The accuracy of the algorithm was tested in these isolated activities in
   a laboratory setting (n = 18) and in the context of daily military
   training routine (n = 24). The overall recognition rates during isolated
   activities and during daily military routine activities were 87.5\% and
   85.5\%, respectively. We conclude that the algorithm adequately
   recognized six military-specific physical activities based on sensor
   data alone both in a laboratory setting and in the military training
   environment. By recognizing type of physical activities this objective
   method provides additional information on military-job descriptions.}},

Abstract = {{Changing the contact angle between a solid substrate and a droplet with
   an external voltage is important in the field of microfluidics. On a
   flat surface, the range of the reversible contact angle is about 90
   degrees: from 30 degrees to 120 degrees. However, on a rough surface,
   such as superhydrophobic surface of carbon nanotube, carbon nanofibers,
   silicon nanowires, ZnO nanorods, etc., the reverse transition from the
   Wenzel state to Cassie state is usually prevented due to an energy
   barrier resulting in a lower contact angle range. In this paper, we
   described the electrowetting on a rough surface of ZnO tetrapods. The
   contact angle on ZnO tetrapod was as high as 155 degrees, and a wide
   range of reversible contact angles actuated by an electric potential was
   observed. Electrolysis, which was a problem in previous research of
   nano-structured superhydrophobic surface, was avoided by applying a
   uniform dielectric layer between the conductive ITO and the ZnO
   tetrapods. The proposed method has potential applications in
   microfluidics devices with a large dynamic range of capillary force. (c)

Abstract = {{The complexes formed by bovine serum albumin (BSA) with single-stranded
   oligonucleotide (ss-oligo) or double-stranded oligonucleotide (ds-oligo)
   were investigated by laser light scattering, zeta potential analysis,
   and atomic force microscopy. It was found that BSA was able to recognize
   ss-oligo and ds-oligo upon forming complexes in HCOOH-HCOONa buffer at
   pH 3.0. When oligonucleotide was added dropwisc to BSA. BSA formed a
   complex with ss-oligo but not with ds-oligo in the studied charge ratio.
   When BSA was added to oligonucleotides. BSA formed complexes with both
   ss-oligo and ds-oligo but via different paths: the BSA/ds-oligo
   underwent two processes, heavy precipitation followed by reentry, with
   increasing BSA/oligo charge ratio, whereas BSA/ss-oligo underwent only
   aggregation process. but with a charge reversal occurred at BSA/oligo
   charge ratio about 0.1. Moreover, the complex formed by BSA and ds-oligo
   showed a kinetics much slower than that of BSA and ss-oligo. We
   attributed the big difference upon complexation to the physical nature
   of oligonucleotides as well as the conformational change of BSA under
   severe conditions. The differentiation of ss-oligo from ds-oligo by BSA
   via nonspecific interactions gained insight in the recognition of DNA or
   RNA by specific protein (enzyme) under physiological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents local spline regression for semi-supervised
   classification. The core idea in our approach is to introduce splines
   developed in Sobolev space to map the data points directly to be class
   labels. The spline is composed of polynomials and Green's functions. It
   is smooth, nonlinear, and able to interpolate the scattered data points
   with high accuracy. Specifically, in each neighborhood, an optimal
   spline is estimated via regularized least squares regression. With this
   spline, each of the neighboring data points is mapped to be a class
   label. Then, the regularized loss is evaluated and further formulated in
   terms of class label vector. Finally, all of the losses evaluated in
   local neighborhoods are accumulated together to measure the global
   consistency on the labeled and unlabeled data. To achieve the goal of
   semi-supervised classification, an objective function is constructed by
   combining together the global loss of the local spline regressions and
   the squared errors of the class labels of the labeled data. In this way,
   a transductive classification algorithm is developed in which a globally
   optimal classification can be finally obtained. In the semi-supervised
   learning setting, the proposed algorithm is analyzed and addressed into
   the Laplacian regularization framework. Comparative classification
   experiments on many public data sets and applications to interactive
   image segmentation and image matting illustrate the validity of our
   method.}},

   sheep. Activation of protein kinase C significantly increased the
   filamentous: globular actin ratio and contractions in the uterine
   arteries, which were inhibited by an actin polymerization inhibitor
   cytochalasin B. The basal levels of filamentous: globular actin were
   significantly higher in nonpregnant uterine arteries than those in
   near-term pregnant sheep. Prolonged treatment (48 hours) of nonpregnant
   sheep with 17 beta-estradiol (0.3 nmol/L) and progesterone (100.0
   nmol/L) caused a significant decrease in the filamentous: globular
   actin. In accordance, the treatment of near-term pregnant sheep for 48
   hours with an estrogen antagonist ICI 182 780 (10.0 mu mol/L) and
   progesterone antagonist RU 486 (1.0 mu mol/L) significantly increased
   the levels of filamentous: globular actin. Increased intraluminal
   pressure from 20 to 100 mm Hg resulted in an initial increase in uterine
   arterial diameter and vascular wall Ca2+ concentrations, followed by a
   decrease in the diameter at a constant steady-state level of Ca2+.
   Cytochalasin B blocked pressure-induced myogenic constrictions without
   effect on vascular wall Ca2+ levels and eliminated the differences in
   pressure-dependent myogenic tone between nonpregnant sheep and near-term
   pregnant sheep. The results indicate a key role of actin polymerization
   in protein kinase C-induced myogenic contractions and suggest a novel
   mechanism of sex steroid hormone-mediated downregulation of actin
   polymerization underlying the decreased myogenic tone of uterine
   arteries in pregnancy. (Hypertension. 2010;56:1009-1015.)}},

Abstract = {{RNase P from E. coli will cleave a RNA at a site designated in a complex
   with an external guide sequence (EGS). The location of the site is
   determined by the Watson-Crick complementary sequence that can be formed
   between the RNA and the EGS. Morpholino oligonucleotides (PMOs) that
   have the same base sequences as any particular EGS will not direct
   cleavage by RNase P of the target RNA at the expected site in three
   mRNAs. Instead, cleavage occurs at a secondary site that does not
   correspond exactly to the expected Watson-Crick sequence in the PMO.
   This cleavage in the mRNA for a drug resistance gene, CAT mRNA, is at
   least second order in the concentration of the PMOs, but the mechanism
   is not understood yet and might be more complicated than a simple
   second-order reaction. EGSs and PMOs inhibit the reactions of each other
   effectively in a competitive fashion. A basic peptide attached to the
   PMO (PPMO) is more effective because of its binding properties to the
   mRNA as a substrate. However, a PMO is just as efficient as a PPMO on a
   mRNA that is mutated so that the canonical W-C site has been altered.
   The altered mRNA is not recognizable by effective extensive W-C pairing
   to an EGS or PMO. The complex of a PMO on a mutated mRNA as a substrate
   shows that the dimensions of the modified oligonucleotide cannot be the
   same as a naked piece of single-stranded RNA.}},

Abstract = {{An equilibrium model of steam methane reforming coupled with in-situ
   membrane separation for hydrogen production was developed. The model
   employed Sievert's Law for membrane separation and minimum Gibbs energy
   model for reactions. The reforming and separation processes were coupled

   reactor for the fluidized bed hydrodynamics. The model predictions for a
   typical case were compared with those from the model of Ye et al. {[}15]
   which assumed a plug flow for bed hydrodynamics. The model predictions
   show satisfactory agreement with experimental data in the literatures.
   The influences of reactor pressure, temperature, steam to carbon ratio,
   and permeate side hydrogen partial pressure on solid carbon, NH(x) and
   NO(x) formation were studied using the model. (C) 2010 Professor T.

   For adsorption onto the hcp1 and fcc2 sites, N atom from NO formed bonds
   with Cu2Pt and Cu-3 clusters, respectively. An analysis of the density
   of states, charge population, and vibrational frequencies before and
   after the adsorption showed that electrons transferred from the surface

Abstract = {{Exosomes (EXO) derived from tumour cells have been used to stimulate
   antitumour immune responses, but only resulting in prophylatic immunity.
   Tumour-derived heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) molecules are molecular
   chaperones with a broad repertoire of tumour antigen peptides capable of
   stimulating dendritic cell (DC) maturation and T-cell immune responses.
   To enhance EXO-based antitumour immunity, we generated an engineered
   myeloma cell line J558(HSP) expressing endogenous P1A tumour antigen and
   transgenic form of membrane-bound HSP70 and heat-shocked J558(HS)
   expressing cytoplasmic HSP70, and purified EXOHSP and EXOHS from
   J558(HSP) and J558(HS) tumour cell culture supernatants by
   ultracentrifugation. We found that EXOHSP were able to more efficiently
   stimulate maturation of DCs with up-regulation of la(b), CD40, CD80 and
   inflammatory cytokines than EXOHS after overnight incubation of immature
   bone-marrow-derived DCs (5 X 10(6) cells) with EXO (100 mu g),
   respectively. We also i.v. immunized BALB/c mice with EXO (30 mu
   g/mouse) and assessed P1A-specific T-cell responses after immunization.
   We demonstrate that EXOHSP are able to stimulate type 1 CD4(+) helper T
   (Th1) cell responses, and more efficient P1A-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T
   lymphocyte (CTL) responses and antitumour immunity than EXOHS. In
   addition, we further elucidate that EXOHSP-stimulated antitumour
   immunity is mediated by both P1A-specific CD8(+) CTL and
   non-P1A-specific natural killer (NK) responses. Therefore,
   membrane-bound HSP70-expressing tumour cell-released EXO may represent a
   more effective EXO-based vaccine in induction of antitumour immunity.}},

Abstract = {{Nafion-coated antimony film electrode (NCAFE) was prepared in situ by
   simultaneously plated antimony with analytes, and applied to the
   determination of trace Pb(II) and Cd(II) in non-deaerated solutions by
   differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). Various
   experimental parameters, which influenced the response of the NCAFE to
   those metals, were thoroughly optimized and discussed. The results
   indicated that the sensitivity and resistance to surfactants at the
   NCAFE were remarkably improved with relative to the antimony film
   electrode (AFE). In the presence of 5 mg.L (1) gelatin, the peak heights
   at the NCAFE showed 4-fold enhancement for Pb and a 9-fold enhancement
   for Cd over a bare AFE. Reproducibility of the sensor was satisfactory,
   and the relative standard deviations were 4.8\% for 20 mu g.L (1) Pb and
   3.2\% for 25 mu g.L (1) Cd (n = 15) with preconcentration time of 180 s.
   The determination limits (S/N= 3) of this sensor were determined to be
   0.15 mu g.L (1) for Pb and 0.30 mu g.L (1) for Cd with accumulation time
   of 300 s. The NCAFE was successfully applied to determining Pb(II) and
   Cd(II) in vegetable and water samples with satisfactory results.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic modulation classification (AMC) has been intensively studied
   to enhance the successful classification rate, particularly for
   overcoming the physical limit that deals with weak signals received in a
   noncooperative communication environment. A wireless sensor network
   (WSN) has multiple geometrically distributed sensors to work
   cooperatively. The distributed signal sensing and classification
   performed by collaborated sensors is proven to be beneficial to
   increasing the modulation classification reliability. In this paper, we
   apply the likelihood ratio-based distributed detection fusion technique
   to address the issues of general binary modulation classifications. The
   data fusion algorithm performed in the primary node is presented. Its
   numerical performance with simulation results is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a software package named PEAS to facilitate analyses
   of large data sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for
   population genetics and molecular phylogenetics studies. PEAS reads SNP
   data in various formats as input and is versatile in data formatting;
   using PEAS, it is easy to create input files for many popular packages,
   such as STRUCTURE, frappe, Arlequin, Haploview, LDhat, PLINK, EIGENSOFT,
   PHASE, fastPHASE, MEGA and PHYLIP. In addition, PEAS fills up several
   analysis gaps in currently available computer programs in population
   genetics and molecular phylogenetics. Notably, (i) It calculates genetic
   distance matrices with bootstrapping for both individuals and
   populations from genome-wide high-density SNP data, and the output can
   be streamlined to MEGA and PHYLIP programs for further processing; (ii)
   It calculates genetic distances from STRUCTURE output and generates MEGA
   file to reconstruct component trees; (iii) It provides tools to conduct
   haplotype sharing analysis for phylogenetic studies based on
   high-density SNP data. To our knowledge, these analyses are not
   available in any other computer program. PEAS for Windows is freely
   available for academic users from http://www.picb.ac.cn/similar to

Abstract = {{A comprehensive understanding of the uptake, tolerance and transport of
   heavy metals in the wetland system through aquatic plants will be
   essential for the development of phytoremediation technologies. Copper
   accumulation and translocation of a submersed macrophyte Hydrilla
   verticillata (L.f.) Royle were investigated. Plant shoots showed a
   significant accumulation of Cu with a maximum of 30 830 mg Cu kg(-1) dry
   weight after exposed to 4000 mu g L-1 Cu for 4 d. Both roots and shoots
   can directly take up Cu from solution and Cu mainly accumulated in cell
   wall fractions. Moreover, H. verticillata predominantly accumulated Cu
   through shoots from the aqueous solutions because of the higher weights
   and bioaccumulation factors of shoots than those of roots. Acropetal
   translocation of Cu in the plant is higher than the basipetal
   translocation, which implies that upward translocation of Cu is mainly
   via the xylem and downward translocation is mainly through the phloem.
   These findings contribute to the application of submerged aquatic plants
   to copper removal from moderately contaminated waters. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma game in structured networks has been
   studied extensively to understand network reciprocity. However, in some
   cases results of these studies cannot be compared because not only the
   network structures but also the network parameters, rules for updating
   strategies, and update dynamics differ among them. In this study, we
   investigated the effect of experimental conditions by conducting a
   series of systematic factorial experiments. We found that those
   experimental assumptions are significantly important in network
   reciprocity, although we confirmed that network reciprocity can be
   basically explained by the average degree of the network (Nowak, 2006;

Abstract = {{Myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in
   myo-inositol (MI) metabolism pathway. The increase in MIOX enzyme
   activity is in proportion to serum glucose concentrations and may be
   responsible for the MI depletion found in the diabetic complications.
   The aim was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) in the MIOX gene are associated with Type 1 diabetes mellitus
   (T1D) and its complications. Four hundred thirty Caucasian patients with
   T1D were recruited: 172 patients had diabetic nephropathy, 140 had
   diabetic retinopathy/neuropathy, 118 patients had diabetes for >= 20
   years without microvascular complications and 224 were normal controls.
   Three SNPs, rs761745 (C/T), and rs2232873 (A/G) in the promoter and
   rs1055271 (C/G) in the 3'-untranslated were genotyped commercially. The
   frequencies of the CC genotype (0.36 vs. 0.44; P=.034) and C allele
   (0.60 vs. 0.68; P=.011) of rs761745 were significantly lower in patients
   with T1D compared with normal controls. Patients with T1D had a
   decreased frequency of the combination genotypes of CC (rs761745), GG
   (rs2232873) and GC (rs1055271) compared with the normal controls (0.13
   vs. 0.22, P=.0027, Pc=0.014). The haplotypes with C/G/G and C/G/C were
   less common in patients with T I D compared to normal controls (0.59 vs.
   0.70, P=.021) and the haplotypes with T/G/C and T/G/G ware more common
   in patients with T1D compared to normal controls (0.37 vs. 0.26;
   P=.021). In summary, our results demonstrated that the polymorphism
   (rs761745) in the promoter region of MIOX gene may be associated with
   the development of T1D in our studied population. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

   which the functions q satisfy the following two-sided inequality:
   alpha(2)pi/2 < argq(z) alpha(1)pi/2 (z is an element of U)
   for some alpha(1) and alpha(2) (0 < alpha(1), alpha(2) <= 1). Several
   interesting consequences of the main results are also given. All these

Abstract = {{In this paper, the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is employed for
   determining an unknown portion of the boundary from the Cauchy data
   specified on parts of the boundary. We propose a new numerical method
   with adaptive placement of source points in the MFS to solve the inverse
   boundary determination problem. Since the MFS source points placement
   here is not trivial due to the unknown boundary, we employ an adaptive
   technique to choose a sub-optimal arrangement of source points on
   various fictitious boundaries. Afterwards, the standard Tikhonov
   regularization method is used to solve ill-conditional matrix equation,
   while the regularization parameter is chosen by the L-curve criterion.
   The numerical studies of both open and closed fictitious boundaries are
   considered. It is shown that the proposed method is effective and stable
   even for data with relatively high noise levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

   make up the error of real-time gas measurement of the side-stream
   device, but also make up the accuracy of the main-stream device. In the
   paper, four issues which can affect the measurement accuracy were
   considered: respiration gas flow, turbulence of the light source with
   all ranges of wavelength, temperature drift and signal noise. The
   experimental results showed that the device could produce a stable

Abstract = {{Objective: To estimate the number of prevalent and incident HIV
   infections in Canada in 2008.
   Methods: We applied multiple methods to estimate national HIV prevalence
   and incidence in Canada, including the workbook method, two statistical
   modelling methods, and an iterative spreadsheet model.
   Results: The estimated number of people living with diagnosed or
   undiagnosed HIV infection (including AIDS) continues to rise, from an
   estimated 57,000 in 2005 to 65,000 in 2008. Nearly half (48\%) of these
   HIV-infected persons were men who have sex with men (MSM) and 22\% were
   women. An estimated 16,900 persons with prevalent infection (26\% of
   total prevalent infections) were unaware of their HIV-infected status
   and this proportion varied from an estimated 19\% of HIV-infected MSM,
   to 25\% of HIV-infected people who inject drugs, and 35\% of
   HIV-infected heterosexuals. An estimated 3,300 new infections occurred
   in Canada in 2008, which was about the same as the estimate of 3,200 in
   2005. Of those new infections, 26\% were among women and 12.5\% were of
   Aboriginal descent; in terms of exposure category, MSM continued to
   comprise the greatest proportion of new infections (44\%) and
   heterosexuals who originated in countries where HIV is endemic comprised
   16\%.
   Conclusion: HIV incidence in Canada is not decreasing. Aboriginal people
   and people from HIV-endemic countries continue to be over-represented in
   Canada's HIV epidemic. People unaware of their HIV infection are a
   priority for being tested and diagnosed to enable them to take advantage
   of care services and receive counselling to prevent further spread of
   HIV.}},

Abstract = {{Zeolite beta with high aluminum content (BEA, Si/Al = 7.4) was
   synthesized and evaluated as a CO2 capturing agent after conducting
   ion-exchange with various alkali and alkaline earth metal ions (Li+, K+,
   Cs+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+). The extent of ion-exchange was confirmed by
   ICP-AES, and textural properties of the samples were measured by XRD,
   SEM, and BET surface area measurement. CO2 adsorption isotherms of the
   ion-exchanged beta samples up to 101.3 kPa were obtained at 273 and 298
   K, and the corresponding heats of adsorption were estimated by the
   Clausius-Clapeyron equation. CO2 adsorption capacity increased in the
   sequence of K+ > Na+ > Li+ > Ba2+ > Ca2+ = Cs+ > Mg2+, and all of the
   evaluated metal ions showed high adsorption selectivity to CO2 over N-2.
   The best performance of K+-exchanged beta was also confirmed by a
   breakthrough curve analysis. Cyclic CO2 adsorption-desorption
   performance of the sample was also studied by TGA in a flow system,
   exhibiting stable cyclic runs accompanied by complete CO2 desorption at
   473 K. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although I-125-UdR treatment of malignant tumors in animal models and
   patients has achieved a certain effect, the short half-life of I-125-UdR
   in vivo and its cellular uptake only in S phase of the cell cycle are
   limiting factors with regard to tumor eradication, and therefore its
   combination with other applications is a promising strategy in cancer
   therapy. In this study, we show that I-125-UdR radionuclide therapy in
   combination with Egr-1 promoter-based IFN gamma gene therapy is more
   effective than I-125-UdR therapy alone in suppressing tumor growth and
   extending survival duration in mice bearing H22 hepatomas. Combined
   therapy could significantly inhibit cell proliferation and tumor
   angiogenesis, induce apoptosis and enhance cytotoxic activities of
   splenic CTL of the mice. Our results suggest that I-125-UdR in
   combination with Egr-1 promoter-based IFN gamma gene therapy may provide
   novel approaches for cancer treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a significant greenhouse gas and its emissions
   from fluidized bed combustion systems can be controlled using catalytic
   conversion and decomposition. The catalytic decomposition of N2O was
   studied in a quartz fixed-bed reactor at 450-700 degrees C. The low-cost
   catalyst was prepared from fly ash and iron oxides, and was
   characterized in terms of the BET specific surface area and XRD. This
   study showed that both the Fe content on the catalyst surface and the
   calcination temperature during the preparation of the catalyst should be
   optimized in order to significantly improve the catalyst performance
   when used for N2O decomposition. The influences of O-2, H2O, CO2 and SO2
   on the N2O decomposition were investigated at the most reactive
   temperature. Experimental results showed that O-2 had a small negative
   effect on the catalytic activity, while CO2 had no obvious effect on the
   N2O decomposition. The N2O conversion was still high even when H2O was
   present. However, the N2O conversion dropped sharply when H2O and O-2
   were both present. The catalytic activity was reduced by SO2 because of
   its reaction with the catalyst. The difference between the N2O
   conversion with H2O present and with both H2O and O-2 present was
   analyzed in order to determine the N2O decomposition mechanism. Two
   mechanisms for the N2O catalytic decomposition mechanism have been
   considered, of which the one with formation of oxygen atoms at two sites
   with migration and recombination shows better agreement with our
   experimental results. (C) 2009 Curtin University of Technology and John

Abstract = {{In face-to-face instruction of Reciprocal Teaching (RT), students'
   reading processes and dialogues with their peers are hardly observed. As
   a result, the teacher has few clues to identify students' learning
   difficulties and provide further scaffoldings. To record students'
   reading processes and enhance their comprehension, this study reports on
   the design of an online reciprocal teaching and learning system to
   support teachers and students in college remedial reading instruction. A
   sample of 129 under-prepared college students voluntarily signed up to
   participate in a remedial reading program. They were encouraged to use
   multiple strategies such as predicting, clarifying, questioning, and
   summarizing, which were supported by the functionalities of dialogue
   box, chat room, discussion forum, and annotation tool in the system. In
   this study, it was observed that students employed the multiple
   strategies to enhance their reading comprehension, as revealed by the
   students' reading processes recorded in the system. When encountering
   difficulties in using these multiple strategies, students expressed that
   they observed and learned from the teacher's or their peers'
   externalization of strategy usage. Students' reading progress in the
   remedial instruction incorporating the RT system was also identified by
   the pre- and post-tests. This study suggests that there may be benefits
   for teachers in encouraging students to interact with others in order to
   clarify and discuss comprehension questions and constantly monitor and
   regulate their own reading. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Soil carbon stock and its changes in northern China's grasslands from

Abstract = {{Climate warming is likely to accelerate the decomposition of soil
   organic carbon (SOC) which may lead to an increase of carbon release
   from soils, and thus provide a positive feedback to climate change.
   However, SOC dynamics in grassland ecosystems over the past two decades
   remains controversial. In this study, we estimated the magnitude of SOC
   stock in northern China's grasslands using 981 soil profiles surveyed
   from 327 sites across the northern part of the country during 2001-2005.
   We also examined the changes of SOC stock by comparing current
   measurements with historical records of 275 soil profiles derived from
   China's National Soil Inventory during the 1980s. Our results showed
   that, SOC stock in the upper 30 cm in northern China's grasslands was
   estimated to be 10.5 Pg C (1 Pg=1015 g), with an average density (carbon
   stock per area) of 5.3 kg C m-2. SOC density (SOCD) did not show
   significant association with mean annual temperature, but was positively
   correlated with mean annual precipitation. SOCD increased with soil
   moisture and reached a plateau when soil moisture was above 30\%.
   Site-level comparison indicated that grassland SOC stock did not change
   significantly over the past two decades, with a change of 0.08 kg C m-2,
   ranging from -0.30 to 0.46 kg C m-2 at 95\% confidence interval.
   Transect-scale comparison confirmed that grassland SOC stock remained
   relatively constant from 1980s to 2000s, suggesting that soils in
   northern China's grasslands have been carbon neutral over the last 20
   years.}},

Abstract = {{Unsteady gravity-driven flow of a thin slender rivulet of a
   non-Newtonian power-law fluid on a plane inclined at an angle a to the
   horizontal is considered. Unsteady similarity solutions are obtained for
   both converging sessile rivulets (when 0 < alpha < pi/2) in the case x <
   0 with t < 0, and diverging pendent rivulets (when pi/2 < alpha < pi) in
   the case x > 0 with t > 0, where x denotes a coordinate measured clown
   the plane and t denotes time. Numerical and asymptotic methods are used
   to show that for each value of the power-law index N there are two
   physically realisable solutions, with cross-sectional profiles that are
   `single-humped' and `double-humped', respectively. Each solution
   predicts that at any time t the rivulet widens or narrows according to
   vertical bar x vertical bar((2N+1)/2(N+1)) and thickens or thins
   according to vertical bar x vertical bar(N/(N+1)) as it flows down the
   plane: moreover, at any station x. it widens or narrows according to
   vertical bar t vertical bar(-N/2(N+1)) and thickens or thins according
   to vertical bar t vertical bar(-N/(N+1)). The length of a truncated
   rivulet of fixed volume is found to behave according to vertical bar t

Abstract = {{Introduction: Testing for high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV)
   infection, a prerequisite of invasive cervical cancer (ICC), has been
   proposed for primary cervical cancer screening. However, the low
   specificity limits its clinical significance. Although the risk factors
   for ICC have been extensively studied, whether the existence of risk
   factors is associated with the specificity of HR-HPV testing in primary
   screening is unknown. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of triage
   by risk factors on HR-HPV testing for detecting cervical intraepithelial
   neoplasia grade 2 or worse in cervical cancer screening.
   Methods: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted to explore
   the risk factors of ICC, and the predictors obtained were selected as
   potential triage factors. In population-based screening, potential
   triage factors associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade
   2 or worse were selected as triage factors, and the performance of
   HR-HPV testing with triage factors was evaluated.
   Results: Lifetime number of sexual partners was selected as a triage
   factor. With the triage factor, the specificity of HR-HPV testing
   increased significantly, both in the strata of normal (P = 0.000) and
   abnormal cytological examination findings (P = 0.030). While stratified
   by age, no significant differences were observed for women younger than
   30 years, but the specificity and the accuracy of the HR-HPV testing
   increased significantly (P = 0.000 and P = 0.000, respectively) among
   women aged 30 years or older.
   Conclusions: Triage by risk factors is a potentially simple and feasible
   method to increase the specificity of HR-HPV testing for cervical cancer
   screening.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is a serious disease in the US. Numerous risk factors have
   been linked to this disease. The safety of using growth promoters, such
   as zeranol, remains under debate due to the lack of sufficient in vitro
   and in vivo evidence. Using CellTiter 96 (TM) Aqueous Non-Radioactive
   Cell Proliferation assay, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, we
   evaluated the effects of sera harvested from experimental and control
   heifers before and after one month of zeranol implantation on the growth
   of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 as well as the involved
   mechanisms. We found that sera harvested from the heifers following one
   month of zeranol implantation were more mitogenically potent in
   stimulating the proliferation of MCF-7 cells when compared to sera
   harvested from the same heifers before zeranol implantation and the
   control heifers. Further investigation found that dextran-coated
   charcoal suppressed the stimulating effect of the sera on MCF-7 cell
   growth. The mechanisms involved in the MCF-7 cell proliferation
   stimulated by zeranol-containing sera may include up-regulation of
   cyclin D1 and down-regulation of p53 and p21 expression at the mRNA and
   protein levels in the cells. The results suggest that the consumption of
   beef products containing biologically active residues of zeranol or its
   metabolites is a risk linked to breast cancer development. Further
   investigation is required in order to clarify this critical issue.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Preoperative portal vein em., bolization (PVE); allows
   potentially curative hepatic resection to be carried out in patients
   with hepatobiliary malignancies who are otherwise not candidates for
   resection because of the small size of the future liver remnant (FLR).
   However, there have only been a few reports on PVE before hepatectomy
   for hilar cholangiocarcinoma due to the small number of Patients who can
   be treated with radical surgery.
   Methodology: :Between January 2007 and;March 2009, 49 :consecutive
   patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who were planned to have
   hemi-hepatectoniy/extended hemi-hepatectomy, plus caudate lobe resection
   in our tertiary referral center were studied. The change in size of the
   FLR and the operative outcomes were compared between patients with or
   without PVE.
   Results: All patients had liver dysfunction as a result of biliary
   obstruction due to hilar cholangiocarcinoma although they had all
   received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. PVE. was used in 16
   Patients with an estimated FLR of <50\%, while no PVE was carried out in
   33 patients with an estimated FLR of >50\%.
   Complications after PVE occurred in 3 patients (18.8\%), which included
   bile leakage (n=1) and coil displacement (n=2). No complication
   precluded liver resection. The FLR to total liver volume (TLV) ratio at
   presentation was significantly smaller in patients who underwent PVE
   than those who did not undergo PVE (40.3 +/- 7.4\% vs. 56.6 +/- 5.0\%;
   p<0.001). After PVE, the FLR to TLV ratio increased significantly (40.3
   +/- 7.4\% vs. 43.1 +/- 7.0\%; p<0.001) at a mean time of 14.2 +/- 3.5
   days. The mean +/- S.D. increase in FLR was 4.6 +/- 3.0 cm(3)/day. At
   surgery, the FLR volume was still significantly smaller in the PVE group
   than the non-PVE (802 +/- 216 cm(3)vs. 979 +/- 202 cm(3); p=0.007).
   In the PVE group, insufficient hypertrophy of the FRL prevented one
   patient from having surgery, while local tumor progression and
   peritoneal dissemination precluded hepatectomy in 2 more patients.
   Finally, 13 patients (81.3\%) underwent radical surgery. The PVE group
   had similar complication and mortality rates compared with the non-PVE
   group (complication rate, 69.2\% vs. 63.6\%; mortality rate, 0.0\% vs.
   9.1\%). The 1- and 2-year overall survivals for the PVE group (with
   intent-to-treat analysis), PVE group (radical surgery only) and the
   non-PVE group were 57.3\% and 43.0\%; 71.3\% and 53.5\%; 70.4\% and
   54.4\%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the
   survival outcomes.
   Conclusions: The results suggested that PVE is a safe and efficacious
   procedure in inducing adequate hypertrophy of the FLR before major
   hepatic resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma with obstructive jaundice
   which had been relieved by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the effect of soil solarization
   on soilborne diseases, weeds and plant yields by using polyethylene film
   (30-mu m-thick) containing different additives {[}ultraviolet (UV),
   ultraviolet + infrared (UV + IR), ultraviolet + infrared + anti-fog +
   anti-dust (UV + IR + AF + AD)], and used polyethylene film (260-mu
   m-thick). Trials were conducted in commercial strawberry (Fragaria
   ananassa cv. `Camarosa') fields in the town of Sultanhisar in Aydin
   province, Turkey, between 2007 and 2009. The highest soil temperatures
   at the depth of 10 cm under a polyethylene sheet containing UV + IR + AF
   + AD were 54 degrees C in 2007 and 50.7 degrees C in 2008. During the
   2007 growing season, collapse and death of strawberry plants were not
   detected. At the end of the 2008 season (May-June), collapsed and dying
   strawberry plants were observed. Pure cultures of Macrophomina
   phaseolina and Rhizoctonia solani were isolated from affected roots and
   crowns of plants. Viability studies of M. phaseolina were conducted
   under various field conditions and temperatures and M. phaseolina
   sclerotia survived more than 18 days at 45 degrees C. There was a sharp
   decline in M. phaseolina at 50 degrees C, where it survived for 19 h but
   was completely killed at 20 h. It first lost viability after 17 h at 50
   degrees C and after 60 min at 55 degrees C. In the field, solarization
   did not reduce the viability of M. phaseolina at a soil depth of 10 or
   20 cm; however, a significant reduction (66\%) in survival was
   determined at a soil depth of 5 cm. All treatments controlled Portulaca
   oleracea, Amaranthus spp., Digitaria sanguinalis, Echinochloa
   crus-galli, Veronica hederifolia, Raphanus raphanistrum, Setaria
   verticillata and Mercurialis annua at a rate of 100\%, but no treatment
   was effective on Cyperus rotundus. The marketable fruit yield was 38,004
   kg. ha(-1) for UV + IR, 35,834 kg. ha(-1) for UV-added polyethylene film
   and 35,368 kg. ha(-1) for used polyethylene sheet-covered plots, whereas

Abstract = {{This paper investigates local reconstruction techniques for extracting
   region-of-interest (ROI) from a 3-D terahertz imaging setup using a
   quantum cascade laser (QCL). The advantage of local reconstruction is
   the reduction in the required measurement time. Difficulties with
   limited projection angles and image noise make the development of
   accurate reconstruction algorithms particularly challenging. In this
   paper, both wavelet-based and traditional filtered back projection (FBP)
   techniques are investigated. Segmentation algorithms are applied to
   reconstructed images with low contrast and the resultant segments are
   compared with a known ground truth to explore the ability of a QCL to
   image target objects with complex contours. In our experiments, a
   polystyrene object with a hole drilled inside is used as the imaging
   target. The region of interest is adjusted through changing the size of
   the exposure regions. It is found that 3-D local reconstruction of the
   interior hole suffers from shape distortion, since scattering caused by
   the target's exterior contours introduces errors in the measured optical
   parameters of the object. It is found that wavelet-based local computed
   tomography for terahertz image reconstruction results in lower
   misclassification of pixels than traditional FBP algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Freeze-dried commercial Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) were
   encapsulated in an emulsion-based formulation stabilized by whey protein
   and resistant starch and either spray-dried or freeze-dried to produce
   probiotic microcapsules. There was no difference in loss of probiotics
   viability after spray drying or freeze drying. Particle size,
   morphology, moisture sorption, and water mobility of the powder
   microcapsules were examined. Particle size analysis and scanning
   electron microscopy showed that spray-dried LGG microcapsules (SDMC)
   were small spherical particles, whereas freeze-dried LGG microcapsules
   (FDMC) were larger nonspherical particles. Moisture sorption isotherms
   obtained using dynamic vapor sorption showed a slightly higher water
   uptake in spray-dried microcapsules. The effect of water mobility, as
   measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, at various
   water activities (a(w) 0.32, 0.57, and 0.70) and probiotic viability
   during storage at 25 degrees C was also examined. Increasing the
   relative humidity of the environment at which the samples were stored
   caused an increase in water mobility and the rate of loss in viability.
   The viability data during storage indicated that SDMC had better storage
   stability compared to FDMC. Although more water was adsorbed for
   spray-dried than freeze-dried microcapsules, water mobility was similar
   for corresponding storage conditions because there was a stronger
   water-binding energy for spray-dried microcapsule. This possibly
   accounted for the improved survival of probiotics in spray-dried
   microcapsules.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy power plants, such as wind turbine generator and
   photovoltaic system, have been introduced in isolated power system
   recently. The output power fluctuations of wind turbine generator and
   load deviations result in frequency deviation and terminal voltage
   fluctuation. Furthermore, these power fluctuations also affect the
   turbine shafting of diesel generators and gas-turbine generators, which
   are the main components of power generation systems in isolated islands.
   For stable operation of gas-turbine generator, the torsional torque
   suppression as well as power system stabilization should be considered.
   In this paper, the control strategy that achieves torsional torque
   suppression and power system stabilization is presented based on
   H-infinity control theory. The effectiveness of the proposed control
   system is validated by numerical simulation results. Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{SETTING: Kathmandu Valley urban area, Nepal.
   OBJECTIVE: To study the probabilities of failure and relapse and of
   amplifying drug resistance to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP) after
   the Category II retreatment regimen.
   DESIGN: Cohort study of smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) retreatment
   cases.
   RESULTS: Of 250 cases started on Category II retreatment, 209 were
   relapse cases; of these, 18 were INH-resistant RMP-susceptible, 18 were
   INH+RMP-resistant and nine were culture-negative. Of 19 return after
   interruption cases, two were INH-resistant RMP-susceptible and one was
   INH+RMP-resistant. Among 22 failures, no case was INH-resistant
   RMP-susceptible, six were INH+RMP-resistant and 14 were
   culture-negative. No INH-susceptible RMP-resistant cases were observed.
   Among 182 INH+RMP-susceptible cases, one failed and four relapsed during
   follow-up. Two of the five cases became INH+RMP-resistant and the
   remaining three remained susceptible. Among 20 INH-resistant
   RMP-susceptible cases, two failed and none relapsed. One of the two
   became INH+RMP-resistant and the other case remained INH-resistant
   RMP-susceptible.
   DISCUSSION: The proportion of resistance among retreatment cases in
   Kathmandu Valley was not high. The risk of relapse with amplification of
   RMP resistance among INH-resistant RMP-susceptible cases on the Category
   II retreatment regimen was 5\% (1/20), and that among
   INH+RMP-susceptible cases was 1\% (2/182).}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) has been
   related to the pathology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through
   regulation of T cell-dependent humoral immune responses. We investigated
   the functional associations of the -262A/T and -188A/G polymorphisms of
   SLAM in Chinese patients with SLE.
   Methods. Genotyping of -262A/T (rs2295614) and -188A/G (rs2295613) in
   SLAM was carried out in 248 cases and 278 controls. Promoter activities
   of haplotypes on the SLAM gene were evaluated with the dual-luciferase
   reporter system. The mRNA expressions of SLAM on peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMC) of SLE patients with different genotypes were
   determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
   Results. Frequencies of -262A allele and -188G allele were significantly
   higher in SLE patients than in controls. Haplotype analysis and
   multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that individuals with
   the AG/AG haplotype had increased susceptibility to SLE (p = 0.002, OR
   1.478, 95\% CI 1.152-1.897). In response to PHA stimulation, the SLAM
   mRNA expression on PBMC of SLE patients was significantly higher in
   -262A-188G haplotype homozygotes compared with -262A-188G heterozyaotes
   and individuals with other genotypes.
   Conclusion. Our findings suggest that -262A-188G haplotype in the SLAM
   gene promoter contributes to the risk of SLE by increasing the
   expression of SLAM. (First Release September 1 2010: J Rheumatol

Abstract = {{Objective Return to work following occupational injury is an important
   rehabilitation milestone; however, it does not mark the end of the
   return-to-work process. Following a return to the workplace, workers can
   experience difficulties that compromise their rehabilitation gains.
   Although there has been investigation of factors related to a return to
   the workplace, little attention has been paid to understanding what
   facilitates continued retum-to-work success as this paper aims to do.
   Methods This study used data gathered during one-on-one telephone
   interviews with 146 people who experienced a work-related injury that
   resulted in their being unable to return to their pre-injury job, but
   who returned to work following an extended period of absence and the
   receipt of vocational services.
   Results Numerous return-to-work facilitators were reported, including
   features of the workers' environmental and personal contexts, as well as
   body function, activities, and participation. Influences that stood out
   included a perception that the work was appropriate, supportive
   workplace relationships, and a sense of satisfaction/achievement
   associated with being at work.
   Conclusions The findings support the contention that initiatives aimed
   at improving return-to-work outcomes can go beyond the removal of
   barriers to include interventions to circumvent difficulties before they
   are encountered. Together with providing ideas for interventions, the
   study's findings offer an insight into research and theoretical
   development that might be undertaken to further the understanding of the
   return-to-work process and the factors that impact upon it.}},

Abstract = {{The chimpanzee is the only animal model for investigating the
   pathogenesis of viral hepatitis types A through E in humans. Studies of
   the host response, including microarray analyses, have relied on the
   close relationship between these two primate species: chimpanzee samples
   are commonly tested with human-based reagents. In this study, the host
   responses to two dissimilar viruses, hepatitis E virus (HEV) and
   hepatitis C virus (HCV), were compared in multiple experimentally
   infected chimpanzees. Affymetrix U133 + 2.0 human microarray chips were
   used to assess the entire transcriptome in serial liver biopsies
   obtained over the course of the infections. Respecting the limitations
   of microarray probes designed for human target transcripts to
   effectively assay chimpanzee transcripts, we conducted probe-level
   analysis of the microarray data in conjunction with a custom mapping of
   the probe sequences to the most recent human and chimpanzee genome
   sequences. Time points for statistical comparison were chosen based on
   independently measured viremia levels. Regardless of the viral
   infection, the alignment of differentially expressed genes to the human
   genome sequence resulted in a larger number of genes being identified
   when compared with alignment to the chimpanzee genome sequence. This
   probably reflects the lesser refinement of gene annotation for
   chimpanzees. In general, the two viruses demonstrated very distinct
   temporal changes in host response genes, although both RNA viruses
   induced genes that were involved in many of the same biological systems,
   including interferon-induced genes. The host response to HCV infection
   was more robust in the magnitude and number of differentially expressed
   genes compared to HEV infection.}},

Abstract = {{Weak interactions between copper atoms so called cuprophilic
   interactions, lead to the supramolecular stacks of C6F5Cu(py), which
   possess unique luminescent and charge transport properties.
   First-principle band-structure calculations have been used to
   investigate the relationship between its charge transport property and
   cuprophilic interactions for the first time. The valence bandwidth was
   found three times larger than the conduction bandwidth. Meanwhile, the
   effective mass of hole is 0.46 m(0), which is only one-third of the
   electron, and much smaller than that of the pentacene. Thus, C6F5Cu(py)
   would become a promising candidate for hole transport material. The
   analysis based on density of states and band structure shows that holes
   transport mainly along the direction of cuprophilic interactions
   (c-axis) and cuprophilic interactions are in favor of hole transport.
   Thus, the cuprophilic interactions play an important role in determining
   charge transport. By the replacement of copper atoms with silver and
   gold atoms, the results show that there are close relationships between
   the metallophilic interactions and transport ability, i.e., the stronger
   metallophilic interactions are, the better hole transport ability is.
   The solid state emission of C6F5Cu(py) is attributed to the monomer
   rather than the dimer. This emission is assigned as the metal-to-ligand
   charge transfer (MLCT), and combined with some contributions from
   ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT).}},

Abstract = {{Replication of infectious hepatitis C virus in Huh7 cells, a human
   hepatocyte cell line, has become possible due to the unique properties
   of the JFH1 isolate. Developing reporter virus systems for a simple
   titration has been attempted by integrating heterologous reporter genes
   into the JFH1 genome, resulting in a big infectivity reduction that
   limits the usefulness of such reporter systems. To overcome this
   problem, JFH1-infected Huh7 cells were cultured continuously for 2 years
   to obtain Huh7-adapted JFH1 variants capable of yielding up to 1000-fold
   higher titers. Sequence analysis of variant genome RNA suggested that
   this adapted population consisted mainly of two variants. By joining the
   5'-half of the obtained representative viral complementary DNA (cDNA)
   fragments of the variants with the 3'-half of the wildtype's, two
   prototype clones, A/WT and B/WT, were constructed. Replication of A/WT
   and B/WT viruses in Huh7 cells showed up to 100-1000-fold higher titers
   than the wild-type. A Renilla luciferase cDNA was inserted into the
   Nonstructural Protein 5A region of the A/WT and B/WT cDNA to generate
   A/WT-Rluc and B/WT-Rluc, respectively. Transfection of Huh7 cells with
   in vitro-transcribed A/WT-Rluc and B/WT-Rluc RNA resulted in production
   of infectious viruses with approximately 15- and 25-fold higher titers,
   respectively, than the wild-type RNA. The replication of A/WT-Rluc and
   B/WT-Rluc viruses was more vigorous than the wild-type even with
   insertion of the luciferase cDNA showing a good correlation of
   luciferase activities with infectious titers. Furthermore,
   interferon-alpha inhibited the replication of A/WT-Rluc and B/WT-Rluc
   viruses in a dose-dependent manner as determined by a luciferase assay.
   These results imply that our system is potentially a tool useful for
   screening anti-hepatitis C virus drugs in a simple and time/cost-saving
   manner. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A hallmark of metazoan RNA polymerase II transcripts is the presence of
   numerous small exons surrounded by large introns. Abundant evidence
   indicates that splicing to excise introns occurs co-transcriptionally,
   prior to release of the nascent transcript from RNAP II. Here, we
   established an efficient model system for co-transcriptional splicing in
   vitro. In this system, CMV-DNA constructs immobilized on beads generate
   RNAP II transcripts containing two exons and an intron. Consistent with
   previous work, our data indicate that elongating nascent transcripts are
   tethered to RNAP II on the immobilized DNA template. We show that
   nascent transcripts that reach full length, but are still attached to
   RNAP II, are efficiently spliced. When the nascent transcript is cleaved
   within the intron using RNase H, both the 5' and 3' cleavage fragments
   are detected in the bound fraction, where they undergo splicing.
   Together, our work establishes a system for co-transcriptional splicing
   in vitro, in which the spliceosome containing the 5' and 3' exons are
   tethered to RNAP II for splicing.}},

Abstract = {{A particulate nitrate analyzer based on a scrubber difference/NO-O-3
   chemiluminescence method (SD-CL method) has been developed for measuring
   nitrate concentrations in remote areas. Particulate nitrate
   concentrations (NO3-(p)) were analyzed by the difference between the
   concentrations of NOy - gaseous nitric acid (HNO3) and NOy - HNO3 -
   NO3-(p). Annular denuders coated with NaCl and PTFE filter were used as
   the scrubbers for HNO3 and NO3-(p), respectively. The transmission
   efficiency of coarse particles in the denuder was found to be 93.4 +/-
   5.8\%, so the loss of NO3-(p) to the denuder was within the uncertainty
   of the particulate nitrate analyzer (+/- 20\%). The measurements of NOy,
   HNO3, and NO3-(p) were conducted from March 15 to April 31, 2008, at
   Cape Hedo, Okinawa, Japan. Over 99.5\% of the observed concentrations of
   NO3-(p) for 10 min integration times were higher than the detection
   limit of the SD-CL method (0.18 mu g m(-3)). The least-squares fit of
   the R\&P nitrate monitor against the SD-CL method yielded a slope of
   0.67 +/- 0.02 and a correlation coefficient of R = 0.73. This result
   indicates that this method could also measure NO3-(p) when the diameter
   of aerosols was larger than 10 mu m. The SD-CL method was found to be
   useful as a measurement system for NO3-(p) in remote areas where coarse
   NO3-(p) dominates.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the development, modeling, and testing of a hybrid
   damper for semi-active suspension The goal of this study is to improve
   the performance of conventional passive oil dampers using a
   magneto-rheological (MR) accumulator that consists of a gas accumulator
   and an MR device The level of damping is continuously variable by means
   of control of the applied current in an MR device that is fitted to a
   floating piston that separates the gas and oil chamber A small MR device
   is used to resist the movement of the floating piston At first, a
   mathematical model that describes all flows within the damper is
   formulated and developed in Matlab/Simulink The MR device is also
   devised A mathematical model is adopted to characterize the performance
   of the device The formulas derived for the different components of the
   damper force are combined into a full damper model Then, the
   applicability of the MR device to a conventional passive oil damper is
   tested in a manufactured test environment and evaluated in terms of the
   damping force vs the piston velocity From the results, It is possible to
   ascertain the MF device's capability to work as a damper that can supply
   a variable damping force Moreover, this research affords a lot of new
   information about the applicability of MR devices and improvement of the

Abstract = {{Mathematical modeling and optimization of the extraction of nimbin from

   Sherwood number (Sh) as a function of Reynolds number (Re) and Schmidt
   number (Sc) was proposed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique. This
   correlation was compared to previous correlations and was found to give
   the most accurate results. Moreover, optimum conditions (temperature,
   pressure, solvent flow rate and particle diameter) which maximizes the
   extraction yield have been determined using GA. At the next step,
   methanol was used as a co-solvent and the dynamic equilibrium constant
   of solute between the solid phase and the solvent was estimated. By
   applying the new determined equilibrium constant, good agreement between
   the model and experimental data was observed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study is a case report and review of the literature. Spinal cord
   herniation is a rare, although increasingly recognized, cause of spinal
   cord dysfunction. It is due to an anterior dural defect, through which
   the spinal cord herniates. The purpose of this article is to report the
   authors' experience and to provide insight on clinical presentation and
   radiological signs to make the reader aware of this entity and then to
   prevent misdiagnosis. The authors conducted a retrospective review of
   patients who underwent surgery for spinal cord herniation at their
   institution between 2000 and 2008. Three patients were treated (all
   women) and the interval between the onset of symptoms and surgery ranged
   from 24 to 48 months. All patients had progressive signs of thoracic
   myelopathy, and two of them were initially misdiagnosed. In all cases,
   the herniation was reduced and the defect repaired using different
   methods. The results and complications of our cases were compared with
   that of the reported literature. According to the results in these cases
   and the review of the literature, the authors believe that spinal cord
   herniation should be treated by using a dural patch to close the dural
   defect and to prevent retethering of the spinal cord.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{An eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is presented that can
   accurately predict the stress intensity factors (SIFs) for thermoelastic
   cracks. The method uses higher order terms of the thermoelastic
   asymptotic crack tip fields to enrich the approximation space of the
   temperature and displacement fields in the vicinity of crack tips-away
   from the crack tip the step function is used. It is shown that improved
   accuracy is obtained by using the higher order crack tip enrichments and
   that the benefit of including such terms is greater for thermoelastic
   problems than for either purely elastic or steady state heat transfer
   problems. The computation of SIFs directly from the XFEM degrees of
   freedom and using the interaction integral is studied. Directly computed
   SIFs are shown to be significantly less accurate than those computed
   using the interaction integral. Furthermore, the numerical examples
   suggest that the directly computed SIFs do not converge to the exact
   SIFs values, but converge roughly to values near the exact result.
   Numerical simulations of straight cracks show that with the higher order
   enrichment scheme, the energy norm converges monotonically with
   increasing number of asymptotic enrichment terms and with decreasing
   element size. For curved crack there is no further increase in accuracy
   when more than four asymptotic enrichment terms are used and the
   numerical simulations indicate that the SIFs obtained directly from the
   XFEM degrees of freedom are inaccurate, while those obtained using the
   interaction integral remain accurate for small integration domains. It
   is recommended in general that at least four higher order terms of the
   asymptotic solution be used to enrich the temperature and displacement
   fields near the crack tips and that the J- or interaction integral
   should always be used to compute the SIFs.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new and innovative method is introduced for analyzing
   neutronic and thermal-hydraulic calculation. For this aim, VVR-S
   research reactor was selected, and the calculation procedure was
   performed for it. WIMS, CITATION and COBRA-EN codes were used for
   investigation. Calculation model consists of two sub-models: neutronic
   and thermo-hydraulic. The neutronic model uses WIMS and CITATION codes
   for neutronic simulation of the reactor core and calculating flux and
   power distribution over it. WIMS code simulates the fuel assemblies and
   CITATION models the core. The thermal-hydraulic model uses COBRA-EN code
   for performing the relative calculation. In this study. FORTRAN 90
   program is used for linking two sub-models and performing the
   calculation. The proposed procedure is performed for VVR-S analysis and
   finally, the obtained results are compared with the experimental results
   that show good agreement with it. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An appealing genome-wide association study design compares one large
   control group against several disease samples. A pioneering study by the
   Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium that employed such a design has
   identified multiple susceptibility regions, many of which have been
   independently replicated. While reusing a control sample provides
   effective utilization of data, it also creates correlation between
   association statistics across diseases. An observation of a large
   association statistic for one of the diseases may greatly increase
   chances of observing a spuriously large association for a different
   disease. Accounting for the correlation is also particularly important
   when screening for SNPs that might be involved in a set of diseases with
   overlapping etiology. We describe methods that correct association
   statistics for dependency due to shared controls, and we describe ways
   to obtain a measure of overall evidence and to combine association
   signals across multiple diseases. The methods we describe require no
   access to individual subject data, instead, they efficiently utilize
   information contained in P-values for association reported for
   individual diseases. P-value based combined tests for association are
   flexible and essentially as powerful as the approach based on
   aggregating the individual subject data. Genet. Epidemiol. 34:725-738,

Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis: Weakly acid refluxes seem to play an important
   role in the pathogenesis of extraesophageal reflux. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate how proportional representation of patients with
   extraesophageal reflux in a group of patients with globus pharyngeus
   changes when we use both pH <4.0 as well as pH <5.0 as a pathological
   threshold for an extraesophageal reflux episode.
   Study Design: Prospective pH monitoring study of 46 patients.
   Methods: Patients with pure globus pharyngeus lasting more than 3 months
   were included in the study. The pH monitoring was performed (Smit
   technique) with double probes (fixed distance of 15 cm). The recorded
   data using only pH <4.0 and using both pH <4.0 along with pH <5.0 as
   thresholds for extraesophageal reflux episode were analyzed
   simultaneously. The reflux area index 4 >6.3 and reflux area index 5
   >72.6 were considered as clear pathological extraesophageal reflux.
   Results: Extraesophageal reflux was proven in 23.9\% patients with pure
   globus pharyngeus when standard analysis using only pH <4.0 was used as
   pathological threshold. If both pH <4.0 and pH <5.0 were used as the
   pathological threshold, clear extraesophageal reflux was found in four
   more (8.7\%) patients.
   Conclusions: This study indicates the possible role of weakly acid
   extraesophageal reflux episodes in some patients with globus pharyngeus.
   Other studies on this issue, including the use of biological markers
   such as signs of inflammation, are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{In a continuing effort to develop novel beta-carbolines endowed with
   better insecticidal activity, a simple high-yielding method for the
   synthesis of harmine compounds starting from L-tryptophan has been
   developed and a series of 1,3-substituted beta-carboline derivatives
   have been synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicity against
   insect cultured Sf9 cell line in vitro and insecticidal activities
   against 4th instar larvae of mosquitos, Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus
   and mustard aphid, Lipaphis erysimi. The results demonstrated that
   1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid (compound
   2) and methyl 1-phenyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (compound 13)
   represented the best potential compounds, with Sf9 cells inhibition
   rates of 71.55\% and 60.21\% after 24 h treatment at concentrations of
   50-200 mg/L, respectively. Both compounds 2 and 13 also showed strong
   insecticidal activity towards 4th instar larvae of mosquitos with LC50
   values of 20.82 mg/L and 23.98 mg/L, and their LC90 values were 88.29
   mg/L and 295.13 mg/L, respectively. Furthermore, the LC50 values of
   compounds 2 and 13 against mustard aphids were 53.16 mg/L and 68.05
   mg/L, and their LC90 values were 240.10 mg/L and 418.63 mg/L after 48 h
   treatment. The in vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds was consistent
   with the insecticidal activity in vivo. The results indicated that the
   1- and 3-positions of the beta-carboline ring deserve further
   investigation to develop biorational insecticides based on the natural
   compound harmine as a lead compound.}},

Abstract = {{A social network is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows
   between individuals, groups, organizations, computers, websites, and
   other information/knowledge processing entities. The nodes in the
   network are the people and groups, while the links show relationships or
   flows between the nodes. Social networks provide both a visual and a
   mathematical analysis of relationships. Social network has been
   researched for a while. However, to our best knowledge,
   privacy-preserving social networks have not been well explored. In this
   paper, we would like to address how to build up a social network
   involving multiple parties. Data collection is a necessary step in the
   social-network-construction process. Due to privacy reasons, collecting
   data from different parties becomes difficult and these concerns may
   prevent the parties from directly sharing the data. How multiple parties
   collaboratively construct a social network without breaching data
   privacy presents a challenge. The objective of this paper is to provide
   a solution for privacy-preserving collaborative social-network problem.}},

Abstract = {{Superconducting quarter-wave resonators, due to their compactness and
   their convenient shape for tuning and coupling, are very attractive for
   low-beta beam acceleration. In this paper, two types of cavities with
   different geometry have been numerically simulated: the first type with
   larger capacitive load in the beam line and the second type of
   lollipop-shape for 100 MHz, beta=0.06 beams; then the relative
   electromagnetic parameters and geometric sizes have been compared. It is
   found that the second type, whose structural design is optimized with
   the conical stem and shaping drift-tube, can support the better
   accelerating performance. At the end of the paper, some structural
   deformation effects on frequency shifts and appropriate solutions have
   been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of barium content on the structural characteristics,

   BaxCe0.50Zr0.40Y0.10O3-delta (x = 0.95, 0.97, 1.00, 1.03, 1.05) is
   investigated. Compositions with barium deficiency show the presence of
   fluorite precipitate detected by powder X-ray diffraction, whilst pure
   perovskite phase is present for other samples. Barium deficiency
   promotes the densification process of the samples. The electrical
   conductivity of BaxCe0.5Zr0.40Y0.10O3-delta increases with barium
   content, which is mainly ascribed to the decreased activation energy due
   to the increasing lattice volume, especially for the case in wet 5\%
   H-2/Ar. The present results suggest that it is very important to control
   the stoichiometry of cations to obtain desirable perovskite type high

Abstract = {{X-ray diffraction has been widely used in analyzing Ca-Mg carbonates.
   Compositions of biogenic and inorganic (Ca,Mg)CO3 crystals are often
   calculated by comparing their d(104) values with published empirical
   curves. However, previous studies suggested that these curves do not
   apply to very high-Mg calcite and disordered dolomite. Based on
   synthesized high-Mg calcite and disordered dolomite, a new empirical
   curve between values of magnesian calcite d(104) and MgCO3 content in
   the calcite-disordered dolomite solid-solution series is constructed.
   This new curve is consistent with the significant cell parameter changes
   accompanying the Mg-Ca cation disorder in dolomite, and it can help the
   characterization of the MgCO3 content of both natural and synthetic
   magnesian calcite and disordered dolomite, especially for the mineral
   mixtures that are not suitable for other analysis methods.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade extensive studies have been focused on mechanical

   systematically investigated the mechanical properties of
   nano-alumina-filled E-54/4, 4-diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS) epoxy
   resins, which were prepared via combining high-speed mixing with
   three-roll milling. Homogeneous dispersion of nano-alumina with small
   agglomerates was obtained in epoxy resin, which was confirmed using
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The static/dynamic modulus,
   tensile strength and fracture toughness of the nanocomposites were found
   to be simultaneously enhanced with addition of nano-alumina fillers.
   About 50\% and 80\% increases of K-IC and G(IC) were achieved in
   nanocomposite filled with 18.4 wt\% alumina nanofillers, as compared to
   that of the unfilled epoxy resin. Furthermore, the corresponding
   fracture surfaces of tensile and compact tension samples were examined
   by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   techniques in order to identify the relevant fracture mechanisms
   involved. Various fracture features including cavities/debonding of
   nanofiller, local plastic deformation as well as crack
   pinning/deflection were found to be operative in the presence of

Abstract = {{Optimal blood levels of tacrolimus in transplant recipients are
   critically important to preserve the allograft. Suboptimal doses of the
   immunosuppressant can result in allograft toxicity or rejection. In the
   present study, we determined CYP3A5 genotypes of patients and analyzed
   their medical documents in 2 successive periods. In the first period, a
   fixed initial dosage of 0.1 mg/kg was prescribed daily for 28 patients
   regardless of their CYP3A5 genotype. In the second period, CYP3A5
   genotyping was performed with polymerase chain reaction-restriction
   fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing. The frequency
   distribution of CYP3A5 genotypes was 47.4\% (38/78) for {*}1/{*}3, 2.6\%
   (2/78) for {*}1/{*}1, and 50\% (39/78) for {*}3/{*}3. The patients with
   {*}1/{*}3 had shown significantly lower tacrolimus blood levels than
   those with the {*}3/{*}3 when the initial dose of 0.10 mg/kg was given
   for 2 weeks postoperatively. In the second period, initial dosages were
   selected according to individuals' CYP3A5 genotypes, 0.08 mg/kg/d for
   recipients with CYP3A5 {*}3/{*}3 and 0.15 mg/kg/d for recipients with
   {*}1/{*}3. Adjustment of the initial dosage of tacrolimus was documented
   to improve the proportion of patients achieving target drug blood levels
   in the early postoperative stage: from 46.7\% to 81.8\% of the {*}1/{*}3
   group and from 46.2\% to 73.1\% of the {*}3/{*}3 group on the third day.
   In conclusion, CYP3A5 polymorphism plays an important role in
   influencing tacrolimus blood levels. Initial tacrolimus dosage selection
   based on CYP3A5 genotyping can improve drug blood levels in the early
   stage following renal transplantation.}},

Title = {{Effect of simvastatin on collagen I deposition in non-infarcted
   myocardium: role of NF-kappa B and osteopontin}},

Abstract = {{The novel biological effect of statins in alleviating myocardium
   fibrosis following infarction has been increasingly recognized, yet the
   underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The purpose of this
   study was to characterize the effect of simvastatin on myocardial
   fibrosis and collagen I deposition in the non-infarcted region after
   myocardial infarction (MI) and to identify the role of NF-kappa B and
   osteopontin in simvastatin-mediated inhibition of post-MI collagen
   over-expression. A rat model of MI was generated by ligating the left
   anterior descending coronary artery. The rats surviving the MI operation
   were randomly divided into the following 3 groups: myocardial infarction
   (MI, vehicle), simvastatin (Sim, 30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), and pyrrolidine
   dithiocarbamate (PDTC, an inhibitor of NF-kappa B, 100
   mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). Four weeks after MI, cardiac function, mRNAs, and
   protein expression in non-infarcted myocardium were analyzed. Myocardial
   fibrosis and collagen I over-expression were observed following MI,
   accompanied by an increase of NF-kappa B and osteopontin. Simvastatin
   improved post-MI left ventricular dysfunction and ameliorated post-MI
   associated changes to several cardiac parameters, including the left
   ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), the maximal rate of pressure
   development (+dP/dt(max)), and the maximal rate of pressure decline
   (-dP/dt(max)). Concurrently, simvastatin significantly suppressed the
   over-expression of NF-kappa B, osteopontin, and collagen I in the
   non-infarcted region following MI. Inhibition of NF-kappa B by PDTC also
   reduced osteopontin over-expression and excessive collagen I production
   and improved the above functional myocardial parameters. These results
   show that post-MI myocardial fibrosis and collagen I over-expression in
   the non-infarcted region is associated with activation of NF-kappa B and
   osteopontin up-regulation. The anti-fibrotic effect of simvastatin
   following MI is associated with the attenuation of the expression of
   osteopontin and NF-kappa B. The inhibition of NF-kappa B activation
   could be the process upstream of osteopontin suppression in the
   simvastatin-mediated effect.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we implanted Schwann cells (SCs) transfected with
   Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene into rats with hemisection spinal cord injury,
   determined its effects on the repair of spinal cord injury and
   investigated the underlying mechanisms. Primary SCs were cultured,
   purified, and transfected with NRG1 gene. SCs and SCs transfected with
   NRG1 gene were implanted, respectively, into rats with hemisection
   spinal cord injury. Behavior, imaging, electrophysiology, and
   immuno-histological analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of
   NRG1 gene-transfected SCs on the repair of spinal cord injury. In vitro
   studies showed that NRG1 protein was highly expressed in SCs transfected
   with NRG1 gene. In addition, the receptors for NRG1, ErbB2, and ErbB4,
   were upregulated in a time-dependent manner. NRG1-transfected SCs
   secreted large amount of NRG1 proteins in vivo, which efficiently
   promoted the expression of ErbB2 and ErbB4 in the neurons and neuroglia
   cells. Moreover, the number of NSE- and GFAP-positive cells was
   increased. After cell transplantation, many transplanted cells survived
   and migrated to the areas with spinal cord injuries. The injuries were
   recovered in all the experimental groups, but the most significant
   recovery was observed in the group of rats implanted with SCs
   transfected with NRG1 gene. We conclude that NRG1-transfected SCs can
   significantly increase the effect on the repair of spinal cord injury.
   This repair effect is achieved via the upregulation of ErbB receptor in
   the target cells, increased proliferation of glial cells, and protection
   of neurons from apoptosis. Anat Rec, 293:1933- 1946, 2010. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{During the parasitological survey of cultured juvenile Pacific bluefin
   tuna (PBT) Thunnus orientalis in 2007 and 2008, two myxosporeans and one
   microsporidian were found. Morphological and molecular analysis showed
   that the heart-infecting and brain-infecting myxosporeans are identified
   as Kudoa shiomitsui and K. yasunagai, respectively. This is a new host
   record for both species. High prevalence of infection (77-100\%) with K.
   shiomitsui was observed in October to December (1-2 months post-transfer
   to sea cages), whereas only a few fish were infected with K. yasunagai.
   A microsporidian observed as white ``cysts{''} in the trunk muscle of
   PBT had a resemblance to Microsporidium seriolae, the causative parasite
   of beko disease in yellowtail. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the
   microsporidian from PBT is closely related to but distinct from several
   other muscle-infecting species such as M. seriolae, Microsporidium sp.
   RSB, and Microsporidium sp. SH. Additionally, the spore dimension (2.7 x
   1.5 mu m on average) was remarkably smaller than the others. These
   results suggest that the present microsporidian is an undescribed
   species and designated Microsporidium sp. PBT. Prevalence and intensity
   of infection with Microsporidium sp. PBT reached a maximum of 100\% and
   20 cysts/fish, respectively. Although pathogenic effects of the two
   Kudoa species on fish health remain unknown, the microsporidian could be
   of concern to PBT aquaculture due to unsightly cysts in the musculature,
   reducing the market value of the fish.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced ceramics require small amounts of cation dopants to improve the
   sintering process or achieve certain properties. Dopant precursors are
   often dissolved in initial processing liquids, which may adversely
   affect ceramic colloidal stability, and dopant transport during drying.
   This would lead to chemical and microstructural inhomogeniety in the
   eventual ceramics. Here we present a method that circumvents these
   problems using the example of Al3+-doped TiO2 ceramics. Homogeneous TiO2
   compacts with 34\% porosity are first prepared by colloidal casting and
   calcined at 700 degrees C. The obtained compacts are infiltrated with an
   aqueous solution of Al(NO3)(3), citric acid and ethylene glycol. The
   solution composition is adjusted such that during drying, a gel forms
   that covers the internal pore surface. Subsequent decomposition of
   organics results in a homogeneous dopant distribution in the porous and
   then dense-sintered TiO2 compacts. This is verified with SEM-EDX, and
   laser ablation coupled ICP-MS on dense compacts sintered at 1100 degrees

   yoghurt. The fraction of PCP4 (<3 kDa) exhibited the highest
   growth-promoting activity on the strains. The value of T-pH4.5 (time
   necessary to reach pH 4.5) of yoghurt fortified with PCP4 reduced from
   5.21 to 4.29 h, and the total counts of LAB present in the final
   products increased from 8.29 to 8.42 log CFU mL(-1) with the addition of
   PCP4 at nitrogen replaced ratio of 3\% (w/w). Moreover, the yoghurt
   exhibited lower postacidification power, higher viscosity and sensory
   evaluation scores than did the control product during storage period.}},

Title = {{Embryonic development of the internal anal sphincter in rats with

Abstract = {{Background/Purpose: The embryogenesis of the internal anal sphincter
   (IAS) in anorectal malformations (ARMs) remains unclear. This study
   aimed to investigate the development of the smooth muscle in the
   terminus of the digestive tract in normal and abnormal rats.
   Methods: Rat embryos with ARMs were generated by administration of
   ethylenethiourea to pregnant rats. The normal rat embryos and embryos
   with ARMs from E13.5 to E21 were serially sectioned in the sagittal
   plane and stained immunohistochemically using specific antibody to
   alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA). Temporospatial study was carried out on
   circular muscle of the distal portion of the hindgut.
   Results: alpha-Smooth muscle actin immunolabeling cells could not be
   observed in the hindgut on E13.5, E14, and E14.5. On E15, there were
   alpha-SMA immunolabeling circular muscle cells in the hindgut; and the
   distal portion of the circular muscle was not thickened in the normal
   and ARMs rats. From E16 onward, the smooth muscle with slight dilated
   terminus, which was characterized by the features of IAS, could be noted
   in the primitive anorectum. In the normal group, the circular muscle in
   the distal portion of the hindgut thickened slightly and became the
   musculature with shutter-like bundles. In the ARMs group, the alpha-SMA
   immunolabeling myogenic precursors of the smooth muscle could be
   observed in the primitive anorectum as well. The musculature was similar
   to that in the normal group. On E15 and E16, there was no significant
   difference in the development of the circular muscle in the 2 groups.
   Moreover, the terminus of the circular muscle in the hindgut did not
   reach the orificium fistulae in ARMs rats. From E17 onward, in ARMs
   rats, the funnel-shaped distal hindgut communicated the genitourinary
   tract with a narrow fistula; the dilated musculature at this portion
   thinned gradually and formed an acute angled extremity in the ARMs group
   rather than formed blunt extremity in the normal group; the terminus
   circular muscle in the dorsal hindgut reached the orificium fistulae.
   During the following gestational days, the circular muscle of the
   hindgut in both normal and ARMs rats continued its own tendency.
   Conclusion: The IAS primordium started to appear at the terminus of the
   hindgut on E15 in the 2 groups. The IAS in the ARMs group failed to
   develop as well as that in the normal group. The IAS dysplasia occurred
   in the late embryonic development (E17-E21). (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Chloromethylated poly(phthalazinone ether ketone) (CMPPEK) was prepared
   from poly(phthalazinone ether ketone), with chloromethyl methyl ether
   (CME) as the chlromethylating reagent and concentrated sulfuric acid as
   the solvent. The effects of CME quantity, reaction temperature, and
   reaction time on degree of chloromethylation (DCM) were investigated.
   CMPPEK with DCM ranging from 0.73 to 2.32 mmol g(-1) were obtained.
   CMPPEK were characterized with H-1 NMR and TGA. CMPPEK membranes were
   prepared from CMPPEK/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone casting solutions.
   Quaternized poly(phthalazinone ether ketone) (QAPPEK) anion exchange
   membranes were prepared from CMPPEK membranes with different DCM. The
   ion exchange capacity (IEC) and water content (Wc) of QAPPEK membranes
   were studied. QAPPEK membranes exhibited IEC ranging from 0.70 to 2.04
   mmol g(-1) and Wc ranging from 12.9 to 52.3\%. IEC and Wc of QAPPEK
   increased with an increase in DCM of CMPPEK. The vanadium ion
   permeability of QAPPEK membranes was much lower than that of Nafion117
   membrane. The performance of vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) single
   cell with QAPPEK membranes was investigated. Compare to VRB cell with
   Nafion117 membrane, the VRB single cell with QAPPEK membranes exhibited
   higher columbic efficiency. The results show that QAPPEK membranes could
   be promising anion exchange membranes for VRB applications. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{In this paper, the header ratio is defined as the ratio between the SEG
   Y header data volume and the SEG Y file size, a formula describing the
   relationship between the header ratio, the compression ratio of SEG Y
   header data and the compression ratio of the SEG Y file is derived It is
   discovered from the formula that the theoretical limit of the SEG Y file
   compression ratio is the quotient of the SEG Y header data compression
   ratio divided by the header ratio, therefore, it is necessary to
   compress the header data efficiently in order to get a high compression
   of the SEG Y file Furthermore, the statistical properties of the SEG Y
   reel header data and trace header data are analyzed An efficient
   lossless compression method for SEG Y header data, known as Header
   Identification Data Lossless Prediction Coding (HIDLPC) method, is
   proposed based on the statistical properties of the SEG Y header data
   Experimental results show that the lossless compression ratio by using
   HIDLPC to compress SEG Y header data is between 30 and 1000, much higher
   than the corresponding compression ratios by using Winzip and WinRAR}},

   Secretoneurin is a potential paracrine factor from lactotrophs

   September 1, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00407.2010.-Secretoneurin (SN) is
   a functional neuropeptide derived from the evolutionarily conserved part
   of precursor protein secretogranin II (SgII). In the time course study,
   SN (10 nM) stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) production and secretion
   after 6 h of static incubation of goldfish pituitary cells. Due to the
   existence of SN-immunoreactivity (SN-IR) in goldfish lactotrophs,
   endogenous SN might exert a paracrine effect on LH in the pituitary. In
   an in vitro immunoneutralization experiment, coincubation with anti-SN
   antiserum reduces the stimulatory effect of salmon
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone (sGnRH) on LH release by 64\%. Using
   Western blot analysis, we demonstrate that sGnRH significantly increases
   the expression of the major SgII-derived peptide (similar to 57 kDa,
   with SN-IR) and prolactin (PRL) after 12 h in the static culture of
   goldfish pituitary cells. Furthermore, there exists a significant
   correlation between the levels of these two proteins (R = 0.76, P =
   0.004). Another similar to 30 kDa SgII-derived peptide containing SN is
   only observed in sGnRH-treated pituitary cells. Consistent with the
   Western blot analysis results, real-time RT-PCR analysis shows that a
   12-h treatment with sGnRH induced 1.6-and 1.7-fold increments in SgII
   and PRL mRNA levels, respectively. SgII gene expression was also
   associated with PRL gene expression (R = 0.66; P = 0.02). PRL cells
   loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye, fura 2/AM, respond to sGnRH
   treatment with increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration level,
   suggesting a potential mechanism of GnRH on PRL cells and thus SgII
   processing and SN secretion. Taken together, endogenous
   lactotroph-generated SN, under the control of hypothalamic GnRH, exerts
   a paracrine action on neighboring gonadotrophs to stimulate LH release.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon nanowire (SiNW) arrays irradiated by energetic Si ions were
   fabricated by metal vapor vacuum arc (MEVVA) ion implantation method.
   Hetero-structure of amorphous/crystalline nanowire was formed in which
   structure of the implanted region on the top of the nanowires was
   amorphous while the structure of unimplanted region on the bottom
   remained crystal. Field emission (FE) properties of the SiNW arrays
   could be improved and modulated by different implantation doses. A low
   turn-on field of 4.63 V/mu m was observed in the SiNWs irradiated by 21
   keV Si ion with a dose of 7.86 x 10(16)/cm(2), and the applied field for
   the emission current density reaching 100 mu A/cm(2) is only 5.52 V/mu
   m. The main reason for the efficient emission is attributed to the
   formation of amorphous SiNWs and structure defects after implantation.
   The ion irradiated SiNWs after post-annealing at high temperature had
   better FE property due to eliminating the restrain effect to electrons.}},

Abstract = {{A high performance thermosetting epoxy resin crosslinkable at room
   temperature was obtained via directly moulding diglycidyl ether of
   bisphenol A (DGEBA) and flexible alpha,omega-bisamino(n-alkylene)phenyl

   inserted in aminophenyl of flexible amino-terminated polythers (ATPE) on
   the mechanical properties, fractographs and curing kinetics of the
   ATPE-DGEBA cured products were studied. The results show that the
   insertion of n-alkylene group into the aminophenyl group of the ATPE, on
   one hand, can significantly increase the strain relaxation rate and
   decrease glass transition temperature of the ATPE-DGEBA cured products,
   resulting in slight decrease of the Young's modulus and tensile
   strength, and significant increase of the toughness and elongation of
   the ATPE-DGEBA cured products. On the other hand, it can remarkably
   enhance the reactivity of amine with epoxy, much accelerating the curing
   rate of the ATPE-DGEBA systems. The activation energy of DGEBA cured by
   BAPTPE, BAMPTPE and BAEPTPE was 53.1, 28.5 and 25.4 kJ.mol(-1),
   respectively. The as-obtained ATPE-DGEBA cured products are homogeneous,
   transparent, and show excellent mechanical properties including tensile
   strength and toughness. Thus they are promising to have important
   applications in structure adhesives, casting bulk materials, functional
   coatings, cryogenic engineering, damping and sound absorbing materials.}},

Abstract = {{Statins improve left ventricular (LV) remodeling in spontaneously
   hypertensive rats (SHRs). This study was designed to investigate the
   effects of atorvastatin administered in the early stage on LV remodeling
   in SHRs, and to explore the underlying mechanisms.
   Sixteen male 8-week-old SHRs were randomized to receive distilled water
   (SHR-DW) or atorvastatin (SHR-ATV) for 12 weeks. Age-matched male
   Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats gavaged with distilled water served as controls.
   LV remodeling was evaluated, myocardial CTGF expression levels were
   detected using Western blotting, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was
   detected with the TUNEL method.
   Compared with WKY and SHR-DW, atorvastatin treatment significantly
   decreased systolic blood pressure in SHRs; atorvastatin significantly
   inhibited LV remodeling, as indicated by the reduced LV weight/body
   weight ratio (SHR-ATV: 4.0 +/- 0.4 versus SHR-DW: 4.7 +/- 0.4 mg/g, P <
   0.05), cardiomyocyte diameter (SHR-ATV: 16.2 +/- 2.8 versus SHR-DW: 19.0
   +/- 1.0 mu m, P < 0.05), and interstitial fibrosis (SHR-ATV: 3.3 +/- 2.1
   versus SHR-DW: 4.5 +/- 1.8\%, P < 0.05). Compared with WKY, myocardial
   CTGF expression was significantly increased and cardiomyocyte apoptosis
   decreased in SHRs. Compared with the SHR-DW group, atorvastatin
   treatment significantly inhibited myocardial CTGF expression (SHR-ATV:
   0.69 +/- 0.21 versus SHR-DW: 1.12 +/- 0.27, P < 0.05) and induced
   cardiomyocyte apoptosis in SHRs (SHR-ATV: 5.2 +/- 0.6 versus SHR-DW: 1.9
   +/- 0.3\%, P < 0.05).
   The results indicate that early-stage administration of atorvastatin
   effectively prevented LV remodeling in SHRs, and that inhibition of
   myocardial CTGF expression and induction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis may
   be the underlying mechanisms. (Int Heart J 2010; 51: 426-431)}},

Title = {{A Prospective, Randomised Trial Comparing Plasmakinetic Enucleation to
   Standard Transurethral Resection of the Prostate for Symptomatic Benign
   Prostatic Hyperplasia: Three-year Follow-up Results}},

Abstract = {{Background: Plasmakinetic enucleation of the prostate (PKEP) has
   recently been proved a safe and technically feasible procedure for
   benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, its long-term safety,
   efficacy, and durability in comparison with the gold-standard
   transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) have not yet been
   reported.
   Objective: To report the 3-yr follow-up results of a prospective,
   randomised clinical trial comparing PKEP with standard TURP for
   symptomatic BPH.
   Design, setting, and participants: A total of 204 patients with bladder
   outflow obstruction (BOO) secondary to BPH were prospectively randomised
   1: 1 into either the PKEP group or the TURP group.
   Intervention: The patients in each group underwent the procedure
   accordingly.
   Measurements: All patients were assessed perioperatively and followed at
   1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 mo postoperatively. The preoperative and
   postoperative parameters included International Prostate Symptom Score
   (IPSS), quality of life (QoL) scores, the International Index of
   Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, maximum urinary flow rates
   (Q(max)), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-assessed prostate volume,
   postvoid residual urine (PVRU) volume, and serum prostate-specific
   antigen (PSA) level. Patient baseline characteristics, perioperative
   data, and postoperative outcomes were compared. All complications were
   recorded.
   Results and limitations: PKEP was significantly superior to TURP in
   terms of the drop in haemoglobin (0.74 +/- 0.33 g/dl vs 1.88 +/- 1.06
   g/dl; p < 0.001), intraoperative irrigation volume (11.7 +/- 4.5 l vs
   15.4 +/- 6.2 l; p < 0.001), postoperative irrigation volume and time
   (18.5 +/- 7.6 l vs. 30.0 +/- 11.4 l and 16.6 +/- 5.2 h vs 25.3 +/- 8.5
   h; all p < 0.001), recovery room stay (67.3 +/- 11.1 min vs 82.0 +/-
   16.4 min; p < 0.001), catheterisation time (51.7 +/- 26.3 h vs 80.5 +/-
   31.6 h; p < 0.001), hospital stay (98.4 +/- 20.4 h vs 134.2 +/- 31.5 h;
   p < 0.001), and resected tissue (56.4 +/- 12.8 g vs 43.8 +/- 15.5 g; p <
   0.001). There were no statistical differences in operation time and
   sexual function between the two groups. At 36 mo postoperatively, the
   PKEP group had a maintained and statistically significant improvement in
   IPSS (2.4 +/- 2.2 vs 4.3 +/- 2.9; p < 0.001), QoL (0.6 +/- 0.5 vs 1.6
   +/- 1.4; p < 0.001), Q(max) (28.8 +/- 10.1 ml/s vs 25.1 +/- 8.0 ml/s; p
   = 0.017), and TRUS volume (21.0 +/- 7.3 ml vs 26.4 +/- 6.8 ml; p <
   0.001), with urodynamically proven deobstruction (Schafer grade 0.2 +/-
   0.02 vs 0.8 +/- 0.1; p < 0.001). More extensive clinical trials are
   required to validate these results.
   Conclusions: PKEP is a safe and highly effective technique for relieving
   BOO. At 3-yr follow-up, the clinical efficacy of PKEP is durable and
   compares favourably with TURP. (C) 2010 European Association of Urology.

Abstract = {{To study the effect of NS1 eIF4GI binding domain on virulence and
   pathogenicity of H5N1 influenza A virus, 5 recombinant H5N1 viruses
   encoding eIF4GI binding domain-truncated NS1 proteins and parental NS1
   (NS1-wt) were generated by an 8-plasmid-based reverse genetics system.
   The results indicated that the recombinants with the addition of 5-amino
   acid and the deletion position of 85-89 in NS1-wt were attenuated in
   replication in vitro and in vivo, compared with the recombinant
   wild-type virus rNS1-wt, whereas the deletion position 85-94 or the
   entire eIF4GI binding domain in NS1-wt displayed a significantly
   attenuated phenotype in chicken and mice. We also showed that the eIF4GI
   binding domain-truncated mutants were impaired in their ability to
   inhibit interferon production in vitro, and they did not replicate as
   efficiently as the parental recombinant strain in embryonated hen eggs,
   in Madin -Darby Canine Kidney cells, or in vivo in chickens and in a
   mouse model. Therefore, these attenuated NS1-truncated viruses may have
   a great potential as live attenuated vaccine candidates against H5N1
   influenza A virus.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{The experiments are carried out to study the transient heat transfer
   characteristics of a minichannel heat sink under high heat flux density
   that varies from 150 W/cm(2) to 200 W/cm(2), in an enclosed loop. The
   heat flux is supplied by the ethyne flame. The average rate of the
   cooling water is from 1.00 m/s to 1.86 m/s. The temperature rise of the
   heated surface and the temperature rise of the cooling water are
   measured. The results show that the temperature rise of the heated top
   surface rises quickly at the startup period of heating, and then
   increases slowly. The variation of the top surface temperature is
   similar to the voltage in the RC circuit. The surface temperature is a
   function of thermal resistance and thermal capacity of the heat sink.
   The temperature of the cooling water at outlet also rises quickly at the
   startup period of heating, and then becomes stable. The temperature
   increases are related to the heat flux density and the rate of the
   cooling water. There is a time delay between the temperature rise of the
   inlet cooling water and the startup of heating. This delay is related to
   the length of the enclosed loop and the rate of the cooling water. The
   pressure drop across the heat sink decreases slightly with time at high
   heat flux since the water viscosity reduces with the increasing
   temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Similar to the substitution of Ba or Sr for calcium, the substitution of
   La for praseodymium in Pr1-xCaxMnO3 (x=0.5 and 0.4) can also induce
   ferromagnetism and sharp magnetisation multisteps at low temperature.
   The La substitution is more efficient to facilitate these magnetic
   phenomena in Pr0.6Ca0.4MnO3 than in charge exchange type manganite
   Pr0.5Ca0.5MnO3 due to the fact that the pseudo-charge exchange type
   orbital charge ordered structure in the former system is easier to be
   collapsed. More importantly, by comparing the magnetic properties of
   Pr0.6-xLaxCa0.4MnO3 with those of Pr(0.6)Ca(0.4-x)A(x)MnO(3) (A=Ba, Sr),
   the crucial role of the A site impurity size on the magnetic phenomena
   is emphasised. The Ba substitution exhibits a greater ability to induce
   such magnetic phenomena than the Sr substitution, and the ability of the
   latter is greater than that of the La substitution. This sequence is in
   agreement with that of their ionic size, i.e. Ba2+>Sr2+>La3+. Combining
   the `counterdistortion' effect due to the introduction of larger size
   impurities on A sites with the martensitic-like model, the experimental
   results have been systematically discussed.}},

Abstract = {{It has been observed that finite element based solutions of full-wave
   Maxwell's equations break down at low frequencies. In this paper, we
   present a theoretically rigorous method to fundamentally eliminate the
   low-frequency breakdown problem. The key idea of this method is that the
   original frequency-dependent deterministic problem can be rigorously
   solved from a generalized eigenvalue problem that is frequency
   independent. In addition, we found that the zero eigenvalues of the
   generalized eigenvalue problem cannot be obtained as zeros because of
   finite machine precision. We hence correct the inexact zero eigenvalues
   to be exact zeros. The validity and accuracy of the proposed method have
   been demonstrated by the analysis of both lossless and lossy problems
   having on-chip circuit dimensions from dc to high frequencies. The
   proposed method is applicable to any frequency. Hence it constitutes a
   universal solution of Maxwell's equations in a full electromagnetic
   spectrum. The proposed method can be used to not only fundamentally
   eliminate the low-frequency breakdown problem, but also benchmark the
   accuracy of existing electromagnetic solvers at low frequencies
   including static solvers. Such a benchmark does not exist yet because
   full-wave solvers break down while static solvers involve theoretical
   approximations.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we successfully conjugated galactosylated poly(ethylene

   growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) mRNA were conjugated to Gal-PEG and

   transfection into HepG2 and HSC-T6 cells. The disulfide bond between PEG
   and siRNA was cleaved by dithiothreitol, leading to the release of
   intact siRNA. Both Gal-PEG-siRNA and M6P-PEG-siRNA conjugates could
   silence luciferase gene expression by about 40\% without any
   transfection reagents, while the gene silencing effects reached more
   than 98\% with the help of cationic liposomes at the same dose.
   Conjugation of TGF-beta 1 siRNA with Gal-PEG and M6P-PEG could silence
   endogenous TGF-beta 1 gene expression as well. In conclusion, these
   siRNA conjugates have the potential for targeted delivery of siRNAs to
   hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells for efficient gene silencing in
   vivo.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper studies the effects of shaft rub on a rotating system's
   vibration response with emphasis on heat generation at the contact
   point. A 3D heat transfer code, coupled to a 3D vibration code, was
   developed to predict the dynamic response of a rotor in the time domain.
   The shaft bow is represented by an equivalent bending moment and the
   contact forces by rotating external forces. The seal ring is modeled as
   a linear spring, which exerts a normal force to the rotor. The
   tangential force is then calculated as the product of the normal force
   with the friction coefficient. Stable or unstable spiraling and
   oscillating modes were seen to occur in well defined shaft speed zones.
   In the main, for the configurations studied, the shaft vibration was
   found to be unstable for speeds below the first critical speed and
   stable for speeds above the first critical speed. Limit cycle behavior
   was observed when the phase angle between the unbalance force and the
   response was around 90 deg. The vibration behavior with rub during
   startup and shutdown was studied by considering the effects of
   acceleration/deceleration rate, friction coefficient, and mass
   unbalance. It was found that friction coefficient and increasing mass
   unbalance amplified the rub effects while acceleration/deceleration rate
   reduced it.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To determine the pharmacokinetics of DL-alpha-lipoic acid in

   Animals-27 clinically normal Beagles.
   Procedures-In a 3 X 3 factorial Latin square design, 3 dosages (2.5,
   12.5, and 25 mg/kg) of DL-alpha-lipoic acid were administered orally in
   a capsule form and provided without a meal, in a capsule form and
   provided with a meal, and as an ingredient included in an extruded dog
   food. Food was withheld for 12 hours prior to DL-alpha-lipoic acid
   administration. Blood samples were collected before (0 minutes) and at
   15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes after administration. Plasma
   concentrations of DL-alpha-lipoic acid were determined via
   high-performance liquid chromatography. A generalized linear models
   procedure was used to evaluate the effects of method of delivery and
   dosage. Noncompartmental analysis was used to determine pharmacokinetic
   parameters of DL-alpha-lipoic acid. Nonparametric tests were used to
   detect significant differences between pharmacokinetic parameters among
   treatment groups.
   Results-A significant effect of dosage was observed regardless of
   delivery method. Method of delivery also significantly affected plasma
   concentrations of DL-alpha-lipoic acid, with extruded foods resulting in
   lowest concentration for each dosage administered. Maximum plasma
   concentration was significantly affected by method of delivery at each
   dosage administered. Other significant changes in pharmacokinetic
   parameters were variable and dependent on dosage and method of delivery.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Values for pharmacokinetic parameters

Abstract = {{The Stefan-number is one out of the multitude of dimensionless numbers
   which predominantly are used in chemical engineering or heat and mass
   transfer problems. It relates sensible heat to latent heat and is a key
   number in solving the problem of heat transfer during solidification or
   melting.
   However, numbers similar to this show up also when several thermodynamic
   problems or relationships in refrigeration engineering are analyzed.
   Using the Stefan-number it can be distinguished if a refrigerant
   superheats or condenses during compression, it gives the size of the
   throttling loss, and it helps to decide if a suction line heat exchanger
   is beneficial or not. For absorption heat pumping, it allows to quantify
   the most important loss mechanism, the solution heat exchanger loss. Of
   course, all this information can be acquired in different ways and maybe
   in more precise ways - also, but at least for teaching the basics of
   refrigeration the Stefan-number is simple to use and very easy to
   understand. In this paper, the different ways of how to use the
   Stefan-number in teaching and understanding thermodynamics of
   refrigerants are presented. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights

Abstract = {{Corticosteroid insufficiency may occur among critically ill patients,
   but the diagnosis remains controversial. Historically assessment of free
   cortisol (FC) by means of equilibrium dialysis (ED) has required large
   blood volumes and prolonged fractionation time preceding analysis. We
   hypothesized that temperature-controlled centrifugal ultrafiltration
   with chemiluminescence immunoassay (CU/CI) would provide real-time FC
   data that highly correlated with ED/radioimmunoassay (ED/RI) or liquid
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) techniques.
   We quantified and correlated baseline and corticotropin-stimulated TC
   and FC by means of CU/CI, ED/RI, and LC/MS among healthy adults and 37
   critically ill children.
   Among critically ill children, FC was three- to fivefold higher than the
   healthy adults at baseline and increased another five- to eightfold
   following corticotropin administration. While TC increased approximately
   twofold following corticotropin administration, FC increased on average
   more than eightfold. Serum FC per CU/CI highly correlated with FC per
   ED/RI or LC/MS, but results were available in a fraction of the time.
   Children failing to increase TC by > 9.0 mu g/dL (248 nM) following
   corticotropin demonstrated an appropriate FC increase. Nearly 50\% of
   critically ill children exhibited FC < 2.0 mu g/dL (55 nM). Neither FC
   nor TC concentrations correlated significantly with measures of illness
   severity.
   Quantification of FC utilizing CU/CI was fast (1-2 h) and results

Title = {{EEG spectral power and negative symptoms in at-risk individuals predict

Abstract = {{Introduction: EEG power in the delta, theta and betal bands has been
   shown to be positively correlated with negative symptoms in first
   episode psychotic patients. The present study investigates this
   correlation in an ``at risk mental state for psychosis{''} (ARMS) with
   the aim to improve prediction of transition to psychosis.
   Methods: Thirteen ARMS patients with later transition to psychosis
   (ARMS-T) and fifteen without (follow-up period of at least 4 years)
   (ARMS-NT) were investigated using spectral resting EEG data (of 8
   electrodes over the fronto-central scalp area placed according to the
   10-20 system) and summary score of the Scale for the Assessment of
   Negative Symptoms (SANS). Linear regressions were used to evaluate the
   correlation of SANS and EEG power in seven bands (delta, theta, alphal,
   alpha2, betal, beta2, beta3) in both ARMS groups and logistic
   regressions were used to predict transition to psychosis. Potentially
   confounding factors were controlled.
   Results: ARMS-T and ARMS-NT showed differential correlations of EEG
   power and SANS in delta, theta, and beta1 bands (p<.05): ARMS-T showed
   positive and ARMS-NT negative correlations. Logistic regressions showed
   that neither SANS score nor EEG spectral power alone predicted
   transition to psychosis. However. SANS score in combination with power
   in the delta, theta, betal, and beta2 bands, respectively, predicted
   transition significantly (p<.03).
   Conclusions: ARMS-T and ARMS-NT show differential correlations of SANS
   summary score and EEG power in delta, theta, and beta bands. Prediction
   of transition to psychosis is possible using combined information from a
   negative symptom scale and EEG spectral data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Regular observations of atmospheric mixing ratios of CO2 and CH4,
   combined with sodar measurements of the mixing layer height in the lower
   troposphere were used to assess night-time surface fluxes of these gases
   in the urban environment (Krakow, southern Poland). The measurements
   performed over the 4-yr period (May 2005-May 2009) revealed a distinct
   seasonality of surface night-time fluxes of CO2, with the minimum of ca.
   2 mmol m-2 h-1 during winter months and the maximum of ca. 20 mmol m-2
   h-1 observed during summer months. The observed seasonality was induced
   by the biospheric component (soil respiration) which dominates the
   measured surface CO2 fluxes during summer months. The surface fluxes of
   CH4 scatter between ca. 50 and 200 mu mol m-2 h-1, without clear
   seasonal trend. Significant flux of CH4 into the atmosphere (mean value
   over the whole observation period equal to ca. 97 mu mol m-2 h-1),
   indicates a presence of relatively strong methane source on the
   investigated area. This source is linked to methane leakages from the
   city gas distribution network.}},

   by changing the S/Se feed molar ratio. As a result of the reactivity
   difference between Se and S precursors, the nanorods have a core/shell

Abstract = {{The electrical resistivity of the liquid Sb-10 wt-\%Cu alloy as a
   function of temperature was measured using direct current four probe
   technique. In a relatively high temperature zone above the liquidus, the
   resistivity-temperature (rho-T) curves of the melt change abnormally;
   moreover, the changing pattern in the first heating process is
   completely different from the ones in the subsequent heating and cooling
   cycles. Since resistivity is a structural sensitive parameter, these
   abnormal changes of rho-T curves indicate that the temperature-induced
   liquid-liquid structure transitions (L-LSTs) probably occur in Sb-10
   wt-\%Cu melt, with some reversible characters. To explore the effects of
   the L-LST on the solidification behaviours and solidified
   microstructures of this alloy, solidification experiments were further
   carried out according to the temperature ranges with anomalous changes
   on rho-T curves. Results show that after the melt experienced the L-LST,
   larger undercooling, shorter solidified time and much finer
   microstructures with differently microscopic patterns could be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{We report on magnetic properties and X-band electron spin resonance
   (ESR) study (80-430 K) of diluted magnetic semiconductors Ge1-xMnxTe
   (x=0.07-0.44) revealing ferromagnetism with the Curie temperature
   achieving 90 K. Effective magnetic moment p(eff) per Mn2+ ion estimated
   from the Curie constant in the range 0.15 <= x <= 0.26 increases from
   2.27 to 2.95 mu(B). The temperature evolution of ESR spectra was found
   to have a complicated character. We observed the presence of two
   distinct absorption lines of Dysonian type, associated with two
   resonance centers in these diluted magnetic semiconductors. Possible
   origin of these two lines has been analyzed and clustering effect was
   proposed to be most likely responsible for anomalous behavior. Anomalies
   in temperature dependencies of the linewidths and g-factors were
   observed at temperatures lower than 160 K. We connect these anomalies
   with magnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of transition to
   ferromagnetic phases. The anomalous broadening of the linewidth in
   paramagnetic region occurs with decreasing of the temperature similarly
   to ESR behavior of related A (MnB6)-Mn-2 diluted magnetic
   semiconductors. This broadening is satisfactorily described in the
   framework of modified Huber's theory. At the same time, the g-factor is
   essentially independent on both temperature and alloy composition.
   Average values of effective g-factor for two resolved spectral
   components at room temperature were found to be g(1)=2.02-2.07 and
   g(2)approximate to 1.99. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Over the last several years, there has been considerable interest in
   evaluating the biological relevance of alterations in blood-borne
   microparticle populations. The most commonly employed technique for the
   characterization of microparticles is light scatter flow cytometry.
   However, the enumeration and sizing of submicron particles based on
   light scattering properties can be problematic. Impedance-based flow
   cytometry based on the Coulter principle offers a sensitive methodology
   to characterize microparticles. This review details the rationale for
   employing impedance-based flow cytometry in the measurement of
   blood-borne microparticles.}},

Title = {{The localization of two mimic epitopes of lipopolysaccharide binding
   protein and the preparation of their tandem multiple antigen peptide}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{362}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To screen and identify two mimic epitopes in the inflammatory
   site of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and to synthesize and
   purify their corresponding mimic epitope four branched peptide (multiple
   antigen peptide, MAP).
   Method: Using an anti-full length LBP monoclonal antibody as the target
   molecule, the amino acid sequences of the exogenous peptides were
   deduced by combining several different techniques including: affinity
   screening of the phage display peptide library, the lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS) binding activity assay and competitive inhibition test, cytokine
   production inhibition, flow cytometry, and DNA sequencing. Basic Local
   Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) software was used to compare the resulting
   peptide sequences with the primary structure sequence of the LBP
   molecule, and thus the amino acid sequences for two mimic inflammatory
   epitopes for the binding of LBP and LPS were determined. Additionally,
   the two target sequences were coupled, and the
   9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC) solid-phase synthesis method was
   used to synthesize the 24aa peptide. The design program of the multiple
   antigen peptide (MAP) was used to couple the four tandem peptides with
   lysine as the core base to produce the branch like structure, and thus,
   the four branched peptide was synthesized and purified.
   Results: Fourteen phage clones (C) with competitive LPS binding activity
   with LBP were successfully obtained. Among these, the amino acid
   sequences of the peptides in C2, C19, C57, C77, C85 and C91 showed a
   homology of more than 90\% to the primary structure of LBP. However, the
   amino acid sequences of C29 and C90, WKAQKRFMKKSG and LKTRKLFWKYKD,
   respectively, did not show homology to the primary structure of LBP,
   which were determined to be mimic epitopes of the inflammatory sites in
   LBP. Further synthesis of the 24aa peptide using FMOC solid-phase
   synthesis and MAP modification were carried out, the four branched
   peptide was synthesized and purified, and the purity was found to be
   higher than 95\%. The purified peptide was subjected to mass
   spectrometry analysis and amino acid analysis, and its molecular weight
   (3102.77 kDa) and amino acid composition were in accordance with
   theoretical values.
   Conclusion: The amino acid sequence for two mimic epitopes of the
   inflammatory site of LBP were determined to be WKAQKRFMKKSG and
   LKTRKLFWKYKD. The MAP was successfully prepared simultaneously and is
   able to be used as the core antigen protein for the formulation of
   vaccines. This knowledge will help in future investigations of the
   functional characteristics of LBP protein, and enhance exploration into
   new pathways for the prevention and treatment of LPS inflammatory
   diseases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Different salmon leucocyte subpopulations were identified by
   immunostaining using rabbit antiserum raised against the salmonid cell
   line TO derived from head kidney leucocytes in combination with other
   available immunoglobulins. The rabbit anti-TO cell line serum
   immunostained all isolated leucocytes from head kidney, peripheral blood
   and spleen, as shown by analyses of these leucocytes by flow cytometry
   and by fluorescence microscopy. In cytospin preparations, the staining
   of salmon leucocytes using rabbit anti-TO serum as the primary antibody
   revealed greater morphological details compared to conventional staining
   procedures, especially among isolated spleen leucocytes where cells with
   a morphology usually limited to dendritic cells were seen. Other cells
   of various shapes and protrusions were also stained although the anti-TO
   serum did not stain protrusions on all cell types. Among the
   immunoglobulin positive cells, the thin protrusions were only seen when
   immunostained using anti-IgM antibody. The same was observed for
   neutrophils stained using the monoclonal E3D9 antibody. The double
   staining of cells using rabbit anti-TO serum and monoclonal antibodies
   specific for IgM positive cells or neutrophils clearly show how the
   morphology of these cells can be compared with the rest of the leucocyte
   population. The staining of salmon leucocytes by antiserum to a salmon
   leucocyte cell line TO provides a tool for staining the total population
   of salmon immune cells, and can be used in immunofluorescence or
   confocal microscopy in combinations with labelling of cellular
   components or pathogens. The detailed morphological characteristics,
   such as cell protrusions, visualized by the presented staining have not
   been observed on fish leucocytes by conventional cell staining

Title = {{S100A proteins in the pathogenesis of experimental corneal
   neovascularization}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{237-38}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The S100A protein family is involved in various inflammatory
   processes. Two of its members, S100A4 and A13, are thought to be
   pro-angiogenic in tumor development. This study examines whether S100A
   proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation-associated
   corneal neovascularization (CorNV).
   Methods: We used 10-0 nylon suture- (S) or chemical burn (CB) -induced
   CorNV models for a microarray analysis of the genome-wide expression
   pattern. At different time points after suturing, we conducted
   histopathological examinations to detect the infiltration of
   inflammatory cells into the corneal stroma. Representative members of
   the S100A family (S100A4, S100A6, S100A8, S100A9, and S100A13),
   pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, transforming growth factor
   beta 1, and MIP-2), and pro-angiogenic factors (fibroblast growth factor
   and vascular endothelial growth factor) were detected with
   reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR). We used
   immunofluorescence to monitor neutrophil or macrophage infiltration and
   S100A8 or S100A9 protein deposition in neovascularized corneas.
   Antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion or S100A8 depletion in mice was
   performed to evaluate the role of neutrophils and S100A proteins in
   suture-induced corneal neovascularization (S-CorNV).
   Results: Microarray profiling revealed that S100A4, S100A6, S100A8,
   S100A9, and S100A13 were upregulated in both CorNV models, with S100A8
   and S100A9 manifesting the most significant changes compared to the
   normal animals. An RT-QPCR assay of these S100A genes and cytokine genes
   in the S-CorNV corneas showed that the changes were time-dependent,
   reaching the apex at day 5. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated
   that neutrophils and macrophages produce S100A8 and S100A9. The
   depletion of neutrophils beginning one day before S-CorNV induction
   decreased disease severity and S100A8/S100A9 deposition in the
   neovascularized corneas. The extent of upregulation of other detected
   S100A genes and pro-inflammatory or pro-angiogenic genes was also
   decreased by neutrophil depletion. Subconjunctival administration of
   S100A8 antibodies also significantly inhibited the growth of vessels and
   inflammation in the S-CorNV model.
   Conclusions: We determined that S100A proteins are involved in the
   inflammatory CorNV model and that S100A8 or S100A9 in particular might
   be employed as targets in managing diseases involving this pathological
   process.}},

Abstract = {{C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is expressed in several human tissues.
   We designed a specific processing-independent assay for proCNP-derived
   products and quantitated the concentrations in human seminal plasma from
   normal and vasectomized men. Antibodies were raised against the
   N-terminus of human proCNP 11-27. Samples were incubated with trypsin
   prior to immunoassay, which allows for the measurement of ``total{''}
   proCNP irrespective of the degree of post-translational processing.
   Seminal plasma from normal young men and vasectomized men were collected
   and quantitated; the molecular heterogeneity was evaluated by gel
   chromatography. The antiserum displayed high binding affinity.
   Preanalytical trypsin treatment fully exposed the proCNP 11-27 epitope
   detected by the antiserum. Seminal plasma from healthy men (n = 120)
   contained similar to 8-fold higher proCNP concentrations compared to
   blood plasma (range 104-933 pmol/L, age 18-25 years); gel chromatography
   suggested the presence of several molecular forms. Parameters associated
   to male fertility, proCNP concentrations in blood plasma and time of
   abstinence did not correlate to the seminal proCNP concentrations.
   Measurement in vasectomized men disclosed seminal proCNP concentrations
   similar to non-vasectomized men (range 107-705 pmol/L, age 34-44 years).
   Taken together, our new proCNP assay shows that proCNP is abundantly
   present in human seminal plasma and that seminal proCNP is secreted from
   the prostate gland and/or the seminal vesicles. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{As with many other anti-cancer agents, docetaxel is a substrate for
   ATP-binding cassette transporters such as P-glycoprotein and its
   metabolism is mainly catalysed by CYP3A. In order to improve the oral
   bioavailability of docetaxel, a component of turmeric, curcumin, which
   can down-regulate the intestinal P-glycoprotein and CYP3A protein
   levels, was used for the pre-treatment of rats before the oral
   administration of docetaxel. Curcumin (100 mg/kg) did not significantly
   modify the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel when given orally 30 min before
   the administration of docetaxel. However, the C-max of docetaxel in rats
   pre-treated with curcumin for four consecutive days was significantly
   increased (p < 0.01) by about 10 times compared to that of the docetaxel
   control, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)
   was about eight times higher than that of the control. Consequently, the
   absolute bioavailability of docetaxel in the treatment group (four days
   of curcumin at 100 mg/kg) was about 40\%, which was a significant
   increase of about eightfold in comparison to the control value. Thus,
   the oral bioavailability of docetaxel was enhanced by the
   co-administration of regular curcumin. It could be possible to
   administer docetaxel orally, besides the established iv. route. Crown

Abstract = {{Myricetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid known for its anti-neoplasm
   anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects Currently potential analgesic
   effects are proposed for several animal models of acute and chronic pain
   Pilot studies show a flavonoid-induced modulation of intracellular
   mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) as p38 and interactions with
   voltage activated potassium channel currents (I-K(v)) The aim of this
   study was to investigate the underlying modulation of I-K(v) and the
   influence of MAPK phosphorylation in an in vitro cell model
   Whole cell patch-clamp recordings of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons
   were performed and IK(v) isolated I-K(V) were concentration-dependently
   reduced by myricetin (1-75 mu M myricetin reduction range 18-78\%) with
   no voltage dependency (-80 to +60 mV) The reduction of I-K(V) was
   enhanced by blocking p38 with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (40 +/- 20\%
   without SB203580 vs 62 +/- 5\% with 5 mu M SB203580 or 83 +/- 7\% with
   10 mu M SB203580) but abolished by activation of p38 using anisomycin
   (40 +/- 20\% without anisomycm vs 0 73 +/- 17\% with 5 mu M anisomycin)
   We conclude that myricetin reduces IK(v) by p38 dependent mechanisms in
   sensory neurons Since a reduction of I-K(V) rather increases neuronal
   excitability it is unlikely that this effect of myricetin contributes to
   its analgesic effects (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present paper is to recommend a methodology for the
   thermal comfort investigations of resting places (parks and squares) in
   urban environments. During three periods (three times 14 weekdays in
   transient seasons) 6775 visitors were mapped in half-hour intervals
   between 12 and 3 p.m. on a park in the inner city of Szeged (South-East
   Hungary). Besides marking the subjects' exact locations, some of their
   personal features were also noticed in table format. Physiologically
   equivalent temperature (degrees C) was calculated from the
   meteorological data measured by the site, to describe the thermal
   conditions of the measurement intervals. To reveal patterns of area
   usage according to thermal conditions, the observations data were
   digitized and processed within GIS application ArcView. The created area
   usage maps clearly illustrate the temporarily differences of attendance
   (on seasonally and daily basis too). These maps facilitate detection of
   preferred and ignored sub-areas in the function of thermal conditions
   (or any of the recorded subjective or measured objective parameters).
   The usefulness of these maps in practice, as well as the
   extension-possibilities of the presented methodology are also discussed.

Title = {{Potential pitfalls in MitoChip detected tumor-specific somatic
   mutations: a call for caution when interpreting patient data}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several investigators have employed high throughput
   mitochondrial sequencing array (MitoChip) in clinical studies to search
   mtDNA for markers linked to cancers. In consequence, a host of somatic
   mtDNA mutations have been identified as linked to different types of
   cancers. However, closer examination of these data show that there are a
   number of potential pitfalls in the detection tumor-specific somatic
   mutations in clinical case studies, thus urging caution in the
   interpretation of mtDNA data to the patients. This study examined
   mitochondrial sequence variants demonstrated in cancer patients, and
   assessed the reliability of using detected patterns of polymorphisms in
   the early diagnosis of cancer.
   Methods: Published entire mitochondrial genomes from head and neck,
   adenoid cystic carcinoma, sessile serrated adenoma, and lung primary
   tumor from clinical patients were examined in a phylogenetic context and
   compared with known, naturally occurring mutations which characterize
   different populations.
   Results: The phylogenetic linkage analysis of whole arrays of mtDNA
   mutations from patient cancerous and non-cancerous tissue confirmed that
   artificial recombination events occurred in studies of head and neck,
   adenoid cystic carcinoma, sessile serrated adenoma, and lung primary
   tumor. Our phylogenetic analysis of these tumor and control leukocyte
   mtDNA haplotype sequences shows clear cut evidence of mixed ancestries
   found in single individuals.
   Conclusions: Our study makes two prescriptions: both in the clinical
   situation and in research 1. more care should be taken in maintaining
   sample identity and 2. analysis should always be undertaken with respect
   to all the data available and within an evolutionary framework to
   eliminate artifacts and mix-ups.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a hierarchical application traffic
   classification system as an alternative means to overcome the
   limitations of the port number and payload based methodologies, which
   are traditionally considered traffic classification methods. The
   proposed system is a new classification model that hierarchically
   combines a binary classifier SVM and Support Vector Data Descriptions
   (SVDDs). The proposed system selects an optimal attribute subset from
   the bi-directional traffic flows generated by our traffic analysis
   system (KU-MON) that enables real-time collection and analysis of campus
   traffic. The system is composed of three layers: The first layer is a
   binary classifier SVM that performs rapid classification between P2P and
   non-P2P traffic. The second layer classifies P2P traffic into
   file-sharing, messenger and TV, based on three SVDDs. The third layer
   performs specialized classification of all individual application
   traffic types. Since the proposed system enables both coarse-and
   fine-grained classification, it can guarantee efficient resource
   management, such as a stable network environment, seamless bandwidth
   guarantee and appropriate QoS. Moreover, even when a new application
   emerges, it can be easily adapted for incremental updating and scaling.
   Only additional training for the new part of the application traffic is
   needed instead of retraining the entire system. The performance of the
   proposed system is validated via experiments which confirm that its
   recall and precision measures are satisfactory.}},

Title = {{Genetic Evidence for Inhibition of Bacterial Division Protein FtsZ by
   Berberine}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Berberine is a plant alkaloid that is widely used as an
   anti-infective in traditional medicine. Escherichia coli exposed to
   berberine form filaments, suggesting an antibacterial mechanism that
   involves inhibition of cell division. Berberine is a DNA ligand and may
   induce filamentation through induction of the SOS response. Also, there
   is biochemical evidence for berberine inhibition of the cell division
   protein FtsZ. Here we aimed to assess possible berberine mechanism(s) of
   action in growing bacteria using genetics tools.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: First, we tested whether berberine
   inhibits bacterial growth through DNA damage and induction of the SOS
   response. The SOS response induced by berberine was much lower compared
   to that induced by mitomycin C in an SOS response reporter strain. Also,
   cell filamentation was observed in an SOS-negative E. coli strain. To
   test whether berberine inhibits FtsZ, we assessed its effects on
   formation of the cell division Z-rings, and observed a dramatic
   reduction in Z-rings in the presence of berberine. We next used two
   different strategies for RNA silencing of ftsZ and both resulted in
   sensitisation of bacteria to berberine, visible as a drop in the Minimum
   Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Furthermore, Fractional Inhibitory
   Concentration Indices (FICIs) showed a high level of synergy between
   ftsZ silencing and berberine treatment (FICI values of 0.23 and 0.25 for
   peptide nucleic acid-and expressed antisense RNA-based silencing of
   ftsZ, respectively). Finally, over-expression of ftsZ led to a mild
   rescue effect in berberine-treated cells.
   Conclusions: The results argue against DNA binding as the primary
   mechanism of action of berberine and support the hypothesis that its
   antibacterial properties are due to inhibition of the cell division
   protein FtsZ. In addition, the genetic approach used here provides a
   means to rapidly test the activity of other putative FtsZ inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{The Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway controls a network of cytoprotective genes
   that defend against the damaging effects of oxidative and electrophilic
   stress, and inflammation. Induction of this pathway is a highly
   effective strategy in combating the risk of cancer and chronic
   degenerative diseases, including atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration.
   An acetylenic tricyclic bis(cyano enone) bearing two highly
   electrophilic Michael acceptors is an extremely potent inducer in cells
   and in vivo. We demonstrate spectroscopically that both cyano enone
   functions of the tricyclic molecule react with cysteine residues of
   Keap1 and activate transcription of cytoprotective genes. Novel
   monocyclic cyano enones, representing fragments of rings A and C of the
   tricyclic compound, reveal that the contribution to inducer potency of
   the ring C Michael acceptor is much greater than that of ring A, and
   that potency is further enhanced by spatial proximity of an acetylenic
   function. Critically, the simultaneous presence of two cyano enone
   functions in rings A and C within a rigid three-ring system results in
   exceptionally high inducer potency. Detailed understanding of the
   structural elements that contribute to the reactivity with the protein
   sensor Keap1 and to high potency of induction is essential for the
   development of specific and selective lead compounds as clinically
   relevant chemoprotective agents.}},

   {[}(PPh3)Pd(HL1)Cl]Cl center dot 2CH(3)CN (1). The complex
   {[}(PPh3)Pd(HL1)I]Cl center dot 1/2H(2)O (2) was prepared via halogen
   exchange between 1 and sodium iodide in methanol/acetonitrile. The first
   binuclear palladium(II) complex containing singly deprotonated HL1,
   {[}(PPh3)(2)ClPd(L1)Pd(PPh3)Cl]Cl center dot 1/3H(2)O center dot CH3OH
   (3), was prepared by the reaction of HL1 with palladium(II) chloride and
   triphenylphosphane in the presence of sodium acetate in methanol.
   All the complexes have been characterized by a combination of FT-IR-,
   P-31 NMR-spectroscopy, elemental analyses and mass spectrometry. The
   molecular structures of the complexes were determined by X-ray
   diffraction studies. The unit cell of 2 exhibits two
   crystallographically independent complexes, while the unit cell of 3
   contains three crystallographically independent molecules. While the
   triazole moiety in 1 and 2 acts as a bidentate chelating ligand, the
   deprotonated triazole compound in 3 acts as a bridging agent between two
   metal centers. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the
   packing mode of the heterocycle by the phenyl rings of the PPh3 moiety
   is responsible for the interesting observed ``sandwich{''} effect. The
   X-ray structure of the complex {[}Pd(py)(4)]Cl-2 center dot 1/2H(2)O (4)

   chromatography (TREF x SEC) is a routine technique to determine the
   chemical heterogeneity of semicrystalline olefin copolymers. Its
   applicability is limited to well crystallizing samples. High-temperature
   two-dimensional liquid chromatography, HT 2D-LC, where the
   chromatographic separation by HPLC is hyphenated to SEC (HPLC x SEC)
   holds the promise to separate such materials irrespective of their
   crystallizability. A model blend consisting of ethylene-vinyl acetate
   (EVA) copolymers covering a broad range of chemical composition
   distribution including amorphous and semicrystalline copolymers and a
   polyethylene standard was separated by HT 2D-LC at 140 degrees C. Both
   axes of the contour plot, i.e. the compositional axis from the HPLC and
   the molar mass axis from the SEC separation were calibrated for the
   first time. Therefore, a new approach to determine the void and dwell
   volume of the developed HT 2D-LC instrument was applied. The results
   from the HT 2D-LC separation are compared to those from a
   cross-fractionation (TREF x SEC) experiment. (c) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {{Organic heterojunction thin-film transistors are fabricated based on
   copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and hexadecafluorophtholocyaninatocopper
   (F16CuPc) as double active layers, which exhibit typical ambipolar

   morphology, which results in a remarkable change on the electric
   characteristics of organic transistors. The highest balanced mobility
   value of 2.91 x 10(-2) cm(2)/V s for hole and 1.04 x 10(-2) cm(2)/V s
   for electron are obtained by depositing F16CuPc at 150 degrees C and
   CuPc at 200 degrees C, respectively, which are comparable to those
   conventional single-layer devices. This result demonstrates that the
   growth conditions of organic heterojunctions play a crucial role in

Abstract = {{Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a
   neuropeptide with highly potent neuro- and general cytoprotective
   actions. PACAP is also an important modulator of circadian rhythmic
   functions, including time-dependent effects in the pineal gland. It is
   not known whether PACAP influences the survival of pinealocytes. The
   present study had two aims. First, we tested whether the cytoprotective
   effects of PACAP are present also in the pineal cells. As the pineal
   gland is the main circadian master clock in birds, we also tested
   whether this effect depends on the time of day. Using flow cytometry, we
   detected a significant decrease of cell viability after hydrogen
   peroxide-induced oxidative stress in chicken pinealocytes. PACAP alone
   did not influence cell survival. Co-incubation with PACAP in the dark
   phase (9 pm) was able to attenuate the toxic effect of H2O2. The
   survival-promoting effect could be counteracted by simultaneously
   applied PACAP antagonist, PACAP6-38. However, co-treatment with PACAP
   during the light phase (9 am) did not result in significant differences
   in the percentage of living cells. In summary, our results show that
   PACAP has a protective effect against the oxidative stress-induced cell
   death in chicken pinealocytes, but this effect is dependent on the phase
   of the circadian biological clock. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An analysis of the mineralogy of the Miura-Boso accretionary prism,
   which consists of off-scraped upper Miocene strata exposed on the
   southern parts of the Miura and Boso peninsulas in Central Japan,
   revealed homogeneous mineral composition throughout all levels of silt
   layers hosting deformation structures associated with sediment
   accretion. XRD analyses showed that the sediment consists of randomly
   ordered mixed layer illite-smectite (I-S) with low illite content (>40
   wt.\%), quartz (30 wt.\%), illite (10-20 wt.\%), plagioclase (10 wt.\%),
   kaolinite (+ chlorite) (5 wt.\%), and calcite (0-10 wt.\%). The observed
   mineralogical assemblage indicates that location of the decollement
   formation was not constrained by mechanical heterogeneities associated
   with mineralogical variations, but was controlled by spatial variations
   in effective pressure. Within the over-consolidated sediment located
   above the incipient decollement zone, the occurrence of abundant
   smectite with a shape-preferred orientation gave rise to smectite
   swelling, producing pressures in the order of similar to 3.0 MPa. The
   combined effect of high swelling pressure and high pore pressure
   resulted in an overpressured zone at the base of the over-consolidated
   zone, facilitating the development of a decollement zone within the
   prism. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the phenotype of their offspring but few studies have examined this
   relationship in humans. Using 120 paired maternal-umbilical cord blood
   samples randomly selected from a prospective birth cohort in Bangladesh,
   we quantified DNA methylation by pyrosequencing seven CpG positions in
   the promoter region of p16, four CpG positions in the promoter region of
   p53, LINE-1 and Alu. Positive correlations were observed between
   maternal and umbilical cord blood at p16, LINE-1, and Alu but not p53.
   Multiple linear regression models observed a significant association
   between maternal and umbilical cord blood at LINE-1 and Alu (LINE-1:
   beta = 0.63, p<0.0001; Alu: beta = 0.28, p = 0.009). After adjusting for
   multiple comparisons, maternal methylation of p16 at position 4
   significantly predicted methylation at the same position in umbilical
   cord blood (beta = 0.43, p = <0.0001). These models explained 48\%, 5\%
   and 16\% of the observed variability in umbilical cord \% 5mC for
   LINE-1, Alu and p16 at position 4, respectively. These results suggest
   that DNA methylation in maternal blood was correlated with her offspring
   at LINE-1, Alu, and p16 but not p53. Additional studies are needed to
   confirm whether these observed associations were due to the inheritance
   of epigenetic events or the shared environment between mother and fetus.
   Future studies should also use a multi-generational family-based design
   that would quantify both maternal and paternal contributions to DNA
   methylation in offspring across more than one generation.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous hydrogenated silicon-rich silicon carbide (a-Si0.8C0.2:H) thin
   films were prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition and
   were thermally annealed in a conventional resistance heated furnace at
   annealing temperatures up to 1100 degrees C. The annealing temperatures
   were varied and the samples were characterised with Auger electron
   spectroscopy, glancing incidence X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
   Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. As-deposited
   a-Si0.8C0.2:H thin films contain a large amount of hydrogen and are
   amorphous. When annealing the films, the onset of Si crystallisation
   appears at 700 degrees C. For higher annealing temperatures, we observed
   SiC crystallites in addition to the Si nanocrystals (NCs). The
   crystallisation of SiC correlates with the occurrence of a strong PL
   band, which is strongly reduced after hydrogen passivation. Thus PL
   signal originates from the SiC matrix. Si NCs exhibit no PL yield due to
   their inhomogeneous size distribution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Kes1/Osh4 is a member of the
   enigmatic family of oxysterol-binding proteins found throughout Eukarya
   united by a beta-barrel structure that binds sterols and oxysterols. In
   this study, we determined that phos-phoinositides are the major
   determinant in membranes that facilitate Kes1 association both in vitro
   and in cells. Increased expression of Kes1 in yeast cells decreased the
   levels of both phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and
   phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). Phosphoinositide and sterol
   bindings by Kes1 were necessary for Kes1 to decrease the level of PI4P
   but not PI3P. Kes1 inhibited vesicular trafficking between the
   trans-Golgi and plasma membrane as evidenced by accumulation of the
   vacuolar soluble NSF attachment protein receptors Snc1 in the
   cytoplasmic vesicles. Sterol and phosphoinositide binding by Kes1 both
   contributed to its regulation of Snc1 trafficking. This study also
   describes a previously unknown role for Kes1 in the regulation of the
   autophagy/cytoplasm to the vacuole trafficking pathway. The
   Kes1-mediated regulation of the autophagy/cytoplasm to the vacuole
   trafficking pathway was prevented by increasing expression of the PI3K
   Vps34, suggesting that it is the Kes1-mediated decrease in PI3P level
   that contributes to this regulation.}},

Title = {{Simple analytical solutions for oxygen transfer into anaerobic
   groundwater}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{The oxygen flux from the atmosphere into aquifers plays a key role for
   the biodegradation of organic solutes in groundwater and changing the
   water chemistry in general. In this paper, simple analytical solutions
   for the reactive transport of oxygen into groundwater are derived and
   compared to numerical models. The oxygen transfer is described analogous
   to diffusion into a semi-infinite domain with instantaneous reaction. We
   assume the capillary fringe does not exist and the concentration of
   oxygen is constant at the water table. Steady state analytical solutions
   are derived for the oxygen flux and for the concentration profiles of
   the reactants and products that could be volatile and nonvolatile. The
   simple approach is validated with numerical simulations. We can show
   that the analytical solutions agree very well with the numerical model.
   On the basis of this finding, simple analytical solutions can be used to
   calculate the depth of oxidation fronts in groundwater and the reactive
   transport of oxygen into groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is one of the oldest known edible
   fruits. It is native to Iran and spread from Iran to other areas In this
   study amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was used to detect
   intra- and inter-population genetic diversity of pomegranate. A group of
   67 accessions belonged to 4 populations from Iran was studied using
   eight primer combinations A total of 221 scorable bands were amplified,
   of which, 118(54.13\%) were polymorphic. Resolving power (Rp) ranged
   from 5.70 to 9.21, and the average of polymorphism information content
   (PIC) per primer pair was 0.40. According to Nei's gene diversity and
   allelic statistics. Isfahan population had a highest genetic diversity
   (H = 0.3646, I = 0.5327, N-e = 1.6467). Coefficient of gene
   differentiation between populations (GST) was 0.124, indicated that
   mainly proportion of genetic variation (87.6\%), was within populations
   and the remaining (12.4\%) of the variation was among populations that,
   also supported by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). The gene
   flow(Nm)varied nom 0.969 to 10.404 between pair-wise populations and was
   3.504 among all of the populations. The Jaccard similarity coefficient
   between individuals ranged from 0.26 to 0.88. The UPGMA dendrogram
   clustered all 67 accessions into 6 groups. In some cases accessions from
   same region were grouped together but in most cases, there was gene
   exchange. To study the genetic relationships among populations, a
   principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Nei's genetic distances
   was performed. Results of this study showed that AFLP marker can be a
   useful tool for investigating the genetic diversity of pomegranate
   genotypes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ehrlichia canis and Babesia canis vogeli are two tick-borne canine
   pathogens with a worldwide importance. Both pathogens are transmitted by
   Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick, which has an increasing
   global distribution. A multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay
   for the simultaneous detection of the tick-borne pathogens E. canis and
   B. canis vogeli was developed using dual-labeled probes. The target
   genes were the 16S rRNA of E. canis and the heat shock protein 70
   (hsp70) of B. canis vogeli. The canine beta actin (ACTB) gene was used
   as an internal control gene. The assay was conducted without using any
   pre-amplification steps such as nested reactions. The sensitivity of
   each reaction in the multiplex qPCR assay was tested in the presence of
   high template concentrations of the other amplified genes in the same
   tube and in the presence of canine DNA. The detection threshold of the
   multiplex assay was 1-10 copies/mu l in all channels and the
   amplifications of the B. canis hsp70 and ACTB were not affected by the
   other simultaneous reactions, while minor interference was observed in
   the amplification of the E. canis 16S rRNA gene. This assay would be
   useful for diagnostic laboratories and may save time, labor and costs.

Abstract = {{The NAD rescue pathway consists of two enzymatic steps operated by
   nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) and nicotinamide
   mononucleotide adenylyltransferases. Recently, the potent Nampt
   inhibitor FK866 has been identified and evaluated in clinical trials
   against cancer. Yet, how Nampt inhibition affects NAD contents and
   bioenergetics is in part obscure. It is also unknown whether NAD rescue
   takes place in mitochondria, and FK866 alters NAD homeostasis within the
   organelle. Here, we show that FK866-dependent reduction of the NAD
   contents is paralleled by a concomitant increase of ATP in various cell
   types, in keeping with ATP utilization for NAD resynthesis. We also show
   that poly-and mono(ADP-ribose) transferases rather than Sirt-1 are
   responsible for NAD depletion in HeLa cells exposed to FK866. Mass
   spectrometry reveals that the drug distributes in the cytosolic and
   mitochondrial compartment. However, the cytoplasmic but not the
   mitochondrial NAD pool is reduced upon acute or chronic exposure to the
   drug. Accordingly, Nampt does not localize within the organelles and
   their bioenergetics is not affected by the drug. In the mouse,
   FK866-dependent reduction of NAD contents in various organs is prevented
   by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases or the NAD precursor
   kynurenine. For the first time, our data indicate that mitochondria lack
   the canonical NAD rescue pathway, broadening current understanding of
   cellular bioenergetics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the structure and mechanical properties of similar

   (a-C:H) coatings deposited on 100Cr6 steel substrates, using low
   temperature (similar to 200 degrees C) DC reactive magnetron sputtering.
   The carbon content was varied with acetylene partial pressure in order
   to obtain single layer coatings with different a-C:H carbon phase
   fractions. The nanocrystalline Ti(N,C) phase is approximately
   stoichiometric for all coatings and the a-C:H phase fraction increases
   from 31 to 47 at.\% as the coatings stoichiometry changed from TiC1.34
   N-0.51 to TiC2.48 N-0.48, respectively. TiC1.34 N-0.51 coatings showed
   the highest nanoindentation hardness (H) of similar to 14 GPa and a
   modulus (E-r) of similar to 144 GPa; H reduced to <6 GPa and E-r to <70
   GPa for TiC2.45 N-0.48 coatings. nc-Ti(N,C)/a-C:H coatings are promising
   candidates for applications where better matching of the modulus between
   a relatively low modulus substrate, hard loading support layer and low
   modulus-high H/E ratio top layer is required. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Genotator: A disease-agnostic tool for genetic annotation of disease}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Disease-specific genetic information has been increasing at
   rapid rates as a consequence of recent improvements and massive cost
   reductions in sequencing technologies. Numerous systems designed to
   capture and organize this mounting sea of genetic data have emerged, but
   these resources differ dramatically in their disease coverage and
   genetic depth. With few exceptions, researchers must manually search a
   variety of sites to assemble a complete set of genetic evidence for a
   particular disease of interest, a process that is both time-consuming
   and error-prone.
   Methods: We designed a real-time aggregation tool that provides both
   comprehensive coverage and reliable gene-to-disease rankings for any
   disease. Our tool, called Genotator, automatically integrates data from
   11 externally accessible clinical genetics resources and uses these data
   in a straightforward formula to rank genes in order of disease
   relevance. We tested the accuracy of coverage of Genotator in three
   separate diseases for which there exist specialty curated databases,
   Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parkinson's Disease, and Alzheimer Disease.
   Genotator is freely available at http://genotator.hms.harvard.edu.
   Results: Genotator demonstrated that most of the 11 selected databases
   contain unique information about the genetic composition of disease,
   with 2514 genes found in only one of the 11 databases. These findings
   confirm that the integration of these databases provides a more complete
   picture than would be possible from any one database alone. Genotator
   successfully identified at least 75\% of the top ranked genes for all
   three of our use cases, including a 90\% concordance with the top 40
   ranked candidates for Alzheimer Disease.
   Conclusions: As a meta-query engine, Genotator provides high coverage of
   both historical genetic research as well as recent advances in the
   genetic understanding of specific diseases. As such, Genotator provides
   a real-time aggregation of ranked data that remains current with the
   pace of research in the disease fields. Genotator's algorithm
   appropriately transforms query terms to match the input requirements of
   each targeted databases and accurately resolves named synonyms to ensure
   full coverage of the genetic results with official nomenclature.
   Genotator generates an excel-style output that is consistent across
   disease queries and readily importable to other applications.}},

Abstract = {{The activity of Cdk5-p35 is tightly regulated in the developing and
   mature nervous system. Stress-induced cleavage of the activator p35 to
   p25 and a p10 N-terminal domain induces deregulated Cdk5 hyperactivity
   and perikaryal aggregations of hyperphosphorylated Tau and
   neurofilaments, pathogenic hallmarks in neurodegenerative diseases, such
   as Alzheimer disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, respectively.
   Previously, we identified a 125-residue truncated fragment of p35 called
   CIP that effectively and specifically inhibited Cdk5-p25 activity and
   Tau hyperphosphorylation induced by A beta peptides in vitro, in HEK293
   cells, and in neuronal cells. Although these results offer a possible
   therapeutic approach to those neurodegenerative diseases assumed to
   derive from Cdk5-p25 hyperactivity and/or A beta induced pathology, CIP
   is too large for successful therapeutic regimens. To identify a smaller,
   more effective peptide, in this study we prepared a 24-residue peptide,
   p5, spanning CIP residues Lys(245)-Ala(277). p5 more effectively
   inhibited Cdk5-p25 activity than did CIP in vitro. In neuron cells, p5
   inhibited deregulated Cdk5-p25 activity but had no effect on the
   activity of endogenous Cdk5-p35 or on any related endogenous
   cyclin-dependent kinases in HEK293 cells. Specificity of p5 inhibition
   in cortical neurons may depend on the p10 domain in p35, which is absent
   in p25. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that p5 reduced A
   beta(1-42)-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation and apoptosis in cortical
   neurons. These results suggest that p5 peptide may be a unique and
   useful candidate for therapeutic studies of certain neurodegenerative
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The various dissociation thresholds of phenol(+)center dot center dot
   center dot Ar-3 complexes for the consecutive loss of all three Ar

   efficiency and mass analyzed threshold ionization spectroscopy via
   excitation of the first excited singlet state (S-1). The adiabatic
   ionization energy is derived as 68077 +/- 15 cm(-1). The analysis of the
   dissociation thresholds demonstrate that all three Ar ligands in the
   neutral phenol center dot center dot center dot Ar-3 tetramer are
   attached to the aromatic ring via pi-bonding, denoted phenol center dot
   center dot center dot Ar-3(3 pi). The value of the dissociation
   threshold for the loss of one Ar ligand from phenol(+)center dot center
   dot center dot Ar-3(3 pi), similar to 190 cm(-1), is significantly lower
   than the binding energy measured for the pi-bonded Ar ligand in the
   phenol(+)center dot center dot center dot Ar(pi) dimer, D-0 = 535 +/- 3
   cm(-1). This difference is rationalized by an ionization-induced pi -> H
   isomerization process occurring prior to dissociation, that is, one Ar
   atom in phenol+center dot center dot center dot Ar-3(3 pi) moves to the
   OH binding site, leading to a structure with one H-bonded and 2
   pi-bonded ligands, denoted phenol(+)center dot center dot center dot
   Ar-3(H/2 pi). The dissociation thresholds for the loss of two and three
   Ar atoms are also reported as 860 and 1730 cm(-1). From these values,
   the binding energy of the H-bound Ar atom can be estimated as 870

Abstract = {{We present an iterative Monte Carlo path integral methodology for
   evaluating thermally averaged real-time correlation functions. Standard
   path integral Monte Carlo methods are used to sample paths along the
   imaginary time contour. Propagation of the density matrix is performed
   iteratively on a grid composed of the end points of the sampled paths.
   Minimally oscillatory propagators are constructed using energy filtering
   techniques. A single propagation yields the values of the correlation
   function at all intermediate time points. Model calculations suggest
   that the method yields accurate results over several oscillation periods
   and the statistical error grows slowly with increasing propagation time.

Abstract = {{The diffusion rate of hydrogen in Nb was calculated using ab initio
   molecular dynamics simulations. At low temperatures the hydrogen is
   strongly trapped in a local strain field which is caused by the elastic
   response of the lattice. At elevated temperatures, the residence time
   (tau) of hydrogen in an interstitial site is not sufficient for fully
   developing the local strain field. This unbinding of the interstitial
   hydrogen and the strain field increases the hopping rate (1/tau) at
   elevated temperatures (>400 K). These results call for a revision of the
   conceptual framework of diffusion of hydrogen in transition metals at
   elevated temperatures.}},

Title = {{Supersonic Beams at High Particle Densities: Model Description beyond
   the Ideal Gas Approximation}},

Abstract = {{Supersonic molecular beams constitute a very powerful technique in
   modern chemical physics. They offer several unique features such as a
   directed, collision-free flow of particles, very high luminosity, and an
   unsurpassed strong adiabatic cooling during the jet expansion. While it
   is generally recognized that their maximum flow velocity depends on the
   molecular weight and the temperature of the working fluid in the
   stagnation reservoir, not a lot is known on the effects of elevated
   particle densities. Frequently, the characteristics of supersonic beams
   are treated in diverse approximations of an ideal gas expansion. In
   these simplified model descriptions, the real gas character of fluid
   systems is ignored, although particle associations are responsible for
   fundamental processes such as the formation of clusters, both in the
   reservoir at increased densities and during the jet expansion.
   In this contribution, the various assumptions of ideal gas treatments of
   supersonic beams and their shortcomings are reviewed. It is shown in
   detail that a straightforward thermodynamic approach considering the
   initial and final enthalpy is capable of characterizing the terminal
   mean beam velocity, even at the liquid-vapor phase boundary and the
   critical point. Fluid properties are obtained using the most accurate
   equations of state available at present. This procedure provides the
   opportunity to naturally include the dramatic effects of nonideal gas
   behavior for a large variety of fluid systems. Besides the prediction of
   the terminal flow velocity, thermodynamic models of isentropic jet
   expansions permit an estimate of the upper limit of the beam temperature
   and the amount of condensation in the beam. These descriptions can even
   be extended to include spinodal decomposition processes, thus providing
   a generally applicable tool for investigating the two-phase region of
   high supersaturations not easily accessible otherwise.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic relaxation pathways in photoexcited nucleobases have received
   much theoretical and experimental attention due to their underlying
   importance to the UV photostability of these biomolecules. Multiple
   mechanisms with different energetic onsets have been proposed by ab
   initio calculations yet the majority of experiments to date have only
   probed the photophysics at a few selected excitation energies. We
   present femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectra (TRPES) of the
   DNA base adenine in a molecular beam at multiple excitation energies
   between 4.7-6.2 eV. The two-dimensional TRPES data is fit globally to
   extract lifetimes and decay associated spectra for unambiguous
   identification of states participating in the relaxation. Furthermore,
   the corresponding amplitude ratios are indicative of the relative
   importance of competing pathways. We adopt the following mechanism for
   the electronic relaxation of isolated adenine; initially the S-2(pi
   pi{*}) state is populated by all excitation wavelengths and decays
   quickly within 100 fs. For excitation energies below similar to 5.2 eV,
   the S-2(pi pi{*})-> S-1(n pi{*})-> S-0 pathway dominates the
   deactivation process. The S-1(n pi{*})-> S-0 lifetime (1032-700 fs)
   displays a trend toward shorter time constants with increasing
   excitation energy. On the basis of relative amplitude ratios, an
   additional relaxation channel is identified at excitation energies above
   5.2 eV.}},

Title = {{Brain activations to emotional pictures are differentially associated
   with valence and arousal ratings}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have investigated the neural responses triggered by
   emotional pictures, but the specificity of the involved structures such
   as the amygdala or the ventral striatum is still under debate.
   Furthermore, only few studies examined the association of stimuli's
   valence and arousal and the underlying brain responses. Therefore, we
   investigated brain responses with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   of 17 healthy participants to pleasant and unpleasant affective pictures
   and afterwards assessed ratings of valence and arousal. As expected,
   unpleasant pictures strongly activated the right and left amygdala, the
   right hippocampus, and the medial occipital lobe, whereas pleasant
   pictures elicited significant activations in left occipital regions, and
   in parts of the medial temporal lobe. The direct comparison of
   unpleasant and pleasant pictures, which were comparable in arousal
   clearly indicated stronger amygdala activation in response to the
   unpleasant pictures. Most important, correlational analyses revealed on
   the one hand that the arousal of unpleasant pictures was significantly
   associated with activations in the right amygdala and the left caudate
   body. On the other hand, valence of pleasant pictures was significantly
   correlated with activations in the right caudate head, extending to the
   nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
   These findings support the notion that the amygdala is primarily
   involved in processing of unpleasant stimuli, particularly to more
   arousing unpleasant stimuli. Reward-related structures like the caudate
   and NAcc primarily respond to pleasant stimuli, the stronger the more
   positive the valence of these stimuli is.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) networks become rapidly mature and
   represent a promising candidate for reducing power consumption, costs,
   and bandwidth bottlenecks of next-generation broadband access networks.
   Two key FiWi technologies with similar design goals are Ethernet Passive
   Optical Network (EPON) and WiMAX. In this paper, we develop a powerful
   and flexible techno-economic analysis to compare the two technologies,
   taking into account not only equipment and installation costs but also
   OAM related costs such as power consumption and repairing costs for a
   wide range of different network failure scenarios, terrain types, and
   wireless channel conditions. The presented results give insight into the
   cost-performance trade-offs of current and next-generation EPON and
   WiMAX networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity in two ecotypes of a marine
   gastropod}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Few surveys have concentrated on studying the adaptive value
   of phenotypic plasticity within genetically-distinct conspecific
   ecotypes. Here, we conduct a test to assess the adaptive value that
   partial phenotypic plasticity may have for survival in the marine
   gastropod Littorina saxatilis. This species has evolved canalized
   ecotypes but, nevertheless, the ecotypes show some phenotypic plasticity
   for the traits under divergent selection between wave-exposed and
   high-predation habitats.
   Results: We exposed juveniles of each ecotype to several environmental
   treatments under laboratory conditions in order to produce shape
   variation associated with plasticity. The two ecotypes from different
   treatments were then transplanted to the wave-exposed habitat and the
   survival rate was monitored. Ecotype explained the largest distinction
   in survival rate while treatment caused variation in survival rate
   within the ecotype released into its parental habitat which was
   correlated with plastic changes in shell shape. Snails that had
   experienced a treatment mimicking the environment of the transplantation
   location survived with the highest rate, while individuals from the
   contrary experimental treatment had lower survivorship.
   Conclusions: We conclude that the partial plastic response shown in
   Littorina saxatilis has a significant impact on fitness, although this
   remains small compared to the overall adaptive difference between
   ecotypes.}},

Abstract = {{The development of a one-step process for producing high fidelity
   hot-embossed cyclic-olefin co-polymer (COC) based microfluidic devices
   without the need for pre-annealing the base polymer substrate/film is
   outlined This was achieved through proper selection of the hot-embossing
   conditions that was based on an in-depth understanding of the
   fundamental factors which affect the replication accuracy of
   microchannels during the hot-embossing process An important factor that
   is commonly overlooked in the hot-embossing of films (typically with
   thicknesses less than 1 mm) is the existence of polymer chain
   orientation Generally polymer films used for hot-embossing are not
   pre-annealed to minimize residual stresses and remove any chain
   orientation that may be present and this affects the replication
   accuracy In contrast polymer substrates (typically with thicknesses more
   than 1 mm) that are used for hot-embossing to produce microfluidic
   devices need to be pre-annealed to minimize residual stresses and remove
   any chain orientation Processing of the latter thus required an
   additional step The avoidance of such pre-annealing may affect the
   replication accuracy In the present work it was demonstrated that
   microfluidic devices with high fidelity microchannels could be produced
   using a single-step hot-embossing process based on knowledge of the
   influence of embossing temperature embossing pressure embossing time and
   polymer chain orientation in the film/substrate on micro-replication (c)

Abstract = {{Rotational relaxation rates for HBr(nu = 1) colliding with helium atoms
   at room temperature have been measured using a time-resolved optical
   optical double resonance technique. Rotational state selective
   excitation of nu = 1 for rotational levels in the range J = 1-9 was
   achieved by stimulated Raman pumping. The population decay in the
   prepared states and the transfer of population to nearby rotational
   states was monitored via 2 + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization
   (REMPI) spectroscopy using the g(3)Sigma(-) -X-1 Sigma(+) (0-1) band.
   Collision-induced population evolution for transfer events with vertical
   bar Delta J vertical bar <= 8 was observed at pressures near 0.7 Torr.
   The experimental data were analyzed using fitting and scaling functions
   to generate state-to-state rotational energy transfer rate constant
   matrices. Total depopulation rate constants were found to be in the
   range (1.3 to 2.0) x 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1). As a test of current
   computational methods, state-to-state rotational energy transfer rate
   constants were calculated using ab initio theory. The total removal rate
   constants were in good agreement with the measured values, but the
   transfer probabilities for events with vertical bar Delta J vertical bar
   >= 3 were underestimated. Inspection of the anisotropic characteristics
   of the potential energy surface did not yield an obvious explanation for
   the discrepancies, but it is most likely that the problem stems from
   inaccuracies in the potential surface.}},

Abstract = {{An individual magnetic atom doped into a semiconductor is a promising
   building block for bottom-up spintronic devices and quantum-logic
   gates(1-3). Moreover, it provides a perfect model system for the
   atomic-scale investigation of fundamental effects such as magnetism in
   dilute magnetic semiconductors(4). However, dopants in semiconductors so
   far have not been studied by magnetically sensitive techniques with
   atomic resolution that correlate the atomic structure with the dopant's
   magnetism. Here we show electrical excitation and read-out of a spin
   associated with a single magnetic dopant in a semiconductor host. We use
   spin-resolved scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to measure the spin
   excitations and the magnetization curve of individual iron
   surface-dopants embedded within a two-dimensional electron gas confined
   to an indium antimonide (110) surface. The dopants act like isolated
   quantum spins the states of which are governed by a substantial magnetic
   anisotropy that forces the spin to lie in the surface plane. This result
   is corroborated by our first principles calculations. The demonstrated
   methodology opens new routes for the investigation of sample systems
   that are more widely studied in the field of spintronics-that is, Mn in
   GaAs (ref. 5), magnetic ions in semiconductor quantum dots(3),
   nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond(6) and phosphorus spins in
   silicon(7).}},

Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{The Kohn-Sham equations with constrained electron density are extended
   to hybrid exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. We derive the frozen
   density embedding generalized Kohn-Sham (FDE-GKS) scheme which allows to
   treat the nonlocal exact-exchange in the subsystems. For practical
   calculations we propose an approximated version of the FDE-GKS in which
   the nonadditive exchange potential is computed at a semilocal level. The
   proposed method is applied to compute the ground-state electronic
   properties of small test systems and selected DNA base pairs. The
   results of calculations employing the hierarchy of XC functionals
   BLYP/B3LYP/BHLYP and PBE/PBE0 are presented, in order to analyze the
   effect of nonlocal exchange contributions, and compared with reference
   coupled-cluster singles and doubles results. We find that the use of
   hybrid functionals leads to a significant improvement in the description
   of ground-state electronic properties of the investigated systems. The
   semilocal version of the FDE-GKS correctly reproduces the dipole and the
   electron density distribution of the exact GKS supramolecular system,
   with errors smaller than the ones obtained using conventional semilocal
   XC functionals. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The erosive wear of borosilicate glass edges by randomly located
   unidirectional Impacts of steel balls was investigated experimentally
   Glass edges were damaged by overlapping chips while flat surfaces
   remained unaffected by the impacts For a given impact velocity the
   extent of edge damage grew rapidly but then became saturated showing no
   further Increase with increasing number of impacts This saturation of
   damage was attributed to the evolution of edge geometry characterized by
   an increase of the effective edge included angle and the width of the
   damage zone Tests on chamfered edges demonstrated a critical chamfer
   width above which chipping was reduced significantly Chamfering did not
   affect chipping when the chamfer width was below the critical value The
   critical chamfer width was related to the size of the chips formed by
   impact and therefore It increased with increasing Impact velocity and
   decreasing edge included angle Cyclic crack growth due to repeated
   impacts at a given location was found to be a common mechanism of chip
   removal The effect of edge geometry on edge chipping was investigated
   further by quasi-static chipping tests on edges of various included
   angles which showed a significant increase of the forces required to
   create chips as the included angle of the edge increased (C) 2010

Title = {{Determining correspondences between high-frequency MedDRA concepts and
   SNOMED: a case study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms
   (SNOMED CT) is being advocated as the foundation for encoding clinical
   documentation. While the electronic medical record is likely to play a
   critical role in pharmacovigilance - the detection of adverse events due
   to medications - classification and reporting of Adverse Events is
   currently based on the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities
   (MedDRA). Complete and high-quality MedDRA-to-SNOMED CT mappings can
   therefore facilitate pharmacovigilance. The existing mappings, as
   determined through the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), are
   partial, and record only one-to-one correspondences even though SNOMED
   CT can be used compositionally. Efforts to map previously unmapped
   MedDRA concepts would be most productive if focused on concepts that
   occur frequently in actual adverse event data. We aimed to identify
   aspects of MedDRA that complicate mapping to SNOMED CT, determine
   pattern in unmapped high-frequency MedDRA concepts, and to identify
   types of integration errors in the mapping of MedDRA to UMLS.
   Methods: Using one years' data from the US Federal Drug Administrations
   Adverse Event Reporting System, we identified MedDRA preferred terms
   that collectively accounted for 95\% of both Adverse Events and
   Therapeutic Indications records. After eliminating those already mapping
   to SNOMED CT, we attempted to map the remaining 645 Adverse-Event and
   141 Therapeutic-Indications preferred terms with software assistance.
   Results: All but 46 Adverse-Event and 7 Therapeutic-Indications
   preferred terms could be composed using SNOMED CT concepts: none of
   these required more than 3 SNOMED CT concepts to compose. We describe
   the common composition patterns in the paper. About 30\% of both
   Adverse-Event and Therapeutic-Indications Preferred Terms corresponded
   to single SNOMED CT concepts: the correspondence was detectable by human
   inspection but had been missed during the integration process, which had
   created duplicated concepts in UMLS.
   Conclusions: Identification of composite mapping patterns, and the types
   of errors that occur in the MedDRA content within UMLS, can focus
   larger-scale efforts on improving the quality of such mappings, which
   may assist in the creation of an adverse-events ontology.}},

   considerably depending upon the pillar attributes. An analytic model is
   presented and validated via full wave analysis, which elucidates the
   optical effects occurring in the nanostructure. Starting from the basic
   phenomenology associated with a single pillar structure, we show that
   several different effects combine to create a global resonance.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the effect of environment on the gate operation of

   described by the Caldeira-Leggett model. Numerically solving this
   equation, we evaluate the gate error as a function of gate time,
   temperature, and environmental coupling strength for experimentally
   determined qubit parameters. The analysis is presented for
   single-quadrature microwave (control) pulses as well as for
   two-quadrature pulses, which lower the gate error significantly for
   idealized systems in the absence of environment. Our results indicate
   that two-quadrature pulses with fixed and variable driving frequency
   have similar performance, which outweighs the performance of
   single-quadrature pulses, in the presence of environment.}},

Abstract = {{The noncovalent interactions of heteroboranes with aromatic systems have
   only recently been acknowledged as a source of stabilization in
   supramolecular complexes. The physical basis of these interactions has
   been studied in several model complexes using advanced computational
   methods. The highly accurate CCSD(T)/complete basis set (CBS) value of
   the interaction energy for the model diborane center dot center dot
   center dot benzene complex in a stacking geometry exhibiting a B2H
   center dot center dot center dot pi hydrogen bond was calculated to be
   -4.0 kcal center dot mol(-1). The DFT-SAPT/CBS approach, which is shown
   to reproduce the CCSD(T)/CBS data reliably asserted that the major
   stabilizing component was dispersion, followed by electrostatics.
   Furthermore, the effect of the benzene heteroatom- and exosubstitutions
   was studied and found to be small. Next, when aromatic molecules were
   changed to cyclic aliphatic ones, van der Waals complexes stabilized by
   the dispersion term only were formed. As the last step, interactions of
   two larger icosahedral borane cages with benzene were explored. The
   complex of the monoanionic CB11H12- exhibited two minima: the first
   stacked above the plane of the benzene ring with a C-H center dot center
   dot center dot pi hydrogen bond and the second planar, in which the
   carborane cage bound to benzene via five B-H center dot center dot
   center dot H-C dihydrogen bonds. The DFT-SAPT/CBS calculations revealed
   that both of these binding motifs were stabilized by dispersion followed
   by electrostatic terms, with the planar complex being 1.4 kcal center
   dot mol(-1) more stable than the stacked one. The dianionic B12H122-
   interacted with benzene only in the planar geometry, similarly as
   smaller anions do. The large stabilization energy of 11.0 kcal center
   dot mol(-1) was composed of dominant attractive dispersion and slightly
   smaller electrostatic and induction terms. In summary, the
   borane/carborane center dot center dot center dot aromatic interaction
   is varied both in the complex geometries and in the stabilizing energy
   components. The detailed insight derived from high-level quantum
   chemical computations can help us understand such important processes as
   host-guest complexation or carborane center dot center dot center dot
   biomolecule interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Aim of the study: Family Zingiberaceae consists of large number of
   medicinal plants and is well known for its use in ethnomedicine. The
   objective of this study is to systematically analyse and document the
   traditional knowledge regarding the use of Zingiberaceous plants for the
   treatment of various human ailments from NE India, adding information to
   the valuation of biodiversity and, to forward suggestions for its
   sustainable use, conservation and for future pharmacological studies.
   Materials and methods: A survey on the utilization of medicinal plants
   belonging to Zingibereceae of North-eastern states was carried out by
   interviewing herbalists followed by collecting plant specimens and
   identifying the specimen. Ethnobotanical information on traditional
   plants was catalogued through structured questionnaires in consultations
   with traditional healers.
   Results: A total of 34 species were documented belonging to 9 genera of
   Zingiberaceae for about 25 types of ailments, 67.6\% of which were used
   in curing multiple disorders. Arunachal Pradesh hosts maximum number of
   Zingiberaceous plant (88\%). Rhizomes were found to be the primary plant
   material as a source for medication and poultices as the predominant
   mode of preparation. Gastrointestinal conditions (58\%) and chest and
   lungs (41\%) related ailments were the main categories for which these
   plants are used.
   Conclusions: The study establishes Zingiberaceae as a medicinal family
   since 41\% of all the available Zingiberaceous plant species in NE were
   found to possess medicinal value. Some new use of herbs also appeared in
   this study for the first time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

   the independent effects of exonic deletions/duplications (or dosage
   mutations) on the risk for and clinical profiles of PD in a Chinese
   cohort consisting of 29 autosomal-recessive early-onset parkinsonism
   (AREP) families and 173 patients with sporadic early-onset Parkinson's
   disease (EOPD). Detected simultaneously by multiplex PCR/denaturing
   high-performance liquid chromatography and real-time quantitative PCR
   analysis, heterozygous or homozygous dosage mutations were identified in
   exons 2-7 of parkin. The overall frequency of these mutations for both
   types of EOPD patients (8.91\%, 18/202) was significantly higher than
   that of the controls (0\%, 0/54) (p = 0.03), and heterozygous mutations
   were more frequent in the AREP probands (17.2\%, 5/29) than in the
   controls (0\%) (p=0.004) and the sporadic EOPD cases (3.5\%, 6/173) (p =
   0.01). AREP patients with dosage mutations had significantly younger age
   at onset (AAO) (p = 0.000) and were more likely to present as
   bradykinesia and complicated with dystonia or dyskinesia compared with
   those without mutations. Sporadic EOPD patients with dosage mutations do
   not have an earlier AAO but are more likely to present as tremor and
   bradykinesia. These data suggested that dosage mutations alone can
   increase the risk for both sporadic and familial EOPD and affect their
   clinical aspects, but might contribute to a greater degree to familial
   EOPD. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{After maintaining elevations near sea level for over 500 million years,
   the Colorado Plateau (CP) has a present average elevation of 2 km. We
   compute new receiver function images from the first dense seismic
   transect to cross the plateau that reveal a central CP crustal thickness
   of 4250 km thinning to 30-35 km at the CP margins. Isostatic
   calculations show that only approximately 20\% of central CP elevations
   can be explained by thickened crust alone, with the CP edges requiring
   nearly total mantle compensation. We calculate an uplift budget showing
   that CP buoyancy arises from a combination of crustal thickening,
   heating and alteration of the lithospheric root, dynamic support from
   mantle upwelling, and significant buoyant edge effects produced by
   small-scale convecting asthenosphere at its margins. Citation: Wilson,

Abstract = {{We report zero kinetic energy photoelectron (ZEKE) spectroscopy of
   pyrene via resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization. Our analysis
   centers on the symmetry of the first electronically excited state (S-1),
   its vibrational modes, and the vibration of the ground cationic state
   (D-0). From comparisons between the observed vibrational frequencies and
   those from ab initio calculations at the configuration interaction
   singles level using the 6-311G (d,p) basis set, and based on other
   previous experimental and theoretical reports, we confirm the B-1(2u)
   symmetry for the S-1 state. This assignment represents a reversal in the
   energy order of the two closely spaced electronically excited states
   from our theoretical calculation, and extensive configuration
   interactions are attributed to this result. Among the observed
   vibrational levels of the S-1 state, three are results of vibronic
   coupling due to the nearby second electronically excited state. The ZEKE
   spectroscopy obtained via the vibronic levels of the S-1 state reveals
   similar modes for the cation as those of the intermediate state.
   Although we believe that the ground ionic state can be considered a
   single electron configuration, the agreement between theoretical and
   experimental frequencies for the cation is limited. This result is
   somewhat surprising based on our previous work on cata-condensed
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and small substituted aromatic
   compounds. Although a relatively small molecule, pyrene demonstrates its
   nonrigidity via several out-of-plane bending modes corresponding to
   corrugation of the molecular plane. The adiabatic ionization potential
   of neutral pyrene is determined to be 59 888 +/- 7 cm(-1).}},

Abstract = {{High-alexithymic individuals are characterized by an impaired ability to

   the hypothesis that valence and arousal modifications of emotional
   stimuli differentially modulate cortical regions in high-alexithymic and
   low-alexithymic individuals. To this end, 28 high-alexithymic and 25
   low-alexithymic individuals were investigated with event-related fMRI
   using visual emotional stimuli. We found differential neural activations

Title = {{Effective continuing professional development for translating shared
   decision making in primary care: A study protocol}},
Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Shared decision making (SDM) is a process by which a
   healthcare choice is made jointly by the healthcare professional and the
   patient. SDM is the essential element of patient-centered care, a core
   concept of primary care. However, SDM is seldom translated into primary
   practice. Continuing professional development (CPD) is the principal
   means by which healthcare professionals continue to gain, improve, and
   broaden the knowledge and skills required for patient-centered care. Our
   international collaboration seeks to improve the knowledge base of CPD
   that targets translating SDM into the clinical practice of primary care
   in diverse healthcare systems.
   Methods: Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),
   our project is to form an international, interdisciplinary research team
   composed of health services researchers, physicians, nurses,
   psychologists, dietitians, CPD decision makers and others who will study
   how CPD causes SDM to be practiced in primary care. We will perform an
   environmental scan to create an inventory of CPD programs and related
   activities for translating SDM into clinical practice. These programs
   will be critically assessed and compared according to their strengths
   and limitations. We will use the empirical data that results from the
   environmental scan and the critical appraisal to identify knowledge gaps
   and generate a research agenda during a two-day workshop to be held in
   Quebec City. We will ask CPD stakeholders to validate these knowledge
   gaps and the research agenda.
   Discussion: This project will analyse existing CPD programs and related
   activities for translating SDM into the practice of primary care.
   Because this international collaboration will develop and identify
   various factors influencing SDM, the project could shed new light on how
   SDM is implemented in primary care.}},

Title = {{Phosphodiesterase 6 subunits are expressed and altered in idiopathic
   pulmonary fibrosis}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is an unresolved
   clinical issue. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are known therapeutic targets
   for various proliferative lung diseases. Lung PDE6 expression and
   function has received little or no attention. The present study aimed to
   characterize (i) PDE6 subunits expression in human lung, (ii) PDE6
   subunits expression and alteration in IPF and (iii) functionality of the
   specific PDE6D subunit in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: PDE6 subunits expression in transplant
   donor (n = 6) and IPF (n = 6) lungs was demonstrated by real-time
   quantitative (q)RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis. PDE6D mRNA and
   protein levels and PDE6G/H protein levels were significantly
   down-regulated in the IPF lungs. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
   alveolar epithelial localization of the PDE6 subunits. This was
   confirmed by qRT-PCR from human primary alveolar type (AT)II cells,
   demonstrating the down-regulation pattern of PDE6D in IPF-derived ATII
   cells. In vitro, PDE6D protein depletion was provoked by transforming
   growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 in A549 AECs. PDE6D siRNA-mediated knockdown
   and an ectopic expression of PDE6D modified the proliferation rate of
   A549 AECs. These effects were mediated by increased intracellular cGMP
   levels and decreased ERK phosphorylation.
   Conclusions/Significance: Collectively, we report previously
   unrecognized PDE6 expression in human lungs, significant alterations of
   the PDE6D and PDE6G/H subunits in IPF lungs and characterize the
   functional role of PDE6D in AEC proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{Neuronal networks generating rhythmic activity as an emergent property
   are common throughout the nervous system. Some are responsible for
   rhythmic behaviours, as is the case for the spinal cord locomotor
   networks; however, for others the function is more subtle and usually
   involves information processing and/or transfer. An example of the
   latter is sympathetic nerve activity, which is synchronized into
   rhythmic bursts in vivo. This arrangement is postulated to offer
   improved control of target organ responses compared to tonic nerve
   activity. Traditionally, oscillogenic circuits in the brainstem are
   credited with generating these rhythms, despite evidence for the
   persistence of some frequencies in spinalized preparations. Here, we
   show that rhythmic population activity can be recorded from the
   intermediolateral cell column (IML) of thoracic spinal cord slices.
   Recorded in slices from 10- to 12-day-old rats, this activity was
   manifest as 8-22 Hz oscillations in the field potential and was
   spatially restricted to the IML. Oscillations often occurred
   spontaneously, but could also be induced by application of 5-HT,
   alpha-methyl 5-HT or MK212. These agents also significantly increased
   the strength of spontaneous oscillations. Rhythmic activity was
   abolished by TTX and attenuated by application of gap junction blockers
   or by antagonists of GABA(A) receptors. Together these data indicate
   that this rhythm is an emergent feature of a population of spinal
   neurons coupled by gap junctions. This work questions the assumption
   that sympathetic rhythms are dependent on supraspinal pacemaker
   circuits, by highlighting a surprisingly strong rhythmogenic capability
   of the reduced sympathetic networks of the spinal cord slice. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Repeated boiling of vegetable oils at high temperature in cooking and
   frying is a very common practice and leads to the formation of a class
   of toxic substances. Among them, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
   are well-documented for their mutagenic/carcinogenic potential. The
   objectives of the present study were to evaluate the genotoxic and
   carcinogenic risks associated with the consumption of repeatedly boiled
   sunflower oil, which is one of the commonly consumed vegetable oils in
   southeast Asian countries. The presence of PAHs was analyzed using
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods in fresh,
   single-boiled, and repeatedly-boiled sunflower oil (FSO, SBSO, and RBSO)
   samples. A higher amount of known carcinogenic/mutagenic PAHs in RBSO
   samples were shown, as compared to FSO and SBSO. Oral administration of
   RBSO in Wistar rats resulted in significant induction of aberrant cells
   (p < 0.05) and micronuclei (p < 0.05) incidence in a dose-dependent
   manner. Oxidative stress analysis also showed a significant decrease in
   levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and
   catalase, with a concurrent increase in reactive oxygen species and
   lipid peroxidation in animals following RBSO consumption, as compared to
   FSO or SBSO (p < 0.05). Additionally, RBSO administration alone and
   along with diethylnitrosamine for 12 weeks induced altered hepatic foci,
   as noticed by the alteration in positive (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
   and glutathione-S-transferase) and negative (adenosine-triphosphatase,
   alkaline phosphatase, and glucose-6-phosphatase) liver biomarkers. A
   significant decrease in the relative and absolute hepatic weight in
   RBSO-supplemented rats was also noted (p < 0.05).}},

Abstract = {{Background: In Switzerland the extent to which patients with chronic
   illnesses receive care congruent with the Chronic Care Model (CCM) is
   unknown.
   Methods: According to guidelines we translated the Assessment of Chronic
   Illness Care (ACIC) into German (G-ACIC). We tested the instrument in
   different primary care settings and compared subscales with the original
   testing.
   Results: Difficulties encountered during the translation process
   consisted in the difference of health care settings in Switzerland and
   USA. However initial testing showed the G-ACIC to be a suitable
   instrument. The average ACIC subscale scores in Swiss managed care
   (MC)-, group (GP)- and single handed practices (SP) were higher for MC
   practices than for group- and single handed practices: Organization of
   the healthcare delivery system: MC mean (m) = 6.80 (SD 1.55), GP m =
   5.42 (SD 0.99), SP m = 4.60 (SD 2.07); community linkages: MC m = 4.19
   (SD 1.47), GP m = 4.83 (SD 1.81), SP m = 3.10 (SD 2.12); self-management
   support: MC m = 4.96 (SD 1.13), GP m = 4.73 (SD 1.40), SP m = 4.43 (SD
   1.34); decision support: MC m = 4.75 (SD 1.06); GP m = 4.20 (SD 0.87),
   SP m = 3.25 (SD 1.59); delivery system design: MC m = 5.98 (SD 1.61), GP
   m = 5.05 (SD 2.05), SP m = 3.86 (SD 1.51) and clinical information
   systems: MC m = 4.34 (SD = 2.49), GP m = 2.06 (SD 1.35), SP m = 3.20 (SD
   1.57).
   Conclusions: The G-ACIC is applicable and useful for comparing different
   health care settings in German speaking countries. Managed care
   organizations seem to implement the different components of the CCM in a
   greater extend than group and single handed practices. However, much
   room exists for further improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report the sequencing and analysis of eight complete
   mitochondrial genomes of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from each of the
   three established subspecies (P.t. troglodytes, P.t. schweinfurthii and
   P.t. verus) and the proposed fourth subspecies (P.t. ellioti). Our
   population genetic analyses are consistent with neutral patterns of
   evolution that have been shaped by demography. The high levels of mtDNA
   diversity in western chimpanzees are unlike those seen at nuclear loci,
   which may reflect a demographic history of greater female to male
   effective population sizes possibly owing to the characteristics of the
   founding population. By using relaxed-clock methods, we have inferred a
   time-tree of chimpanzee species and subspecies. The absolute divergence
   times vary based on the methods and calibration used, but relative
   divergence times show extensive uniformity. Overall, mtDNA produces

Abstract = {{Chromosome translocations induced by DNA damaging agents, such as
   ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapies, alter genetic information
   resulting in malignant transformation. Abrogation or loss of the
   ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, a DNA damage signaling
   regulator, increases the incidence of chromosome translocations.
   However, how ATM protects cells from chromosome translocations is still
   unclear. Chromosome translocations involving the MLL gene on 11q23 are
   the most frequent chromosome abnormalities in secondary leukemias
   associated with chemotherapy employing etoposide, a topoisomerase II
   poison. Here we show that ATM deficiency results in the excessive
   binding of the DNA recombination protein RAD51 at the translocation
   breakpoint hotspot of 11q23 chromosome translocation after etoposide
   exposure. Binding of Replication protein A (RPA) and the chromatin
   remodeler INO80, which facilitate RAD51 loading on damaged DNA, to the
   hotspot were also increased by ATM deficiency. Thus, in addition to
   activating DNA damage signaling, ATM may avert chromosome translocations
   by preventing excessive loading of recombinational repair proteins onto
   translocation breakpoint hotspots.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a design for a simple broad-angle polarization beam splitter
   (PBS) consisting of two rows of dielectric cylinders with different

   that TM polarized light is reflected totally by this PBS but TE
   polarized light passes through it freely in a broad incident angle range
   (from -50 degrees to 50 degrees). The PBS can work over a wide frequency
   range (from 0.22 x (c/a) to 0.28 x (c/a)) with a high efficiency.
   Moreover, the PBS structure has a novel capability of tolerance to large
   random disorder, which is very advantageous for practical applications.
   Even when a random disorder of 15\%a (a is space period) is introduced
   into the radius and position of each cylinder, the PBS structure can
   still maintain almost the same good performance and high splitting

Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{42}},
Pages = {{9024-9026}},

Abstract = {{The removal of damaged bases by DNA glycosylases is thought to be
   effectively irreversible, because of an overall equilibrium that favors
   hydrolysis over synthesis of the N-glycosyl bond. Surprisingly, human
   alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) can make damaged DNA by catalyzing
   formation of an N-glycosyl bond between 1,N-6-ethenoadenine (epsilon A)
   and abasic DNA. We attribute the ready reversibility of this glycosylase
   reaction to the exceptionally tight binding and slow subsequent
   hydrolysis of DNA containing an EA lesion. In principle, reversibility
   could provide a mechanism for direct reversal of base damage by a DNA
   glycosylase, allowing the glycosylase to bypass the rest of the base
   excision repair pathway.}},

Title = {{Transmission Intensity and Drug Resistance in Malaria Population
   Dynamics: Implications for Climate Change}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Although the spread of drug resistance and the influence of climate
   change on malaria are most often considered separately, these factors
   have the potential to interact through altered levels of transmission
   intensity. The influence of transmission intensity on the evolution of
   drug resistance has been addressed in theoretical studies from a
   population genetics' perspective; less is known however on how
   epidemiological dynamics at the population level modulates this
   influence. We ask from a theoretical perspective, whether population
   dynamics can explain non-trivial, non-monotonic, patterns of treatment
   failure with transmission intensity, and, if so, under what conditions.
   We then address the implications of warmer temperatures in an East
   African highland, where, as in other similar regions at the altitudinal
   edge of malaria's distribution, there has been a pronounced increase of
   cases from the 1970s to the 1990s. Our theoretical analyses, with a
   transmission model that includes different levels of immunity,
   demonstrate that an increase in transmission beyond a threshold can lead
   to a decrease in drug resistance, as previously shown {[}1], but that a
   second threshold may occur and lead to the re-establishment of drug
   resistance. Estimates of the increase in transmission intensity from the
   1970s to the 1990s for the Kenyan time series, obtained by fitting the
   two-stage version of the model with an explicit representation of vector
   dynamics, suggest that warmer temperatures are likely to have moved the
   system towards the first threshold, and in so doing, to have promoted
   the faster spread of drug resistance. Climate change and drug resistance
   can interact and need not be considered as alternative explanations for
   trends in disease incidence in this region. Non-monotonic patterns of
   treatment failure with transmission intensity similar to those described
   as the `valley phenomenon' for Uganda can result from epidemiological
   dynamics but under poorly understood assumptions.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: One of the proposed mechanisms of trastuzumab-induced
   regression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+)
   tumours includes facilitation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated
   cytotoxicity (ADCC). Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
   (GM-CSF) mediates ADCC. We presented our pilot study of adding GM-CSF to
   trastuzumab in patients with trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ metastatic
   breast cancer.
   METHODS: Patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer that progressed
   after trastuzumab +/- chemotherapy were continued on trastuzumab 2mg
   kg(-1) intravenous weekly and GM-CSF 250 mu g m(-2) subcutaneous daily.
   Patients were assessed for response every 8 weeks. Treatment was
   continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
   RESULTS: Seventeen patients were evaluable (median age 48 years, range
   27-75 years). The median number of metastatic sites was 2 (range 1-3);
   the most common site was the liver (n = 10). The median number of prior
   regimens for metastatic disease was 2 (range 1-5). No objective disease
   response was observed, but five patients (29\%) had stable disease for a
   median duration of 15.8 (range 10-53.9) weeks. The most common adverse
   event was rash at the injection site. No grade 4 or irreversible adverse
   event was seen.
   CONCLUSION: The addition of GM-CSF to trastuzumab alone had a modest
   clinical benefit and acceptable safety profile in heavily pretreated
   patients with trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ metastatic breast cancer.

Abstract = {{We report results of the first 3 x 3 ``multiangle{''} simulation of the
   evolution of neutrino flavor in the core-collapse supernova environment.
   In particular, we follow neutrino flavor transformation in the
   neutronization neutrino burst of an O-Ne-Mg core-collapse event. Though
   in a qualitative sense our results are consistent with those obtained in
   3 x 3 single-angle simulations, at least in terms of neutrino mass
   hierarchy dependence, performing multiangle calculations is found to
   reduce the adiabaticity of flavor evolution in the normal neutrino mass
   hierarchy, resulting in lower swap energies. Differences between
   single-angle and multiangle results are largest for the normal neutrino
   mass hierarchy. Our simulations also show that current uncertainties in
   the measured mass-squared and mixing angle parameters translate into
   uncertainties in neutrino swap energies. Our results show that at low
   theta(13) it may be difficult to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy
   using the O-Ne-Mg neutronization neutrino burst.}},

Abstract = {{The choice of reaction solvent has a major influence on the surface area
   and pore volume in conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) networks
   synthesized by Sonogashira-Hagihara palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling
   chemistry of aromatic dibromo monomers with 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene.
   Four solvents were evaluated for these reactions: N,N-dimethylformamide
   (DMF), 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and toluene. Networks
   synthesized in DMF tend to exhibit the highest surface areas (up to 1260
   m(2)/g), whereas those synthesized in toluene have on average
   significantly lower surface areas and pore volumes. By judicious choice
   of reaction solvent, microporous materials can he prepared which combine
   high surface area with a variety of functional groups of interest in
   applications such as gas storage, molecular separations, and catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the potential efficacy of
   hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in the
   prevention of epilepsy.
   Methods: This study was a population-based, nested case-control study
   among older adults in the province of Quebec, Canada. The primary cohort
   consisted of cardiovascular patients who had received a
   revascularization procedure. Within the cohort, those with the primary
   hospital diagnosis of epilepsy were identified (cases). Each case was
   matched to 10 controls by age and cohort entry time. Potential
   confounders were adjusted using a conditional logistic regression model.
   A sensitivity analysis was performed using propensity score matching.
   Results: The initial cohort consisted of 150,555 subjects. Within the
   cohort, 217 hospital-diagnosed cases of epilepsy and 2,170 corresponding
   controls were identified. The adjusted rate ratio (ARR) for epilepsy
   among current statin users was 0.65 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   0.46-0.92). The ARR for past users of statins was 0.72 (95\% CI
   0.39-1.30). No benefit was found for the control drug groups, including
   nonstatin cholesterol-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and
   angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (1.00 {[}95\% CI 0.45-2.20],
   1.04 {[}95\% CI 0.74-1.47], and 0.94 {[}95\% CI 0.66-1.33]).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that statin use decreases the risk of
   hospitalization for epilepsy. Because of its observational nature, this
   study requires future research to confirm these intriguing findings.

Abstract = {{Nanofluidic transport in lab-on-chip devices requires nanochannels that
   are difficult to fabricate since they require challenging top-down
   technological approaches. We present a bottom-up, scalable, low-cost,
   and robust alternative to construct large areas of extremely homogeneous
   Pillared Planar Nanochannels (PPNs) for nanofluidic applications. Their
   unique structure is made of mesoporous titanosilicate pillars, of 20 nm
   in diameter, supporting a continuous sealing layer of the same material.
   This complex hierarchical structure is achievable when combining diverse
   bottom-up processing strategies that include self-assembly of block
   copolymer, nanostructured sol-gel coatings, and highly controlled liquid
   deposition processing, with powerful top-down techniques such as deep
   X-ray lithography. While these novel materials are of interest for many
   nanotechnological applications, we focus on their ability to guide
   fluids through natural capillary forces, for which the classical
   Washburn's model of diffusion is verified. These systems are the first
   promising example of fully mesoporous materials applied to nanofluidics,
   thus opening the ``lab-on-chip{''} domain to mesofluidics.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{We conducted an association study across the human leukocyte antigen
   (HLA) complex to identify loci associated with multiple sclerosis (MS).
   Comparing 1927 SNPs in 1618 MS cases and 3413 controls of European
   ancestry, we identified seven SNPs that were independently associated
   with MS conditional on the others (each P <= 4 x 10(-6)). All
   associations were significant in an independent replication cohort of
   2212 cases and 2251 controls (P <= 0.001) and were highly significant in
   the combined dataset (P <= 6 x 10(-8)). The associated SNPs included
   proxies for HLA-DRB1{*}15:01 and HLA-DRB1{*}03:01, and SNPs in moderate
   linkage disequilibrium (LD) with HLA-A{*}02:01, HLA-DRB1{*}04:01 and
   HLA-DRB1{*}13:03. We also found a strong association with rs9277535 in
   the class II gene HLA-DPB1 (discovery set P = 9 x 10(-9), replication
   set P = 7 x 10(-4), combined P = 2 x 10(-10)). HLA-DPB1 is located
   centromeric of the more commonly typed class II genes HLA-DRB1, -DQA1
   and -DQB1. It is separated from these genes by a recombination hotspot,
   and the association is not affected by conditioning on genotypes at
   DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1. Hence rs9277535 represents an independent
   MS-susceptibility locus of genomewide significance. It is correlated
   with the HLA-DPB1{*}03:01 allele, which has been implicated previously
   in MS in smaller studies. Further genotyping in large datasets is
   required to confirm and resolve this association.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1{*}0602 allele is
   closely associated with narcolepsy, a neurologic disorder characterized
   by excessive daytime sleepiness, fragmented sleep, and shortened REM
   sleep latency. We evaluated whether DQB1{*}0602 was a novel marker of
   interindividual differences by determining its relationship to sleep
   homeostatic, sleepiness, and cognitive responses to baseline and chronic
   partial sleep deprivation (PSD) conditions.
   Methods: Ninety-two DQB1{*}0602-negative and 37 DQB1{*}0602-positive
   healthy adults participated in a protocol of 2 baseline 10 hours time in
   bed (TIB) nights followed by 5 consecutive 4 hours TIB nights.
   DQB1{*}0602 allelic frequencies did not differ significantly between
   Caucasians and African Americans.
   Results: During baseline, although DQB1{*}0602-positive subjects were
   subjectively sleepier and more fatigued, they showed greater sleep
   fragmentation, and decreased sleep homeostatic pressure and
   differentially sharper declines during the night (measured by non-REM
   EEG slow-wave energy {[}SWE]). During PSD, DQB1{*}0602-positive subjects
   were sleepier and showed more fragmented sleep, despite SWE elevation
   comparable to negative subjects. Moreover, they showed differentially
   greater REM sleep latency reductions and smaller stage 2 reductions,
   along with differentially greater increases in fatigue. Both groups
   demonstrated comparable cumulative decreases in cognitive performance.
   Conclusions: DQB1{*}0602 positivity in a healthy population may
   represent a continuum of some sleep-wake features of narcolepsy.
   DQB1{*}0602 was associated with interindividual differences in sleep
   homeostasis, physiologic sleep, sleepiness, and fatigue-but not in
   cognitive measures-during baseline and chronic PSD. Thus, DQB1{*}0602
   may represent a genetic biomarker for predicting such individual
   differences in basal and sleep loss conditions. Neurology (R)

Abstract = {{Poly(2,6-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)dithieno-
   {[}3,2-b;2',3'-d]-thiophene)s represent a new class of
   solution-processable polymer semiconductors for organic thin-film
   transistors. This class of polymer semiconductors offers not only high
   field-effect transistor mobility, but also processability from
   relatively nontoxic, environmentally friendlier solvents. Thin-film
   transistors utilizing these polymer semiconductors fabricated even from
   environmentally friendlier organic solvents of generally low solvency
   such as hexane and toluene have exhibited high field-effect mobility and
   current on/off ratio as well as excellent thermal stability and high
   resistance to photoinduced oxidative doping. This is in sharp contrast
   to most high-mobility polymer semiconductors, which require toxic
   chlorinated aromatic solvents for fabrication to achieve high mobility.
   The use of relatively nontoxic processing solvent would eliminate the
   safety concerns associated with use of chlorinated aromatic solvents,
   potentially enabling low-cost mass manufacturing processes for thin-film
   transistor devices.}},

Abstract = {{A series of poly(ethylene glycol-co-isopropylidene glyceryl glycidyl
   ether) (P(EO-co-IGG)) random copolymers with different fractions of
   1,2-isopropylidene glyceryl glycidyl ether (IGG) units was synthesized.
   After acidic hydrolysis a new type of ``functional PEGs{''}, namely
   poly(ethylene glycol-co-glyceryl glycerol) (P(EO-co-GG)) was obtained.
   Using an initiator that releases a terminal amino moiety after
   deprotection, functional end groups with orthogonal reactivity to the
   in-chain groups were obtained. All polymers showed narrow molecular
   weight distributions (1.07-1.19), and control of the molecular weights
   was achieved in the range 5000-30 000 g/mol. Random incorporation of
   both comonomers was verified by monitoring the copolymerization kinetics
   via real-time H-1 NMR spectroscopy during the polymerization and by
   characterization of the triad sequence distribution, relying on C-13 NMR
   analysis. Using the 1,2-diol component of the side chains allows for
   attachment and facile acid-catalyzed release of molecules bearing
   ketone/aldehyde functionalities. This renders the materials potentially
   useful as support for reagents, drugs or catalysts. This was
   demonstrated using benzaldehyde as a model compound. DSC was carried out
   on all samples, showing amorphous structures upon incorporation of IGG
   fractions exceeding 15\%.}},

Title = {{Regulation of 3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinase 1 Activity by
   Homodimerization in Live Cells}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE SIGNALING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) plays a central role in
   regulating the activity of protein kinases that are essential for
   signaling; however, how PDK1 itself is regulated is largely unknown. We
   found that homodimerization of PDK1 is a spatially and temporally
   regulated mechanism for controlling PDK1 activity. We used Forster
   resonance energy transfer monitored by fluorescence lifetime imaging
   microscopy to observe PDK1 homodimerization in live cells. A pleckstrin
   homology (PH) domain-dependent, basal dimeric association of PDK1 was
   increased upon cell stimulation with growth factors; this association
   was prevented by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor and by a
   mutation in, or a complete deletion of, the PH domain of PDK1. The
   distinct spatial distribution of PDK1 homodimers relative to that of
   heterodimers of PDK1 and protein kinase B (PKB), and the ability of
   monomeric mutants of PDK1 to phosphorylate PKB, suggested that the
   monomer was the active conformation. Mutation of the autophosphorylation
   residue threonine-513 to glutamate, which was predicted to destabilize
   the homodimer interface, enhanced the interaction between PDK1 and PKB
   and the activity of PKB. Through in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence
   intensity and anisotropy measurements, combined with existing crystal
   structures and computational molecular modeling, we determined the
   geometrical arrangement of the PDK1 homodimer. With this approach, we
   calculated the size of the population of PDK1 dimers in cells. This
   description of a previously uncharacterized regulatory mechanism for the
   activation of PDK1 offers possibilities for controlling PDK1 activity
   therapeutically.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Macrophages contribute to the progression and acute
   complications of atherosclerosis. Macrophage imaging may serve as a
   biomarker to identify subclinical inflamed lesions, to predict future
   risk, and to aid in the assessment of novel therapies.
   Methods and Results-To test the hypothesis that nanoparticle-enhanced,
   high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can measure plaque
   macrophage accumulation, we used 3-T MRI with a macrophage-targeted
   superparamagnetic nanoparticle preparation (monocrystalline iron oxide
   nanoparticles-47 {[}MION-47]) in cholesterol-fed New Zealand White
   rabbits 6 months after balloon injury. In vivo MRI visualized thickened
   abdominal aortas on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images (T1 spin
   echo, 20 axial slices per animal; T2 spin echo, 28 slices per animal).
   Seventy-two hours after MION-47 injection, aortas exhibited lower T2
   signal intensity compared with before contrast imaging (signal intensity
   ratio, aortic wall/muscle: before, 1.44 +/- 0.26 versus after, 0.95 +/-
   0.22; 164 slices; P<0.01), whereas T1 spin echo images showed no
   significant change. MRI on ex vivo specimens provided similar results.
   Histological studies colocalized iron accumulation with immunoreactive
   macrophages in atheromata. The magnitude of signal intensity reduction
   on T2 spin echo in vivo images further correlated with macrophage areas
   in situ (150 slices; r=0.73). Treatment with rosuvastatin for 3 months
   yielded diminished macrophage content (P<0.05) and reversed T2 signal
   intensity changes (P<0.005). Signal changes in rosuvastatin-treated
   rabbits correlated with reduced macrophage burden (r=0.73). In vitro
   validation studies showed concentration-dependent MION-47 uptake by
   human primary macrophages.
   Conclusion-The magnitude of T2 signal intensity reduction in
   high-resolution MRI after administration of superparamagnetic
   phagocytosable nanoparticles can assess macrophage burden in atheromata,
   providing a clinically translatable tool to identify inflamed plaques
   and to monitor therapy-mediated changes in plaque inflammation.

Title = {{Immunocontraception in Wild Horses (Equus caballus) Extends Reproductive
   Cycling Beyond the Normal Breeding Season}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although the physiological effects of immunocontraceptive
   treatment with porcine zona pellucida (PZP) have been well studied,
   little is known about PZP's effects on the scheduling of reproductive
   cycling. Recent behavioral research has suggested that recipients of PZP
   extend the receptive breeding period into what is normally the
   non-breeding season.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To determine if this is the case, we
   compiled foaling data from wild horses (Equus caballus) living on
   Shackleford Banks, North Carolina for 4 years pre- and 8 years
   post-contraception management with PZP (pre-contraception, n = 65 births
   from 45 mares; post-contraception, n = 97 births from 46 mares).
   Gestation lasts approximately 11-12 months in wild horses, placing
   conception at approximately 11.5 months prior to birth. Since the
   contraception program began in January 2000, foaling has occurred over a
   significantly broader range than it had before the contraception
   program. Foaling in PZP recipients (n = 45 births from 27 mares) has
   consistently occurred over a broader range than has foaling in
   non-recipients (n = 52 births from 19 mares). In addition, current
   recipients of PZP foaled later in the year than did prior recipient and
   non-recipient mares. Females receiving more consecutive PZP applications
   gave birth later in the season than did females receiving fewer
   applications. Finally, the efficacy of PZP declined with increasing
   consecutive applications before reaching 100\% after five consecutive
   applications.
   Conclusions/Significance: For a gregarious species such as the horse,
   the extension of reproductive cycling into the fall months has important
   social consequences, including decreased group stability and the
   extension of male reproductive behavior. In addition, reproductive
   cycling into the fall months could have long-term effects on foal
   survivorship. Managers should consider these factors before enacting
   immunocontraceptive programs in new populations. We suggest minor
   alterations to management strategies to help alleviate such unintended
   effects in new populations.}},

Abstract = {{Using first-principles electronic-structure calculations, we studied the
   structural and magnetic properties of various hydrogen clusters,
   including hydrogen monomer, dimers, trimers, tetramers, and hexamers
   adsorbed on a graphene surface. The magnetic behaviors of such defective
   systems were shown to strongly depend on the geometrical configuration
   of hydrogen atoms. The stability of the structures was demonstrated to
   be dependent on two important factors: the distance between hydrogen
   atoms and the strength of exchange couplings between the defect-induced
   magnetic moments. For the magnetic structures, the electron spins
   populate the quasilocalized p(z)-type states on specific carbon atoms.
   The presence of such quasilocalized p(z)-type states was shown to yield
   relatively strong hyperfine couplings at particular carbon sites in the
   neighborhood of hydrogen atoms.}},

Abstract = {{Studies to define the effects of estrogens on immune function have
   yielded conflicting results. The recent demonstration that GPR30 can
   mediate rapid non-genomic events and may function as a novel
   transmembrane estrogen receptor could provide a mechanism underlying
   such findings. In this study, we have investigated the ability of GPR30
   to regulate cell-surface expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a
   key molecule in the perception of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by
   immune cells. We show that 17 beta-estradiol or GPR30-specific agonists
   decrease TLR4 expression on macrophages within 10-60 min and such
   effects were abolished following GPR30 knockdown. Importantly, GPR30
   ligation significantly reduces sensitivity of these immune cells to LPS
   challenge as determined by reductions in inflammatory mediator
   production. Based on these findings, we suggest that estrogen may
   utilize this non-classical estrogen receptor to limit potentially lethal
   acute inflammatory responses without compromising long-term host
   defense. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear evolution of an interface subject to a parallel shear flow
   is studied by the vortex sheet model. We perform long-time computations
   for the vortex sheet in density-stratified fluids by using the point
   vortex method and investigate late-time dynamics of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
   instability. We apply an adaptive point insertion procedure and a
   high-order shock-capturing scheme to the vortex method to handle the
   nonuniform distribution of point vortices and enhance the resolution.
   Our adaptive vortex method successfully simulates chaotically distorted
   interfaces of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability with fine resolutions.
   The numerical results show that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability evolves
   a secondary instability at a late time, distorting the internal rollup,
   and eventually develops to a disordered structure.}},

   close in time to the SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband

   whether there are significant temperature effects in the upper

   precipitation. During both May/June and October/November 2003, we found
   a temperature increase related to particle precipitation at all heights
   above 100 km. In general, we did not find a consistent immediate

Abstract = {{A new genus and species of Amphipoda is reported from inland ground
   waters of the Sultanate of Oman. AlthoughGlyptogidiella omanica gen. et
   sp. nov. exhibits several features typical of the Bogidiellidae (i. e.
   combined display of distinct carpal lobe on first gnathopod, reduced
   pleopodal rami, and unsegmented exopodite of third uropod), its
   exceptionally large fifth coxal plate and short rami of third uropod do
   not fit in the restricted diagnosis of the family as recently presented
   elsewhere. In fact, the enlarged coxal plate V is a feature not reported
   in any other amphipod, whereas no other bogidiellid displays an expanded
   basis on pereopod VII. The habitus of Glyptogidiella is not typical for
   a dweller of a true interstitial niche, with its short antennae, large
   coxal plate and short and stubby rami on the third uropod. This suggests
   that the interstitial medium could not be the primary habitat for the
   species, and that the underground of wadis might contain interstices of
   large size and could also be in contact with karstic hollows.}},

Abstract = {{In regions with frequent water stress and large aquifer systems
   groundwater is often used as an additional water source. If groundwater
   abstraction exceeds the natural groundwater recharge for extensive areas
   and long times, overexploitation or persistent groundwater depletion
   occurs. Here we provide a global overview of groundwater depletion (here
   defined as abstraction in excess of recharge) by assessing groundwater
   recharge with a global hydrological model and subtracting estimates of
   groundwater abstraction. Restricting our analysis to sub-humid to arid
   areas we estimate the total global groundwater depletion to have
   increased from 126 (+/- 32) km(3) a(-1) in 1960 to 283 (+/- 40) km(3)
   a(-1) in 2000. The latter equals 39 (+/- 10)\% of the global yearly
   groundwater abstraction, 2 (+/- 0.6)\% of the global yearly groundwater
   recharge, 0.8 (+/- 0.1)\% of the global yearly continental runoff and
   0.4 (+/- 0.06)\% of the global yearly evaporation, contributing a
   considerable amount of 0.8 (+/- 0.1) mm a(-1) to current sea-level rise.

Abstract = {{A set of conjugated oligo- and polytluorene-tethered fac-Ir(ppy)(3)
   complexes were synthesized, In addition to steady-state absorption and
   emission, time-resolved emission spectroscopy was used to systematically
   study the correlation of photophysical properties with chemical
   structures. A chain length dependency study showed that both radiative
   and nonradiative triplet decay rates, as well as the phosphorescence
   quantum yield, decreased with increasing chain length of the appended
   oligofluorene. Notably, the complex with oligofluorene tethered to the
   pyridine tiara to phenyl ring possessed a substantially higher
   phosphorescence quantum efficiency and shorter lifetime than those of an
   isomeric complex with the oligofluorene linked to the phenyl ring para
   to pyridine. Nonetheless, both these two oligomer complexes exhibited an
   excited state of mixed MLCT. (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) and LC
   (ligand-centered) transitions, whereas another isomeric complex having
   an oligofluorene appended to the phenyl ring pant to the iridium ion
   exhibited a particularly long triplet lifetime (> 100 mu s), indicative
   of a (LC)-L-3 excited state. A moderately high quantum yield (similar to
   0.5) was displayed by this (LC)-L-3-featured phosphor. DEL calculations
   substantiated the proposition that the attachment of oligofluorene to
   Ir(ppy)(3) at different positions resulted in varied molecular orbitals,
   with different relative contribution of MLCT to the emissive excited
   state. Hence, photophysical properties such as radiative decay rate,
   lifetime, and quantum yield, etc., were all influenced by the
   substitution isomerism. As these results indicated that if short
   lifetime and fast radiative decay were desired, among different
   substitution patterns appending the conjugated chain to the pyridine
   unit was the most favorable. Thus, star-shaped complexes with an oligo-
   or polyfluorene tethered to each of the three pyridine units of
   Ir(ppy)(3) were prepared. In such a structure, the tris-cyclometalated
   iridium effected nearly complete intersystem crossing (ISC) in all three
   ligands across three fluorene units, without compromising the
   phosphorescence quantum yield. But the study showed that further
   extending the conjugated ligand resulted in partial ISC or even complete
   loss of capacity for ISC beyond a certain distance.}},

Abstract = {{Tetherin/BST2 is a type-II membrane protein that inhibits the release of
   a range of enveloped viruses, including HIV-1. Here we report three
   crystal structures of human tetherin, including the full-length
   ectodomain, a triple cysteine mutant and an ectodomain truncation. These
   structures show that tetherin forms a continuous alpha helix
   encompassing almost the entire ectodomain. Tetherin helices dimerize
   into parallel coiled coils via interactions throughout the C-terminal
   portion of the ectodomain. A comparison of the multiple structures of
   the tetherin dimer reveals inherent constrained flexibility at two
   hinges positioned at residues A88 and G109. In the crystals, two
   tetherin ectodomain dimers associate into a tetramer by forming an
   antiparallel four-helix bundle at their N termini. However, mutagenesis
   studies suggest that the tetrametric form of tetherin, although
   potentially contributing to, is not essential for its antiviral
   activity. Nonetheless, the structural and chemical properties of the N
   terminus of the ectodomain are important for optimal tethering function.
   This study provides detailed insight into the mechanisms by which this
   broad-spectrum antiviral restriction factor can function.}},

   deposited after the starting solution was aged for twelve days. The
   films fit well with the hexagonal, wurtzite-type ZnO structure, with a

   a consequence of the aging of the solution. An average crystallite size
   varied between 17.3 and 22.8 nm due to aging effect, and some variations
   in surface morphology were encountered. All the films are highly

Abstract = {{X-ray diffraction and reflectivity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
   spectroscopic ellipsometry were applied to study the initial
   composition, thickness, lattice structure and refractive index of
   `fresh' and annealed thin SiOx films (similar to 15 nm) on crystalline
   silicon substrates, prepared by thermal evaporation of SiO in vacuum. It
   has been ascertained that the film thickness and composition (x = 1.3)
   of the `fresh' films are very close to the values set during the
   deposition. It has been shown that furnace annealing of the films at
   1000 degrees C causes phase separation, film densification and small
   modification of the Si-SiOx interface. Transmission electron microscopy
   results have proven that a self-assembling process leads to formation of
   Si nanocrystals with a diameter of similar to 4-5 nm and to epitaxial
   overgrowth of the Si substrate, increasing the c-Si/SiOx interface
   transition region to 6-7 monolayers. The nanocrystals are randomly
   distributed in an amorphous SiO2 matrix being closer to the Si-SiOx
   interface. Formation of tunnel oxide layer with a thickness of 3-5 nm
   has been found upon annealing. Clockwise hysteresis has been observed in
   the capacitance-voltage characteristics measured which has been
   explained by assuming charging and discharging of the nanocrystals with
   holes, which tunnel from the Si substrate. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Formalization of taxon-based constraints to detect inconsistencies in
   annotation and ontology development}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Gene Ontology project supports categorization of gene
   products according to their location of action, the molecular functions
   that they carry out, and the processes that they are involved in.
   Although the ontologies are intentionally developed to be taxon neutral,
   and to cover all species, there are inherent taxon specificities in some
   branches. For example, the process `lactation' is specific to mammals
   and the location `mitochondrion' is specific to eukaryotes. The lack of
   an explicit formalization of these constraints can lead to errors and
   inconsistencies in automated and manual annotation.
   Results: We have formalized the taxonomic constraints implicit in some
   GO classes, and specified these at various levels in the ontology. We
   have also developed an inference system that can be used to check for
   violations of these constraints in annotations. Using the constraints in
   conjunction with the inference system, we have detected and removed
   errors in annotations and improved the structure of the ontology.
   Conclusions: Detection of inconsistencies in taxon-specificity enables
   gradual improvement of the ontologies, the annotations, and the
   formalized constraints. This is progressively improving the quality of
   our data. The full system is available for download, and new constraints
   or proposed changes to constraints can be submitted online at
   https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=605890\&group\_id=36855.}},

Abstract = {{The organoantimony(III) and organobismuth(III) sulfides (LMS)(2) (L =
   NCN chelating ligand, C6H3-2,6-(CH2NMe2)(2); M = Sb (1), Bi (2)) are
   dimeric in the solid state. Nevertheless, their monomeric structures
   with terminal Sb S and Bi-S bonds present in solution were trapped by
   {[}2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with CS2, giving the molecular
   trithiocarbonates LMS2C=S (M = Sb (3), Bi (4)). Both compounds were
   characterized in the solid state by X-ray diffraction techniques on both
   single crystals and powder material and by IR spectroscopy. Carbon
   disulfide can be easily eliminated from the trithiocarbonates 3 and 4 by
   heating to 120 degrees C ( for 3) and 160 degrees C ( for 4) to recover
   the starting sulfides 1 and 2. In solution, trithiocarbonates 3 and 4
   exist in equilibrium with starting sulfides 1 and 2, but this
   equilibrium may be shifted to pure 3 and 4 by addition of an excess of
   CS2, as shown by H-1 NMR spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the far-infrared spectral range presents a novel approach for
   analysis of the hydrogen bonding in proteins. Here it is presented for
   the analysis of Fe S vibrations (500-200 cm(-1)) and of the intra- and
   intermolecular hydrogen bonding signature (300-50 cm(-1)) in the Rieske
   protein from Thermus thermophilus as a function of temperature and pH.
   Three pH values were adequately chosen in order to study all the
   possible protonation states of the coordinating histidines. The Fe S
   vibrations showed pH-dependent shifts in the FIR spectra in line with
   the change of protonation state of the histidines coordinating the
   {[}2Fe-2S] cluster. Measurements of the low-frequency signals between
   300 and 30 K demonstrated the presence of a distinct overall hydrogen
   bonding network and a more rigid structure for a pH higher than 10. To
   further support the analysis, the redox-dependent shifts of the
   secondary structure were investigated by means of an electrochemically
   induced FTIR difference spectroscopic approach in the mid infrared. The
   results confirmed a clear pH dependency and an influence of the
   immediate environment of the cluster on the secondary structure. The
   results support the hypothesis that structure-mediated changes in the
   environment of iron sulfur centers play a critical role in regulating
   enzymatic catalysis. The data point towards the role of the overall
   internal hydrogen bonding organization for the geometry and the
   electronic properties of the cluster.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study online maximization and minimization knapsack
   problems with limited cuts, in which (1) items are given one by one over
   time, i.e., after a decision is made on the current item, the next one
   is given, (2) items are allowed to be cut at most k (>= 1) times, and
   (3) items are allowed to be removed from the knapsack.
   We obtain the following three results.
   (i) For the maximization knapsack problem, we propose a (k +
   1)/k-competitive online algorithm, and show that it is the best
   possible, i.e., no online algorithm can have a competitive ratio less
   than (k 1)/k.
   (ii) For the minimization knapsack problem, we show that no online
   algorithm can have a constant competitive ratio.
   (iii) We extend the result in (i) to the resource augmentation model,
   where an online algorithm is allowed to use a knapsack of capacity m
   (>1), while the optimal algorithm uses a unit capacity knapsack. (C)

Abstract = {{In the present work, accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process was used as
   an effective alternative method for manufacturing high-strength, finely
   dispersed and highly uniform copper/alumina metal matrix composite
   (MMC). The microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of the
   Cu/15 vol.\% Al2O3 composite during various ARB cycles are reported. The
   produced MMC by nine ARB cycles showed a homogeneous distribution and
   strong bonding between particles and matrix without any porosity. Also,
   it was found that when the number of cycles increased, not only did
   elongation increase but also the tensile strength of the composite
   improved by 2.5 times compared to that of the annealed copper used as
   the original raw material. Strengthening in the produced composites was
   explained by strain hardening, grain refinement, reinforcing role of
   particles, uniformity, bonding quality and size of particles. The
   findings also revealed that after the first cycle, hardness rapidly
   increased, then dwindled and finally saturated by further rolling. (C)

Abstract = {{Fibre Multi-Object Spectrograph (FMOS) is the first near-infrared
   instrument with a wide field of view capable of acquiring spectra
   simultaneously from up to 400 objects. It has been developed as a
   common-use instrument for the F/2 prime-focus of the Subaru Telescope.
   The field coverage of 30' diameter is achieved using a new 3-element
   corrector optimized in the near-infrared (0.9-1.8 mu m) wavelength
   range. Due to limited space at the prime-focus, we have had to develop a
   novel fibre positioner, called ``Echidna{''}, together with two
   OH-airglow suppressed spectrographs. FMOS consists of three subsystems:
   the prime focus unit for IR, the fibre positioning system/connector
   units, and the two spectrographs. After full systems integration, FMOS
   was installed on the telescope in late 2007. Many aspects of the
   performance were checked through various test and engineering
   observations. In this paper, we present the optical and mechanical
   components of FMOS, and show the results of our on-sky engineering
   observations to date.}},
