Abstract = {{We consider two coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations, the (1+1) and
   the (2+1)-dimensional and concentrate basically on the question as to
   whether there exists a stable, self-trapped solution. The positive
   answer is obtained within the variational and the numerical method.
   Namely, it is observed that neither spreading nor catastrophic
   self-focusing can develop and an oscillating, self-trapped solution
   arises. Numerical results show, in contradiction to the variational
   ones, that amplitudes of those oscillations decrease with propagation
   distance and for sufficiently large distances they vanish to zero.}},

Abstract = {{A vast range of sources, from chronicles, hagiography and the liturgy to
   medical manuscripts and charters, is at our disposal for the study of
   health and healing in Italy between the ninth and eleventh centuries.
   What is needed in order to exploit this material is a methodology for
   the careful examination of sources in their regional, social and
   political context. I focus on what hagiography can contribute to the
   study of medicine and disease, discussing in detail two ninth-century
   episcopal hagiographies, the Milanese second Vita Ambrosii, and the Vita
   Barbati from Benevento in southern Italy. At the same time, however, I
   stress the limitations of studying texts in isolation, given that one
   region, city, or community could be simultaneously producing a number of
   different kinds of evidence, with possibly more than one view of
   sickness and healing. There is great potential for medical history in
   further investigation of the archaeological, liturgical, and charter
   evidence from early medieval Italy. The study of all surviving
   manuscripts from this period, not just medical works, can provide a
   bridge between the detailed examination of a particular text and a
   discussion of the wider literary and cultural traditions into which they
   fitted.}},

Title = {{The composition of solid solutions crystallising from aqueous solutions:
   the influence of supersaturation and growth mechanisms}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{168}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{195-210}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we present a new approach to the problem of the
   crystallisation in solid solution-aqueous solution (SS-AS) systems, in
   which two main controlling factors have been considered: (i) the
   supersaturation state of the multicomponent solution in contact with the
   growing crystal and (ii) the growth mechanisms, operating at a molecular
   scale on the various faces of the crystal. Supersaturation has been
   evaluated as a function of the solid solution (the beta function) and
   the transitional supersaturation between spiral growth and two
   dimensional nucleation mechanisms has been considered as a linear
   function of the solid composition (the beta {*} line). By superimposing
   beta functions and beta {*} line on a supersaturation-solid composition
   diagram, we can define compositional regions growing according to
   different growth mechanisms. In order to test our model, a number of in
   situ Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) experiments have been conducted in
   the Ba2+-Sr2+-SO42--H2O system, using barite (001) as the substrate. The
   general growth behaviour observed is consistent with the predictions
   given for a number of initial aqueous solution compositions. Microprobe
   analysis shows that the new (001) layers grown under conditions where
   the maximum supersaturation corresponded to intermediate compositions of
   the (Ba,Sr)SO4 solid are very Sr-rich. A qualitative explanation for
   such a compositional shift is given on the basis of nucleation rate
   calculations in the Ba2+-Sr2+-SO42--H2O system. Finally we discuss the
   effect of the substrate on the formation and distribution of
   two-dimensional (Ba,Sr)SO4 nuclei on a barite (001) surface. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Female F344 rats treated chronically with diethylstilbestrol (DES)
   develop prolactin (PRL)-producing pituitary tumors. These tumors are
   larger in female than in male rats. To investigate gender differences in
   DES-induced pituitary tumor formation, we employed female and male rats
   and neonatally androgenized females, which received 100 mu g of
   testosterone propionate (TP) after birth. At 3 months of age, all rats
   were deprived of their gonads and divided into control and DES-treated
   groups. Forty days after beginning treatment, control pituitary weight
   and serum PRL were similar in gonadectomized males (GDX), ovariectomized
   females (OVX) and androgenized-ovariectomized females (OVX + TP), but
   weight of DES-induced tumors was 2.5-fold higher and serum PRL 5.6-fold
   higher in OVX + DES than in GDX + DES or OXV + TP + DES (p < 0.001). At
   the pituitary level, nuclear estrogen receptors (NE2R) amounted to >100
   fmol/mg DNA in all rats receiving DES. However, NE2R were lower in OVX +
   DES (101.3 +/- 9.0 fmol/mg DNA) than in GDX + DES (174.6 +/- 16.8; p <
   0.05) and in OXV + DES + TP (150.3 +/- 27.7; p < 0.05). A similar
   profile was found for cytosolic progestin receptors. Using electron
   microscopy (EM), hyperplasia/hypertrophy of lactotropes was found in all
   DES-stimulated pituitaries. However, tumors of OVX + DES rats were
   enriched in hyperstimulated typical lactotropes, i.e., cells with high
   rate of hormonal synthesis, processing and secretion. Instead, tumors
   from GDX + DES and OVX + TP + DES rats were a mixture of typical and
   atypical lactotropes, i.e. a cell subpopulation with refractory
   secretory response and a few gonadotropes. In agreement with these data,
   immunoreactive pituitary PRL was lower in OVX + DES than in OVX + TP +
   DES and GDX + DES groups. Thus, differences in the sensitivity to DES,
   serum and tumor PRL, NE2R and progestin receptors between estrogenized
   female rats on one side and male and TP-androgenized females on the
   other, may by due in part to heterogeneity of cell populations. Our data
   further suggest that neonatal hypothalamic exposure to androgens, as in
   normal males or androgenized females with masculinization of
   hypothalamic centers, may condition the response to DES stimulation
   later in life. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{A series of covalently bound peptide-protoporphyrin-peptide compounds,
   also carrying naphthalene (N) to allow a photophysical investigation,
   were synthesized Their general formula is P(nN)(2), where P refers to
   protoporphyrin IX, and n to the number of amino acids in the sequence
   Boc-Leu-Leu-Lys-(Ala)(x)-Leu-Leu-Lys of each backbone chain (x = 0-3; n
   = x + 6). Their structural features in methanol solution were
   investigated by ir and CD spectra, and by steady-state and time resolved
   fluorescence experiments as well. The ir spectra indicate that
   intramolecularly H-bonded conformations form, and CD data in both
   methanol and water-methanol mixture suggest the presence of alpha-helix
   structure. Quenching of excited naphthalene takes place by electronic
   energy transfer from singlet N{*} to P ground state. Fluorescence decays
   coupled with molecular mechanics calculations indicate that two
   conformers for each dimeric peptide are the major contributors to the
   observed phenomena. These conformers are characterized by a globular,
   protein-like structure, where the protoporphyrin resides in a central
   packet, while the two N groups are externally situated. Of the four N
   linkages in the two conformers, three of them attain a very similar
   steric arrangement around the central P molecule, in terms of both
   center-to-center distance and mutual orientation, while the fourth
   experiences a different steric disposition as compared to the others.
   Experimental photophysical parameters satisfactorily compare with those
   obtained by theoretical calculations, within the Forster mechanism for
   long-range energy transfer, only when the mutual orientation of the
   chromosomes was also taken into account. This implies that
   interconversion among conformational substates of probes linkages is
   slow on the time scale of the energy transfer process. (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{Introduction. Sexually transmitted diseases due to a sexual abuse cause
   are rarely documented in black Africa. The purpose of this study was to
   demonstrate the existence of sexual abuse in young girls with gonorrhea
   observed in Lome (Togo).
   Patients and methods, A cross-sectional study was conducted to document
   cases of sexually transmitted diseases diagnosed in young children (0 to
   11 years of age) seen at the dermato-venereology unit of the Lome
   teaching hospital over a 20 month period. Syphilis serology (TPHA-VDRL)
   and HIV serology were carried out for all children with sexually
   transmitted disease and repeated after two weeks for TPHA-VDRL, and
   three months for HIV serology in children who had been sexually abused.
   Results. During this period, 13 of 33 cases of sexually transmitted
   diseases diagnosed in young children were gonorrhea (mean age 7.2 +/-
   2.7 yean). It was due to sexual abuse in 12 cases tall in young girls).
   The abuser was a domestic employee in the child's home (n = 3), a member
   of the child's family (n = 7), an educator (n = 1), a neighbor (n = 1).
   Mean age of the alledged authors of sexual abuse was 25.7 +/- 5.5 year
   Syphilis serology was negative, but one case of HIV infection in a
   10-year-old girl was observed with identification of the contaminator.
   Conclusion. The results of this study confirm that sexual abuse in
   children is not an uncommon occurrence in black Africa and that it often
   leads to gonorrhea. The classic consequences of such abuse are
   aggravated by the high prevalence of HIV infection observed in the
   majority of the countries in black Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Layers of various metals (M) buried in Si, SiO2 or Al2O3 were irradiated
   with various fluences of heavy MeV ions in order to obtain either
   silicides or nanometric particles that are expected to exhibit
   interesting optical properties. The mixing of noble metals, Fe and Er
   with these matrices proceeds either via isotropic diffusion in the metal
   layer or the growth of compound particles by planar diffusion or a dual
   mechanism involving recoil implantation and radiation-enhanced diffusion
   of M atoms in the matrix. Noble metals form clusters in the oxides
   directly by lateral segregation and by reprecipitation after diffusing
   over some distance. Both types of clusters contribute to the absorption
   resonance of the metal plasmon in the visible part of the spectrum, so
   that the absorption intensity is not a simple function of the mixing
   yield. Irradiation of co-sputtered SiO2: M layers with a low ion fluence
   induces more homogeneous precipitation and provides these layers with as
   interesting optical properties as those obtained by mixing. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The Flory-Huggins equation has been used to model the equilibrium phase
   behaviour of a solvent-modified epoxy resin intended for the fabrication
   of porous components by chemically induced phase separation followed by
   evacuation of the solvent after curing. Points in
   composition-temperature space corresponding to a transition from
   homogeneous to heterogeneous postcuring microstructures have been
   identified for a variety of solvents using a thermal gradient oven.
   Assuming this transition to coincide with the cloud-point curve
   corresponding to the gel point of the resin, the data were used in
   conjunction with the predictions of the Flory-Huggins equation to
   estimate the interaction parameter and its temperature dependence for
   each solvent. Phase diagrams in composition-conversion space were then
   calculated for a range of curing temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{A multiple-site, nonlethal rabbit surgical model of spinal implant
   infection was used to assess the efficacy of a spinal wound lavage to
   reduce post-operative infection from methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Multiple aqueous lavages of isotonic
   saline were compared to the same procedure using 1wt\% pooled human
   immunoglobulin G (IgG) applied directly to the surgical implant sites.
   Visually observed clinically relevant signs of infection (e.g.,
   swelling, erythema, pus) were supported by bacterial enumeration from
   multiple biopsied tissue and bone sites post-mortem at 7 and 28 days
   post-challenge. Clinical signs of infection were significantly reduced
   in IgG-lavaged infected spinal sites. Bacterial enumeration also
   exhibited statistically significant reductions in soft tissues, bone and
   on K-wire spinal implants using IgG lavage compared with saline.
   Complete healing of all surgical wounds was seen after 28 days, although
   isolated fibrosed abscesses were observed in autopsied sites treated
   with both IgG and saline lavages. Local use of IgG wound lavage is
   proposed as supplementary infection prophylaxis against antibiotic
   resistant implant-centered or surgical wound infection.}},

Abstract = {{A computational treatment of the constitutive equations of
   nematodynamics, based on the Leslie-Ericksen approach, is presented and
   discussed for a rotating planar nematic sample subjected to a constant

   suitable to be solved numerically are worked out, in terms of derived
   functionals of v and n and of their spatial and time derivatives.
   Time-dependent patterns of the director are obtained using a
   finite-difference scheme in a spatial polar grid. Several experimental
   situations are analyzed, corresponding to common experimental setups:
   continuously rotating samples for different values of the rotational
   speed; 30 degrees and 90 degrees step-rotation experiments. A comparison
   is made to existing approximate treatments. Dependence upon the sample

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{689-693}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. Lay personnel and many health care workers in the United
   States believe that head louse infestations caused by Pediculus capitis
   are exceedingly transmissible and that infested children readily infest
   others. Schoolchildren therefore frequently become ostracized and remain
   so until no signs of their presumed infestations are evident. Repeated
   applications of pediculicidal product and chronic school absenteeism
   frequently result.
   Methods. To determine how frequently louse-related exclusions from
   schools and applications of pediculicidal therapeutic regimens might be
   inappropriate, we invited health care providers as well as
   nonspecialized personnel to submit specimens to us that were associated
   with a diagnosis of pediculiasis, Each submission was then characterized
   microscopically.
   Results, Health care professionals as well as nonspecialists frequently
   overdiagnose pediculiasis capitis and generally fail to distinguish
   active from extinct infestations. Noninfested children thereby become
   quarantined at least as often as infested children. Traditional
   anti-louse formulations are overapplied as frequently as are
   ``alternative{''} formulations. Pediculicidal treatments are more
   frequently applied to noninfested children than to children who bear
   active infestations.
   Conclusions. Pediculicidal treatments should be applied solely after
   living nymphal or adult lice or apparently viable eggs have been
   observed. Because health care providers as well as lay personnel
   generally misdiagnose pediculiasis, and because few symptoms and no
   direct infectious processes are known to result, we suggest that the
   practice of excluding presumably infested children from school may be
   more burdensome than the infestations themselves.}},

Abstract = {{The specificity of schistosome circulating antigen detection was
   determined in negative individuals from two S. mansoni-endemic
   countries, Senegal and Burundi, and compared with results from Dutch
   control individuals. A nearly absolute specificity was achieved for
   circulating anodic antigen (CAA) detection in serum, irrespective of the
   target population or sample pretreatment method. Circulating cathodic
   antigen (CCA) detection in serum and urine resulted in a lower
   specificity than serum CAA detection. Apparent large differences in
   specificity of CCA detection between countries were mainly due to
   pretreatment methods. Apparently, the alkaline; heating pretreatment
   method is not as effective as trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-pretreatment in
   removing (certain) interfering components, which may vary between
   populations. In view of the development of the urine CCA assay into a
   noninvasive screening test, a slightly lower specificity may still be
   acceptable. For precise epidemiological analyses the highly specific
   serum CAA assay remains the method of choice.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate post cryotherapy thyroid
   function status of normal rat thyroid tissue and to determine the
   topography of temperature of cryotreated tissues and of tissues adjacent
   to them. Nitrous oxide cryotherapy was performed in 40 male Wistar rats.
   They were divided into four groups of 10. In group I, the right thyroid
   lobe was subjected to cryotherapy and the left lobe was not frozen. In
   group II, both thyroid lobes were cryotreated. In group III, the right
   lobe was frozen and the left lobe was excised. In group IV, the thyroid
   was subjected to neither cryotherapy nor surgery. During cryotherapy,
   the temperature in various places of the thyroid and in the surrounding
   tissues was measured. Serum thyrotropin concentrations were determined
   before an experiment and 4 weeks after in all rats. The results of
   temperature measurements proved that it is possible to limit cryotherapy
   to certain areas of thyroid tissue and to spare the neighboring tissues,
   because they are not subjected to temperatures that are damaging. The
   effectiveness of cryotherapy was confirmed by functional effect.
   Cryotherapy changed function of thyroid tissue. There was a
   statistically significant difference between mean baseline and follow-up
   concentrations in rats of groups II and III. In both groups
   hypothyroidism occurred post cryotherapy. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., culture in
   north-western Europe has given rise to concerns regarding the biological
   consequences of fish farm escapes on wild salmonid populations.
   Canthaxanthin, a carotenoid pigment additive to farmed salmon feed which
   is passed from females to their progeny, may be used as an indicator of
   the numbers of escaped farmed salmon which spawn in the wild. In the
   present study, thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) were used to screen emergent Atlantic salmon fry
   sampled from seven river catchments in Ireland for canthaxanthin. The
   incidence of fry containing canthaxanthin at greater than trace levels (
   < 5\% of total carotenoid pigment) was 0-4\%, with an average of 1.7\%,
   among the seven rivers sampled, indicating that the progeny of farmed
   salmon were present at similarly low frequencies. Canthaxanthin was
   detected at trace levels in an unexpectedly high proportion (35\%) of
   salmon fry. Canthaxanthin was present at levels exceeding trace amounts
   in 24\% of 21 non-anadromous brown trout, Salmo trutta L., sampled from
   six Irish rivers and present at trace levels in a further 57\% of the
   fish, indicating that dietary canthaxanthin is freely available to
   salmonids in Irish rivers. The widespread presence of trace levels in
   salmon fry may be attributable, at least in part, to the increased
   sensitivity of the HPLC methods and to rapid dietary uptake during early
   post-emergence feeding.}},

   stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, The first
   aim of this study was to investigate whether these findings are present
   in anterior tibialis muscle and whether or not they are associated.
   Abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and function as well as signs
   of myopathy have been found during corticosteroid treatment. The second
   aim of this study therefore, was to investigate whether in COPD patients
   prolonged use of low dose prednisolone has effects on muscle energy
   metabolism and qualitative morphology.
   In a cross-sectional study 15 COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in
   one second (FEV1) 33+/-9 (mean+/-SD) \% predicted) who were
   steroid-naive (CORT-) were compared with 10 healthy control subjects
   (HC) and with 14 COPD patients (FEV1 30+/-11 \% pred), who had been
   using oral prednisolone for at least 1 yr (CORT+),
   It was found that adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/adenosine diphosphate was
   lower in CORT- compared to HC (5.7 versus 6.2, p=0.03), Inosine
   monophosphate was detected in 13 of 15 CORT- compared to 3 of 10 HC
   (p=0.004). However, although indications were found for an imbalance in
   production and utilization of ATP, comparing CORT- and HC, no
   differences in oxidative (citrate synthase and 3-hydroxy-acyl-coenzyme
   me A dehydrogenase) and glycolytic (hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase
   and phosphofructokinase) enzyme capacities were found.
   When, comparing steroid-treated and steroid-naive patient subgroups, no
   differences in the above mentioned parameters of muscle energy
   metabolism and of muscle qualitative morphology were found.}},

Abstract = {{In some countries the content of trans fatty acids (TFA) in margarines
   has strongly decreased as a result of the continuous discussion on their
   disadvantages regarding aspects of nutritional physiology. However,
   still in 1994 almost 1/3 of total fatty acids in part of German
   sunflower margarines, shortenings and cooking fats comprised these
   unfavourable TFA. In the present study the main interest was laid on
   trans-C16:1, trans-C18:1, trans-C20:1, trans-C18:2 and trans-C18:3 fatty
   acids and particularly their individual isomers, as negative metabolic
   activity of TFA possibly might only be attributable to certain isomers.
   By combining argentation thin-layer chromatography with gas
   chromatography using a 100-m capillary column (CP-Sil 88) trails fatty
   acid contents were determined in nearly all German brands of sunflower
   margarines (SFM; n = 9) and of cooking fats and shortenings (CFS; n =
   10). Concerning the above-mentioned groups of isomers mean TFA contents
   of 0.01, 4.88, 0.00, 0.45 and 0.03\% for SFM as well as of 0.01, 5.02,
   0.03, 0.70 and 0.17\% for CFS were established, respectively. The
   re-evaluation of samples from 1993 and 1996 exhibited that the total TFA
   content (sum of all mentioned isomers) in SFM decreased from 21.77\%
   (range: 13.78-26.29; n = 11) to 5.37\% (1.98-6.15\%; n = 9) between 1994
   and 1999. Also the total TFA content in CFS on average strongly
   decreased from 11.77\% (0.08-33.63; n = 16) in 1994 and 12.52\%
   (1.61-26.79\%; n = 7) in 1996 to 5.91\% (0.43-19.72\%; n = 10) in 1999.
   However, even the newest CFS samples partly exhibited relative high TFA
   contents. In addition to the total TFA contents all positional isomers
   of trans-C18:1, trans-C18:2 and trans-C18:3 in SFM and CFS were
   quantified and compared between different years. The conjugated linoleic
   acid (cis Delta 9, trans Delta 11) occurred only in small amounts of
   0.03\% and 0.02\% in current SFM and CFS.}},

Abstract = {{The changes in chemical composition, main physico-chemical parameters.
   classical nitrogen fractions, caseins and their degradation products.
   and some fat characteristics were studied during the ripening process of
   10 batches of Quesucos de Liebana cheese. a traditional variety made in
   the north of Spain. The values of the different compositional and
   physico-chemical parameters at the end of the ripening did not differ
   significantly from those found in other cow's milk cheeses elaborated
   with similar technology. The presence of residual lactose at the end of
   the ripening process is outstanding. The total soluble nitrogen
   increased by a factor of 2 at the end of the ripening compared to the
   values shown at the beginning. However, non-protein nitrogen increased
   very little. The final values of the different nitrogen fractions show
   that this cheese undergoes a proteolysis moderate in extension but not
   very intense and that the rennet is the main agent of the proteolysis
   produced during ripening. Using PAGE techniques, it was possible to show
   that, throughout ripening, 56\% of alpha(s)-casein and 11\% of
   beta-casein turned out to be degraded. The TEA number and acidity index
   of the fat values show that the processes of lipolysis and fat
   autooxidation during the ripening of this cheese are not very intense.

Abstract = {{This paper describes the current effort to develop a standardized data
   set, or suite of digital video sequences, that can be used for test and
   evaluation of digital video motion detectors (VMDs) for exterior
   applications. We have drawn from an extensive video database of typical
   application scenarios to assemble a comprehensive data set. These data,
   some existing for many years on analog videotape, have been converted to
   a reproducible digital format and edited to generate test sequences
   several minutes long for many scenarios. Sequences include non-alarm
   video, intrusions and nuisance alarm sources, taken with a variety of
   imaging sensors including monochrome CCD cameras and infrared (thermal)
   imaging cameras, under a variety of daytime and nighttime conditions.
   The paper presents an analysis of the variables and estimates the
   complexity of a thorough data set. Some of this video data test has been
   digitized for CD-ROM storage and playback. We are considering developing
   a DVD disk for possible use in screening and testing VMDs prior to
   government testing and deployment. In addition, this digital video data
   may be used by VMD developers for further refinement or customization of
   their product to meet specific requirements. These application scenarios
   may also be used to define the testing parameters for future procurement
   qualification. A personal computer may be used to play back either the
   CD-ROM or the DVD video data. A consumer electronics-style DVD player
   may be used to replay the DVD disk. This paper also discusses various
   aspects of digital video storage including formats, resolution, CD-ROM
   and DVD storage capacity, formats, editing and playback.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the concentration of 8-isoPGF(2 alpha) in cord
   blood as a measure of oxidative stress during labour, and to compare
   them with other established parameters of in vivo lipid peroxidation and
   with the acid-base status of the newborn.
   Method Umbilical cord arterial and venous blood samples were collected
   from 81 singleton term deliveries for determination of 8-isoPGF(2
   alpha), malondialdehyde and organic hydroperoxides. In addition,
   metabolites derived from the oxidative metabolism of purines during
   hypoxia-reoxygenation and routine cord blood of oxygen saturation, pH,
   pO(2), pCO(2), HCO3 and base excess were measured.
   Results Arterial concentrations of 8-isoPGF(2 alpha) were significantly
   higher in cases with fetal distress, tight nuchal cord (P < 0.001), the
   umbilical coiling index, and male sex (P < 0.05) (R-2 = 0.48). No
   correlation was found with any parameter of acid-base status. In
   arterial and venous blood the concentrations of organic hydroperoxides
   and hypoxanthine significantly correlated with the fetal nuchal cord (P
   < 0.001) (R-2 = 0.26 and 0.6, respectively).
   Conclusion Our findings indicate that 8-isoPGF(2 alpha) in cord arterial
   blood is a suitable parameter to quantify a possible oxidative stress in
   the fetus during labour. Measurements of the F-2-isoprostane
   concentrations in cord blood at labour provide a clinically useful
   method to assess the perinatal outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Diapause induction and termination were compared among three different
   geographic populations of Helicoverpa armigera from Ishigaki (24.3
   degrees N; 124.2 degrees E), Okayama (Ushimado, 34.6 degrees N; 134.1
   degrees E) and Kanazawa (36.6 degrees N; 136.7 degrees E) in Japan. The
   critical daylength for pupal diapause induction among the three
   populations was between 12L:12D and 14L:10D in the larval stage. No
   clinal latitudinal variation in the critical daylength was found among
   the three populations. Most of the diapausing pupae emerged when they
   were continuously maintained at 20 degrees C under 12L:12D, suggesting
   that cold exposure (chilling) is not necessary to break the pupal
   diapause. Furthermore, the time required for diapause termination of the
   Okayama population was the longest (214 days), followed by the Ishigaki
   (149 days) and Kanazawa (73 days) populations at 20 degrees C (without
   chilling) under the 12L:12D photoperiod. These results showed no clinal
   latitudinal variation in diapause termination.}},

Abstract = {{Varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E (ORF 68) belongs to the group of
   late genes. It is a major component of the virion envelope and can be
   found complexed with glycoprotein I on the infected host cell surface.
   Glycoprotein E (gE) expression is activated by IE4 and IE62. Also,
   cellular transcription factors, like Spl, are able to influence the gE
   expression. Performing quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
   chain reaction, we found no decrease in Spl mRNA levels at different
   times post-infection, indicating that Sp1 mRNA evade virion host shutoff
   effects. In addition, the Sp1 protein was detectable in highly infected
   cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays have shown a binding of Sp1
   to both GC elements within the gE-5'untranslated region (5'UTR).
   Additional shift assays have notified a binding of TATA box binding
   protein to the TATA box of the gE promoter, which is characterized by an
   untypical TATACA motif. Promoter-reporter constructs have been made
   using mutated variants of the gE-5'UTR as promoters. In transfection
   studies, we found that the TATA deletion, as well as inactivations of
   both GC boxes, reduced the basal activity of the promoter. A complete
   loss of activity did not become measurable until eliminating both GC
   elements and the TATA box, indicating that these cis-elements substitute
   for each other in initiation of transcription of the gE-5'UTR. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We studied the prognostic value of angiogenesis grading and microvessel

   patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, treated on Eastern Cooperative
   Oncology Protocol E9486 and Intergroup study 0141 (S9321) at the Mayo
   Clinic, were studied. Bone marrow microvessels were examined using
   immunohistochemical staining for von Willebrand factor. Determination of
   microvessel density and angiogenesis grading,vas done in a blinded
   manner. There was a strong correlation between microvessel density and
   the plasma cell labeling index, rho 0.42, P < 0.001. Angiogenesis
   grade,vas also significantly associated with the plasma cell labeling
   index. Fifteen \% of patients,vith low-grade angiogenesis had a high
   labeling index (>1\%), In contrast, 47\% of patients with intermediate
   or high-grade angiogenesis had high labeling indices (P = 0.02), Overall
   survival was significantly different among those with high-,
   intermediate-, and low-grade angiogenesis, with median times of 2, 4,
   and 4.4 years, respectively (P = 0.02), Similarly, patients with
   microvessel density >50/x400 field had poorer survival compared with
   those with 50 or fewer microvessels/field, median survival 2.6 versus
   5.1 years, respectively (P = 0.004), There was a strong association
   between angiogenesis grade and microvessel density (P < 0.001). We
   conclude that bone marrow angiogenesis is a predictor of poor survival
   in newly diagnosed myeloma, Angiogenesis is correlated with the plasma
   cell labeling index but not the bone marrow plasma cell percentage. A
   simple visual grading of angiogenesis is an efficient alternative to
   microvessel density estimation.}},

Abstract = {{We present simultaneous optical polarimetry and X-ray data of the
   near-synchronous polar RX J2115-5840. We model the polarization data
   using the Stokes imaging technique of fetter ct al. We find that the
   data are best modelled using a relatively high binary inclination and a
   small angle between the magnetic and spin axes. We find that, for all
   spin-orbit beat phases, a significant proportion of the accretion flow
   is directed on to the lower hemisphere of the white dwarf, producing
   negative circular polarization. Only for a small fraction of the beat
   cycle is a proportion of the flow directed on to the upper hemisphere,
   However, the accretion flow never occurs near the upper magnetic pole,
   whatever the orientation of the magnetic poles. This indicates the
   presence of a non-dipole field with the field strength at the upper pole
   significantly higher. We find that the brightest parts of the hard X-ray
   emitting region and the cyclotron region are closely coincident.}},

Abstract = {{Microbiologically influenced corrosion of carbon steel has been
   investigated. Carbon steel coupons were exposed online in the cooling
   water system of a nuclear test reactor to assess the microbial growth on
   the coupons and the corrosion phenomena. Iron bacteria, sulphate
   reducing bacteria (SRB) and culturable aerobic heterotrophic bacteria
   (CAHB) were monitored both on the coupons and in the cooling water.
   Corrosion rate was assayed by weight loss method and corrosion products
   analysed by XRD and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Extensive tuberculation of
   carbon steel coupons was noticed. SEM pictures revealed the presence of
   ensheathed filamentous iron bacteria encrusted with corrosion products.
   Beneath the tubercles significant pitting and SRB induced corrosion in
   the form of concentric rings was observed. From the phase analysis, the
   following compounds were found to be present: gamma-Fe2O3, Fe2PO5,
   FePS3, Fe(PO3)(3) and BaFeO3-x. From the present study it is inferred
   that iron bacteria (Leptothrix sp.) and SRB (Desulfovibrio sp.) are
   responsible for the corrosion of carbon steel. The role of these
   bacteria in influencing the corrosion of carbon steel is highlighted.

Abstract = {{Twenty-three Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), populations
   collected in the southeastern (Alabama and Mississippi), midwestern
   (Indiana), and northwestern (Idaho and Washington) United States from
   1995 to 1999 were evaluated for biotype composition based on response to
   Hessian fly resistance genes H3,H5, H6, and H7H8 in wheat, Triticum
   aestivum L. Biotypes L and O, combined, mode up at least 60\% of all
   Alabama populations. Biotype L was predominant in the northern third of
   Alabama and biotype O in the southern two-thirds of the state. Based on
   biotype data, wheat cultivars with H7H8 resistance should he highly
   effective in central and southern Alabama. Fifty-four percent of the
   Mississippi population consisted of biotype L, and the remaining
   virulent biotypes (B, D, E, G, J, and O) ranged in frequency from 1 to
   17\%. The Mississippi population also contained 4\% of the avirulent
   biotype GP. Only biotypes D and L were found in Indiana populations, but
   biotype L was predominant. Hessian fly populations from Idaho and
   Washington contained one or more of the virulent biotypes D-H, J, and
   L-O; however, only biotypes E, F, and G occurred at frequencies >12\%.
   The avirulent biotype GP made up 25-57\% of Idaho and Washington
   populations, a much higher percentage than found in populations from the
   eastern United States. Although the highest level of virulence in Idaho
   and Washington populations was found to resistance genes H3 and H6, the
   frequency of biotype GP would indicate that the currently deployed gene
   H3 would provide a moderate to high level of resistance, depending on
   location. Nine of the populations, plus populations collected from the
   mid-Atlantic state area in 1989 and 1996, also were tested against the
   wheat cultivar `INW9811' that carries H13 resistance to Hessian ny
   biotype L and two Purdue wheat lines with unidentified genes for
   resistance. The H13 resistance in INW9811 was highly effective against
   all populations tested from the eastern and northwestern U.S. wheat
   production areas, except Maryland and Virginia. population studies also
   indicated that wheat line CI 17960-1-1-2-4-2-10 likely carries the H13
   resistance gene, based on the similarity of its response and that of
   INW9811 to eight flp populations. Continued monitoring of biotype
   frequency in Hessian ny populations is required for optimal deployment
   and management of resistance genes in all wheat production areas.}},

   serious seasonal deficit of pasture and other feed, (c) the lack of an
   organized market for wool and meat, (d) poor access to agricultural
   credit, (e) primitive shearing equipment, and (f) an inadequate supply
   of drinking water for sheep. Strategies to assist farmers develop their
   sheep management skills, improve access and quality of support services,
   improved technology adaptable to local conditions and effective linkages

Abstract = {{An attempt has been made in this article to summarize the
   state-of-the-art clinical experience with the use of anti-TNF therapies
   in four diseased states with special emphasis on myelodysplastic
   syndromes. Given the central role of TNF-alpha in initiating and
   perpetuating the chronic damage produced in the diseased organs by
   controlling a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as its
   acute role in sepsis, theoretically speaking, neutralization of this
   peptide was a natural therapeutic choice. Results of the initial
   clinical trials appear encouraging and sometimes dramatic in their
   efficacy. The mechanism of response however, is interesting in that even
   when TNF-alpha is directly targeted by a monoclonal antibody, the
   resulting benefits can frequently not be attributed to TNF suppression
   alone. Rather, it appears that a more general effect on the
   T-lymphocytes is also contributing to the responses being seen. This
   raises the new possibility of combining anti-cytokine and anti-T-cell
   strategies to treat at least the more chronic diseases such as Crohn's
   disease and myelodysplastic syndromes. Continued clinical trials testing
   these strategies are clearly warranted. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To characterize the differences between two matched groups of
   patients treated by ICSI: those pregnant after all embryos transferred
   implanted (100\% implantation rate) compared with nonpregnant patients.
   Methods: Twenty-one patients in whom one transferred embryo achieved a
   singleton pregnancy (group A) and 21 pregnant patients to whom two or
   three embryos were transferred and achieved 11 twin and 10 triplet
   pregnancies (group B) compared with matched nonpregnant patients (group
   C and D, respectively).
   Results: The singleton pregnant patients were significantly older than
   the twin and triplet pregnancy patients. Although a similar number of
   human menopausal gonadotropin ampules were used in the singleton
   compared with the twins and triplets a significantly lower number of
   oocytes and embryos were achieved at lower levels of estradiol on the
   human chorionic gonadotropin day in the former than in the latter
   respectively. No difference was found between the pregnant women and
   their nonpregnant controls in any of the mentioned parameters. Good
   embryo morphology was found in 86\% of the embryos in group A compared
   with 62\% in group C (P = 0.08) and 92\% in group B compared with 66\%
   in group D (P < 0.002).
   Conclusions: The only parameter in which pregnant patients with 100\%
   implantation rate differ from their nonpregnant controls was embryo
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine whether outcomes in poorly
   controlled asthma can be further improved with a starting dose of
   inhaled budesonide higher than that recommended in international
   guidelines.
   The study had a parallel-group design and included 61 subjects with
   poorly controlled asthma, randomized to receive 3,200 mu g or 1,600 mu g
   budesonide daily by Turbuhaler(R) for 8 weeks (double-blind), then 1,600
   mu g.day(-1) for 8 weeks (single-blind), followed by 14 months of
   open-label budesonide dose down-titration using a novel algorithm, with
   a written asthma crisis plan based on electronic peak expiratory flow
   monitoring. The primary outcome variable for weeks 1-16 was change in
   airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and, for the open-label phase, mean
   daily budesonide dose,
   By week 16, there were large changes from baseline in all outcomes, with
   no significant differences between the 3,200- and 1,600-mu g.day(-1)
   starting dose groups (AHR increased by 3.2 versus 3.0 doubling doses,
   p=0.7; morning peak flow increased by 134 versus 127 L.min(-1), p=0.8),
   Subjects starting with 3,200 mu g.day(-1) were 3.8 times more likely to
   achieve AHR within the normal range, as defined by a provocative dose of
   histamine causing a 20\% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second
   (PD20) of greater than or equal to 3.92 mu mol by week 16 (p=0.3),
   During dose titration, there was no significant difference in mean
   budesonide dose (1,327 versus 1,325 mu g.day(-1), p>0.3). Optimal asthma
   control was achieved in the majority of subjects (at
   completion/withdrawal: median symptoms 0.0 days.week(-1),
   beta(2)-agonist use 0.2 occasions.day(-1), and PD20 2.4 mu mol).
   In subjects with poorly controlled asthma, a starting dose of 1,600 mu
   g.day(-1) budesonide was sufficient to lead to optimal control in most
   subjects. The high degree of control achieved, compared with previous
   studies, warrants further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the frequency of tachycardia-related
   cardiomyopathy in patients with atrial fibrillation and systolic
   dysfunction referred for atrioventricular node ablation.
   Patients and Methods: This prospective multicenter cohort study was
   conducted at 16 tertiary care centers. The ejection fraction was
   measured before and 3 and 12 months after atrioventricular node
   ablation, Patients with reduced systolic function (ejection fraction
   less than or equal to 45\%) before atrioventricular ablation were
   included in this study. Patients whose ejection fraction increased by at
   least 15 percentage points and to higher than 45\% were considered to
   have tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy,
   Results: Of 63 patients with systolic dysfunction, 48 had at least 1
   adequate follow-up echocardiographic study. Sixteen (25\%) of the 63 had
   marked improvement in the ejection fraction (mean +/- SD change, 27+/-8
   percentage points) to a value higher than 45\% after ablation,
   Conclusions: Tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy is common in patients

Abstract = {{Celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory disorder of the small intestine
   induced by cereal prolamins. The demonstration of IgA endomysial
   antibodies (EMA) is currently the most reliable serological screen for
   CD. The antigenic target is transglutaminase. The aim of this study was
   to develop an ELISA assay for the detection of antibodies to
   transglutaminase (TGA), and to assess the sensitivity and specificity of
   TGA for the detection of celiac disease against the benchmarks of
   jejunal biopsy, antigliadin antibodies (AGA) and EMA. Sera from 57
   patients with celiac disease were tested for IgA and IgG TGA, IgA EMA,
   IgA and IgG AGA, and the total IgA level. The sensitivity, specificity,
   predictive value and concordance of AGA, EMA and TGA were assessed
   against the gold-standard biopsy result. IgG plus IgA TGA offered 100\%
   sensitivity in CD patients for whom no dietary intervention had been
   commenced, with a specificity of 61\%. The sensitivity of TGA dropped
   from 100 to 79\% after dietary restriction. In patients on no gluten
   restriction, there was 100\% agreement between TGA and EMA, and 100\%
   agreement between TGA and AGA for the IgA isotype. The false-positive
   rate for TGA was 53\% in Down's syndrome patients and 25\% in patients
   with systemic autoimmune disorders. We conclude that testing for TGA is
   a reliable diagnostic serology for celiac disease, with improved
   sensitivity compared with established methods. The results suggest that
   serial TGA measurements may be a more accurate marker for dietary
   compliance than AGA, but prospective studies are required.}},

Abstract = {{From regular monitoring of the Double Quasar QSO 0957+561 A,B there is
   now general agreement on a time delay of about 416 days. This has made
   it possible to determine the microlensing residual in the light-curve,
   see Pelt et al. (1998). We have used two significant microlensing
   features: 1) A ``quiet{''} period with a variability less than 0.05 mag
   lasting about 8 years, and 2) A change in the residual of 0.25 mag
   during a time interval of about 5 years. The first feature gives a lower
   limit for the lens mass, M, for a given normalized source radius, r,
   whereas the second feature gives an upper limit. We have considered the
   amount of mass in a continuum to be a free parameter with possible
   values between 0\% (all mass in lenses) and 90\%. At a significance
   level of 1\% the mass can only be constrained within a rather wide range
   (10(-6)M. to 5M.). For the radius R of the source an upper limit of
   10(16) cm is found, whereas the normalized source radius r is restricted
   to be smaller than 30. At a level of 10\%, however, the range of
   possible masses is much narrower (2.10(-3) M. to 0.5M.), and the upper
   limit of R is about 6 . 10(15) cm, whereas the value of r is restricted
   to be less than 2. We have used an effective transverse velocity V equal
   to 600 km s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Background: The efficacy of CT scan in the diagnosis of pediatric
   appendicitis has hot been established.
   Methods: Every patient under the age of 18 who was diagnosed and treated
   for acute appendicitis in the 1 year period front March 1998-March 1999
   at Lakeland Regional Medical Center were included. The presentation,
   laboratory evaluation, imaging evaluation, hospital course, and
   pathologic evaluation were reviewed. Selected imaging studies were
   reviewed by an independent radiologist.
   Results: Forty-six: patients mere treated for appendicitis; 17 of them
   received CT scans (37\%), The CT scans predicted appendicitis in 9 of 17
   cases (sensitivity = 53\%). False-negative studies resulted in some
   morbidity but no mortality. The radiology review indicated that three
   cases clearly did not demonstrate appendicitis, The other false-negative
   studies were secondary to either technical or professional factors.
   Conclusion: The efficacy of CT imaging in the diagnosis of acute
   appendicitis in children has still not been demonstrated. This limited
   series indicates that if CT scanning is to be used in pediatric
   patients, more attention to technical and professional factors may be
   required. Some of these factors, particularly the ingestion of oral
   contrast, are particularly problematic in small children and may limit
   the effectiveness of this modality.}},

Abstract = {{The TRAP coactivator complex is a large, multisubunit complex of nuclear
   proteins which associates with nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) in the
   presence of cognate ligand and stimulates NR-mediated transcription. A
   single subunit, TRAP220, is thought to target the entire complex to a
   liganded receptor through a domain containing two of the signature LXXLL
   motifs shown previously in other types of coactivator proteins to be
   essential for mediating NR binding. In this work, we demonstrate that
   each of the two LXXLL-containing regions, termed receptor binding
   domains 1 and 2 (RBD-1 and RBD-2), is differentially preferred by
   specific NRs. The retinoid X receptor (RXR) displays a weak yet specific
   activation function 2 (AF2)-dependent preference for RBD-1, while the
   thyroid hormone receptor (TR), vitamin D-3 receptor (VDR), and
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor all exhibit a strong
   AF2-dependent preference for RBD-2. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we
   show that preference for RBD-2 is due to the presence of basic-polar
   residues on the amino-terminal end of the core LXXLL motif. Furthermore,
   we show that the presence and proper spacing of both RBD-1 and RBD-2 are
   required for an optimal association of TRAP220 with RXR-TR or RXR-VDR
   heterodimers bound to DNA and for TRAP220 coactivator function. On the
   basis of these results, we suggest that a single molecule of TRAP220 can
   interact with both subunits of a DNA-bound NR heterodimer.}},

Abstract = {{The ion exchange of Cl- and OH- with F- in synthetic calcium
   chlorapatite and calcium hydroxyapatite single crystals was investigated
   under hydrothermal conditions. The hydrothermal treatments were
   conducted using 5 and 10 M KF solutions, at temperatures of 500 and 600
   degrees C under a constant internal pressure of 100 MPa, for intervals
   between 6 and 336 h. The ion exchange of Cl- in the chlorapatite
   crystals proceeded faster than that of OH- in the hydroxyapatite
   crystals during hydrothermal treatments at 500 degrees C in 5 M KF
   solution. Under these conditions, the chlorapatite crystals were
   completely converted to fluorapatite crystals. In contrast, the
   hydroxyapatite crystals were only partially converted to fluorapatite.
   In both cases, the topotaxial ion-exchange reaction was achieved by a
   mechanism of dissolution-precipitation of clusters. The partially and
   completely converted fluorapatite crystals had a characteristic texture,
   exhibiting tiny tunnels along the c axis of the crystals, and a thin
   layer of CaF2 was also produced on the surface of the converted
   crystals. The influence of the reactivity of the individual apatites on
   the control of the ion exchange rate is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Glucocorticoids are highly effective in the treatment of allergy and
   asthma and inhibit the synthesis of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 by
   disease-promoting CD4(+) Th2 cells. CD8(+) T cells also synthesize these
   cytokines, and the aim of this study was to investigate how
   glucocorticoids effect cytokine production by these cells. When CD8(+) T
   cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 and IL-2 plus IL-4 or dexamethasone,
   production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is low in both
   primary and secondary cultures restimulated with anti-CDS and IL-2
   alone, However, when both are present, a synergistic effect on IL-10
   synthesis is observed. The additional presence of antigen-presenting
   cells (APC) in the priming culture maintains IL-10 levels, but inhibits
   IL-4 and IL-5 production. CD4(+) T cells develop a similar
   glucocorticoid-induced phenotype. These cells demonstrate regulatory
   activity and inhibit CD4(+) T cell activation in an IL-10-dependent
   manner. Earlier reports show glucocorticoids promote a Th2 phenotype by
   effects on purified naive T cells or pretreatment of APC. This study
   demonstrates, more critically, that when APC are present,
   glucocorticoids induce CD4 and CD8 T cell populations synthesizing high
   levels of IL-10, but greatly reduced amounts of disease-promoting IL-4

   track density was to backscatter the ions from an Au film deposited on a
   thick vitreous carbon backing. In this way,at angles greater than 90
   degrees ions of masses 12 < m < 197 amu will be backscattered in a clean
   monoenergetic beam. The energy is controlled by the accelerator energy
   (which allows the choice of several charge states, depending on the type
   of ion) and the scattering angle; the energy spectrum width is given by
   the thickness of the Au film. The ion fluence is controlled by the beam
   current, bombarding time and beam angle. Carbon ions with energies
   between 1 and 10 MeV were selected to impinge on CR-39 (allyl diglycol
   polycarbonate) plastic detectors, which were then chemically etched for

Abstract = {{Four mature sedentary geldings were used in a 4x4 Latin square designed
   experiment to evaluate the effects of supplemental molybdenum (Mo) on
   copper (Cu) balance. Four diets were formulated to contain 0 (control),
   5, 10 and 20 ppm of supplemental Mo and were fed for a 21-day adjustment
   period followed by a 72-hour fecal and urine collection. Diets consisted
   of a pelleted concentrate based on corn, soybean meal and cotton seed
   hulls fed in a 50:50 ratio of concentrate to native prairie grass hay.
   All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isocaloric with
   similar concentrations of Cu. Urine was collected every four hours for
   72 hours and multiple fecal grab samples were taken every two hours post
   feeding. On the third collection day, blood samples were drawn at the
   time of feeding, each hour for five hours post feeding, and eight hours
   post feeding for serum Cu analysis. Balance data were analyzed using a
   general linear model procedure with horse, period and treatment as main
   effects. Serum Cu data were analyzed using the general linear model
   procedure with horse, treatment and period as main effects and time as
   the repeated variable. The intake of Cu was similar among all diets fed.
   There was no difference (p>.05) in serum Cu concentrations over time or
   between treatments due to supplemental Mo. Urinary and fecal excretion
   of Cu did not differ (p>.05) between diets. Consequently, the balance of
   Cu was similar among diets consumed. Excretion of Mo in the urine was
   higher (p<.05) in horses fed the 20 ppm Mo diet versus the 0, 5 and 10
   ppm Mo diet. As Mo intake increased, fecal excretion increased (p<.05)
   across all diets. Additionally, Mo balance was higher (p<.05) on the 20
   ppm Mo diet than all other diets. In conclusion, supplemental Mo
   appeared to have no adverse effect on the absorption and retention of Cu
   when fed to mature geldings.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Profilin(Hev b 8) in natural rubber latex (NRL) has been
   assumed to be an important allergen. Since latex profilin has a
   molecular mass similar to two other latex allergens (Hev b 1 and Hev b
   6.03) in the 14-kDa range, it is difficult to obtain sufficient amounts
   of purified native profilin for investigations and diagnostics. The
   present study aimed to produce recombinant latex profilin (rHev b 8) and
   study its IgE-binding reactivity.
   Methods: A profilin-specific cDNA encoding the latex profilin from Hevea
   brasiliensis leaves was synthesized and subcloned, and the rHev b 8 was
   overexpressed in fusion with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) in E.
   coli. The IgE-binding reactivity of rHev b 8 was studied by
   immunoblotting, immunoblot inhibition experiments, and the Pharmacia CAP
   method, with 25 sera from health-care workers with latex allergy and 17
   sera from latex-sensitive spina bifida patients.
   Results: rHev b 8 was found to have 131 amino acids and a sequence
   identity of 75\% with birch profilin (Bet v 2). Analysis by the CAP
   system revealed the presence of rHev b 8-specific IgE antibodies in two
   out of 17 sera from spina bifida patients and in five out of 25 sera
   (20\%) from health-care workers. Two subjects of the latter group with
   rHev b 8-specific IgE showed negative results in the skin prick tests
   with tree-pollen extracts and had no IgE to rBet v 2, indicating the
   presence of IgE-binding epitopes on the Hev b 8-molecule which do not
   cross-react with birch profilin. Immunoblot inhibition assays using
   MBP-rHev b 8 as inhibitor confirmed the presence of latex profilin in
   the NRL extract. IgE binding to the native latex profilin could be
   completely inhibited by the MBP-rHev b 8.
   Conclusions: Latex profilin represents a minor allergen in NRL and may
   have IgE-binding epitopes different from Bet v 2.}},

Abstract = {{High hydrostatic pressure is regarded as possible alternative method for
   food preservation. One of the primary considerations for industrial
   applications is the ability of this method to eradicate pathogenic
   micro-organisms. This study subjected L. monocytogenes suspensions, in a
   phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) or in a citrate phosphate buffer (pH 5.6), to
   high hydrostatic pressure treatments relative to the following
   variables: pressure (200-600 MPa) treatment time (3, 10 and 20 min),
   temperature (4, 20 and 40 degrees C) and the pH of the suspension medium
   (5.6 and 7.0). An optimal design of 40 runs was obtained using the
   Fedorov algorithm and responses were studied by analysis of variance in
   terms of cell survival on plate count agar. Efficiency was determined by
   log(10) comparisons of the numbers of live cells before and after
   treatment. A statistically significant relationship was found between
   the four variables considered (pressure, pH, treatment time and
   temperature), their interactions (treatment time vs pressure, pH vs
   treatment time, pH vs pressure, pressure vs temperature, treatment time
   vs temperature) and the inactivation of L. monocytogenes. R-squared
   statistical analysis indicated that the linear model used accounted for
   more than 98.5\% of the variability in the inactivation of L.

Abstract = {{Pyrite oxidation in the underground mining environment of Iron Mountain,
   California, has created the most acidic pH values ever reported in
   aquatic systems. Sulfate values as high as 120 000 mg l(-1) and iron as
   high as 27 600 mg l(-1) have been measured in the mine water, which also
   carries abundant other dissolved metals including Al, Zn, Cu, Cd, Mn, Sb
   and Pb. Extreme acidity and high metal concentrations apparently do not
   preclude the presence of an underground acidophilic food web, which has
   developed with bacterial biomass at the base and heliozoans as top
   predators. Slimes, oil-like films, flexible and inflexible stalactites,
   sediments, water and precipitates were found to have distinctive
   communities. A variety of filamentous and non-filamentous bacteria grew
   in slimes in water having pH values < 1.0. Fungal hyphae colonize
   stalactites dripping pH 1.0 water; they may help to form these drip
   structures. Motile hypotrichous ciliates and bdelloid rotifers are
   particularly abundant in slimes having a pH of 1.5. Holdfasts of the
   iron bacterium Leptothrix discophora attach to biofilms covering pools
   of standing water having a pH of 2.5 in the mine. The mine is not a
   closed environment - people, forced air flow and massive flushing during
   high intensity rainfall provide intermittent contact between the surface
   and underground habitats, so the mine ecosystem probably is not a
   restricted one.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: To assess the agreement between proxy informants' reports of
   history of surgery and childbirth and older index subjects' own recall.
   DESIGN: Interrater reliability study.
   SETTING: An outpatient family medicine clinic and a provincial electoral
   district in Montreal, Canada.
   PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-two subjects aged 65 years and older without
   cognitive impairment, identified from clinic and community settings, and
   each index subject's proxy respondent.
   MEASUREMENTS: Identical questionnaires were administered to index
   subjects and proxies.
   RESULTS: Proxies failed to report 39\% of non-childbirth surgeries
   reported by index subjects, but failed to report only 10\% of
   childbirths. Female proxies were significantly less likely than male
   proxies to underreport non-childbirth surgeries after controlling for
   age of index subject and interval since surgery. Longer interval since
   surgery was significantly associated with greater underreporting,
   whereas age of the index subject and relationship between proxy and
   index subject were not. Agreement between proxies and index subjects on
   date of surgery was much higher for childbirths than for non-childbirth
   surgeries.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that proxy respondents can provide
   reliable information on older women's history of childbirth but that use
   of proxy respondents for history of non-childbirth surgeries may result
   in substantial underreporting.}},

Abstract = {{The bdr (Borrelia direct repeat) gene family of the genus Borrelia
   encodes a polymorphic group of proteins that carry a central repeat
   motif region containing putative phosphorylation sites and a hydrophobic
   carboxyl-terminal domain. It has been postulated that the Bdr proteins
   may anchor to the inner membrane via the C-terminal domain. In this
   study, we used cellular fractionation methodologies, salt and detergent
   treatments, and immunoblot analyses to assess the association of the Bdr
   proteins with the cellular infrastructure in both Borrelia burgdorferi
   (a Lyme disease spirochete) and B. turicatae (a relapsing fever
   spirochete). Triton X-114 extraction and partitioning experiments
   demonstrated that most Bdr paralogs are associated with the inner
   membrane-peptidoglycan complex. Analyses of cells treated with the
   highly chaotropic bile salt detergent deoxycholic acid demonstrated that
   some Bdr paralogs may also interact with the peptidoglycan, as evidenced
   by their tight association with the insoluble cellular matrix. In
   addition, immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments revealed an enhanced IP
   of all Bdr paralogs when the cell lysates were boiled prior to addition
   of the precipitating antibody. Furthermore, some Bdr paralogs were
   accessible to antibody in the IP experiments only in the boiled cell
   lysates. These observations suggest that different Bdr paralogs may
   carry out different structural-functional roles. Demonstration of the
   inner membrane localization of the Bdr proteins and of the differences
   in nature of the interaction of individual Bdr paralogs with the cell
   infrastructure is an important step toward defining the functional role
   of this unique protein family in the genus Borrelia.}},

Abstract = {{Background-The use of creatine (Cr) as a nutritional supplement to aid
   athletic performance has gained widespread popularity among athletes.
   However, concerns have recently been expressed over potentially harmful
   effects of short and long term Cr supplementation on health.
   Methods-Forty eight young healthy subjects were randomly allocated to
   three experimental protocols aimed at elucidating any potential health
   risks associated with five days (20 g/day) to nine weeks (3 g/day) of Cr
   supplementation. Venous Mood samples were collected before and after
   periods of Cr supplementation and were analysed for some haematological
   indices, and for indices of hepatic, muscular, and renal dysfunction.
   Findings-All measured indices were well within their respective normal
   range at all times. Serum creatinine concentration tended to be
   increased the day after Cr supplementation, However, values had returned
   to baseline six weeks after the cessation of supplementation, These
   increases were probably attributable to increased creatinine production
   rather than renal dysfunction. No indication of impairment to the
   haematological indices measured, hepatic function, or muscle damage was
   apparent after Cr supplementation.
   Interpretation-These data protide evidence that there are no obvious
   adverse effects of acute or more chronic Cr supplementation on the
   haematological indices measured, nor on hepatic, muscle, and renal
   function. Therefore there is no apparent health risk associated with Cr
   supplementation to healthy people when it is ingested in quantities that
   have been scientifically proven to increase muscle Cr stores.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in aerobic and
   anaerobic metabolism produced by a newly devised short training
   programme. Five young male volunteers trained daily for 2 weeks on a
   cycle ergometer. Sessions consisted of 15-s all-out repetitions with
   45-s rest periods, plus 30-s all-out repetitions with 12-min rest
   periods. The number of repetitions was gradually increased up to a
   maximum of seven. Biopsy samples of the vastus lateralis muscle were
   taken before and after training. Performance changes were evaluated by
   two tests, a 30-s all-out test and a maximal progressive test.
   Significant increases in phosphocreatine (31\%) and glycogen (32\%) were
   found at the end of training. In addition, a significant increase was
   observed in the muscle activity of creatine kinase (44\%),
   phosphofructokinase (106\%), lactate dehydrogenase (45\%),
   3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (60\%) and citrate synthase (38\%).
   After training, performance of the 30-s all-out test did not increase
   significantly, while in the maximal progressive test, the maximum oxygen
   consumption increased from mean (SD) 57.3 (2.6) ml . min(-1) . kg(-1) to
   63.8 (3.0) ml . min(-1). kg(-1), and the maximum load from 300 (11) W to
   330 (21) W; all changes were significant. In conclusion, this new
   protocol, which utilises short durations, high loads and long recovery
   periods, seems to be an effective programme for improving the enzymatic
   activities of the energetic pathways in a short period of time.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design: One-group discriminant analysis.
   Objective: To determine whether 1 MHz of continuous ultrasound can
   identify tibial stress fractures in subjects.
   Background: Stress fractures can lead to loss of function or to more
   serious nonunion fractures. Early diagnosis is important to reduce the
   risk of further injury and to assure a safe return to activity.
   Therapeutic ultrasound has been reported to be an accessible, less
   expensive alternative in diagnosing stress fractures compared with other
   diagnostic techniques.
   Methods and Measures: Twenty-six subjects (12 men, 20.33 +/- 1.37 years;
   14 women, 20.78 +/- 3.8 years) with unilateral tibia pain for less than
   2 weeks volunteered to participate in the study. Continuous, 1 MHz
   ultrasound was applied to the uninvolved and involved tibias at 7
   increasing intensities for 30 seconds each. Subjects completed a visual
   analog scale after the application of each intensity to assess the pain
   response to ultrasound. Results from the visual analog scale were
   compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to determine if
   continuous ultrasound could predict whether subjects had a normal MRI,
   increased bone remodeling, or advanced bone remodeling consistent with a
   stress fracture.
   Results: Discriminant analysis on the visual analog scale correctly
   classified subjects into 1 of 3 clinical classification groups in
   42.31\% of the cases. None of the subjects found to have a stress
   fracture by MRI were correctly identified by continuous ultrasound. This
   resulted in a predicted sensitivity of 0\% and a predicted specificity
   of 100\%.
   Conclusions: A protocol using visual analog scores after the application
   of 1 MHz continuous ultrasound is not sensitive for identifying subjects
   with tibial stress fractures.}},

   nonobese men and 12 nonobese women using the meal fatty acid
   tracer/adipose tissue biopsy study design. In addition to determining
   body composition, measurements of regional adipose tissue lipoprotein
   lipase activity, blood flow, and fat cell size were performed to place
   the meal fatty acid kinetic studies in perspective. Twenty-four hours
   after ingesting the test meal, the concentration of meal fatty acids was
   greater (P < 0.05) in abdominal subcutaneous than in thigh adipose
   tissue in both men (0.61 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.09 mg/g) and women
   (0.59 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.43 +/- 0.05) but was not different between men and
   women. A greater percentage of dietary fat was stored in subcutaneous
   adipose tissue in women than in men (38 +/- 3 vs. 24 +/- 3\%,
   respectively, P < 0.05), and a greater portion of meal fatty acid
   disposal was unaccounted for in men. Significant gender differences in
   regional adipose tissue blood flow after meal ingestion were noted; the
   differences were in the direction that could support greater nutrient
   storage in lower body fat in women.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of the C3d component of complement to enhance antibody

   Analysis of the titers, avidity maturation, and hemagglutinin-inhibition
   activity of raised antibody revealed that immunizations with sHA-3C3d
   DNA accelerated both the avidity maturation of antibody to HA and the
   appearance of hemagglutinin-inhibition activity. These accelerated
   antibody responses correlated to a more rapid appearance of protective

   applications for postoperative followup: Initial results}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{191}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: The idea of using telemedical applications to evaluate
   patients remotely is several decades old. It has already been
   established that x-ray images (and magnetic resonance images) can be
   transferred using a personal computer and a modem, and many other such
   applications have been implemented. Over the past 50 years the expense
   and technical demands of the equipment involved in telemedicine have
   hindered its widespread deployment. The purpose of this study is to
   evaluate the ability of a mobile, low-bandwidth telemedicine platform to
   achieve real-time postoperative visits in the home.
   Study Design: This evaluation was designed to evaluate the feasibility
   of performing a real-time clinical visit with computer and
   telecommunications hardware and software. A nurse and medical student
   (for information gathering only) made postoperative visits at patients'
   homes while the physician stayed at the office. Clinical evaluations
   were performed by using low-resolution and frame-rate video,
   high-resolution still images, and simultaneous telephony over a standard
   telephone line. These remote visits were followed by a standard visit in
   the office. Eleven patients were included, all of whom had undergone
   various laparoscopic procedures. They lived 5 to 240 miles from their
   surgeon. Efficiency was measured by recording the time required to
   capture and send data required by the physician to make a clinical
   decision. The time expense was measured at both the patients' and
   physician's locations. Technical issues were evaluated and patient
   satisfaction was assessed by standardized objective questionnaires. The
   accuracy of the evaluation at the remote visit was determined with a
   standard office visit.
   Results: No technical problems were observed. The mean total time of the
   housecall at the remote site was 86 minutes (range 60 to 160 minutes)
   and at the base station site was 41 minutes (range 21 to 71 minutes).
   After personnel became familiar with the system, the last three visits
   averaged 61 and 25 minutes at the two sites, respectively. This
   corresponds favorably with current time requirements for visiting nurses
   and office visits. The patients were highly satisfied with the home
   visit and, on average, rated the experience as 4.8 out of a maximum of
   5.
   Conclusions: Followup visits in patients' homes after laparoscopic
   procedures can be accomplished by transmitting simultaneous voice,
   low-resolution video, and high-resolution still images to accurately
   perform postoperative evaluations over standard telephone lines, with
   time requirements and clinical accuracy similar to those of standard
   visits. (J Am Coll Surg 2000;191: 196-203. (C) 2000 by the American
   College of Surgeons).}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: TO determine the needs of surgical residents as teachers of
   clinical clerks.
   DESIGN: A needs assessment survey.
   SETTING: Department of Surgery, University of Toronto,
   PARTICIPANTS: Clinical clerks and surgical residents and staff surgeons.
   METHODS: Three stakeholder groups were defined: staff surgeons, surgical
   residents and clinical clerks. Focus-group sessions using the nominal
   group technique identified key issues from the perspectives of clerics
   and residents. Resulting information was used to develop needs
   assessment surveys, which were administered to 170 clinical clerks and
   190 surgical residents, Faculty viewpoints were assessed with
   semistructured interviews, Triangulation of these 3 data sources
   provided a balanced approach to identifying the needs of surgical
   residents as teachers.
   RESULTS: Response rates were 64\% for clinical clerks and 66\% for
   surgical residents. Five staff surgeons were interviewed, Consensus was
   noted among the stakeholder groups regarding the importance of staff
   surgeon role modelling and feedback, resident attitude, time management,
   knowledge of clerks' formal learning objectives, and appropriate times
   and locations for teaching. Discrepancies included a significant
   difference in opinion regarding the residents' capacity to address
   clerks' individual learning needs and to foster good tram relationships.
   Residents indicated that they did not receive regular feedback regarding
   their teaching and that staff did not place an emphasis on their
   teaching role.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study has, from a multi-source perspective, assessed
   the needs of surgical residents as teachers. These needs include
   enhancing residents' education regarding how and what to teach medical
   students on a surgical rotation, and a need for staff surgeons to
   increase feedback to residents regarding their reaching.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To investigate the nature and cause of an acute, anomalous
   stromal edema after epithelial debridement in the rabbit cornea.
   METHODS. Series I: Adult New Zealand White rabbit corneas were mounted
   in perfusion chambers. The endothelium was bathed with Ringer's fluid,
   and the outer surface was covered with silicone oil. The epithelium of
   one eye was debrided with a scalpel before mounting, and the cornea of
   the fellow eye was debrided with a rotating brush after stabilization in
   the perfusion chamber. Using specular microscope tracking software, it
   was possible to measure total swelling and local swelling within the
   cornea. Series II: Diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution 0.1\% or a
   placebo was applied topically, 1 drop per 45 minutes fur 3 hours before
   animals were euthanatized.
   RESULTS. Series I: Corneas with their epithelium scraped with a scalpel
   before mounting were 37.5 +/- 17.5 mu m (n = 6; P < 0.001) thicker in
   vitro than the stromas of perfused, intact fellow corneas. Epithelial
   debridement with a rotating brush after mounting resulted in an
   immediate (within 8 minutes) stromal swelling that plateaued in 1 hour
   at 31.0 +/- 5.3 mu m(n = 6; P < 0.001). Curiously, in six of six
   corneas, the anterior stroma swelled more than the posterior stroma. In
   four of six corneas, the posterior stroma thinned. Analysis showed this
   pattern to be consistent with a sudden increase in anterior swelling
   pressure or osmotic pressure and to be inconsistent with a change in
   endothelial transport properties. Series II: Placebo-treated corneas
   swelled 30.6 +/- 7.7 mu m (n = 5) 1 hour after debridement, whereas
   corneas pretreated with diclofenac sodium swelled only 19.2 +/- 3.1 mu m
   (n = 6; P < 0.008).
   CONCLUSIONS. The anterior stromal swelling occurs rapidly and near the
   site of epithelial injury suggesting messenger and/or enzymatic
   involvement with an effect parallel to apoptosis. Reduction of the
   swelling response with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
   implicates the cyclooxygenase pathway. The swelling is similar to the
   unexplained acute edema that occurs during inflammation in the rat paw
   edema model, and may represent a general mechanism for mobilization of
   inflammatory cells.}},

Abstract = {{During the past 50 years forests have recolonized extensive areas of
   Puerto Rico. Between 1950 and 1990 forest cover increased from 9\% to
   37\% of the island's land area. Ln proportional terms more land has
   reverted to forest in Puerto Rico than anywhere else on earth during the
   second half of the twentieth century This paper explores the geography
   of this process by matching changes in land cover with the
   characteristics of the land and communities in Puerto Rico. The
   reversion of agricultural lands to forest occurred most frequently in
   humid, upland, coffee-growing regions characterized by heavy
   out-migration and populations of smallholders who earned some of their
   income from off-farm sources. These findings suggest that changes in
   non-farm labor markets, as well as changes in the political economy of
   agriculture, have important impacts on the prospects for converting
   agricultural lands into forests.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Determining both the frequency and the spectrum of p53 gene
   mutation in young patients with gastric cancer might provide clues to
   the host related genetic mechanism(s) in gastric carcinogenesis.
   Patients and methods-p53 mutations were assessed (by means of polymerase
   chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP),
   followed by DNA sequencing) in a cohort of 105 consecutive Italian
   patients in whom gastric cancer was ascertained before the age of 41.
   Results-A low prevalence of p53 mutations (eight of 105) was observed,
   with no significant difference between intestinal (three of 31; 10\%)
   and diffuse (five of 74; 7\%) phenotypes. A significantly higher
   prevalence of p53 mutations was associated with the cardiac location
   (odds ratio, 7.09; confidence interval, 1.56 to 32.11). In all but one
   case, p53 mutations were associated with a stage higher than I. All
   eight mutations were located at CpG sites, where G : C to A: T
   transitions have been associated with frequent methylation at the C5
   position of cytosine.
   Conclusions-These findings show that, unlike what has been consistently
   demonstrated in the general population, p53 mutations are uncommon in
   gastric cancer occurring in young patients, and in such patients, p53
   alterations are significantly associated with the cardiac location.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{771-779}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The effect of benzodiazepines (BZs) on GABA(A)-ergic synaptic responses
   depends on the control receptor occupancy: the BZ-induced enhancement of
   receptor affinity can lead to greater peak amplitudes of quantal
   responses only when, under normal conditions, receptors are not fully
   saturated at peak. Based on this fact, receptor occupancy at the peak of
   spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) has been
   assessed in various mammalian neuronal preparations. To use the same
   principle with compound (or multiquantal), action potential-evoked
   IPSCs, complications introduced by quantal asynchrony in conjunction
   with the BZ-induced increase in the decay time of the quantal responses
   have to be overcome. We used a simple analytic convolution model to
   calculate expected changes in the rise time and amplitude of
   postsynaptic currents when the decay time constant, but not the peak
   amplitude, of the underlying quantal responses is increased, this being
   the expected BZ effect at saturated synapses. Predictions obtained were
   compared with the effect of the BZ flunitrazepam on IPSCs recorded in
   paired pre-and postsynaptic whole cell voltage-clamp experiments on
   striatal neurons in cell culture. In 22 pairs, flunitrazepam (500 nM)
   reliably prolonged the decay of IPSCs (49 +/- 19\%, mean +/- SE) and in
   18 of 22 cases produced an enhancement in their peak amplitude that
   varied markedly between 3 and 77\% of control (26.0 +/- 5.3\%). The
   corresponding change in rise time, however (+0.38 +/- 0.11 ms, range
   -0.8 to +1.3 ms) was far smaller than calculated for the observed
   changes in peak amplitude assuming fixed quantal size. Because therefore
   an increase in quantal size is required to explain our findings,
   postsynaptic GABAA receptors were most likely not saturated during
   impulse-evoked transmission at these unitary connections. The peak
   amplitudes of miniature IPSCs in these neurons were also increased by
   flunitrazepam (500 nM, +26.8 +/- 6.6\%), and their decay time constant
   was increased by 26.3 +/- 7.3\%. Using these values in our model led to
   a slight overestimate of the change in compound IPSC amplitude (+28 to
   +30\%).}},

Abstract = {{Two slow currents have been described in rat sympathetic neurons during
   and after tetanization of the whole preganglionic input. Both effects
   are mediated by nicotinic receptors activated by native acetylcholine
   (ACh). A first current, indicated as I-AHPsyn, is calcium dependent and
   voltage independent, and is consistent with an I-AHP-type potassium
   current sustained by calcium ions accompanying the nicotinic synaptic
   current. The conductance activated by a standard synaptic train was
   similar to 3.6 nS per neuron; it was detected in isolation in 14 out of
   a 52-neuron sample. A novel current, I-ADPsyn, was described in 42/52 of
   the sample as a post-tetanic inward current, which increased in
   amplitude with increasing membrane potential negativity and exhibited a
   null-point close to the holding potential and the cell momentary
   chloride equilibrium potential. I-ADPsyn developed during synaptic
   stimulation and decayed thereafter according to a single exponential
   (mean tau = 148.5 ms) in 18 neurons or according to a two-exponential
   time course (tau = 51.8 and 364.9 ms, respectively) in 19 different
   neurons. The mean peak conductance activated was similar to 20 nS per
   neuron. I-ADPsyn was calcium independent, it was affected by internal
   and external chloride concentration, but was insensitive to specific
   blockers (anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, 9AC) of the chloride channels
   open in the resting neuron. It is suggested that g(ADPsyn) represents a
   specific chloride conductance activatable by intense nicotinic
   stimulation; in some neurons it is even associated with single
   excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSCs). Both I-AHP and I-ADPsyn are
   apparently devoted to reduce neuronal excitability during and after
   intense synaptic stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematically rigorous Hamiltonian theory of nonrelativistic axial

   the corresponding axial-continuum model to calculate suitable
   phase-space orbits. The derivation of this result makes essential use of
   a rigorous version of a theorem of Besjes on single-phase first-order
   averaging theory and of an asymptotic formula for the distribution of
   quasilattice points along arbitrary quasilattice axes of the considered
   IQC model. A deep number-theoretic result of Niederreiter is used to

Abstract = {{The effect of a postharvest hot-water dip treatment (HWT) at 53 degrees
   C for 3 min and a 3-day heat-conditioning treatment at 37 degrees C with
   air (HAT) at 90-95\% RH on chilling tolerance and catalase (CAT)
   activity was compared in `Fortune' mandarins. The HWT treatment
   increased CAT activity in the fruit, but after they were removed from
   high temperature to cold storage a rapid decline in CAT activity was
   associated with increased chilling injury. Greater chilling tolerance
   and CAT activity was induced when fruits were conditioned for 3 days at
   37 degrees C and 90-95\% RH. The CAT activity in fruits exposed to HAT
   was higher than in the dipped and the non-heated fruits over the storage
   period at 2 degrees C. An inhibitor of CAT activity,
   3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT), caused peel damage in HAT `Fortune'
   mandarins and in the chilling-tolerant `Clementine' and `Clemenules'
   cultivars stored at 2 degrees C but not at 12 degrees C (non-chilling
   temperature). CAT activity was reduced about two to three times by AT
   upon cold storage in the cultivars studied. Little difference was found
   in the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase
   (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) between AT-treated and non-treated
   fruits. The data indicate that CAT may be a major antioxidant enzyme
   involved in the defence mechanism of mandarin fruits against chilling
   stress. Our results also suggest that the different effectiveness of the
   heat-conditioning treatments in increasing chilling tolerance of
   `Fortune' mandarins may be related to induction of CAT activity during
   heating and on its persistence during cold storage. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Occasional and transient increase in liver enzymes is
   reported during growth hormone (GH) treatment in girls with Turner
   syndrome (TS).
   Methods: Retrospectively, the specific role of GH treatment on liver and
   muscular enzymes was evaluated in 78 patients (48 boys; age range
   4.0-20.8 years) affected by GH deficiency (GHD) who had been treated
   with GH for at least 1 year (range: 1-15 years). All patients had normal
   serum levels of liver and muscular enzymes before GH therapy was
   started.
   Results: A clinically asymptomatic and mild increase in serum
   transaminase levels was observed in 6 of 78 patients with GHD during GH
   treatment; 3 (3.8\%) of the patients showed an isolated, transitory and
   self-limiting increase in serum liver transaminase levels which was
   noticed 6 to 12 months after GH treatment was started, and normalized
   spontaneously within 3 to 6 months, without stopping the therapy. Three
   additional patients showed a transitory mild increase both in aspartate
   aminotransferase (AST) and creatine phosphokinase (CK) which also
   normalized spontaneously within 3 to 6 months. The increase in
   transaminase levels was not related to the brand of GH preparations nor
   to the dosage administered.
   Conclusions: A mild, transient, self-limiting increase in serum
   transaminase may occur during GH treatment. Concomitant determination of
   CK serum levels may quickly differentiate muscular from hepatic
   hypertransaminasemia. Except for persistent cases, this condition does
   not generally require further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Two studies provide evidence that Latins (i.e., Mexicans and Mexican
   Americans) are guided by a concern with socioemotional aspects of
   workplace relations to a far greater degree than are Anglo-Americans.
   The focus on socioemotional considerations results in Latins having a
   relatively greater preference for workgroups having a strong
   interpersonal orientation. Preferred relational style had a far greater
   impact on preferences for workgroups and judgments about their likely
   success than did the ethnic composition of the workgroups for both
   Latins and Anglo-Americans, Evidence that the two groups differ markedly
   in relational schemas comes from examination of suggestions about how
   group performance could be improved, judgments about whether a focus on
   socioemotional concerns necessarily entails a reduction in task focus,
   and recall for socioemotional aspects of workgroup interactions.
   Implications for the dynamics of intercultural contact are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a vision technique for position and displacement
   measurement of moving targets. An adapted phase reference pattern is
   fixed to the object to be controlled and allows the location of the
   object in the scene observed by a static camera with an accuracy better
   than 10(-2) pixel. The phase reference pattern is scaled as a function
   of the desired field of observation and position accuracy. Then the
   system measurement performances can he chosen from the nanometer to the
   millimeter ranges (or even larger). Furthermore, the method is self
   calibrating in length, since the phase reference pattern includes its
   own length reference. Drifts in vision system magnification therefore do
   not affect the measurement accuracy, Applications can be used in
   different fields, for instance, the position control of masks and wafers
   in photolithography processes or the servo-control of micro-robots.}},

   Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone) (expt 1). In expt 2, Artemia enriched with
   DIS were fed to mysis l-postlarvae 1 to assess diet performances. The

   larvae at the N6-PZ1 moult are administered DIS (2 mg L-1 day(-1)) + CAR
   (2 mg L-1 day(-1)) and SDW (20 cells mu L-1 mixed algae, Chaetoceros

   feed, and DIS + CAR (2 mg L-1 day(-1) each) thereafter until PZ3
   (survival 91.2\%), as opposed to live microalgae control (81.9\%). A
   significantly better total length was achieved by larvae fed the live
   microalgae control (2.51 mm) or the above artificial diet regime (2.44
   mm) than in all other treatments. Larvae administered this artificial
   diet treatment were significantly heavier (0.039 mg larvae(-1)) than
   those fed the algal control (0.023 mg larvae(-1)) or any other
   treatment. This may result from the combined effect of the artificial

   results demonstrate for the first time the impact that a single first
   feed at the N6-PZ1 moult may have on later development, as all larval
   groups received the same diet from the PZ1 to PZ3 stages. The results
   from expt 2 indicate that the administration of Artemia enriched with
   DIS during mysis 1-post-larvae 1 for L. vannamei larvae results in
   significant increase in survival (88.6\%), total length (5.24 mm) and
   weight (0.155 mg larvae(-1)) in comparison with other enrichments, such
   as DIS 5V1 (without vitamins, but with HUFA) or non-enrichment.}},

Abstract = {{A selective and sensitive method is described for the extractive
   spectrophotometric determination of iron(III), employing
   pyridoxal-4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (PPT) and n-butanol as
   spectrophotometric reagent and extracting solvent, respectively. The
   extraction behaviour of the complex of iron(III) with the reagent in the
   pH range 2.5-6.5 and the effects of various metal ions on the extraction
   are critically studied. Beer's law is valid between 0.5 and 6.0 mu g
   ml(-1). The molar absorptivity is 2.3 x 10(4) dm(3) mol(-1) cm(-1) and
   Sandell's sensitivity index is 2.428 ng ml(-1) at 420 nm. The
   reliability of the method is assured by analysing some standard alloy
   and pharmaceutical samples.}},

Abstract = {{The specific interactions between base pairs and amino acids were
   studied by the multicanonical Monte Carlo method. We sampled numerous
   interaction configurations and side-chain conformations of the amino
   acid by the multicanonical algorithm, and calculated the free energies
   of the interactions between an amino acid at given C-alpha positions and
   a fixed base pair. The contour maps or free energy derived from this
   calculation represent the preferred C-alpha position of the amino acid
   around the base, and these mars of various combinations of bases and
   amino acids can be used to quantify the specificity of intrinsic
   base-amino acid interactions. Similarly, enthalpy and entropy mars will
   provide further details of the specific interactions. We have also
   calculated the free-energy map of the orientations of the C-alpha-C-beta
   bond vector, which indicates the preferential orientation of the amino
   acid against the base. We compared the results obtained by the
   multicanonical method with those of the exhaustive sampling and
   canonical Monte Carlo methods. The free-energy map of the base-amino
   acid interaction obtained by the multicanonical simulation method was
   nearly identical to the accurate result derived from the exhaustive
   sampling method. This indicates that a single multicanonical Monte Carlo
   simulation can produce an accurate free-energy map. Multicanonical Monte
   Carlo sampling produced free-energy maps that were more accurate than
   those produced by canonical Monte Carlo sampling. Thus, the
   multicanonical Monte Carlo method can serve as a powerful tool for
   estimating the free-energy landscape of base-amino acid interactions and
   for elucidating the mechanism by which amino acids of proteins recognize
   particular DNA base pairs. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Consider situations where the depth at each point in the scene is
   multi-valued, due to the presence of a virtual image semi-reflected by a
   transparent surface. The semi-reflected image is linearly superimposed
   on the image of an object that is behind the transparent surface. A
   novel approach is proposed for the separation of the superimposed
   layers. Focusing on either of the layers yields initial separation, but
   crosstalk remains. The separation is enhanced by mutual blurring of the
   perturbing components in the images. However, this blurring requires the
   estimation of the defocus blur kernels. We thus propose a method for
   self calibration of the blur kernels, given the raw images. The kernels
   are sought to minimize the mutual information of the recovered layers.
   Autofocusing and depth estimation in the presence of semi-reflections
   are also considered. Experimental results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Background Bronchoplastic procedures are an accepted surgical approach
   in patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to avoid
   pneumonectomy, Postoperative complications associated with the bronchial
   anastomosis and local recurrence of the tumor have to be considered.
   Experimental design and setting: Retrospective analysis of the clinical
   courses and follow-up of 1610 consecutive patients who received surgical
   resection for NSCLC at the Department of Surgery, Klinikum Grosshadern,
   University of Munich, Germany. Among them there were 134 (8.3\%)
   bronchoplastic resections.
   Methods. Morbidity, mortality, and survival rate were investigated in
   these patients to verify the safety of this technique.
   Results. From all 134 bronchoplastic resections, 105 lobectomies, 22
   bilobectomies, and 7 pneumonectomies were performed, Atelectasis was
   observed in 6.0\% (versus conventional procedures: 3.7\%; p: n.s.),
   whereas anastomotic dehiscence occurred in 3.0\%, in-hospital mortality
   amounted to 3.7\% (versus 5.3\%; p: n.s.). The stage dependent 5-year
   survival in R0-resected patients was comparable in both groups.
   Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that bronchoplastic procedures
   represent a safe therapeutic option in the operative treatment of
   non-small-cell lung cancer that should be considered in all patients

Abstract = {{Background. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator is important for matrix
   degradation and motility of cancer cells. For effective invasion,
   urokinase has to be associated with its cell surface receptor.(1)
   Methods. We analyzed 33 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (hnSCC)
   and 14 mucosal tissue samples for the expression of urokinase receptor
   using Northern hybridization and correlated expression levels to
   clinical and histopathologic data. Urokinase expression was determined
   by fibrin zymography.
   Results. The expression of urokinase receptor is significantly increased
   in hnSCC compared with adjacent mucosa. Expression levels in primary
   tumors show no statistically significant correlations to T staging,
   metastasis, recurrence, or differentiation stage of the resected tumors.
   Furthermore, there was no correlation between urokinase and urokinase
   receptor expression levels in SCC samples.
   Conclusions. Urokinase receptor expression is increased in hnSCC, but it
   is not useful as a prognostic marker for the metastatic behavior of
   primary tumors. Comparison of our data with previously published reports
   is discussed. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   45-50 degrees between T-t and T-i approximate to 100-120K and retains
   the same angle down to 1.5K. The ordered moment values at 1.5 K are
   8.28(9) and 8.13(8)mu(B) per Dy atom and 3.12(5) and 1.79(4)mu(B), per
   (Mn/Cr) atom for the two compounds DyMn5CrSn6 and DyMn4Cr2Sn6,
   respectively. Alloying with the almost non-magnetic Cr leads to a
   substantial decrease of the ordering and of the spin reorientation
   temperatures as well as a reduction of the ordered Dy moment value
   compared to the compound DyMn6Sn6. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{ZF-, LF- and TF- mu SR-measurements were started with the aim to study
   the interplay of the R- and Fe-sublattices in establishing the magnetic
   order by comparing TbFe4Al8 and YFe4Al8. Comparison of the spin-lattice
   relaxation rates between the two compounds shows that the fast
   relaxation visible in TbFe4Al8 arises from the Tb 4f moments and is best
   fitted with a streched exponential (exp ( - lambda t)(beta)). The
   slowing down of the spin dynamics in Tb with beta decreasing from 1 to
   1/3 on approaching T-N from above, is characteristic for the universal
   behaviour of a classical spin glass. However, the T-dependence of
   lambda, resembles more that of a conventional AF system involving rare
   earth moments. As neutron diffraction has shown long-range magnetic
   order sets in immediately below T-N. The present experiment suggests
   that the slowing down of the spin dynamics is governed by competing
   interactions leading to a wide distribution of time correlations.
   However, the ensuing frustration does not seem to be strong enough to
   prevent the onset of long-range magnetic order below T-N involving both
   the Tb and the Fe moments. These results confirm the complex long-range
   ordering process associated with two distinct order parameters and the
   simultaneous ordering of the two sublattices found by neutron
   diffraction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   of frequency-based lifetime characterization as an alternative to
   time-based measurements for MOS devices biased in inversion, One
   consideration during lifetime/diffusion length measurements, is whether
   the near-surface space-charge region or the bulk or quasineutral region
   is characterized. To characterize the near-surface space-charge region
   of the three, one usually makes room temperature pulsed MOS capacitor or
   diode leakage current measurements, We show that room-temperature,
   frequency-domain capacitance, conductance, or resistance measurements
   characterize the quasineutral bulk, not the space-charge region, in
   contrast to room-temperature pulsed MOS-C or diode leakage curl ent
   measurements which characterize the space charge region.}},

Abstract = {{Macrolides may influence the inflammatory response to an infection by
   mechanisms that are unrelated to their antimicrobial effect. Indeed,
   erythromycin and other macrolides inhibit cytokine production and induce
   degranulation of neutrophils in vitro. CXC chemokines are small
   chemotactic cytokines that specifically influence neutrophil functions.
   To determine the effect of a clinically relevant dose of erythromycin on
   the production of CXC chemokines and neutrophil degranulation, six
   healthy humans received a 30 min iv infusion of erythromycin (1000 mg).
   Whole blood obtained before and at various times after the infusion was
   stimulated ex vivo with heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ex vivo
   production of the CXC chemokines interleukin 8 (IL-8) and epithelial
   cell-derived neutrophil attractant 78 (ENA-78), in whole blood obtained
   after erythromycin infusion, was lower than that in blood drawn before
   erythromycin infusion (maximum inhibition post-infusion: 32.9 +/- 6.5\%
   and 35.2 +/- 12.6\% decrease in production, respectively, expressed as
   percentage change relative to production before infusion of
   erythromycin, both P < 0.05). In contrast, infusion of erythromycin was
   associated with an enhanced capacity of whole blood to release the
   neutrophil degranulation products bactericidal/permeability increasing
   protein (BPI), human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and human lactoferrin
   (HLF) upon stimulation with S. pneumoniae. Effects of erythromycin were
   greatest 4 h after infusion was stopped, when BPI, HNE and HLF
   concentrations were increased by +107.6 +/- 33.5\%, +134.7 +/- 34.8\%
   and +205.9 +/- 55.9\%, respectively (expressed as percentage change
   relative to production before infusion of erythromycin) (all P < 0.05).
   These results indicate the ability of erythromycin to reduce CXC
   chemokine production and to enhance neutrophil degranulation in human
   blood.}},

Abstract = {{Staphylococcus aureus was shown to transport iron complexed to a variety
   of hydroxamate type siderophores, including ferrichrome, aerobactin, and
   desferrioxamine. An S. aureus mutant defective in the ability to
   transport ferric hydroxamate complexes was isolated from a Tn917-LTV1
   transposon insertion library after selection on iron-limited media
   containing aerobactin and streptonigrin. Chromosomal DNA banking the
   Tn917-LTV1 insertion was identified by sequencing of chromosomal DNA
   isolated from the mutant. This information localized the transposon
   insertion to a gene whose predicted product shares significant
   similarity with FhuG of Bacillus subtilis. DNA sequence information was
   then used to clone a larger fragment of DNA surrounding the fhuG gene,
   and this resulted in the identification of an operon of three genes,
   fhuCBG, all of which show significant similarities to ferric hydroxamate
   uptake (fhu) genes in B. subtilis. FhuB and FhuG are highly hydrophobic,
   suggesting that they are embedded within the cytoplasmic membrane, while
   FhuC shares significant homology with ATP-binding proteins. Given this,
   the S. aureus FhuCBG proteins were predicted to be part of a binding
   protein-dependent transport system for ferric hydroxamates. Exogenous
   iron levels were shown to regulate ferric hydroxamate uptake in S.
   aureus. This regulation is attributable to Fur in S. aureus because a
   strain containing an insertionally inactivated fur gene showed maximal
   levels of ferric hydroxamate uptake even when the cells were grown under
   iron-replete conditions. By using the Fur titration assay, it was shown
   that the Fur box sequences upstream of fhuCBG are recognized by the
   Escherichia coli Fur protein.}},

Abstract = {{A series of systematic investigations have been carried out on a new
   type of full-color display devices combining ultraviolet (UV) thin film
   electroluminescence (EL) with red, green and blue (RGB) visible-light
   phosphors. The device structure is composed of phosphor/Indium Tin Oxide
   (ITO)/a-SiNx/ZnF2:Gd/a-SiNx/Al/glass. UV emission from a ZnF2:Gd active
   layer is employed as an excitation source for the phosphors. For the
   UV-EL/photoluminecsence (PL) hybrid device using blue light-emitting
   phosphors, a maximum luminance of 10 cd/m(2) and a maximum efficiency of
   0.015 1m/W has been achieved while the luminance of red and green
   light-emitting devices were 50 and 30 cd/m(2), respectively, under an
   applied voltage of 250 V0-p (5 kHz sinusoidal voltage). Technical data
   on the fabrication of the thin film UV-EL device together with RGB
   visible-light PL layers are presented. Research and development efforts
   on the optimum design and optoelectronic performance and related
   characterizations are also described and discussed. It is believed that
   there will be a tremendous demand fur the developed device which has a
   much higher picture element resolution and the possibility of a higher
   brightness as compared with recently introduced plasma display panels

Abstract = {{The term ``environmental justice{''} is a relatively recent addition to
   the lexicon of public health and risk-based decision making. Although it
   is currently a prominent public policy issue, there is no
   consensus-derived definition, nor is there general agreement about
   viable mechanisms for putting worthwhile social goals (e.g., fairness,
   equity, and justice) into operation. Nevertheless, the concept of
   environmental justice has focused attention on important questions of
   whether economically and politically disadvantaged communities bear a
   disproportionate burden of environmental pollution, and whether past
   environmental policies, programs and practices have been fair and
   equitable. Among individuals and organizations involved with issues of
   environmental justice there is a spectrum of strong and often
   contradictory convictions about the nature and role of risk assessment.
   Critics are convinced it is part of the problem and are inclined to see
   it as an ethically suspect, resource-intensive, elitist, never-ending
   process used to maintain the status quo. Advocates, on the other hand,
   contend that risk assessment is an essential policy and regulatory tool
   for identifying, evaluating, and resolving instances of environmental
   injustice, and that it provides a unifying conceptual framework and a
   common language for constructive dialogue on the issue. This article
   argues that, in practice, risk assessment has contributed to both the
   reality and the perception of environmental justice problems because of
   the overly narrow and restricted manner in which it has been applied. In
   principle, however, risk assessment is part of the solution to
   environment injustices because it provides a beneficial construct for
   framing key questions and fostering constructive debate about how to
   answer them. Well-designed research studies and high-quality risk
   assessments are necessary to define the dimensions of the problem, to
   understand the root causes, and to identify effective, efficient, and
   equitable solutions. Ultimately, attaining the goal of environmental
   justice depends on putting risk assessment principles into practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose. The goal of this investigation was to study the
   recover of ankle plantar-flexor peak torque, fatigue resistance, and
   functional ability (stair climbing, walking) following cast
   immobilization in patients with ankle fractures. Subjects. The
   participants were 10 patients who underwent open reduction-internal
   fixation and 8 weeks of cast immobilization following a fracture of the
   ankle mortise and 10 age- and sex-matched, noninjured comparison
   subjects. Methods. Plantar-flexor torque and fatigue resistance were
   measured at 1, 5, and 10 weeks of rehabilitation using an isokinetic
   dynamometer. Ankle plantar-flexor peak torque and fatigue resistance
   were correlated to timed ambulation, time stair climbing, and unilateral
   heel-rises. Results. Following immobilization, plantar-flexor peak
   torque was decreased at all angular speeds and positions. The decrease
   in peak torque was associated with an increase in fatigue resistance.
   With rehabilitation, ankle plantar-flexor torque and fatigue resistance
   renormaled. Regression analysis revealed a strong relationship between
   plantar-flexor peak torque and functional measures. By 10 weeks
   post-immobilization, peak torque, fatigue resistance, and all measures
   of functional performance had returned to control levels. Conclusion and
   Discussion. The decrease in muscle performance, functional ability, and
   fatigue resistance induced by 8 weeks of cast immobilization can be
   reversed with 10 weeks of supervised physical therapy. In addition, this
   study demonstrated that ankle-plantar flexor torque is a good predictor
   of stair-climbing and walking performance in patients with ankle
   fractures.}},

Journal = {{GASTROENTEROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: The published risk of adenocarcinoma in the setting
   of Barrett's esophagus (BE) varies. Publication bias, the selective
   reporting of studies featuring positive or extreme results, may result
   in overestimation of this cancer risk in the literature. The aim of this
   study was to assess those publications reporting a cancer risk in BE for
   evidence of publication bias. Methods: A MEDLINE search for all
   published estimates between 1966 and 1998 of cancer risk in BE was
   performed. All studies reporting a cancer risk expressible in cancers
   per patient-year of follow-up were retrieved. Bibliographies of these
   studies were surveyed for additional estimates. All publications that
   required an initial endoscopy with histologic confirmation of BE and any
   cancer were included. The relationship of reported cancer risk to size
   of the study was assessed, Multivariable regression controlling for
   differences in definition of BE, as well as other study characteristics,
   was performed. The data were also analyzed by means of a funnel diagram,
   an epidemiologic method to assess publication bias. Results: Five
   hundred fifty-four abstracts were reviewed. Twenty-seven publications
   met the stated criteria for inclusion. There was a strong correlation
   between cancer risk and the size of the study, with small studies
   reporting much higher risks of cancer than larger studies. This
   association persisted when differences in the definition of BE,
   retrospective vs. prospective nature of the study, surveillance
   interval, and the effect of cancer detected in the first year were
   considered. The funnel diagram analysis suggested publication bias.
   Conclusions: The cancer risk in BE may be overestimated in the
   literature due to publication bias.}},

Title = {{Sulfur isotope characteristics of the Archean Cu-Zn Gossan Hill VHMS
   deposit, Western Australia}},
Journal = {{MINERALIUM DEPOSITA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{533-550}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Gossan Hill is an Archean (similar to 3.0 Ga) Cu-Zn-magnetite-rich
   volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposit in the Yilgarn Craton of
   Western Australia. Massive sulfide and magnetite occur within a layered
   succession of tuffaceous, felsic volcaniclastic rocks of the Golden
   Grove Formation. The Gossan Hill deposit consists of two
   stratigraphically separate ore zones that are stratabound and
   interconnected by sulfide veins. Thickly developed massive sulfide and
   stock\textbackslash{}work zones in the north of the deposit are
   interpreted to represent a feeder zone. The deposit is broadly zoned
   from a Cu-Fe rich lower ore zone, upwards through Cu-Zn to Zn-Ag-Au-Pb
   enrichment in the upper ore zone. New sulfur isotope studies at the
   Gossan Hill deposit indicate that the variation is wider than previously
   reported, with sulfide delta(34)S values varying between -1.6 and 7.8
   parts per thousand, with an average of 2.1 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand (1
   sigma error). Sulfur isotope values have a broad systematic
   stratigraphic increase of approximately 1.2 parts per thousand from the
   base to the top of the deposit. This variation in sulfur isotope values
   is significant in view of typical narrow ranges for Archean VHMS
   deposits. Copper-rich sulfides in the lower ore zone have a narrower
   range (delta(34)S values of -1.6 to 3.4 parts per thousand, average
   similar to 1.6 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand) than sulfides in the upper
   ore zone. The lower ore zone is interpreted to have formed from a
   relatively uniform reduced sulfur source dominated by leached igneous
   rock sulfur and minor magmatic sulfur. Towards the upper Zn-rich ore
   zone, an overall increase in delta(34)S values is accompanied by a wider
   range of delta(34)S values, with the greatest variation occurring in
   massive pyrite at the southern margin of the upper ore zone (-1.0 to 7.8
   parts per thousand). The higher average delta(34)S by mixing the values
   (2.8 +/- 2.1 parts per thousand) and their wider range are explained by
   mixing of hydrothermal fluids containing leached igneous rock sulfur
   with Archean seawater (delta(34)S values of 2 to 3 parts per thousand)
   near the paleoseafloor. The widest range of delta(34)S values at the
   southern margin of the deposit occurs away from the feeder zone and is
   attributed to greater seawater mixing away from the central upflow zone.}},

   based on leaf morphology (keeled, concave, plane) form monophyletic
   groups, and that species delineation based on morphological characters

   Brachelyma subulata to root the tree, both Dichelyma and Fontinalis are
   monophyletic and patristically divergent (each united by >15
   synapomorphic mutations). Groups of species within Fontinalis defined by
   leaf morphology are polyphyletic and it is clear that leaf morphology is

   are nonmonophyletic for both nr- and cpDNA sequences and populations of
   some morphological taxa are separated in widely divergent clades,
   Molecular evidence suggests that at least some morphospecies are
   artificial, defined by convergent leaf forms. The weight of the evidence
   indicates that F, antipyretica is positively paraphyletic, with European
   populations more closely related to (i.e., share a more recent common

   populations that are morphologically conspecific. North American
   populations are more closely related to North American endemic species.

   virus were able to overcome protection induced by fpIBD1 whereas
   challenge with a low titre of virus did not. The genotype of chicken
   also has an important effect on the outcome of challenge possibly as a
   result of the major histocompatability complex and its ability to
   present VP2-derived peptides to the immune system. It was not possible
   to protect the inbred white leghorn chicken strain, line 15I, from
   IBDV-induced bursal damage by vaccination with fpIBD1 even at the lowest

Volume = {{140}},

Abstract = {{Background Although reduced intracellular levels of magnesium have been
   described in patients with acute myocardial infarction, its significance
   as a regulator of thrombosis remains unknown.
   Methods and Results To determine whether reduced intracellular levels of
   magnesium enhance platelet-dependent thrombosis, we evaluated 42
   patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) by exposing porcine aortic
   media to their Flowing unanticoagulated venous blood for 5 minutes by
   using an ex vivo perfusion (Badimon) chamber. Baseline analysis
   demonstrated significant associations between intracellular levels of
   magnesium, platelet-dependent thrombosis (P =.02), and platelet
   P-selectin (CD62P) expression (P <.05), Patients were divided into 2
   groups: below (n = 22) and above (n = 20) the median intracellular
   levels of magnesium (1.12, mu g/mg protein). There were no significant
   differences in age, body mass index, serum lipids, fibrinogen, platelet
   count, or serum magnesium levels between the two groups.
   Platelet-dependent thrombosis was significantly higher in patients with
   intracellular levels of magnesium below compared with above median
   (150+/- 128 vs 45 +/- 28 mu m(2)/mm, P <.004). Neither platelet
   aggregation nor CD62P expression was significantly different between the
   two groups.

   carried out using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Mass spectra of
   positive and negative cluster ions were observed as a function of delay
   time between the irradiation of the laser pulse and the acceleration of
   ions. The mass distribution of clusters changed significantly in the
   initial phase (less than or equal to 10 mu s) after the irradiation of
   the laser pulse. The sizes of both positive and negative cluster ions
   grow with the increase in the delay rime. These results indicate that
   clustering reactions progress even in vacuum without ambient gas. The
   mechanism of clustering is considered to be reactions among various
   carbon ions and neutral species in the laser ablation plume.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To explore changes in demographic distribution, incidence
   and survival rates of oral cancer in the United States from 1973 through
   1996. Methods: From the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   (SEER) data, we computed the proportion of oral cancer by demographic
   characteristics, site, and stage at diagnosis for 1973-84 and 1985-96.
   We estimated incidence and 5-year relative survival rates of oral cancer
   by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and compared survival rates between
   the two periods. The estimated annual percent change (EAPC) was used to
   explore trends in incidence rate from 1973 through 1996. results: Most
   of the tongue and floor of mouth cancers (>54\%) reported during 1973-84
   and 1985-96 had spread to a distant site at time of diagnosis. The
   age-adjusted annual incidence rates of oral cancer decreased among white
   men from 1973 through 1996, but increased among black men aged 65-69
   years, and among young white men (aged 30-34 years) and women (aged
   25-29 years). These changes in trend were all statistically significant
   (testing EAPC = 0 at the 0.05 level). Overall, there was no improvement
   in the 5-year relative survival rate of either whites or blacks with
   oral cancer. Conclusion: There was little change in early detection of
   oral cancer or in 5-year relative survival rates between 1973-84 and
   1985-96 in nine SEER regions. This suggests a deficiency in professional
   and public education regarding early diagnosis of oral cancer.
   Furthermore, the increasing trend of oral cancer among older black men
   and among younger whites merits further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnostic role of intraoperative cytology (IC) has been
   demonstrated by many comparative studies. These studies have used
   sensitivity and specificity as statistical tools, based on binary
   principles. Statistical methods based on binary principles appear to be
   inappropriate for comparing anatomic pathology studies which involve
   significant human judgment with a range of subjective nonbinary result
   patterns. In this study, we applied the receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve, which is based on probabilistic principles
   for the comparison of diagnostic accuracy with IC and frozen sections
   (FS). Seven observers studied a variable number of IC alone, FS alone,
   and IC/FS together from a pool of 446 specimens. The results were
   analyzed by ROC curve, using the MEDCALC software program (MedCalc
   Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). The accuracy with IC alone and FS alone
   was comparable. IC alone was diagnostic for many lesions, offering the
   choice of not freezing the tissue, and thus avoiding the introduction of
   artifacts. This strongly favors the routine practice of preparing IC
   during intraoperative consultation. Diagn. Cytopathol. 2000,23.134-139.

Abstract = {{Denitrogenation processes for light oils, based on a combination of UV
   irradiation and liquid-liquid extraction, have been investigated. Two
   extraction systems, one oil/water and the other oil/acetonitrile, were
   used for the denitrogenation of three separate light oils, of differing
   nitrogen content and hydrocarbon composition. The denitrogenation
   results, obtained for three model nitrogen compounds (aniline, indole,
   and carbazole), were compared with those obtained for the actual light
   oils. In the oil/water system, the photodecomposition of carbazole was
   found to be strongly suppressed by the presence of double-ring aromatic
   hydrocarbons. This adverse effect, however, was reduced by the addition
   of hydrogen peroxide to the water phase, and in the presence of 30\%
   hydrogen peroxide and 36 h of photoirradiation, the nitrogen content of
   the light oils was decreased successfully to <20\% of the feed value. In
   the oil/acetonitrile system, the nitrogen-containing compounds in the
   light oils were extracted into the acetonitrile phase and were there
   photodecomposed effectively, even in the presence of double-ring
   aromatics. In this way and with 10 h of photoirradiation, the nitrogen
   content of the light; oils was decreased successfully to <3\% of the
   feed concentration. Both of the proposed processes, however, were found
   to have difficulty in the denitrogenation of highly substituted
   alkylcarbazole compounds. In both processes, desulfurization occurred
   simultaneously with denitrogenation, and the sulfur content of light
   oils was also decreased to <30\% and 5\% of the feed values, thus
   revealing that both of the proposed processes are satisfactory for
   application to the simultaneous denitrogenation and desulfurization of
   light oil feedstocks.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the effects of imperatoxin A (IpTx(a)) on local
   calcium release events in permeabilized frog skeletal muscle fibers,
   using laser scanning confocal microscopy in linescan mode. IpTx(a)
   induced the appearance of Ca2+ release events from the sarcoplasmic
   reticulum that are similar to 2 s and have a smaller amplitude (31 +/-
   2\%) than the ``Ca2+ sparks{''} normally seen in the absence of toxin,
   The frequency of occurrence of long-duration imperatoxin-induced Ca2+
   release events increased in proportion to IpTx(a) concentrations ranging
   from 10 nM to 50 nM. The mean duration of imperatoxin-induced events in
   muscle fibers was independent of toxin concentration and agreed closely
   with the channel open time in experiments on isolated frog ryanodine
   receptors (RyRs) reconstituted in planar lipid bilayer, where IpTx(a)
   induced opening of single Ca2+ release channels to prolonged
   subconductance states. These results suggest involvement of a single
   molecule of IpTx(a) in the activation of a single Ca2+ release channel
   to produce a long-duration event. Assuming the ratio of full conductance
   to subconductance to be the same in the fibers as in bilayer, the
   amplitude of a spark relative to the long event indicates involvement of
   at most four RyR Ca2+ release channels in the production of
   short-duration Ca2+ sparks.}},

Title = {{Impact of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha gene polymorphism on IgA nephropathy}},
Journal = {{KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{783-789}},

Abstract = {{Background It is evident that cytokines play an important role in the
   pathogenesis as well as disease progression in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).
   The level of cytokine production is influenced by different genotypes
   that reflect gene polymorphism of the pertinent cytokine. Interleukin-1
   receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
   (TNF-alpha) gene polymorphism have been found to affect disease
   susceptibility and activity in several inflammatory diseases. However,
   the impact of these polymorphisms in IgAN patients has not previously
   been thoroughly studied.
   Methods. We investigated 111 cases of biopsy-proven IgAN and 100
   healthy, normal controls for their IL-1ra and TNF-alpha gene
   polymorphism. IL-1ra gene polymorphism was characterized as a variable
   number of tandem repeats of a 86 bp sequence within intron 2. Five
   alleles were identified and were designated as IL1RN{*}1, IL1RN{*}2,
   IL1RN{*}3, IL1RN{*}4, and IL1RN{*}5, corresponding to 4, 2, 5, 3, 6
   repeats, respectively. A polymorphism in the promoter region of the
   TNF-alpha gene was also studied. This polymorphism involved a guanidine
   to adenosine transition at position -308 and was designated as TNF1
   (-308G) and TNF2 (-308A).
   Results. There were 54 male and 57 female patients with a mean age of
   30.3 +/- 12.5 years and a disease duration of 66.8 +/- 47.2 months. The
   mean duration of the follow-up period was 47.3 +/- 32.6 months. In the
   patient group, the allele frequencies of IL1RN{*}1, IL1RN{*}2,
   IL1RN{*}3, IL1RN{*}4, and IL1RN{*}5 were 89.6\%, 9.9\%, 0\%, 0.5\%, and
   0\%, respectively, whereas the corresponding carriage rates were 100\%,
   19.8\%, 0\%, 0.9\%, and 0\%, respectively. An excessive carriage of
   IL2RN{*}2 was found in the patients when compared with normal controls
   (allele frequency, 9.9 vs. 2.5\%, P < 0.0001). The allele frequencies of
   TNF1 and TNF2 were 94.1 and 5.9\%, respectively, and the carriage rates
   were 99.1 and 10.8\%, respectively, in the patients, which was not
   significantly different from those of normal controls. When the patients
   were stratified into mild and severe groups according to their initial
   presentation, none of the studied alleles correlated with the severity.
   However, patients with gross hematuria were associated with a higher
   carriage rate of TNF2 when compared with patients without gross
   hematuria (allele frequency, 15.4 vs. 4.6\%, P = 0.0552; carriage rate,
   30.8\% vs. 8.2\%, P = 0.0272). Renal survival analysis revealed that the
   TNF2 carrier had a renal survival comparable with TNF2 (-) patients.
   However, the carriage of the IL1RN{*}2 allele was associated with a
   significantly poorer longterm outcome with a median survival time of 72
   months, as compared with those without IL1RN{*}2 (134 months, P < 0.01).
   Conclusion. IL-1ra and TNF-alpha gene polymorphism may affect disease
   susceptibility as well as disease activity and longterm outcome in human
   IgAN. Treatment with an IL-1ra or IL-1 blocking agent may be relevant in
   those carrying the IL1RN{*}2 allele.}},

Abstract = {{To fully explore the resistance potential of transgenic rice produced by
   Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, an elite line KMD1 was assessed
   for its resistance to eight lepidopteran rice pest species. KMD1
   contained a synthetic cry1Ab gene from Bacillus thuringiensis under the
   control of a maize ubiquitin promoter. It was derived from a commercial
   japonica Chinese rice variety Xiushui 11, and bred true for both
   agronomic traits and a cry1Ab gene when the bioassays were done in 1998
   in the R-5 generation. The eight lepidopteran pest species were: four
   Pyralidae species: Chilo suppressalis (striped stem borer, SSB),
   Scirpophaga incertulas (yellow stem borer, YSB), Cnaphalocrocis
   medinalis (leaf folder), Herpitogramma licarisalis; two Noctuidae:
   Sesamia inferens (pink stem borer, PSB) and Naranga anescens; one
   Stayridae: Mycalesis gotama; and one Hesperiidae, Parnara guttata. In
   laboratory bioassays, 100\% mortality was observed in all insect species
   when their newly hatched or third-instar larvae were fed KMD1 leaf
   tissues, whereas only 9.65\% of the neonates and none of the
   third-instar larvae died when fed the leaf tissues of non-transgenic
   control. Moreover, the leaf area of control tissues consumed in four
   days by stem borers was 20 to 40 times higher than that of KMD1 tissues,
   and the area of control tissues eaten by leaf-feeding species was 120 to
   180 times greater than that of the transgenic tissues. Under natural
   infestation, no KMD1 plant was visibly damaged by the SSB, YSB and leaf
   folder in field evaluation. On the other hand, 80, 9.3 and 88.7\% of
   control plants were injured by SSB, YSB, and leaf folder, respectively.
   These data disclosed that the transgenic line was highly resistant to a
   broad spectrum of lepidopteran insect species and could be useful in
   insect resistance breeding programs.}},

   pressure control (BPC) in a specialised consultation.
   Method: 100 patients with essential systolo-diastolic hypertension (HTA)
   were screened.
   An independant physician measured the blood pressure level with an OMRON
   705 CP device 3 times.
   The acceptable BPC was considered less than 160/95 mmHg and the optimal
   BPC less than 140/90 mmHg. There was 70 man, 30 female (mean age=67 year
   old). The initial mean blood pressure was 169/104 mmHg.
   Results: The final blood pressure measured was 137/80 mmHg, The
   percentage of patients who have an acceptable control (<160/95) was 91\%
   and an optimal control (<140/90) 66\%.
   12\% of these 66 maintain a hight cardio-vascular risk. The mean number
   of medication used was 2 and it's paradoxally not differ beetween the
   optimal blood pressure control group and the other patients who need
   probabelly an intensive medication.
   In conclusion these study shows us the importance in understanding our

Abstract = {{This article describes and analyzes the stream of thought occurring
   concurrently with overt communication about marital conflict. The
   research considers how marital conflicts may be affected by selective
   attention to different elements of conflict (different emotions, issues,
   interactional behaviors, and background events) and by spontaneous
   attributions about communicative intentions and outcomes. One hundred
   eighteen couples discussed a current conflict issue, then individually
   watched a videotape of the discussion and reported thoughts and feelings
   experienced during the discussion. Descriptively, the thoughts revealed
   limited complexity, infrequent perspective taking, a predominant concern
   for implicit relationship issues over content issues, and frequent
   direct analysis of the communication process. Spouses viewed their own
   communication in more favorable terms than their partner's
   communication. Husbands and wives also viewed the interactions
   differently, with wives appearing, in certain respects, more
   other-directed, relationship-sensitive, and objective. Interaction-based
   thoughts were especially subjective in the most severe conflicts, as
   suggested by a lack of correspondence between attributions about
   communication and observer coding of the interactions. Furthermore, in
   severe conflicts and dissatisfied relationships, the individuals had
   more angry, blaming, and pessimistic thoughts and less focus on content
   issues.}},

Abstract = {{A structural model of a one-component sigma-phase crystal has been
   constructed by means of molecular dynamics simulation. The phonon
   dispersion curves and the vibrational density of states were computed
   for this model. The dependence of the vibrational properties on the
   thermodynamical parameters was investigated. The vibrational density of
   states of the sigma-phase structure is found to be similar to that of a
   one-component glass with icosahedral local order. On the basis of this
   comparison it is concluded that the sigma phase can be considered to be
   a good crystalline reference structure for this glass.}},

Abstract = {{The normal processes of aging lead gradually to impairment of the
   function of most organs and to a gradually increasing force of
   mortality. This can to some extent be counteracted by life-long physical
   exercise as evidenced by epidemiological studies. The same is seen in
   animal experiments, where the mean survival time but not the maximum
   lifespan is increased by life-long physical exercise. In previous
   studies we have shown that the with aging increasing thermal stability
   of collagen-a biomarker of aging-is slowed down by life-long physical
   exercise in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Here we investigate whether late
   onset physical exercise also has a beneficial effect on this biomarker
   of aging. We found that mild exercise (100 m/day in a treadmill) retards
   the increase of thermal stability of collagen, when the rats are trained
   from 27 to 30 months of age. On the other hand more extensive exercise
   (400 m/day from 24 to 27 and 200 m/day from 27 to 30 months of age) has
   the opposite effect, which is in agreement with our previous study on
   rats trained from 12 to 24 months of age. We conclude that senescent
   rats can also benefit from physical exercise and that the optimum amount
   of training decreases with age. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. AU rights

Abstract = {{Background. The CT appearance of the normal and abnormal thymus and its
   age-related changes have been described. However, there is no
   information regarding the change in thymus CT attenuation values in
   children.
   Objective. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the normal CT
   attenuation of the thymus in infants and children and discover when the
   decline begins.
   Materials and methods. CT attenuation values of the thymus were
   retrospectively evaluated in 152 children between ages of 1 day and up
   to 14 years. For each patient the mean value of the CT thymus
   attenuation was calculated and compared to CT attenuation of the chest
   wall and cardiac muscles. We also examined the correlation between
   thymic attenuation, gender, and disease. The statistical analysis used
   was multivariate linear regression. Results. C-T attenuation of the
   thymus declines with age, beginning only after the Ist year of life. The
   thymus is more hyperdense than the chest wall and cardiac muscles in
   infants less than 1 year. The thymus is denser in males than females, In
   malignant conditions, in infants less than 1 year, thymus CT attenuation
   is decreased. In older children thymus attenuation was similar to that
   for the chest wall and cardiac muscles.
   Conclusion. The decline in thymic CT attenuation with age is consistent
   with fatty infiltration of the gland. The measurements given in this
   report can serve as a basis for comparison to determine whether the
   thymus of a young child is normal or pathological.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The transfusion of blood components containing WBCs can
   cause unwanted complications, which include virus transmission,
   transfusion-associated GVHD, alloimmunization, febrile reactions, and
   immunomodulation. Phototreatment with 4 mu M of dimethylmethylene blue
   (DMMB) and 13 J per cm(2) of white light irradiation has previously been
   shown to be an effective way to inactivate different models of enveloped
   and nonenveloped viruses in RBC suspensions, with minimum damage to
   RBCs. The present study compares WBC photoinactivation in buffy coat
   after DMMB or MB phototreatment under virucidal conditions.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Buffy coat diluted to 30-percent Hct was
   treated with the dye and white light. Isolated WBCs were assayed for
   cell proliferation and viability by an assay using a tetrazolium
   compound, limiting dilution analysis, DNA fragmentation, and flow
   cytometry assays.
   RESULTS: DMMB and 2.5 J per cm(2) of light phototreatment can inactivate
   T cells to the limit of detection by limiting dilution analysis (>4.76
   log reduction). No WBC proliferation activity was observed after DMMB
   and 3.8 J per cm(2) of light. DNA degradation after DMMB phototreatment
   was light dependent. In addition, DMMB phototreatment induced apoptosis
   in WBCs. In contrast, MB phototreatment under virucidal conditions did
   not cause significant changes in the viability of WBCs. Neither DNA
   degradation nor signs of apoptosis were observed after MB
   phototreatment.
   CONCLUSION: DMMB phototreatment inactivates T-lymphocytes, the cells
   that cause GVHD.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogeny inferred from ITS DNA sequence resolved isolates of Australian
   Ganoderma into five terminal clades. The phylogenetic analysis was
   considered superior to sequence Variation statistics for delineating
   species as intra and inter-specific variation were dissimilar across the
   taxa studied. The analysis also revealed that a number of isolates had
   been misnamed. Phylogeny inferred from the sequence data supported the
   retention of Elfvingia and Ganoderma as subgenera of Ganoderma, and the
   placement of the G. chalceum complex within subgenus Ganoderma. These
   findings were, however, poorly supported by decay analysis. G.
   adspersum, a European species considered to be a synonym of G. australe
   (a species which is in need of neotypification) by some authors, was not
   synonymous with G. australe from Australia. G. incrassatum from Northern
   Australia formed a clade with isolates named G. gibbosum from China and
   an isolate named G. australe from Taiwan. G. weberianum from Australia,
   originally identified by R. L. Steyaert, formed a terminal clade that
   was closely related to a second terminal clade comprised of two G.
   weberianum isolates and an isolate of G. microsporum from Asia. It was
   concluded that the clades represented two allopatric populations of G.
   weberianum and that G. microsporum was a synonym of G, weberianum.
   Isolates determined as G. chalceum by R. L. Steyaert and referred to
   here as G. cupreum formed a distinct terminal clade most closely related
   to material identified as G. sinense. A species mistaken for G. lucidum
   from Australia and Indonesia, a species from temperate and South East
   Asia containing commercially cultivated strains, and an Argentinean
   species showed evidence of allopatric speciation. Nomenclatural problems
   and the implications of our study on the pharmaceutical and commercial
   exploitation of Ganoderma in Australia are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An in vitro gas production system was used to investigate the influence
   of various substrate mixtures on a natural mix of rumen microbes by
   measurement of fermentation end-products. The treatments were
   combinations of cassava (15.0, 30.0 and 45.0\%) with different roughage
   sources (ruzi grass, rice straw or urea treated rice straw). Microbial
   biomass, net N-15 incorporation into cells, volatile fatty acid
   production, gas volume and rate of gas production increased linearly
   with increasing levels of cassava inclusion. There was also an effect of
   roughage source, with rice straw being associated with the lowest values
   for most parameters whilst similar values were obtained for ruzi grass
   and urea treated rice straw. The results suggest that microglial growth
   and fermentation rate increase as a function of readily available
   carbohydrate in the substrate mixture. A strong, linear relationship
   between N-15 enrichment, total volatile fatty acid production and gas
   production kinetics support the suggestion of the use of the in vitro
   gas production system as a tool for screening feedstuffs as an initial
   stage of feed evaluation.}},

Title = {{Association between triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnant receptor
   polymorphisms and lipid traits}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{441-447}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) is,
   in part, mediated by lipoprotein receptors (such as low density
   lipoprotein receptor-related protein {[}LRP] and very low density
   lipoprotein {[}VLDL] receptors), which recognize TRL remnants after
   specific binding with apolipoprotein E. The purpose of this study was to
   explore the association of the genetic polymorphisms of remnant
   receptors with lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein levels including
   remnant-like particle-cholesterol (RLP-C).
   Design and Methods: Using polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA, VLDL
   receptor tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism, LRP trinucleotide repeat
   polymorphism, and LRP exon 3 polymorphism were analyzed in normal adults
   (control group: n = 161)and in patients with coronary artery disease
   (CAD group: n = 102).
   Results: The allelic distributions of VLDL receptor triple repeat
   polymorphism, LRP tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism, and LRP exon 3
   polymorphism in Koreans were similar to those of Japanese but were
   significantly different from those of other ethnic: groups. There were
   no significant differences in the allele frequencies of the
   polymorphisms between the control and CAD groups. VLDL receptor
   polymorphism in the control group (p = 0.0403) and LRP exon 3
   polymorphism in the CAD group (p = 0.0459) showed significant
   associations with lipoprotein (a) {[}Lp(a)] levels.
   Conclusions: The results of the present study demonstrated significant
   interracial distribution of remnant receptor polymorphisms. There was no
   association between the remnant receptor polymorphisms and the RLP-C
   levels. However, the polymorphisms showed a significant association with
   Lp(a), which may suggest that the Lp(a) metabolism is in part mediated
   by the uptake through the remnant receptors. Copyright (C) 2000 The

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Genetic recombination is a major force driving the evolution of many
   viruses. Recombination between two copackaged retroviral genomes may
   occur at rates as high as 40\% per replication cycle(1). This enables
   genetic information to be shuffled rapidly leading to recombinants with
   new patterns of mutations and phenotypes. The in vitro process of DNA
   shuffling(2,3) (molecular breeding) mimics this mechanism on a vastly
   parallel and accelerated scale. Multiple homologous parental sequences
   are recombined in parallel, leading to a diverse library of complex
   recombinants from which desired improvements can be selected. Different
   proteins and enzymes have been improved using DNA shuffling(4-6). We
   report here the first application of molecular breeding to viruses. A
   single round of shuffling envelope sequences from six murine leukaemia
   viruses (MLV) followed by selection yielded a chimaeric clone with a
   completely new tropism for Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHOK1) cells. The
   composition and properties of the selected clone indicated that this
   particular permutation of parental sequences cannot be readily attained
   by natural retroviral recombination. This example demonstrates that
   molecular breeding can enhance the inherently high evolutionary
   potential of retroviruses to obtain desired phenotypes. It can be an
   effective tool, when information is limited, to optimize viruses for
   gene therapy and vaccine applications when multiple complex functions
   must be simultaneously balanced.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies show that the position of centre of body mass
   (cm(body)) and the ratio of flight muscle to total body mass (flight
   muscle ratio, FMR) are good predictors of flight speed and
   manoeuvrability in butterflies. However, cm(body), FMR, and related
   morphometric traits are strongly correlated phenotypically, making it
   difficult to identify the causal determinants of flight performance. By
   experimentally gluing weights that amounted to similar to 15\% body
   weight to a palatable Neotropical butterfly species (Anartia fatima), we
   tested the effects of altering FMR and repositioning cm(body) on two
   measures of flight performance: flight speed and the ability to evade
   capture. We then tested their effects on survival in a natural setting.
   might performance studies detected no significant differences in
   airspeed or evasive flight ability among unweighted controls,
   weighted-loaded butterflies (MIL), and those with cm(body) positioned
   further posterior (CM). In two mark-release-recapture experiments,
   survival of treatment groups did not differ, but males survived longer
   than females. In one experiment, WL and CM butterflies were recaptured
   more frequently than controls, whereas the probability of recapture for
   females was higher than that for males in the second experiment. When
   significant, results for recapture were consistent with a causal
   relationship between FMR and flight speed. Presumably, a decrease in
   flight speed was due to a reduction in muscle mass-specific power output
   in the weighted butterflies. However, the results did not support a
   relationship between manoeuvrability and cm(body). (C) 2000 The Linnean

   brightness sensitivity for LASCO over earlier coronagraphs; however, we
   have not detected a significant population of fainter (i.e., low mass)
   CMEs. The general shape of the distribution of apparent sizes for LASCO
   CMEs is similar to those of earlier reports, but the average (median)
   apparent size of 72 degrees (50 degrees) is significantly larger. The
   larger average apparent size is predominantly the result of the
   detection of a population of partial and complete halo CMEs at least
   some of which appear to be events with a significant longitudinal
   component directed along the Sun-Earth line, either toward or away from
   the Earth. Using full disk solar images obtained by the Extreme
   ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on SOHO, we found that 40 out of 92
   of these events might have been directed toward the Earth, and we
   compared the timing of those with the I(I) geomagnetic storm index in
   the days following the CME, Although the ``false alarm{''} rate was
   high, we found that 15 out of 21 (71\%) of the K-p greater than or equal
   to 6 storms could be accounted for as SOHO LASCO/EIT frontside halo
   CMEs. If we eliminate three Kp, storms that occurred following LASCO/EIT
   data gaps. then the possible association rate was 15 out of 18 (83\%).}},

Abstract = {{Background: The precise prognostic significance of critically low
   cholesterol concentrations in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery
   is unknown.
   Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, we analyzed the database
   of 2074 patients, of whom 87 died postoperatively in hospital. All
   patients underwent cardiothoracic surgery using a heart-lung machine.
   Age, sex, body mass index, preoperative ejection fraction, smoking,
   diabetes mellitus, type of operation, emergency surgery, renal
   deficiency, pulmonary hypertension, and endocarditis were considered
   together with serum concentrations of cholesterol, C-reactive protein,
   alanine aminotransferase, and triglycerides. The statistics included
   sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, odds ratio, and the ROC
   curve.
   Results: Cholesterol decreased sharply immediately after surgery in both
   the deceased and the survivors. In the deceased, the mean cholesterol
   concentration (+/- SE) remained rather low between days 4 and 7 after
   surgery {[}2.46 +/- 0.16 mmol/L (95 +/- 6 mg/dL)]. In the survivors at
   that time, the mean cholesterol concentration was significantly (P <
   0.001) higher {[}4.37 +/- 0.03 mmol/L (169 +/- 1 mg/dL)]. The positive
   predictive value of a critically low cholesterol concentration {[}<3.10
   mmol/L (<120 mg/ dL)] was 25.4\%, increasing to 66.6\% at a cutoff value
   of 1.55 mmol/L (60 mg/dL). The odds ratio under those circumstances was
   15.5, and the area under curve (C-statistic) was 0.90.
   Conclusions: The cholesterol concentration between days 4 and 7 after
   cardiothoracic surgery possesses a high prognostic significance in terms
   of in-hospital mortality. (C) 2000 American Association for Clinical

Abstract = {{Space-invariant filtering of signals that overlap with noise in both
   space and frequency can be inefficient. However, the signal and noise
   may be well separated in the joint space/spatial-frequency domain, Then,
   it is possible to benefit from the application of space/spatial
   frequency approaches, Processing based on these approaches can
   outperform space or frequency invariant-based methods. To this aim the
   concept of nonstationary space-varying filtering is introduced in this
   paper as an extension of the time-varying filtering concept. The
   filtering definitions are based on statistical averages, although the
   filtering should commonly be applied knowing only a single noisy signal
   realization. The procedures that can produce good estimates of
   quantities crucial for efficient filtering, based on a single noisy
   signal realization, are considered, Special attention has been paid to
   the region of support estimation and cross-term effects removal. The
   efficiency of the proposed space/spatial-frequency filtering concept is
   tested on the signal forms inspired by the interferograms in optics,
   including real images as disturbances. Examples demonstrate the
   superiority of the proposed filtering over the space-invariant one for
   the considered type of signals and noise.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted an acoustic study of widow rockfish (Sebastes entomelas) to
   test the feasibility of using acoustic methods to estimate the biomass
   of near-bottom shoals of rockfish, and to estimate the biomass of a
   particular mid-winter shoal, which the fishing industry suggested might
   be large enough to change current government perceptions of stock
   biomass. We repeated the acoustic survey of the study site 20 times. The
   total area backscattering coefficient (Sa) per survey ranged from
   808-452 m(2) n.mi(-2). Total biomass estimates for the 21-28 km(2) area
   were 1000-2630 t. Trawl catches indicated that the species composition
   was approximately 88\% widow rockfish. The variances in mean Sa for each
   of the micro-surveys were estimated with spatial analysis using either a
   unique or a global variogram. The coefficient of variation (CV) ranged
   from 4.8-17.8\% when using individual variograms and from 9.6-29.5\%
   when using a global variogram. The observed CV among the 20 estimates
   was 31\%, almost three times the average CV based on the unique
   variograms, and almost two times the average CV derived From a global
   variogram. Although echograms indicated a diel movement, from near
   bottom during the day, to off-bottom at night, we observed no strong
   correlation of acoustic fish density with time of day or state of the
   diel tide. During the cruise, biomass estimates were derived within 24
   hours of the completion of each micro-survey so that industry
   participants could review results and request changes to survey design.
   Although the estimates failed to indicate that current harvest
   recommendations were too conservative and were therefore a
   disappointment to industry, accommodating their scepticism during the
   cruise allowed us to provide scientifically credible estimates. The
   estimates now provide a shared reference point between fishers and stock
   assessment biologists for discussion about anecdotal sounder
   observations. The overall methodology can be implemented using portable
   equipment on commercial fishing vessels and will be useful for either
   scheduled or ``ship of opportunity{''} surveys of specific shoals.
   Application to larger scale biomass estimation of widow rockfish stocks
   remains problematic, owing to problems of near-bottom detection, species
   resolution, and unpredictability of fish distribution. (C) 2000

Number = {{377}},
Pages = {{44-56}},

Abstract = {{Fracture of the femoral head after hip dislocation is a relatively rare
   injury often associated with a poor functional outcome. Twenty-six
   patients who sustained femoral head fractures were evaluated using
   radiographs, clinical examinations, and a validated outcome scoring
   system. The Short Form-12 was used to assess functional outcome.
   Patients whose fractures were stabilized with 3-mm cannulated screws and
   washers had a poor functional outcome. When evaluated with an odds ratio
   analysis, the use of Kocher-Langenbeck posterior approach was associated
   with a 3.2 times higher incidence of the patients having avascular
   necrosis develop when compared with the Smith-Petersen approach. A
   literature review combined with the current series confirms that the
   principles of early reduction of hip dislocation, early stabilization,
   anatomic reduction of the fracture, and rigid fixation are critical
   principles to attain good results. The Brumback classification system
   provides superior differentiation of different fracture types when
   compared with the Pipkin classification. The Smith-Petersen anterior
   surgical approach is recommended for the majority of patients with
   femoral head fractures. Three-millimeter cannulated screws with threaded
   washers are contraindicated for use in stabilizing femoral head
   fractures, and should not be used in any joint because of dissociation
   between the screw and the washer.}},

Abstract = {{The Open Distributed Processing (ODP) standardisation initiative has led
   to a framework by which distributed systems can he modelled using a
   number of viewpoints. These include an enterprise viewpoint, which
   focuses on the objectives and policies of the enterprise that the system
   is meant to support. Although the ODP reference model provides abstract
   languages of relevant concepts, it does not prescribe particular
   techniques that are to be used in the individual viewpoints. In
   particular, there is a need to develop appropriate notations for ODP
   enterprise specification, in order to increase the applicability of the
   ODP framework. In this paper, we tackle this concern and develop a
   specification language to support the current draft of the enterprise
   viewpoint, In doing so, we analyse the current definition of the ODP
   enterprise viewpoint language. Using the Unified Modelling Language
   (UML), a meta-model of the con concepts and their relationships is
   constructed, and we also investigate to what extent the UML can be used
   fur enterprise viewpoint specification. We, then, focus on the
   expression of enterprise policies that govern the behaviour of
   enterprise objects. We develop a policy language, which is a combination
   of structured English and simple predicate logic and is built on top of
   the formal object-oriented specification language Object-Z, into which
   the complete language is translated. We illustrate the ideas in the
   paper with a case study that presents an enterprise specification of a
   library support system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) is a compound produced in several
   classes of algae and higher plants that live in the marine environment.
   Considering its generally high intracellular concentrations, DMSP has a
   function in the osmotic protection of algal cells. Due to the relatively
   slow adaptation of its intracellular concentrations upon salinity
   shifts, DMSP should, however, not be considered as an osmoticum in the
   strict sense of being responsible for osmotic balance, but rather as a
   constitutive compatible solute. Besides salinity, other factors also
   appear to affect cellular DMSP quotas, but the exact regulatory
   mechanisms are still unclear. In this review, a brief discussion is
   given of the three pathways of DMSP biosynthesis that are currently
   distinguished. This is followed by an overview of the factors that
   affect DMSP biosynthesis (light, salinity, temperature and nitrogen
   limitation) in relation to its physiological functions. A new hypothesis
   is presented in which DMSP production is described as an overflow
   mechanism for excess reduced compounds and for energy excess. Finally,
   the possible functionality of the enzymatic cleavage of DMSP is
   discussed in the context of an overflow mechanism. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effects of freeze drying and of air drying at 30 degrees C on the
   nutritive value of Calliandra calothyrsus leaves were evaluated, using
   material from two provenances grown together under controlled greenhouse
   conditions. Freshly harvested leaf of each provenance was compared with
   the dried treatments In terms of in vitro digestibility, content of
   extractable, protein-bound and fibre-bound proanthocyanidin (condensed
   tannin) and protein precipitation activity of the extractable fraction,
   as well as crude protein and fibre content. The effect of long-term (12
   months) storage of fresh-frozen and dried leaf was also evaluated.
   Provenance was found to have a major effect on most of the traits, and
   large differences between the provenances in proanthocyanidin structure
   were found by high-performance liquid chromatography, with the tannins
   of one provenance consisting mainly of catechin/epicatechin subunits
   (producing cyanidin on treatment with butanol/HCl), and those of the
   other mainly gallocatechin/epigallocatechin subunits (producing
   delphinidin with butanol/HCl). This also resulted in large differences
   in colour yield in the butanol/HCl assay for proanthocyanidins,
   necessitating separate standards for each provenance. Both drying
   treatments tended to increase digestibility, though the effect was only
   significant for one provenance. Air drying, but not freeze drying,
   increased proanthocyanidin binding to protein, but not to fibre, in both
   provenances. Long-term freezing reduced proanthocyanidin content by
   about half and should be avoided in tannin research. The study suggests
   that careful air drying, without excessive heating, may not reduce the
   nutritive value of C calothyrsus, though this needs validation through
   feeding studies with ruminants. (C) 2000 Society of Chemical industry.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term data on water temperature, phytoplankton biovolume, Bosmina
   and Daphnia abundance and the timing of the clear-water phase were
   compared and analysed with respect to the influence of the North
   Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in two strongly contrasting lakes in central
   Europe. In small, shallow, hypertrophic Muggelsee, spring water
   temperatures and Daphnia abundance both increased more rapidly than in
   large, deep, meso/oligotrophic Lake Constance. Because of this, the
   clear-water phase commenced approximately three weeks earlier in
   Muggelsee than in Lake Constance. In Muggelsee, the phytoplankton
   biovolume during late winter/early spring was related to the NAO index.
   In Lake Constance, where phytoplankton growth was inhibited by intense
   downward mixing during all years studied, this was not the case.
   However, in both lakes, interannual variability in water temperature, in
   Daphnia spring population dynamics and in the timing of the clear-water
   phase, were all related to the interannual variability of the NAO index.
   The Daphnia spring population dynamics and the timing of the clear-water
   phase appear to be synchronized by the NAO despite large differences
   between the lakes in morphometry, trophic status and hushing and mixis
   regimes, and despite the great distance between the lakes (similar to
   700 km). This suggests that a great variety of lakes in central Europe
   may possibly have exhibited similar interannual variability during the
   last 20 years.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Lowland dry forests are unique in Hawaii for their high diversity of
   tree species compared with wet forests. We characterized spatial and
   temporal partitioning of soil water resources among seven indigenous and
   one invasive dry forest species to determine whether the degree of
   partitioning was consistent with the relatively high species richness in
   these forests. Patterns of water utilization were inferred from stable
   hydrogen isotope ratios CFD of soil and xylem water, zones of soil water
   depletion, plant water status, leaf phenology, and spatial patterns of
   species distribution. Soil water delta D values ranged from -20 parts
   per thousand near the surface to -48 parts per thousand at 130 cm depth.
   Metrosideros polymorpha, an evergreen species, and Reynoldsia
   sandwicensis, a drought-deciduous species, had xylem sap delta D values
   of about -52 parts per thousand, and appeared to obtain their water
   largely from deeper soil layers. The remaining six species had xylem FD
   values ranging from -33 to -42 parts per thousand, and apparently
   obtained water from shallower soil layers. Xylem water delta D values
   were negatively correlated with minimum annual leaf water potential and
   positively correlated with leaf solute content, an integrated measure of
   leaf water deficit. Seasonal patterns of leaf production ranged from dry
   season deciduous at one extreme to evergreen with near constant leaf
   expansion rates at the other. Species tapping water more actively from
   deeper soil layers tended to exhibit larger seasonality of leaf
   production than species relying on shallower soil water sources.
   Individuals of Myoporum sandwicense were more spatially isolated than
   would be expected by chance. Even though this species apparently
   extracted water primarily from shallow soil layers, as indicated by its
   xylem FD values, its nearly constant growth rates across all seasons may
   have been the result of a larger volume of soil water available per
   individual. The two dominant species, Diospyros sandwicesis and Nestegis
   sandwicensis, exhibited low leaf water potentials during the dry season
   and apparently drew water mostly from the upper portion of the soil
   profile, which may have allowed them to exploit light precipitation
   events more effectively than the more deeply rooted species. Character
   displacement in spatial and temporal patterns of soil water uptake was
   consistent with the relatively high diversity of woody species in
   Hawaiian dry forests.}},

   processes can be summarized in the paradox that says that an institution
   with its personnel is vulnerable in proportion to the degree of careful
   reporting. In particular, if the records are very precise, situations
   are no longer vague. This is why it is necessary to justify, on
   unpredictable and unplanned occasions, one's activities by means of
   record files. Against this background, training in reporting procedures
   is a delicate enterprise. An improvement in reporting performances can
   be expected by merely shaping this kind of training as a process that
   brings to light the not deceivable paradox mentioned before. This
   prevents this paradox from being ineffective, and the actors are
   relieved of the burden.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of early onset, unilateral conductive hearing loss on
   tone-induced 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in the auditory cortex of
   juvenile Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) were studied. Atresia
   of the left ear canal was induced at postnatal day 9 (P9) to achieve
   reversible auditory deprivation prior to onset of hearing (around P12).
   Atresia either persisted (ATR, n = 4) or the canal was opened 15 min
   before the 2-DG experiments (RE, n = 4) at P27. Control animals were
   either non-deprived (CON, n = 4), or their left ears were plugged
   acutely (PAX, it = 4). In PAX, 2-DG uptake in primary auditory cortex
   (AI) and anterior auditory field (AAF) was lower in right than in left
   AI and AAF. In contrast, in ATR and RE, uptake was significantly higher
   on the right side contralateral to the atresia. Hence, atresia during
   early development leads to plastic changes resulting in an
   interhemispheric imbalance of functional metabolism in favor of the
   auditory cortex contralateral to the manipulated ear. Distances between
   tone-induced 2-DG labeling in AI and AAF were increased in PAX, but
   smaller in ATR in the right compared to the left hemisphere, suggesting
   effects of atresia also on spatial relations in cortical tonotopic maps.

Abstract = {{This study reports that quiescent herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1
   genomes, persisting in long-term infected nerve growth factor (NGF)
   differentiated PC12 cells, were not stimulated by superinfection with a
   HSV-1. We have previously shown that HSV-1 can establish long term,
   quiescent infections in NGF differentiated PC12 cells. To determine if
   virion associated factors or virus induced gene products could
   trans-activate the quiescent viral genomes, long term infected PC12 cell
   cultures were superinfected at a high moi (moi of 20) with a recombinant
   HSV 17 alpha 47/lacZ that contains the IacZ gene within the alpha 47
   locus. Progeny virus and gene expression from the resident `quiescent'
   viral genomes were not detected following superinfection with
   recombinant 17 alpha 47/lacZ. The failure to stimulate the quiescent
   genome appears to be related to the inability of the super infecting
   virus to induce any gene expression from its own genome following entry
   into the long term NGF treated PC12 cells. Interestingly, both primary
   and superinfecting viruses could be stimulated from the quiescently
   infected cultures following cocultivation with inducer cells. These data
   suggest that (i) HSV genomes in quiescently infected PC12 cells are
   unable to be stimulated by incoming virion associated factors and (ii)
   NGF differentiated PC12 cells maintained in tissue culture for longer
   than 3 weeks became completely refractory to viral gene expression. The
   possibilities that these results are reflective of populations of neural
   cells, in vivo in mouse central nervous system, which are completely
   refractory to virus gene expression, yet accommodating to the
   maintenance of viral genomes and thus favor `latency', are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{D(-) Luciferin, interacts with different metal ions to produce
   colourless soluble salts with absorption spectra broader, intense and
   red shifted as compared to those of the parent compound. The equilibrium
   constants for the luciferin-metal ion system vary in the order,
   depository divalent transition metal ions > alkali metal ions. The
   equilibrium constants for the ternary complexes formed between metal
   ions and a mixture of luciferin and luciferase are larger than that of
   binary complexes but vary in the same order. Steady state fluorometric
   titration's of luciferin further confirmed its complexation with metal
   ions. The single absorption maximum of firefly luciferase at 278 nm
   originating from tyrosine was split into a doubler in presence of
   transition metal ions. The absorption maximum at lower wavelength is
   attributed to the H-bond raptured free tyrosine denatured conformation
   of the luciferase while the longer wavelength band to
   tyrosine-transition metal ion complex. Difference spectra of luciferase
   metal ion complex yielded change in the molar extinction coefficients
   from which the number of tyrosine molecules exposed to aqueous solution
   by the perturbant metal ions are evaluated following the Donovan model.
   The number of tyrosine molecules exposed to the aqueous medium as a
   result of conformational change in the enzyme are 4, 3, 3, 2 and 3 by
   Hg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Cd2+ and Cs+ respectively. The denaturation constants
   calculated for the luciferase-metal ion complexes vary between 0.152 and
   0.570 and follow the order of Hg2+>Cs+>Cd2+>Co2+>Mn2+. Steady state
   fluorescence data reveal that the metal ions quench the fluorescence of
   enzyme by complexation with the side chain residues of the excited state
   tyrosine. Profound change in the UV CD spectrum of luciferin and
   luciferase in presence of metal ions was attributed to the
   conformational change in the substrate and enzyme. Thus the inhibition
   of luciferase activity in the firefly bioluminescence by metal ions is
   attributed to the quaternary complex formed between metal
   ion-luciferin-luciferase and ATP near or around the active site of the
   enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To clarify the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values
   of various human cell lines for carbon-ion beams with 2 different linear
   energy transfer (LET) beams and to investigate the relationship between
   the cell-killing effect and the biophysical characters, such as the
   chromosome number and the area of the cell nucleus, using qualitatively
   different kinds of radiations.
   Methods and Materials: Sixteen different human cell lines were
   irradiated with carbon-ion beams, having 2 different LET values
   (LETinfinity = 13.3 and approximately 77 keV/mu m), accelerated by the
   Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) at National Institute of
   Radiological Sciences in Japan. Cell-killing effect was detected as
   reproductive cell death using a colony-formation assay. The number of
   chromosomes was observed in a metaphase spread using the conventional
   method, The area of the cell nucleus was calculated as an ellipse on
   photographs using a micrometer,
   Results: The RBE values calculated by the D-10, which is determined as
   the dose (Gy) required to reduce the surviving fraction to 10\%,
   relative to X-rays, range from 1.06 to 1.33 for 13-keV/mu m-beam and
   from 2.00 to 3.01 for approximate 77-keV/mu m-beam irradiation on each
   cell line, There was a good correlation in the D-10 values of each cell
   line between X-rays and carbon-ion beams. However, the D-10 values did
   not clearly depend on either the chromosome number or the area of the
   cell nuclei.
   Conclusion: The RBE values for HIMAC carbon-ion beams are consistent
   with previous reports using carbon-ion beams with the similar LET
   values, and the cellular radiosensitivity of different cell lines,well
   correlate among different types of radiation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A theoretical framework is presented that describes a way in which the
   inverse dynamics equations of motion of planar two-joint arm movements
   (EX-model) are reformulated in a simple form. A single point was assumed
   to define both the wrist and elbow joint centers, and thus the motion of
   two points in extrinsic space was represented by second-order
   differential equations to provide the variables in the reformulation
   (RE-) model. Through an analytical processes, it was shown that the
   RE-model for reproducing the shoulder joint torque consists of the
   linearly scaled moment per unit mass responsible for accelerating the
   wrist and elbow points about the shoulder joint, while that for
   reproducing the elbow joint torque consists of the linearly scaled
   moment per unit mass responsible for accelerating the wrist point about
   the elbow. The scaling factors for variables in the RE-model were based
   solely on the values for segment lengths, while in the EX-model the
   inertial parameter data for the segments are involved in its
   representation. The inertial parameter data of six-arm specimens from
   the cadaver experiment of Chandler et al. (1975, AMRL Technical Report,
   Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH) were used to develop and verify the
   numeric solutions of the RE-model. The adequacy of the model varied
   somewhat among subjects, but minor changes of the physical parameters of
   the arm segments enabled perfect reformulation, regardless of the
   specimens. The potential abilities of the RE-model to deal with the
   complexities in motor control with more simple control schemes are
   discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress has been postulated to play important roles in the
   pathogenesis of various diseases such as atherosclerosis in
   hyperlipidemic subjects. Although the possible role of oxidation of
   low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the etiology of atherosclerosis has
   been studied extensively, the turnover of endogenous antioxidants, which
   is an important protection system against oxidative stress, remains to
   be elucidated. The aim of our study was to determine the change of the
   turnover of endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione and ascorbic
   acid in case of hyperlipidemia, using Japanese white rabbits (JW) and
   Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits (WHHL). The levels of total
   glutathione and low molecular weight thiols in the liver, kidney, and
   other organs in both strains of rabbits were similar. However, a kinetic
   analysis using L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine revealed that the rate of
   glutathione turnover in the liver and kidney of WHHL was about 50\%
   lower than that of JW. Furthermore, intravenously administered ascorbic
   acid disappeared more slowly in WHHL, than in JW. These results indicate
   that the turnovers of both glutathione and ascorbic acid in WHHL, are
   depressed in comparison with that in Tmi. These changes would he closely
   related to the increased oxidizability of lipids in the circulation of
   hyperlipidemic subjects.}},

Abstract = {{The Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein PtxS negatively regulates its own
   synthesis by binding to the upstream region of its gene, We have
   recently identified a 14 bp palindromic sequence within the ptxS
   upstream region as the PtxS operator site (OP1), In this study, we
   searched the P. aeruginosa genomic sequence to determine whether this 14
   bp sequence exists in other regions of the P. aeruginosa chromosome.
   Another PtxS operator site (OP2) was located 47 bp downstream of ptxS.
   DNA gel shift experiments confirmed that PtxS specifically binds to a
   520 bp fragment that carries OP2. The DNA segment 3' of OP2 contains
   four open reading frames (ORF1-ORF4), which code for 29, 32, 48 and 35
   kDa proteins respectively, The molecular weight of the products of ORFs
   2 and 3 were confirmed by T7 expression experiments. Computer analyses
   suggest that ORF2 encodes an ATP-dependent kinase; ORF3, a transporter;
   and ORF4, a dehydrogenase. The predicted product of ORF1 showed no
   homology to previously identified proteins and contains all the
   conserved amino acids within the aldose 1-epimerase protein motif,
   Examination of the ptxs-ORF1 intergenic region (using promoter fusion
   experiments) showed that no potential promoter exists. An isogenic
   mutant defective in ORF1 was constructed in the P. aeruginosa strain
   PAO1. In contrast to its parent strain, the mutant failed to grow on a
   minimal medium in which 2-ketogluconate was the sole carbon source.
   Similarly, a previously constructed ptxS isogenic mutant of PAO1 did not
   grow in a minimal medium containing 2-ketogluconate as the sole carbon
   source. Furthermore, a plasmid carrying a fragment that contains ptxS
   and ORFs 1-4 complemented the defect of the previously described P.
   aeruginosa 2-ketogluconate-negative mutant. In the presence of 10 mM
   2-ketogluconate, the in vitro binding of PtxS to a DNA fragment that
   carries either OP1 or OP2 was inhibited. These results suggest that: (i)
   ptxS together with the other four ORFs constitute the 2-ketogluconate
   utilization operon (kgu) in P. aeruginosa. Therefore, ORFs 1-4 were
   designated kguE, kguK, kguT and kguD respectively. (ii) PtxS regulates
   the expression of the kgu operon by binding to two operators (OP1 and
   OP2) within the operon; and (iii) 2-ketogluconate is the molecular
   inducer of the kgu operon or the molecular effector of PtxS.}},

   as the Si substrate can be studied without high correlation of the
   respective parameters. From multiple-angle ellipsometric measurements it
   is established that the introduction of hydrogen increases the
   refractive index and the extinction coefficient of the Si substrate.
   This result is linked with the observed increase of the substrate doping
   level. The increased refractive index of the oxide upon implantation,
   and consequently, the mechanical stress, are correlated with
   electrically active radiation defects in the interface region. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT) catalyzes the final
   step in the synthesis of glactosylceramide (GalCer). It has previously
   been shown that CGT-deficient mice do not synthesize GalCer and its
   sulfated derivative GalCer Is-sulfate (galactosylsulfatide, SM4s) but
   form myelin containing glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and sphingomyelin with
   2-hydroxy fatty acids, Because relatively high concentrations of GalCer
   and SM4s are present also in mammalian kidney, we analyzed the
   composition of lipids in the kidney of Cgt(-/-) and, as a control,
   Cgt(-/-) and wildtype mice. The homozygous mutant mice lacked GalCer,
   galabiaosylceramide (Ga(2)Cer), and SM4s, Yet, they did not show any
   major morphological or functional defects in the kidney, A slight
   increase in GlcCer containing 4-hydroxysphinganine was evident among
   neutral glycolipids. Intriguingly, more polar sulfoglycolipids, that is,
   lactosylceramide H-3-sulfate (SM3) and gangliotetraosylceramide
   II3,IV3-bis-sulfate (SB1a), were expressed at 2 to 3 times the normal
   levels in Cgt(-/-) mice, indicating upregulation of biosynthesis of SB1a
   from GlcCer via SM3, Given that SM4s is a major polar glycolipid
   constituting renal tubular membrane, the increase in SM3 and SB1a in the
   mice deficient in CGT and thus SM4s appears to be a compensatory
   process, which could partly restore kidney function in the knockout
   mice.}},

   test panels and on the cost per identified case.
   Methods: We studied 540 new, symptomatic patients at the Comprehensive
   Medicine Clinics of National Defense Medical College during 1991-1997.
   All underwent testing with the ``Essential Laboratory Tests{''} panel
   (2) {[}ELT(2) panel]. This panel includes hematologic tests, urinalysis,
   total protein, C-reactive protein, albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides,
   glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, serum protein
   fractionation, six enzymes, and optional tests, including x-rays,
   electrocardiogram, and fecal occult blood.
   Results: The ELT(2) panel uncovered 276 additional diagnoses of
   asymptomatic disease or abnormal health status. The most frequent occult
   condition was hyperlipidemia (100 cases) followed by liver dysfunction
   (53 cases). Clinical efficiency of the panel (occult diseases/ patient)
   varied depending on the category of tentative initial diagnosis, with
   the highest efficiency in patients with cardiovascular disease. We
   created smaller panels by combining 11 basic tests {[}called the ELT(1)
   baseline panel] with one or more additional tests from the ELT(2) and
   analyzed their cost-effectiveness. Addition of four tests (total
   cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, glucose, and uric acid) improved
   both clinical efficiency (0.41 occult disease/patient) and economic
   efficiency {[}Y2372 (similar to\$22.50 US)/occult disease] at a
   cost-effectiveness of Y177 per incremental case of occult disease.
   Addition of further tests decreased cost-effectiveness.
   Conclusions: Although the ELT(2) panel has supplemental utility for
   opportunistic screening of some significant, occult diseases and
   conditions, universal utilization of the full panel is not supported by
   the cost-effectiveness found in this study. (C) 2000 American

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical performance of a new
   enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen in
   comparison with the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR). A total of 310 patients with acute or chronic hepatitis C, and
   132 HCV-negative controls were studied. Chemiluminescence EIA with
   monoclonal anti-HCV core antigen was used, and qualitative and
   quantitative commercial RT-PCRs and an in-house nested RT-PCR were
   performed. Compared with nested RT-PCR, the core antigen assay showed
   97\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity in 75 patients with chronic
   hepatitis C and 132 controls. HCV core antigen was positive in 16 (94\%)
   of 17 patients with acute hepatitis C at initial consultation. In 3
   persons prospectively followed, core antigen was detected in the first
   available (1-3 weeks) post-transfusion sample. In 167 anti-HCV-positive
   individuals, 129 (77\%) were viremic; core antigen was detected in 126
   (98\%) compared with 129 (100\%) for nested RT-PCR and 121 (94\%) for
   the commercial RT-PCR. In 48 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated
   with interferon alfa, the concentration of core antigen before treatment
   was significantly (P < .002) lower in patients with sustained response
   than in nonresponders. All responders had a sustained loss of core
   antigen, whereas all nonresponders remained core antigen positive. The
   concentrations of HCV core antigen and HCV RNA correlated significantly
   (n = 48, r = .627, P < .001). In conclusion, the HCV core antigen assay
   is useful for the diagnosis of acute and chronic hepatitis C, and for
   predicting and monitoring the effect of interferon alfa treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Paramecium bursaria shows many kinds of circadian rhythms, including a
   mating reactivity rhythm. P. bursaria cells normally contain several
   hundred Chlorella in the cytoplasm as endosymbionts. We found an
   interesting mutant strain (Ok2) from nature. Chlorella-contain green
   cells (Ok2) showed a normal mating reactivity rhythm in a constant light
   condition (LL) or constant darkness (DD). However, Chlorella-free white
   cells (Ok2w) derived from Ok2 did not display a mating reactivity rhythm
   in LL. In DD, they showed a normal mating reactivity rhythm. When Ok2w
   cells were infected with Chlorella isolated from green cells that show
   normal mating reactivity rhythms, they exhibited a circadian mating
   rhythm in LL. The green Ok2 cells reverted to the non-reactive state in
   LL by treatment with the herbicide paraquat. Sugar components in the
   cytosol of Ok2 and Ok2w were analyzed by HPLC, and four kinds of sugars
   were identified in Ok2 cells of day time. When maltose and maltotriose
   were added to Ok2w cell culture, the mating reactivity rhythms appeared
   in white cells in LL. These results suggest that the photosynthetic
   products of symbiotic Chlorella are closely related to the expression of
   circadian rhythms in a mutant strain of P. bursaria.}},

Journal = {{NATURE CELL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{492-499}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The multisubunit protein complex cohesin is required to establish
   cohesion between sister chromatids during S phase and to maintain it
   during G2 and M phases. Cohesin is essential for mitosis, and even
   partial defects cause very high rates of chromosome loss. In budding
   yeast, cohesin associates with specific sites which are distributed
   along the entire length of a chromosome but are more dense in the
   vicinity of the centromere. Real-time imaging of individual centromeres
   tagged with green fluorescent protein suggests that cohesin bound to
   centromeres is important for bipolar attachment to microtubules. This
   cohesin is, however, incapable of resisting the consequent force, which
   leads to sister centromere splitting and chromosome stretching.
   Meanwhile, cohesin bound to sequences flanking the centromeres prevents
   sister chromatids from completely unzipping and is required to pull back
   together sister centromeres that have already split. Cohesin therefore
   has a central role in generating a dynamic tension between microtubules
   and sister chromatid cohesion at centromeres, which lasts until
   chromosome segregation is finally promoted by separin-dependent cleavage
   of the cohesin subunit Scc1p.}},

Title = {{Vertical profiles of latent heat release and their retrieval for TOGA
   COARE convective systems using a cloud resolving model, SSM/I, and
   ship-borne radar data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN}},
Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{Latent heating profiles associated with three TOGA COARE active
   convective episodes (December 10-17 1992; December 19-27 1992; and
   February 9-13 1993) are examined using the two-dimensional version of
   the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) Model, and retrieved by using the
   Goddard Convective and Stratiform Heating (CSH) algorithm. The following
   sources of rainfall information are input into the CSH algorithm:
   Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), shipborne radars and the GCE
   model. Diagnostically determined latent heating profiles are calculated
   using 6 hourly soundings used for validation.
   The GCE model simulated rainfall and latent heating profiles are in
   excellent agreement with those estimated by soundings. In addition, the
   typical convective and stratiform heating structures (or shapes) are
   well captured by the GCE model. Radar measured rainfall is smaller than
   that estimated by the GCE model and SSM/I in both December convective
   episodes. SSM/I derived rainfall is more than the GCE model simulated
   for the December 19-27 and February 9-13 periods, but it is in excellent
   agreement with the GCE model for the December 10-17 period. The GCE
   model estimated stratiform amount is about 50 \% for December 19-27, 42
   \% for December 11-17 and 56 \% for the February 9-13 case. These
   results are consistent with large-scale analyses. Accurate estimates of
   stratiform amount are needed for good latent heating retrieval. A higher
   (lower) percentage of stratiform rain can imply a maximum heating rate
   at a higher (lower) altitude. The GCE model always simulates more
   stratiform rain (10 to 20 \%) than the radar for all three convective
   episodes. The SSM/I derived stratiform amount is about 37 \% for
   December 19-27, 48 \% for December 11-17 and 41 \% for the February 9-13
   case.
   Temporal variability of CSH algorithm retrieved latent heating profiles
   using either the GCE model simulated or radar estimated rainfall and
   stratiform amount is in good agreement with that diagnostically
   determined for all three periods. However, less rainfall and a smaller
   stratiform percentage estimated by radar resulted in a weaker
   (underestimated) latent heating profile, and a lower maximum latent
   heating level compared to those determined diagnostically. Rainfall
   information from SSM/I can not retrieve individual convective events due
   to poor temporal sampling. Nevertheless, this study suggests that a good
   rainfall retrieval from SSM/I for a convective event can lead to a good
   latent heating retrieval.
   Sensitivity testing has been performed and the results indicate that the
   SSM/I derived time averaged stratiform amount may be underestimated for
   December 19-27. Time averaged heating profiles derived from SSM/I,
   however, agree well with those derived by soundings for the December
   10-17 convective period. The heating retrievals may be more accurate for
   longer time scales, provided there is no bias in the sampling.
   An appropriate selection of latent heating profiles from the CSH look-up
   table is important. Sensitivity tests addressing this issue have been
   performed.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas numerous mutations of the human lutropin receptor (hLHR) and
   human TSH receptor (hTSHR) have been shown to cause constitutive
   activation of these receptors, it has been suggested that either the
   hFSHR as a whole, or the i3/TM VI region of the hFSHR, is less
   susceptible to mutation-induced constitutive activation. However, as
   shown herein, substitution of a highly conserved leucine residue in
   transmembrane III (TM III) of the I hFSHR (Leu III.18) with arginine
   causes a B-fold increase in basal cAMP in transfected cells, consistent
   with a strong constitutive activation of the hFSHR. Interestingly, this
   mutant is unresponsive to further hormonal stimulation. Substitutions of
   hFSHR(L460) with lysine, alanine, or aspartate show that only arginine
   causes constitutive activation. However, all result in decreased FSH
   responsiveness, suggesting a role for L460 in FSH-stimulated cAMP
   production by the hFSHR. Because Leu III.18 is highly conserved in
   rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), we tested the
   effects of substitution of the comparable leucine in the human
   beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (h beta(2)-AR). Substitution of L124 in the
   h beta(2)-AR with arginine, lysine, or alanine resulted in constitutive
   activation as evidenced by increased basal levels of cAMP that could be
   attenuated by an inverse agonist. In all cases, isoproterenol-stimulated
   cAMP was unaffected. Taken altogether, our data support a model whereby
   Leu III.18 may play a general role in GPCRs by stabilizing them in an
   inactive state. Constitutive activation may arise by both a disruption
   of Leu III.18 as well as the introduction of a specific residue that
   serves to stabilize the active state of the receptor.}},

Abstract = {{Study Objectives. To evaluate long-term effects of operative
   hysteroscopy on the development of intrauterine adhesions (IUA), and to
   determine whether hypoestrogenism has a modulatory role in preventing
   IUA.
   Design. Prospective, randomized study (Canadian Task Force
   classification I).
   Setting. Tertiary-care teaching hospital.
   Patients. Ninety-five women requiring resectoscopic surgery.
   Intervention. Hysteroscopic surgery using the resectoscope and 1.5\%
   glycine for uterine distention.
   Measurements and Main Results. indications for hysteroscopy were polyps
   (28 patients), solitary myoma (32), multiple myomata (20), and uterine
   septa (15). Patients in each group were randomized to endometrial
   suppression with danazol or placebo. Second-look office hysteroscopy
   with CO2 for uterine distention was performed after the First menses
   after surgery to assess the frequency, extent, and severity of IUA. The
   likelihood and severity of IUA depended on the pathology treated at
   initial surgery. Of women treated For polyps and uterine septa, in only
   one with septa (placebo group) developed IUA. Mild IUA Formation was
   present in 10 patients (31.3\%) with solitary fibroids and 9 (45.5\%)
   with multiple myomata. The frequency was similar in placebo- and
   danazol-treated groups with both solitary and multiple myomas (50\% and
   44.4\% vs 50\% and 55.6\%). All IUA were lysed during second-look
   surgery except in one woman with multiple myomata who required repeat
   resectoscopy.
   Conclusion. Intrauterine adhesions are the major long-tern, complication
   of operative hysteroscopy, with frequency dependent on the pad,ology
   initially treated. Second-look office hysteroscopy is a cost-effective
   method of diagnosing and lysing IUA after resectoscopy.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that self-duality equations for multi-instantons on a line
   in four dimensions are equivalent to minimal surface equations in
   three-dimensional Minkowski space. We extend this equivalence beyond the
   equations of motion and show that topological number, instanton moduli
   space and anti-self-dual solutions have representations in terms of
   minimal surfaces. The issue of topological charge is quite subtle
   because the surfaces that appear are non compact. This minimal
   surface/instanton correspondence allows us to define a metric on the
   configuration space of the gauge fields. We obtain the minimal surface
   representation of an instanton with arbitrary charge. The trivial vacuum
   and the BPST instanton as minimal surfaces are worked out in detail. BPS
   monopoles and the geodesics are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose, The aim of this study is to estimate the initial dissolution
   rate of drug substances by isothermal microcalorimetry. A theory was
   presented on the basis of Gibbs free energy and the Noyes-Whitney
   equation.
   Methods. Polymorphic forms and quenched glass of indomethacin, and some
   different crystallinity samples of terfenadine were used. The heats of
   solution of samples were measured by isothermal microcalorimetry. The
   initial dissolution rates of samples were measured by rotating disk
   method at 25 degrees C.
   Results. Each drug showed a linear correlation between the heats of
   solution and the logarithms of initial dissolution rate, irrespective of
   their different crystal structure, such as polymorphic forms and
   crystallinity. The logarithms of initial dissolution rates were well
   correlated with the degree of crystallinity obtained by the isothermal
   microcalorimetry.
   Conclusions. The initial dissolution rates of drug substances could be
   estimated quantitatively from the heats of solution as estimated from
   the present theory. Isothermal microcalorimetry was extremely useful for
   the estimation of the initial dissolution rates of polymorphs and of
   partially crystalline samples.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetization and resistivity were measured as functions of temperature

   other two were paramagnetic, displaying the Curie law below 120 K with
   the effective magnetic moment of 1.3 or 2.0 mu(B)/La. We propose that
   the sample-dependent magnetic behaviors of (Ca0.995La0.005)B-6 may be
   explained in terms of superparamagnetism, assuming that the
   ferromagnetic state is spatially inhomogeneous. All the samples

   are smaller as compared to those of 1,10-phenanthroline due to electron
   withdrawing effect of nitro group in nitrophen, which makes the latter a
   weaker ligand. The pseudo first order rate constants and quantum yield
   values in acidic medium are higher than those in basic medium. The
   mechanism of the photochemical substitution is different in two media.
   In acidic medium the reaction rate increases with increase in ligand

Abstract = {{in the Kokchetav ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) massif in northern Kazakhstan,
   diamond-bearing UHP rocks occur exclusively in a western, rhomb-shaped
   domain, that differs from an eastern transpressional domain with
   coesite-bearing remnants indicating highest UHP conditions. Different
   mechanisms may have contributed to the early ascent of the UHP Kokchetav
   massif. The geometry and structure of the diamond-bearing domain are
   interpreted as a sheath-like fold, coeval with early stage melting. In
   contrast, the coesite-bearing domain has a sheet-like geometry. At
   mid-crustal level this early difference in the ascending UHP wedge is
   reflected in a western rhomb-horst and an eastern transpression
   structure, respectively. The latter extends to the east (Borovoye) where
   the uppermost sequences of the UHP massif were defined by others. Sheath
   folding is postulated as a suitable mechanism contributing to the early
   buoyancy-driven ascent of the subducted rocks, and explains the
   selective spatial distribution of diamond-and coesite-bearing sequences
   preserved in the wedge.}},

Abstract = {{Previous techniques for estimating quantitative genetic parameters, such
   as heritability in populations where exact relationships are unknown but
   are instead inferred from marker genotypes, have used data from
   individuals on a pairwise level only. At this level, families are
   weighted according to the number of pairs within which each family
   appears, hence by size rather than information content, and information
   from multiple relationships is lost. Estimates of parameters ale
   therefore not the most efficient achievable. Here, Markov chain Monte
   Carlo techniques have been used to partition the population into
   complete sibships including, if known, prior knowledge of the
   distribution of family sizes. These pedigrees have then been used with
   restricted maximum likelihood under an animal model to estimate
   quantitative genetic parameters. Simulations to compare the properties
   of parameter estimates with those of existing techniques indicate that
   the use of sibship reconstruction is superior to earlier methods, having
   lower mean square errors and showing nonsignificant downward bias. In
   addition, sibship reconstruction allows the estimation of population
   allele frequencies that account for the relationships within the sample,
   so prior knowledge of allele frequencies need not be assumed. Extensions
   to these techniques allow reconstruction of half sibships when some or
   all of thr maternal genotypes are known.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a novel method for recording amplitude and phase of
   6D-vibrations of a spatial pendulum over a wide frequency range (10 Hz
   up to 20 kHz). The six degrees of freedom of the pendulum mass were
   monitored by three electrodynamic stereo pickups. Ar vest the tips of
   the needles and the pendulum's center of mass defined the reference
   system with respect to which the oscillations of the mass were recorded
   in terms of their amplitudes and phases. Its small dimensions, constant
   transfer characteristics, linearity, high dynamics, and virtual lack of
   reaction onto the moving system over the entire frequency range provided
   the advantages of the measuring system. This method was used to analyze
   the spatial 6D-vibrations of the head of a cemented femoral hip
   endoprosthesis when the femur was stimulated to bending vibrations. The
   head of the prosthesis carried our axial rotational vibrations at every
   frequency used to stimulate the femur. The amplitudes of the axial
   rotations of the cortical bone were small in comparison to the ones of
   the prosthesis head, indicating that axial rotational vibrations
   following femur bending vibrations mainly stressed the spongiosa and the
   cement layer. This was observed over the entire frequency range,
   including at the low frequencies relevant for gait. Over the
   low-frequency range, as well as as some of the higher resonance
   frequencies, stationary instantaneous helical axes characterized the
   vibrations. The measurements suggest the mechanism that the interface
   ``implant-bone{''} may already be stressed by axial torsional loads when
   the femur is loaded by bending impacts that are known to occur during
   walking. {[}S0148-0731(00)01604-6].}},

Abstract = {{Promoting mental health in an illness-oriented health care delivery
   system is challenging. Health promotion from a holistic perspective
   requires that mental health be viewed as important as physical health.
   The mental health needs of the elderly are numerous and often not
   addressed during routine visits for primary health care. Research
   consistently reports that elderly African Americans are not equal
   participants in the formal health care system. Consequently, promoting
   mental health in the African American elderly is a challenge made even
   more complicated because of this group's limited access to and use of
   mental health care services. Promoting the health of African Americans
   confronts many traditional values and practices of health care
   institutions and mental health practice. Therefore, health care
   providers must be innovative and creative to facilitate mental health
   promotion in this population of clients. The authors suggest that the
   Revised Health Promotion Model can serve as a framework for guiding the
   mental health care of elderly African Americans, Aspects of the model
   are particularly relevant for this population. The case of an elderly
   Black woman is presented as an illustration of ways in which the model
   may be applied with many cultural nuances,

Abstract = {{1 There are a substantial number of drugs acting either directly or
   indirectly on the heart, but surprisingly, little is known about the
   metabolic capacity of heart muscle cells.
   2 We therefore investigated the gene expression and protein activity of
   cytochrome P450 isozymes in cultures of adult cardiomyocytes of the rat.
   3 Semi-quantitative CYP gene expression pattern suggests CYP1A1 and
   CYP2B1/2 to be key players in cardiomyocytes and upon treatment with
   Aroclor 1254 approximate 4 fold inductions could be observed for both
   gene families, when compared with appropriate controls.
   4 The mRNA expression of most genes was sustained for prolonged periods
   of time, e.g. up to 120 h in culture and in the case of the CYP3A1 gene
   an approximate 10 fold induction was observed at the higher Aroclor 1254
   dose level (10 mu M) in 24 h old cultures.
   5 The constitutively expressed genes, e.g. CYP2C11 and CYP2E1 are
   expressed throughout the entire culture period (5 days) and did not
   respond to Aroclor 1254 treatment.
   6 CYP4A1 was mainly expressed in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes of
   control animals and its expression declined rapidly in culture. 7 There
   was good agreement between gene expression and translated protein
   activity using 7 ethoxyresorufin and testosterone as substrates. 8 The
   data reported herein should foster the routine use of freshly isolated
   and cultivated cardiomyocytes for drug profiling and toxicity studies.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Emotional control is hypothesized to increase cancer
   incidence and cancer mortality risk. We tested the hypothesis
   prospectively on all cancers in elderly men.
   Methods: The Zutphen Elderly Study on lifestyle and chronic diseases
   started in 1985. The total sample consisted of 939 men born between 1900
   and 1920 and living in Zutphen (response 74\%). In 1985, emotional
   control was measured by questionnaire with the Courtald Emotional
   Control Scale (CECS). The CECS consists of three dimensions (anger,
   anxiety and depression). Emotional control scores were grouped in
   tertiles. Information on cancer incidence and mortality was collected
   until December 1994 through general practitioners and hospital
   administration (119 incidence cases, and 71 deaths from cancer). Cox
   proportional hazards analyses were performed, adjusted for
   sociodemographic, psychosocial, and lifestyle-related factors.
   Results: Overall emotional control and emotional control of anger and of
   anxiety were not convincingly related to cancer risk. Intermediate
   control of depression was related to cancer incidence (fully adjusted RR
   = 1.7, 95\% CI = 1.0-2.8). Both intermediate and high control of
   depression were related to cancer mortality (RR = 2.2, 95\% CI = 1.1-4.6
   and RR = 2.1, 95\% CI = 1.0-4.3, respectively).
   Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that control of depression is
   related to cancer risk.}},

Abstract = {{A retrospective study was carried out to determine the importance and
   causes of ruminant urethral obstruction, during the period from January
   1989 to July 1991 and August 1998 to March 1999 in Debre Zeit area,
   Ethiopia. Of the total 104 ruminant surgical cases, the prevalence of
   urethral obstruction in sheep and cattle accounted for 37.14 \% (13/35)
   and 44.93 \% (31/69), respectively. The two common causes of urethral
   obstruction were external trauma and uroliths. In the sheep both
   external trauma and uroliths represent 46.15 \% (6) each, while in
   cattle the rates of occurrence were 35.48 \% (11) and 29.03 \% (9),
   respectively. The causes of obstruction were nor clearly identified in a
   significant proportion of cattle (35.48 \%, n = 11), and in a single
   ram. In sheep, 53.38 \% cases were with intact urethra, 15.38 \% with
   ruptured urethra and 30.77 \% with ruptured urinary bladder. In cattle,
   64.52 \% cases were with ruptured urethra. Intact urethra and ruptured
   urinary bladder cases accounted for 25.81 \% and 9.68 \%, respectively.
   Shortage of drinking water during the long dry season, watering of
   animals on salty crater-lake water and low vitamin A level in feed are
   considered as some of the important contributing factors in urolith
   formation in cattle. An imbalance in calcium and phosphorus ratio and
   high level of magnesium in commercially available and traditionally used
   concentrate feeds, respectively, were anticipated to be the major
   contributory factors in ovine urolithiasis. Analysis of mineral
   composition of the urolith samples from cattle revealed the presence of
   calcium and oxalate as major constituents. Results were discussed by
   comparison with literature data from other countries. Recommendations on
   possible control options and future areas of research were made.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the efficacy of low-dose methotrexate (MTX) given long-term
   for the treatment of autoimmune hearing loss, we performed a prospective
   open-label study of 11 patients with treatment-refractory autoimmune
   hearing loss. All patients had ongoing episodic worsening of hearing in
   1 or both ears before enrollment despite traditional medical therapy.
   The MTX dose was 7.5 to 17.5 mg/wk. Hearing loss and vertigo were
   evaluated at baseline and at completion of the study. Hearing
   improvement was defined as an improvement in the pure tone threshold
   (PT) average of >10 dB or an increase in speech discrimination (SD) of
   >15\%, whereas worsening was defined as a worsening of >10 dB in PT or a
   decrease of >15\% in SD in at least 1 ear. The MTX was well tolerated.
   Among the 6 patients with Meniere's disease, 4 had improvement or
   resolution of vertigo, while 2 had no improvement. Disequilibrium
   improved in all 3 patients with Cogan's syndrome. According to the
   parameters defined above, hearing improved in 9 patients (82\%), was
   unchanged in 1 patient (9\%), and worsened in 1 patient (9\%). Long-term
   low-dose MTX therapy may be a useful therapy for some patients who have
   hearing loss with a presumptively autoimmune-mediated component that is
   refractory to traditional therapies.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new segment-based approach for a real-time reactive
   rescheduling method. The approach is applicable to actual large-scale
   manufacturing systems, such as fully automated semiconductor wafer
   fabrication lines. The proposed method can efficiently tin terms of
   computation time) schedule processing operations at equipment units by
   dividing a wide scheduling range into small segments and by using a
   greedy scheduling algorithm. It can also reactivate infeasible schedules
   without sacrificing the quality of schedules in terms of productivity as
   much as possible. From the simulation results obtained, we
   experimentally confirmed that the proposed method reactivates without
   significant productivity loss caused by the rescheduling algorithm
   itself infeasible schedules faster than a comparative method commonly in
   use today, Consequently, the proposed method manages to keep schedules
   at each equipment unit executable in terms of processing performance and
   schedule quality.}},

   normal range and there was a marked improvement in left ventricular
   function by gated blood pool scintigraphy. Pre- and postoperative
   fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) myocardial positron emission
   tomography showed increased accumulation of FDG in the myocardium before
   surgery, but accumulation within the normal range after operation.
   Myocardial glucose metabolism changed when the long-term effects of

Abstract = {{The reaction pattern of an extracellular chitin deacetylase from a
   Deuteromycete, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum ATCC 56676, was
   investigated by use of chitooligosaccharides {[}(GlcNAc)(n), n = 3-6]
   and partially N-deacetylated chitooligosaccharides as substrates. When
   0.5\% of(GlcNAc)(n), was deacetylated, the corresponding
   monodeacetylated products were initially detected without any
   processivity, suggesting the involvement of a multiple-chain mechanism
   for the deacetylation reaction. The structural analysis of these
   first-step products indicated that the chitin deacetylase strongly
   recognizes a sequence of four N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues
   of the substrate (the subsites for the four GlcNAc residues are defined
   as -2, -1, 0, and +1, respectively, from the nonreducing end to the
   reducing end), and the N-acetyl group in the GlcNAc residue positioned
   at subsite 0 is exclusively deacetylated, When substrates of a low
   concentration (100 mu M) were deacetylated, the initial deacetylation
   rate for (GlcNAc)(4) was comparable to that of (GlcNAc)(5), while
   deacetylation of (GlcNAc)(3) could not be detected. Reaction rate
   analyses of partially N-deacetylated chitooligosaccharides suggested
   that subsite -2 strongly recognizes the N-acetyl group of the GlcNAc
   residue of the substrate, while the deacetylation rate was not affected
   when either subsite -1 or +1 was occupied with a D-glucosamine residue
   instead of GlcNAc residue, Thus, the reaction pattern of the chitin
   deacetylase is completely distinct from that of a Zygomycete, Mucor
   rouxii, which produces a chitin deacetylase for accumulation of chitosan
   in its cell wall.}},

   errors in the 0.8 - 1.7\% and 0.4 - 2.9\% ranges for SDS-acetonitrile
   and SDS-pentanol eluents, respectively, demonstrated the reliability of
   the methodology. Acetonitrile and pentanol had a complementary effect in
   these analyses. The elution strength of acetonitrile was weaker, but
   allowed higher efficiencies. A 0.094 M SDS-16\% acetonitrile eluent
   separated seven steroids (dehydrotestosterone, dydrogesterone,
   medroxyprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, methandienone,

   steroids dehydrotestosterone, dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone
   acetate, methandienone methyltestosterone, progesterone, testosterone

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To describe displacement of the globe into the ethmoid sinus
   after an orbital trauma,
   METHOD: Case report. A 58-year-old man sustained trauma of the left eye
   and orbit, which resulted in displacement of the globe into the ethmoid
   sinus. One day after injury, surgery was performed to restore the intact
   globe into position within the orbit.
   RESULTS: After operation, the globe held in its anatomical site, and 10
   months after surgery the visual acuity was 20/100, slight pallor of the
   optic disk was present, and there was no limitation of the horizontal
   and vertical ductions,
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of traumatic
   displacement of the globe into the ethmoid sinus with satisfactory
   restoration of normal globe position and preservation of vision. (C)

Abstract = {{The claim that there is something distinctive about the kind of
   knowledge associated with social work research is investigated. When
   three tests of distinctiveness are applied it emerges that the only way
   in which this claim can be upheld is by reference to a prior claim to
   ontological distinctiveness. The nature of this distinctive ontology is
   explored using an image of links and interdependencies. It is argued
   that complexity is integral to both the world of social work practice
   and the process of doing social work research. Alternative conceptions
   of complexity in the physical and social sciences are discussed but it
   is suggested that social work research needs its own concept of `network
   knowledge' if it is to deliver understandings of complexity relevant to
   the world in which it exists. Finally, the extent to which network
   knowledge is networked knowledge, collectively owned and produced is
   examined. The article concludes that by linking the concept of knowledge
   to the process of knowledge creation, what emerges is not only a
   distinctive research paradigm but also a way of rebuilding a concept of
   professional unity and purpose in social work education.}},

Abstract = {{Down-modulation of CD3 zeta expression on CD8 T lymphocytes occurs,
   independently of other T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 components, in
   tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, human immunodeficiency virus infection,
   and autoimmune disease. These associations suggest that it might be
   related to chronic antigenic stimulation. CD3 zeta down-modulation was
   found, however, in CD8 T cells that in response to acute viral
   infections. In 3 otherwise healthy donors with acute gastroenteritis,
   infectious mononucleosis, and Epstein-Barr
   virus/cytomegalovirus/mononucleosis, 30\% to 60\% of circulating CD8 T
   cells had down-modulated CD3 zeta to below the level of detection. The
   CD3 zeta-T cells were also CD28- but expressed the activation markers
   HLA-DR and CD57. CD3 zeta-CD28-T cells are effector CTL because they
   express perforin and produce IFN-gamma, but not IL-2, on activation and
   contain the viral-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). However,
   CD35-CD28-T cells generally do not express CD25 after anti-CD3 and
   anti-CD28 stimulation and are not cytotoxic until they are cultured with
   IL-2 overnight. Cytotoxicity coincides with the re-expression of CD3
   zeta but not CD28, Downmodulation of CD3 zeta acid CD28 on effector CTL
   may control CTL triggering and proliferation to prevent
   immunopathogenesis. (C) 2000 by The American Society of Hematology.}},

   peculiar characteristic of Tresarcus. This structure recalls, from a
   morphological point of view (though at a different dimensional scale),
   the four-arched termination of the epidermal hairs that ornate the
   adaxial (upper) surface of the assimilating leaves of Salvinia natans,
   Adanson, 1785 (Pteridophyta). This species has an aquatic habit and the
   four-arched structure as the tip of the epidermal is interpreted as a
   device that favours buoyancy by trapping air on the leaf surface. A

   Tresarcus. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Allatotropin (AT) is an insect neuropeptide isolated from the tobacco
   hornworm, Manduca sexta, stimulates juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis
   by the corpora allata. A cDNA isolated from the true armyworm,
   Pseudaletia unipuncta, encodes a 135 amino acid AT precursor peptide
   which contains the AT peptide, with processing sites necessary for its
   endoproteolytic cleavage and amidation, plus two additional peptides of
   unknown function. The encoded AT peptide is identical to that isolated
   from M. sexta and Agrius convolvuli.
   Southern blot analysis indicated that AT is a single copy gene per
   haploid genome and is present in two allelic forms. A single transcript
   of approximately 1.5 kilobases was detected by northern blot analysis.
   The expression of the AT gene was analyzed during development from sixth
   instar larvae to five day-old moths. Initial expression was observed in
   late pupae and this expression was maintained throughout the adult
   stages in both sexes. In one day-old moths, expression was at its lowest
   level of the stages that express AT mRNA but levels increased in day 3
   and day 5 adults. This pattern of AT expression in adult P. unipuncta
   moths mirrors that of JH biosynthesis and supports the notion that AT
   may act in the adult stages.
   Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed that AT
   expression was localized to numerous structures of the nervous system,
   suggesting that AT may have functions distinct from regulation of JH
   biosynthesis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of
   intracavernosal alprostadil (CAVER-JECT(R)) in diabetic patients with
   erectile dysfunction (ED).
   Patients and Methods: This study included 31 diabetic men (aged 44-75
   years) with ED of greater than or equal to 4 months duration. All
   patients were initially instructed in the self-injection technique at
   the investigator's clinic. The optimal dose was determined for each
   patient and set at one of the following: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 mu
   g. After the optimal dose was determined and the patient was well
   trained, the self-injection home phase was followed for 6 months. The
   efficacy and adverse events were documented.
   Results: An optimal dose was determined for 29 men (93.5\%) and in 16
   men (55\%) it was greater than or equal to 20 mu g. During the home
   phase, 76.5\% of injections assessed by the patients resulted in
   satisfactory sexual activity and 72.5\% of injections assessed by
   partners resulted in satisfactory intercourse. A total of 16 patients
   dropped out during the titration phase (n = 2) and the home phase (n =
   14). The most common reasons included lack of efficacy (n = 3, all in
   the home phase), intolerable penile pain (1 in the titration phase, 2 in
   the home phase) and dissatisfaction with the higher dosage (n = 2).
   Penile pain occurred in 19 (61\%) of 31 patients. Most were tolerable,
   and the incidence decreased with time. Prolonged erection occurred in 2
   men (6.5\%), and no priapism was noted. Penile fibrosis occurred in 1
   patient (3.2\%). None of the systemic medical events were related to the
   study mediction. However, 1 patient suffered from right putaminal
   hemorrhage in the last month, and this was considered to be caused by
   underlying hypertension and not drug-related.
   Conclusion: Despite the high incidence of penile pain, most of the
   occurrences were tolerable. Despite a higher withdrawal rate in this
   study, intracavernosal alprostadil is still considered as a relatively
   effective and safe treatment in some diabetic patients with ED if the
   individual dose is established by titration and patients are trained in
   the self-injection technique with period supervision. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The global increase in transcription of cytoprotective genes induced in
   response to oxidative challenge has been termed the antioxidant
   response. Ferritin serves as the major iron-binding protein in
   nonhematopoietic tissues, limiting the catalytic availability of iron
   for participation in oxygen radical generation. Here we demonstrate that
   ferritin is a participant in the antioxidant response through a
   genetically defined electrophile response element (EpRE). The EpRE of
   ferritin H identified in this report exhibits sequence similarity to
   EpRE motifs found in antioxidant response genes such as those encoding
   NAD(P)H:quinone reductase, glutathione S-transferase. and heme
   oxygenase. However, the EpRE of ferritin H is unusual in structure,
   comprising two bidirectional motifs arranged in opposing directions on
   complementary DNA strands. In addition to EpRE-mediated transcriptional
   activation, we demonstrate that ferritin is subject to time-dependent
   translational control through regulation of iron-regulatory proteins
   (IRP). Although IRP-1 is initially activated to its RNA binding
   (ferritin-repressing) state by oxidants, it rapidly returns to its basal
   state. This permits the translation of newly synthesized ferritin
   transcripts and ultimately leads to increased levels of ferritin protein
   synthesis following oxidant exposure. Taken together, these results
   clarify the complex transcriptional and translational regulatory
   mechanisms that contribute to ferritin regulation in response to
   prooxidant stress and establish a role for ferritin in the antioxidant
   response.}},

   remained relatively constant for at least 24 h at 4C. The developed

Abstract = {{Despite technological changes and improved management, piglet mortality
   remains a problem for both production and welfare. Most preweaning
   mortality occurs within the first 3 days after birth because of problems
   with adaptation and development. Thus, the purpose of our study was to
   determine the physiologic state of newborn pigs with respect to piglet
   survival. Data were collected from 1024 live-born piglets of 106
   primiparous German Landrace sows to analyze relationships between
   farrowing traits, early postnatal vitality and blood chemistry,
   including immunity of piglets at birth. Surviving piglets were compared
   with those that died during the first 10 days of life. The survivors
   were significantly heavier at birth (P=0.001), were born earlier in the
   birth order (P=0.04), reached the udder and took in first colostral milk
   more quickly (P=0.001) and had a smaller drop in rectal temperature 1 h
   after birth (P=0.001) than dead. However, dead piglets had significantly
   higher blood levels of inorganic phosphorus (P=0.0001), calcium (P=0.04)
   and urea (P=0.05), but a lower concentration of alpha(2)-macroglobulin
   and lower lymphocyte proliferation indices in response to pokeweed
   mitogen (P=0.05). Models fitted for discrimination between survivors and
   piglets that died included, in addition to birth weight and litter size,
   the foraging behavior of neonates (time from birth to first suckle) and
   their thermoregulatory capacity (rectal temperature 1 h after birth) in
   the first experimental. unit, as well as prenursing biochemical measures
   (inorganic phosphorus, calcium and glucose) in the second experimental
   unit. These ethophysiological and biochemical traits of early postnatal
   vitality are important determinants of maturity and development at
   birth. Hence, breeding programs and perinatal housing and feeding
   conditions should ensure a high physiological maturity to improve
   mortality rates of neonates. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Decoding UGA as selenocysteine requires a unique tRNA, a specialized
   elongation factor, and specific secondary structures in the mRNA, termed
   SECIS elements. Eukaryotic SECIS elements are found in the 3'
   untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs while those in prokaryotes
   occur immediately downstream of UGA. Consequently, a single eukaryotic
   SECIS element can serve multiple UGA codons, whereas prokaryotic SECIS
   elements only function for the adjacent UGA, suggesting distinct
   mechanisms for recoding in the two kingdoms. We have identified and
   characterized the first eukaryotic selenocysteyl-tRNA-specific
   elongation factor. This factor forms a complex with mammalian SECIS
   binding protein 2, and these two components function together in
   selenocysteine incorporation in mammalian cells. Expression of the two
   functional domains of the bacterial elongation factor-SECIS binding
   protein as two separate proteins in eukaryotes suggests a mechanism for
   rapid exchange of charged for uncharged selenocysteyl-tRNA-elongation
   factor complex, allowing a single SECIS element to serve multiple UGA
   codons.}},

Abstract = {{Interphase boundaries between 3C SiC grains and two different beta-Si3N4
   morphologies in Si3N4-SiC composites have been studied by transmission
   electron microscopy. In general, boundaries between small beta-Si3N4
   intragranular precipitates and surrounding SiC grains were relatively
   free of intergranular films, whereas boundaries between large beta-Si3N4
   grains and adjacent SiC grains were invariably covered with thin
   intergranular films. Orientation relationships approximating to {[}110]
   3C SiC parallel to {[}0001] beta-Si3N4 and (001) 3C SiC parallel to (10
   (1) over bar 0) beta-Si3N4 were found to dominate between 3C SiC grains
   and the intragranular beta-Si3N4 precipitates, but there was no evidence
   of any favoured orientation relationship between the large beta-Si3N4
   grains and adjacent SiC grains. The rationale for `special' orientation
   relationships arising when there is no intergranular film present at 3C
   SiC-beta-Si3N4 interfaces is explored geometrically using the
   near-coincidence site lattice model, with the significant result that
   the dominant orientation relationships between 3C SiC grains and the

Abstract = {{The major secondary metabolites of the sponge Aplysina aerophoba are
   brominated compounds. X-ray energy dispersive microanalysis was
   therefore used to locate secondary metabolites via the Br signal in
   energy emission spectra from sponge sections. To test the reliability of
   this method in the face of the loss or redistribution of metabolites
   during processing, we compared the results obtained by conventional
   aldehyde fixation with those obtained by cryofixation and
   cryosubstitution with and without cryoembedding. Bromine appeared to be
   concentrated in two sponge structures, viz, fibres and spherulous cells,
   when cryofixed material was examined. However, X-ray microanalysis
   failed to demonstrate the presence of bromine in spherulous cells in
   chemically fixed samples, showing the need for cryotechniques to avoid
   the loss of compounds. Cryofixation plus cryosubstitution methods
   performed best regarding structural preservation and the immobilization
   of metabolites. The presence of bromine in the spherulous cells suggests
   that this cell type is the producer of the secondary metabolites, as
   described for other sponge species. Nevertheless, the presence of
   bromine in sponge fibres indicates that they can accumulate metabolic
   substances, although we have been unable to assess whether the chemicals
   are in their original form or in a modified state within the fibres. A.
   aerophoba has both bacterial and cyanobacterial symbionts in its
   mesohyl; the absence of brominated compounds in them contrasts with
   previous findings in other sponges with prokaryote symbionts.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis is characterized by marked osteophyte formation
   consisting of new cartilage and bone. Because several growth factors are
   known to be involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, the expression
   of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and basic fibroblast growth factor
   in the osteophytes of the human femoral heads in osteoarthritis were
   examined. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid
   was detected in the osteophytes by reverse transcription-polymerase
   chain reaction. All of the nine examined osteophytes expressed
   transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid, whereas
   one of four osteoarthritic femoral heads and none of four osteonecrotic
   femoral heads expressed transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger
   ribonucleic acid. The extent of transforming growth factor-beta 1
   messenger ribonucleic acid expression varied among the osteophytes.
   Transforming growth factor-beta 1 or basic fibroblast growth factor was
   analyzed in osteophytes immunohistochemically. Transforming growth
   factor-beta 1 was localized in the superficial cells in the osteophyte
   cartilage, but it was scarcely detected in the superficial cells in the
   degenerative articular cartilage. Basic fibroblast growth factor was
   detected in the cells in the whole layer of osteophyte cartilage and in
   the articular cartilage. There was a difference in the localization,
   which suggests the different roles of transforming growth factor-beta 1
   and basic fibroblast growth factor in bone and cartilage metabolism in
   osteophyte formation.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{334-339}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Epileptiform discharges and behavioral seizures may be the consequences
   of the presence of either excessive excitation associated with the
   neurotransmitter glutamate or from inadequate inhibitory effects
   associated with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Synaptic effects of
   these neurotransmitters are terminated by the action of transporter
   proteins that remove these amino acids from the synaptic cleft. The
   glial transporters glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate
   transporter-1 (GLT-1), and the neuronal transporter excitatory amino
   acids carrier-1 (EAAC-1) limit excitation initiated by synaptic release
   of glutamate. Transporter proteins GABA transporter-1 (GAT-1) and GABA
   transporter-3 (GAT-3) remove GABA from synaptic regions. To assess the
   molecular effects of the antiepileptic drug valproate, albino rats with
   chronic, spontaneous, recurrent seizures induced by amygdalar injection
   of FeCl3 were treated for 14 days with either valproic acid or with
   saline as an injection control. Regions of the hippocampus were assayed
   for glutamate and GABA transporters by western blot. While
   epileptogenesis is thought to correlate with the downregulation of GLAST
   and upregulation of EAAC-1, valproate caused an increase in the quantity
   of GLAST protein measured in the hippocampus. Valproate treatment
   decreased GLT-1 in both control and experimental animals in both
   hippocampi. EAAC-1 was unchanged by valproate treatment. GABA
   transporters GAT-1 and GAT-3 in the hippocampus were upregulated by
   FeCl3 injection into the amygdala. However, valproate caused the
   downregulation of these GABA transporters in both control and
   experimental animals. Altered molecular regulation of glutamate appears
   to be critical in the development of sustained, spontaneous limbic
   seizures. Our data suggest that valproate may have unique mechanisms of
   action; specifically, it may affect the removal of glutamate by
   upregulating GLAST and decreasing GABA transport, which could result in
   increased tissue concentrations of GABA.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an ultrafast all-optical divided-clock extractor in which an
   all-optical symmetric-Mach-Zehnder (SMZ)-type semiconductor switch and a
   passive energy-distribution Mach-Zehnder interferometer are embedded in
   an optical loop. The extractor generates ultrashort optical clock pulses
   at a divided clock frequency (f(o)/N, N = 1, 2, 3, 4,...) from
   optical-time division-multiplexed (OTDM) input packets at a bit
   frequency, f(o). Numerical results reveal that the phase of 40 GHz 1 ps
   clock pulses locks within 20 ns (which corresponds to 3,000 bits of a
   160 Gb/s signal) to that of the 160 Gb/s pseudorandomly encoded input
   pulses.}},

Abstract = {{A solution of the problem of low flux, multicomponent, mass transfer in
   single, circulating liquid drops is presented in this work. The
   prediction from fundamental theory of single-component mass transfer for
   drops travelling at intermediate Reynolds numbers (10 less than or equal
   to Re less than or equal to 250), reported by the authors (Uribe-Ramirez
   \& Korchinsky (2000) Chemical Engineering Science, in press), is
   extended to the case of several solutes transferring simultaneously. The
   same limitations of the previous paper apply here. These include (i) the
   neglect of the mass transfer occurring in the wake, (ii) that mass
   transfer during drop formation will previously have been accounted for,
   and (iii) that complete mixing occurs beyond the narrow boundary layer
   adjacent to the drop surface. The multicomponent diffusion equation,
   with velocities estimated as for the single component transfer case, is
   uncoupled using the linearized theory of Toor (1964a, b) and Stewart and
   Prober (1964). Each of the uncoupled differential equations is then
   solved, using a transformation of variables, for the
   pseudo-concentration profiles near the boundary in both phases, and for
   the bulk solute concentration changes in the drop. Multicomponent mass
   transfer coefficients are also calculated. Results for the quaternary
   system, toluene-acetone-acetaldehyde-water, are predicted to illustrate
   the application of the theory. Experimental data are required to check
   predictions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Emesis (nausea and vomiting) is one of the most important toxicities
   associated with chemotherapy. Although it is not life threatening, it
   has a major impact on a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQL)
   and overall response to chemotherapy. New antiemetics are expensive and
   well-conducted comparative health economic studies are rare. The aim of
   the study was to review the literature in the area of
   chemotherapy-induced emesis in cancer patients and to offer
   recommendations for the inclusion of these outcomes in the design of
   clinical trials for new antiemetic therapies. The economic literature
   was reviewed based on methodological standards for economic evaluation.
   Many studies did not comply with standards, specifically with regard to
   the choice of alternatives, chosen perspective, setting, type of emesis,
   measurement of costs and defining outcomes (including health-related
   quality of life). These issues are described for each study and
   recommendations for trial design are presented. The role of economic
   data is to support decision making in choosing between competing
   antiemetic therapies. It is the combination of clinical outcomes, costs
   and health-related quality of life, which will allow treating physicians
   to comprehensively assess the relative value of antiemetic therapies and
   to provide the most cost-effective therapy for their patients. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to create a methodology for
   evidence-based assessment of published drug-drug interaction information
   and presentation of that information in a standardized format,
   Background: Inconsistencies in drug-drug interaction information among
   major medical compendia have been documented and are of major concern to
   physicians, pharmacists, drug utilization review (DUR) program
   operators, and patients, Most compendia fail to document their
   methodology for listing or rating the potential clinical severity of
   drug-drug interactions. Inconsistent information about drug-drug
   interactions can cause prescribing problems and variations, possibly
   increasing the incidence of morbidity and mortality.
   Methods: The available literature (MEDLINE(R), EMBASE(R), International
   Pharmaceutical Abstracts) on systematic reviews, methodologic quality
   assessment of research articles, and causality assessment of adverse
   drug events was searched to identify the best practices for creation of
   an evidence-based drug-drug interaction information review process. A
   suggested format for standardized presentation of this information is
   described.
   Results: The following 5-step process was created to assess published
   drug-drug interaction information: (1) search the medical literature for
   published drug-drug interaction information; (2) assess the relevance of
   the articles; (3) assess the quality of the articles; (4) assess
   drug-drug interaction causality; and (5) abstract the findings and
   present the evidence.
   Conclusions: Evidence-based assessment of published drug-drug
   interaction information appears to be feasible and would help
   clinicians, DUR program operators, and patients. Assessment of this
   information on a large scale, however, mill require significant
   resources and the resolution of a number of technical issues.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To assess patients' views on the organization of
   (cardiovascular) preventive care.
   Design. Prospective questionnaire survey with measurements shortly after
   risk assessment (T-1) and after 1 year of risk intervention (T-2)
   Setting. Twenty-seven general practices participating in a project to
   enhance systematic cardiovascular disease prevention in two regions in
   The Netherlands.
   Study participants. Two-hundred and ninety-eight successive patients
   aged 30-60 years identified with an elevated cardiovascular risk.
   Main outcome measures. Organizational aspects such as the acceptability
   of the care provider, practicality of special clinics, accessibility of
   the practice for routine care.
   Results. Most of the respondents (74\%) had no preference for a care
   provider in cardiovascular preventive care and only a few patients (3\%)
   reported having little confidence in the expertise of the practice
   assistant to provide such care. The vast majority (88\%) considered
   special preventive clinics to be practical, especially at T-1. Most of
   the respondents (76\%) did not report a decline in the accessibility of
   their practice for routine care. These outcome measures were not
   affected by age, sex, educational level or the number of risk factors
   measured during 1 year of risk intervention.
   Conclusion. Most patients did not have any major objections against the
   organization of preventive care through opportunistic case finding and
   risk monitoring in special preventive clinics managed by the practice
   assistant.}},

Abstract = {{The design of effective gene delivery systems for gene transfer in
   primary human blood cells is important both for fundamental
   hematopoiesis research and for cancer gene therapy strategies. Here, we
   evaluated electroporation as a nonviral means for transfection of
   activated human T lymphocytes and adult bone marrow (BM) CD34(+) cells.
   We describe optimal culture and electroporation parameters for efficient
   gene delivery in prestimulated T lymphocytes (16.3 +/- 1.3\%), as well
   as e-day cultured adult BM CD34(+) cells (29.6 +/- 4.6\%).
   PHA-stimulated T cells were most receptive for transfection after 48h of
   in vitro culture, while T cells stimulated by CD3 cross-linking and
   interleukin (IL)-2 achieved maximum transfection levels after 72 h of
   pre-stimulation. Kinetic analysis of EGFP expression revealed that
   activated T lymphocytes maintained transgene expression at high levels
   for a prolonged period. In addition, fresh unstimulated BM CD34(+) cells
   were consistently transfected (5.2 +/- 0.4\%) with minimal cytotoxicity
   (<5\%), even without preliminary CD34(+) cell purification. Both T cells
   and CD34(+) cells retained their phenotype and functional capacity after
   electroporation. These results demonstrate that electroporation is a
   suitable nonviral transfection technique that may serve applications in
   gene therapy protocols using T lymphocytes or CD34(+) cells.}},

Abstract = {{The digestibility and voluntary intake of fibrous roughages and acorns
   was studied in six wild boar and five Meishan pigs. The
   neutral-detergent fibre (NDF) concentration of the diets ranged from 139
   to 767 g/kg of the organic matter Organic matter digestibility of
   acorns, mixed grass and wheat straw was higher in wild boar (P < 0.05)
   while voluntary food intake of the Meishan pigs was higher for mixed
   grass, hay and wheat straw (P < 0.05). Organic matter digestibility (P <
   0.01) and NDF digestibility (P < 0.05) were both negatively related to
   NDF concentration oft he diet. No relationship existed between voluntary
   food intake and NDF concentration of the diet. The apparent nitrogen (N)
   digestibility was positively related (P < 0.01) to dietary N while no
   relationship was found with dietary NDE The negative effect of NDF on
   digestibility could only be partly explained by the lignin concentration
   of NDF. Much more important was the lower efficiency of the carbohydrate
   fermentation in the caecum and colon when compared with the direct
   absorption of glucose from the small intestine. It tons estimated that
   digestible NDF at a maximum contributed proportionately 0.26 to the
   metabolizable energy intake of the animals. It teas concluded that wild
   boar and domestic pigs should be able to maintain themselves on an all
   fresh grass diet when NDF concentration oft he diet does not exceed
   about 550 g/kg and N concentration is not too low.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to the selection of optimal sensor
   locations in distributed parameter systems, which distinguishes the
   purposes of state estimation from the purposes of parameter estimation.
   In the first case, the optimality criterion is based on a measure of
   independence between the sensor responses, while in the second case, it
   is based on a measure of independence between the parameter sensitivity
   functions. The procedure, which is general and can be applied to models
   with any degree of complexity, is illustrated with the optimal placement
   of temperature sensors in a catalytic fixed-bed reactor. Some numerical
   results for the on-line estimation of temperature and concentration
   profiles as well as for the estimation of unknown model parameters are
   discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this work was to study whether there are
   differences in plasma proinsulin levels and proinsulin-to-specific
   insulin ratio in the offspring of patients with different phenotypes of
   type II diabetes.
   Design: Eleven glucose-tolerant offspring of type II diabetic patients
   with deficient insulin secretion phenotype (IS group), nine
   glucose-tolerant offspring of patients with insulin-resistant phenotype
   (LR group), and fourteen healthy control subjects without a family
   history of diabetes were studied.
   Methods: Plasma specific insulin, plasma proinsulin, and plasma
   C-peptide levels were measured during a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test
   and during hyperglycemic clamp.
   Results: Plasma proinsulin levels during the oral glucose tolerance test
   and the hyperglycemic clamp did not differ among the study groups, The
   IR group had a lower fasting plasma proinsulin-to-specific insulin ratio
   (10.3 +/- 1.7\%) than the control group (15.4 +/- 1.4\%; P<0.05) and the
   IS group (18.6 +/- 2.7\%: P < 0.05). Furthermore. the TR group had lower
   plasma proinsulin-to-specific insulin ratio at 30, 60 and 90 min after
   the oral glucose load than the IS group. However, there were no
   significant differences in proinsulin-to-C-peptide ratio during the oral
   glucose tolerance test among the study groups, In stepwise multiple
   regression analysis, hepatic specific insulin extraction in the fasting
   state (beta = 0.65, P < 0.001) and fasting blood glucose (beta = 0.32; P
   < 0.05) together explained 52\% of the variation in fasting plasma
   proinsulin-to-specific insulin ratio.
   Conclusions: Hyperproinsulinemia is not a characteristic finding in
   glucose-tolerant offspring of type II diabetic probands with deficient
   insulin secretion or insulin-resistant phenotype. The differences in
   proinsulin-to-specific insulin ratios were most likely explained by
   different hepatic extraction among the study groups.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Cognitive adaptation training is a novel psychosocial
   treatment approach designed to improve adaptive functioning by using
   compensatory strategies in the home or work environment to bypass the
   cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. The authors tested the
   effect of cognitive adaptation training on level of adaptive functioning
   in outpatients with schizophrenia.
   Method: Forty-five patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective
   disorder were randomly assigned for 9 months to one of three treatment
   conditions: 1) standard medication follow-up, 2) standard medication
   follow-up plus cognitive adaptation training, and 3) standard medication
   follow-up plus a condition designed to control for therapist time and
   provide environmental changes unrelated to cognitive deficits.
   Comprehensive assessments were conducted every 3 months by raters who
   were blind to treatment condition.
   Results: Significant differences were found between the three treatment
   groups in levels of psychotic symptoms, motivation, and global
   functioning at the end of the 9-month study period. Patients in the
   cognitive adaptation training group overall had higher levels of
   improvement, compared with those in the remaining treatment conditions.
   In addition, the three groups had significantly different relapse rates
   over the 9-month study: 13\% for the cognitive adaptation training
   group, 69\% for the group in which therapist time and environmental
   changes were controlled, and 33\% for the group who received standard
   follow-up only.
   Conclusions: Compensatory strategies may improve outcomes for patients
   with schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Larvae of the common intertidal chthamalid barnacles Jehlius cirratus
   and Notochthamalus scabrosus were obtained from mature adults collected
   in central and northern Chile and cultivated in the laboratory at
   temperatures typical of the conditions encountered by larvae in these
   regions. Morphological and developmental descriptions of the six
   naupliar stages and the cyprid stage of both species are given. Both
   species clearly present the general pattern of development for
   chthamalids, in which the structural characters of the cephalic shield
   and abdominal process, in conjunction with the utilization of the
   alphabetical setation formula for antennae, facilitate the
   identification and differentiation between larval stages. The average
   time of naupliar larval development of J. cirratus and N. scabrosus in
   sea-water temperature ranging 15-18 degrees C was 31 and 37 days, while
   larvae cultivated in temperatures ranging 18-20 degrees C completed
   naupliar development after 13 and 20.2 days, respectively. This
   represents a 58\% and 45.5\% reduction in naupliar development time with
   a three-degree increase in mean sea water temperature for J. cirratus
   and N. scabrosus, respectively. The development time from cyprid until
   settlement and metamorphosis of N. scabrosus lasted between 9 and 11
   days, depending on the temperature, while cyprid development for J.
   cirratus lasted 8 days at 18-20 degrees C. The average sizes of the
   naupliar and cyprid stages were similar between the species at both
   temperature ranges. Although the increased temperature reduced the time
   of larval development, it did not significantly affect larval sizes.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of Ca-P magnetron sputter coated implants on the
   mechanical anchorage was evaluated in a goat model. Therefore, uncoated
   and coated screw designed commercially pure titanium TiO2-blasted
   implants were inserted into the trabecular bone of the femoral condyles
   of 12 goats. The thicknesses of the coatings were 0.1 mu m (CaP-0.1),
   1.0 mu m (CaP-1) and 4.0 mu m (CaP-4). In addition, uncoated
   TiO2-blasted implants (Ti) were used as control. Evaluation of the
   interface strength and appearance, using torque test and scanning
   electron microscopy, was done at implantation periods of 6 and 12 weeks.
   Although, especially at 6 weeks of implantation, the Ca-P coated
   implants showed higher failure torque values than the TiO2 blasted
   implants, the observed differences for type of implant and evaluation
   period were not significant (P>0.1). SEM evaluation showed that all
   implants with failure values of more than 100 N conducted bone growth
   into their screw threads. In addition, we observed that the fracture
   plane for the CaP-3 implants was situated at the coating-implant
   interface or inside the coating. For the Cap-1 and CaP-0.1 the fracture
   line could not be determined definitely. For the Ti implants, the
   fracture torque testing resulted in failure at the bone-implant
   interface. Therefore, we conclude that all implants resulted in a good
   bonding strength with the surrounding bone. The sputtered Ca-P coatings
   seemed to improve the initial fixation of the TiO2 blasted implants.}},

   increase as the number of incumbent firms increases (up to the point of
   excess capacity). This feature implies that, when considering mixed
   strategies, the relevant payoffs are not monotonic: as the probability
   of entry increases, expected profit for a given firm, conditional on

Abstract = {{Several antifoam agents were evaluated for the ability to control foam
   in the production of Bacillus thuringiensis-based biopesticides using
   sewage sludge as a raw material. Experiments were conducted in shake
   flasks as well as in 15 I fermenters with controlled parameters.
   Polypropylene glycol (PPG), the most commonly used antifoam agent in B.
   thuringiensis fermentation, inhibited cell growth, sporulation and
   decreased the entomotoxicity yield even at a concentration of 0.1\%
   (v/v) in sewage sludge medium. About 40\% reduction in entomotoxicity
   was observed when PPG was used at 0.3\% (v/v). The impact of PPG on
   sporulation and toxin synthesis in tryptic soy yeast broth (TSYB) medium
   was also studied. The inhibitory effects were less severe in TSYB than
   in sludge medium. Another silicone-based antifoam agent, ``Antifoam
   A{''}, showed less severe effect on growth and stendotoxin production.
   The problem of the inhibitory effect of chemical antifoam agents on
   growth and endotoxin production was minimised substantially with the use
   of vegetable oils such as canola, olive, and peanut oils. Canola and
   peanut oil stimulated both sporulation and delta-endotoxin synthesis.
   The stimulus effect varies with the monounsaturated fat contents of
   oils.}},

Journal = {{LEUKEMIA}},

Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
   characterized by a poor response to therapy and short survival. To
   assess the proliferative capacity, we cultured MCL cells, using
   irradiated 3T6 mouse fibroblasts transfected with human CD40L ('CD40
   system') in the presence of different cytokines. Proliferation was
   measured by H-3-thymidine incorporation and by CFSE fluorescence.
   Thirteen out of 16 MCL cases proliferated well in the CD40 system. In 10
   cases a strong response upon further addition of IL-10 was seen, whereas
   IL-4 had an additional effect in only four cases. CFSE staining of cells
   before and after culture showed an increased number of cell divisions in
   the IL-10/CD40L stimulated cells. The MCL cells remained CD5(+)CD19(+).
   Neither plasma cell differentiation nor isotype switching was seen. The
   light chain expression was strictly monoclonal. IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6,
   G-CSF and GM-CSF did not stimulate MCL proliferation. IL-10 receptor
   expression correlated with the response to IL-10 in the culture system
   and the effect of added IL-10 could be blocked by antibodies directed
   against IL-10 and the IL-10 receptor. Autocrine IL-10 production by the
   MCL cells was detected in eight of 10 cases tested. IL-10 receptor
   blocking decreased proliferation when no exogenous IL-10 was used in
   four of seven cases tested. EBV assessed by EBER in situ hybridization
   was not detected in six cases tested. In conclusion, MCL can
   successfully be cultured upon CD40 stimulation if 3T6 CD40L(+) cells are
   used. In this context IL-10 is a costimulatory factor. IL-10 receptor
   expression seems to correlate with response to CD40 crosslinking and
   IL-10. Autocrine IL-10 production might play a role in the proliferation
   of this lymphoma. This culture system may be useful to test new
   treatment strategies for this, thus far, therapy-resistant lymphoma.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of different approaches has been used during the last couple
   of decades to investigate structure and function relationships within
   the catalytic portion of the FoF1-ATP synthase and of its interactions
   with the proton-translocator F-o. In our group, we employ ESR
   spectroscopy with the use of stable organic radicals, so-called spin
   labels, as reporter groups. The radicals are either attached to
   substrates/ligands or specifically inserted into the protein structure
   by ``site-specific spin labeling.{''} Both approaches bear intrinsic
   advantages for their special uses and result in the specific information
   that is available through ESR, e.g., structural changes due to binding
   of effector molecules (e.g., Mg2+ ions), conformational transitions
   during catalytic turnover, distance information on radicals bound at 20
   Angstrom or less, and information on the binding characteristics of
   labeled substrates. This review summarizes the results of a variety of
   different approaches we have used during the last years to study, with
   the help of ESR spectroscopy, the structure of the nucleotide binding
   sites of F-1-ATPases of different origins as well as interactions with
   F-o subunits.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanoreceptive lateral line system detects hydrodynamic stimuli
   and plays an important role in a number of types of fish behaviour,
   including orientation to water currents. The lateral line is composed of
   hair cell receptor organs called neuromasts that occur as superficial
   neuromasts on the surface of the skin or canal neuromasts located in
   subepidermal canals. Both are innervated by primary afferents of the
   lateral line nerves. Although there have been extensive studies of the
   response properties of lateral line afferents to vibrating sources,
   their response to water flow has not been reported. In this study, we
   recorded extracellularly from anterior lateral line afferents in the New
   Zealand long-fin eel Anguilla dieffenbachii while stimulating the eel
   with unidirectional water flows at 0.5-4 cm s(-1). Of the afferents,
   80\% were flow-sensitive to varying degrees, the response magnitude
   increasing with flow rate. Flow-sensitive fibres gave non-adapting tonic
   responses, indicating that these fibres detect absolute flow velocity.
   Further studies are needed to confirm whether flow-sensitive and
   flow-insensitive fibres correlate with superficial and canal neuromasts,
   respectively.}},

   compounds by the broth microdilution method. The rates of oxacillin
   resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus,
   and other CoNS were 13.5, 69, 90, and 34\%, respectively. In
   oxacillin-resistant strains high rates of resistance (up to 100\%) to
   erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were also
   observed. However, no strain appeared to be resistant to vancomycin or
   quinupristin-dalfopristin. The streptogramin combination exhibited
   excellent in vitro activity against all staphylococcal species tested,
   regardless of the patterns of resistance to other drug classes. In terms
   of MICs at which 90\% of the isolates are inhibited,
   quinupristin-dalfopristin was 2 times more active against S. aureus
   isolates, 4 to 16 times more active against S. haemolyticus, and 8 to 32
   times more active against S. epidermidis than vancomycin or teicoplanin.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:To examine the content and structure of children's play
   narratives in a large sample of 5-year-olds in order to replicate
   previous findings, explore the role of gender differences, and identify
   a pattern that can provide useful information about children's behavior.
   Method: The MacArthur Story Stem Battery and coding system was used to
   code content themes and coherence from play narratives of 652 twins in a
   nonclinical sample. To measure behavior problems, parents completed the
   Child Behavior Checklist when their children were aged 5 and 7 years;
   teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form when the children were aged
   7 years. Results: Girls told more coherent narratives with less
   aggression than boys. Aggressive themes were found to correlate with
   behavior problems as in previous studies. Upon further examination, this
   correlation held for girls but not boys. Children who told repeated
   aggressive/incoherent narratives had more behavior problems than those
   who did not show this narrative pattern. Conclusions: The Story Stem
   methodology is useful for gaining access into the young child's inner
   world. The gender of the child, content of the story, and coherence of
   the story all provide useful information in identifying narratives that
   may indicate more risk for behavior problems.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives, To present results from an outcome evaluation of the Henry
   J. Kaiser Family Foundation's Community Health Promotion Grants Program
   (CHPGP) in the West, which represented a major community-based
   initiative designed to promote improved health by changing community
   norms, environmental conditions, and individual behavior in 11 western
   communities.
   Methods. The evaluation design: ill randomly assigned intervention and
   control communities, 4 intervention communities selected on special
   merit, and 4 matched controls. Data for the outcome evaluation were
   obtained from surveys, administered every two years at three points in
   time, of community leaders and representative adults and adolescents,
   and from specially designed surveys of grocery stores. Outcomes for each
   of the 11 intervention communities were compared with outcomes in
   control communities.
   Results. With the exception of two intervention communities-a largely
   Hispanic community and a Native American reservation-we found little
   evidence of positive changes in the outcomes targeted by the 11
   intervention communities. The programs that demonstrated positive
   outcomes targeted dietary behavior and adolescent substance abuse.
   Conclusions. improvement of health through community-based interventions
   remains a critical public health challenge. The CHPGP, like other
   prominent community-based initiatives, generally failed to produce
   measurable changes in the targeted health outcomes. Efforts should focus
   on developing theories and methods that can improve the design and
   evaluation of community-based interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The fine structure of the symbiotic dinoflagellate genus Symbiadinium
   has been well described. All of the published descriptions are based on
   tissue that was tired in standard aldehyde and osmium fixatives and
   dehydrated in an ethanol series before embedding. When the technique of
   freeze-substitution was used to fix tissue from Cassiopeia xamachana,
   Aiptasia pallida, and Phyllactis flosculifera and prepare it for
   embedding, thecal vesicles were revealed within the in situ symbionts of
   all three species. Although these structures have been identified in
   cultured symbionts, they have never been described in the in situ
   symbionts. A review of the literature has revealed several instances
   where thecal vesicles were either overlooked or identified incorrectly.
   Thus the formal description of the genus Symbiodinium, which describes
   the in situ symbionts, contains information that is based on artifact
   and should be revised. A revision of the genus is suggested, and the
   true nature of these structures and their significance in the symbiotic
   association are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Mibefradil, a calcium T- and L-channel blocker developed for use in
   hypertension, was recently removed from the market after reports of
   severe drug-drug interactions. Mibefradil is known to inhibit various
   cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism, particularly CYP3A.
   However, the extent and the severity of the observed drug interactions
   in humans suggest that inhibition of additional systems important to
   drug disposition, such as the drug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp),
   may also have contributed to the severity of the mibefradil
   interactions. A polarized epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1, which does not
   express P-gp, and the derived L-MDR1 cell line, which overexpresses
   human P-gp, were used to study the effects of mibefradil on drug
   transport. A markedly greater basal-to-apical versus apical-to-basal
   transport of {[}H-3]mibefradil was seen in the L-MDR1, but not in the
   LLC-PK1 cells, suggesting that the drug is a substrate of P-gp. Using a
   human intestinal cancer-derived cell line Caco-2, which constitutively
   expresses P-gp, mibefradil was shown to be a potent inhibitor of
   P-gp-mediated digoxin transport, with an IC50 of 1.6 mu M. Additionally,
   the effect of mibefradil on CYP3A was assessed using human liver
   microsomes. Mibefradil inhibited CYP3A-mediated nifedipine oxidase
   activity with an IC50 of 0.8 mu M, and a K-i of 0.6 mu M. Thus,
   mibefradil is not only a P-gp substrate, but also a potent inhibitor of
   both P-gp and CYP3A. These data suggest that the severity of drug
   interactions seen with mibefradil use is due to the dual inhibition of
   both P-gp and CYP3A.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces compositional time Petri net (CTPN) models. A CTPN
   is a modularized time Petri net (TPN), which is composed of components
   and connectors. The paper also proposes a set of component-level
   reduction rules for TPNs, Each of these reduction rules transforms a TPN
   component to a very simple one while maintaining the net's external
   observable timing properties. Consequently, the proposed method works at
   a coarse level rather than at an individual transition level. Therefore,
   one requires significantly fewer applications to reduce the size of the
   TPN under analysis than those existing ones for TPNs. The use and
   benefits of CTPNs and reduction rules are illustrated by modeling and
   analyzing the response time of a command and control system to its
   external arriving messages.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Downy mildew, caused by Peronospora parasitica (Pers. Fr.) Fr., is one
   of the most economically important diseases of broccoli (Brassica
   oleracea L. Italica group). Previous studies have shown that resistance
   to downy mildew in broccoli is dependent on plant age with seedling
   resistance being independent of mature-plant resistance. The objectives
   of this study were to: 1) determine if valid evaluations for downy
   mildew resistance can be conducted at both the cotyledon and the three
   to four true-leaf stages on the same plants of a given broccoli entry;
   2) determine if doubled-haploid (DH) lines derived from the resistant
   hybrid `Everest' also exhibit resistance to downy mildew and if so,
   characterize the resistance phenotype(s) in these lines; and 3)
   determine if identified resistant DH lines exhibit resistance to
   isolates of P. parasitica acquired from different geographic regions of
   the United States. Twenty-three DH broccoli inbreds and two commercial
   hybrids were evaluated for reaction at different developmental stages to
   infection by P, parasitica in a controlled environment. Results showed
   that broccoli plants can be evaluated for downy mildew resistance in a
   two-stage process. Inoculation at the cotyledon stage did not offer any
   cross-protection or otherwise influence the expression of reaction
   phenotype (RP) when the same plants were subsequently inoculated at the
   three to four true-leaf stage. Three different RPs to infection by P,
   parasitica were identified in DH inbreds. These were: 1) susceptibility
   at both the cotyledon stage and the true-leaf stage; 2) resistance at
   both the cotyledon and true-leaf stage; and 3) susceptibility at the
   cotyledon stage but resistance at the true-leaf stage. There was no
   effect of two pathogenic isolates from different geographic regions on
   RP of DH broccoli inbreds. Selection of plant resistance to downy mildew
   at the cotyledon stage will effectively identify plants with high levels
   of resistance at subsequent developmental stages.}},

   applications, such as die-face design, arise in manufacturing where
   surfaces must be constructed visible to a given direction. In this paper
   we present a family of swept surfaces with built-in visibility. In
   particular, methods are laid our to build translational, rotational and
   spined sweeps visible to a given direction by sweeping monotone section
   curves. In these methods, minimal limitations are imposed besides those
   needed to avoid surface singularities. To increase modeling flexibility,
   the methods are extended to sweeps with distinct end sections and
   nonuniform scaling functions. {[}S1087-1357(00)00103-9].}},

Abstract = {{Differentiation therapy for neoplastic diseases has potential for
   supplementing existing treatment modalities but its implementation has
   been slow. One of the reasons is the lack of full understanding of the
   complexities of cellular pathways through which signals for
   differentiation lead to cell maturation. This was: addressed in this
   study using HL60 cells, a well-established model of differentiation of
   neoplastic cells. SE 203580 and SE 202190, specific inhibitors of a
   signaling protein p38 MAP kinase, were found to markedly accelerate
   monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells induced by low concentrations of
   1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25D(3)). Surprisingly, inhibition of p38
   activity resulted in sustained enhancement of p38 phosphorylation and of
   its in vitro activity in the absence of the inhibitor, indicating
   up-regulation of the upstream components of the p38 pathway. In
   addition, SE 203580 or SE 202190 treatment of HL60 cells resulted in a
   prolonged activation of the JNK and, to a lesser extent, the ERK
   pathways, The data are consistent with the hypothesis that in HL60 cells
   an interruption of a negative feedback loop from a p38 target activates
   a common regulator of multiple MAPK pathways. The possibility also
   exists that JNK and/or ERK pathways amplify a differentiation signal
   provided by 1,25D(3). (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{In Experiment 1, different Vacuum pressures (30, 50, 70 and 90 mm Hg)
   were used to aspirate 4156 bovine follicles in vitro, to assess their
   effect on flow rate and the recovery, morphology and blastocyst
   formation of the recovered oocytes. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were
   classified according to the morphology of the cumulus cells. Data were
   analyzed using Chi Square analysis. Overall recovery rate declined as
   the aspiration pressure increased above 50 mm Hg (P<0.05). The recovery
   rate of Grade I oocytes decreased significantly (P<0.05) as the vacuum
   pressure increased with a corresponding increase in the number of
   denuded oocytes recovered (P<0.05). The blastocyst yield, expressed as a
   percentage of recovered COCs decreased significantly as the aspiration
   pressure increased beyond 50 mm Hg (P<0.05). In Experiment 2, the
   holding media (hepes- or bicarbonate-buffered TCM 199) and holding time
   (1 h or 5 h) did not affect the blastocyst formation of the oocytes
   (P>0.05). In Experiment 3, it was found that individual culture of the
   oocyte during fertilization or culture had a detrimental effect on the
   oocytes blastocyst formation (8.8\% to 16\% blastocyst yield on Day 8)
   when compared to control (31.3\%). In Experiment 4, groups of 5, 10 and
   25 oocytes were compared with singly cultured oocytes. There were no
   significant differences (P<0.05) in the blastocyst formation rate among
   groups of 5, 10, or 25 oocytes, but there was a significant difference
   between oocytes processed in groups and those processed individually. In
   Experiment 5, when groups of 10 oocytes were cultured in different drop
   sizes, there was no significant difference in cleavage rates between
   oocytes cultured in 100 mu L (85.0\%, n = 280) and in 10 mu L (86.8\%, n
   = 280) of media, but culture in 50 mu L (79.3\%, n = 280) resulted in
   cleavage rates significantly lower (P<0.05) than culture in 10 mu L
   drops. There was no significant difference in the blastocyst formation.
   However there was a significant difference (P<0.05) in cell numbers of
   Day 8 blastocysts, with oocytes cultured in 100 mu L drops having
   significantly lower cell counts than oocytes cultured in 50 or 10 mu L
   drops. (C) 2000 by Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the correlation expected between the phylogenetic relatedness
   of two taxa and their net ecological similarity a measure of the overall
   phylogenetic relatedness of a community of interacting organisms can be
   used to investigate the contemporary ecological processes that structure
   community composition. I describe two indices that use the number of
   nodes that separate taxa on a phylogeny as a measure of their
   phylogenetic relatedness. As an example of the use of these indices in
   community analysis, I compared the mean observed net relatedness of
   trees (greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter at breast height) in each
   of 28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest with the net
   relatedness expected if species were drawn randomly from the species
   pool (of the 324 species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I
   assembled from published sources. I found that the species in plots were
   more phylogenetically related than expected by chance, a result that was
   insensitive to various modifications to the basic methodology. I
   tentatively infer that variation in habitat among plots causes
   ecologically more similar species to co-occur within plots. Finally, I
   suggest a range of applications for phylogenetic relatedness measures in
   community analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Soil and leaf samples and the growth of 5 to 10-year-old ash and
   sycamore stands (artificial and natural regeneration) were analysed at
   different forest sites in Bavaria. The various multritional conditions
   and the growth efficiency of young ashes and sycamores serve to describe
   the critical values for the nutritional ranges with greater precision.
   This was possible by evaluating the nutrient supply of the sites, the
   nutritional status of the leaves with and without deficiency symptoms,
   and by characterising the growth and the vitality of the trees. Both
   tree species have a high demand for Ca, Mg and P. The nutrient supply
   clearly depends on the nutrient content of the soil with respect to
   exchangeable base cations, and for the ash to citric-acid-soluble P. The
   height growth was mainly determined by the N status of the leaves, which
   is superior where the biologically active top soils are rich in base
   cations. The ash and sycamore stands exhibited visible symptoms of N, P,
   K and Mg deficiency at the respective sites. Visible symptoms of Ca
   deficiency were not observed. However, ash and sycamore probably
   experienced latent Ca deficiency in very acid soils poor in base

Abstract = {{The tremendous changes in China's development philosophy and regional
   economics during the last two decades have carved out selectively new
   locations of development across the nation. While politicians heatedly
   debate the acceptable levels of regional inequality, most scholarly
   studies focus on broad aggregate trends of inequality among provinces
   and groups of provinces, and pay little attention to identifying and
   conceptualizing sources and major agents of spatial change. This paper
   aims at revealing detailed spatial ramifications of the reforms, and at
   understanding the impacts of the state, local agents, and foreign
   investors on regional development. To this effect, we conduce a
   disaggregated and empirical study of Jiangsu, a coastal province
   experiencing dramatic economic and spatial restructuring. We show that
   local agents which favor rural industrial enterprises accelerated nea
   growth in selected rural areas, in contrast to slower growth of older
   cities and state-owned enterprises, resulting in a ner decline of
   intercounty inequality. But the coalescence of state policy, local
   agents, and foreign investment has widened the historical gap between
   northern and southern Jiangsu, and is likely to accelerate intercounty
   inequality in the future. Our study demonstrates the utility of the
   ``developments from above, below and outside{''} framework for analyzing
   key forces of regional growth in socialist transitional economies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Thimerosal is an important preservative in vaccines and
   ophthalmologic preparations. The substance is known to be a type IV
   sensitizing agent. High sensitization rates were observed in
   contact-allergic patients and in health care workers who had been
   exposed to thimerosal-preserved vaccines. There is evidence for the
   involvement of the glutathione system in the metabolism of thimerosal or
   its decomposition products (organomercury alkyl compounds). Thus
   detoxification by polymorphically expressed glutathione S-transferases
   such as GSTT1 and GSTM1 might have a protective effect against
   sensitization by these substances. Methods: To address this question, a
   case control study was conducted, including 91 Central European
   individuals with a positive patch-test reaction to thimerosal. This
   population was compared with 169 healthy controls and additionally with
   114 individuals affected by an allergy against para-substituted aryl
   compounds. The latter population was included in order to test whether
   possible associations were due to substance-specific effects, or were a
   general feature connected with type IV immunological diseases.
   Homozygous deletions of GSTT1 and GSTM1 were determined by polymerase
   chain reaction. Results: Glutathione S-transferase M1 deficiency was
   significantly more frequent among patients sensitized to thimerosal
   (65.9\%, P = 0.013) compared with the healthy control group (49.1\%) and
   the ``para-compound{''} group (48\%, P = 0.034). Glutathione
   S-transferase T1 deficiency in the thimerosal/mercury group (19.8\%) was
   barely elevated versus healthy controls (16.0\%) and the
   ``para-compound{''} group (14.0\%). The combined deletion
   (GSTT1-/GSTM1-) was markedly more frequent among thimerosal-sensitized
   patients than in healthy controls (17.6\% vs. 6.5\%, P = 0.0093) and in
   the ``para-compound{''} group (17.6\% vs. 6.1\%; P = 0.014), revealing a
   synergistic effect of these enzyme deficiencies (healthy controls vs.
   thimerosal GSTM1 negative individuals, OR = 2.0 {[}CI = 1.2-3.4],
   GSTT1-, OR = 1.2 {[}CI = 0.70-2.1], GSTM1/T1-, OR = 3.1 {[}CI =
   1.4-6.5]). Conclusions: Since the glutathione-dependent system was
   repeatedly shown to be involved in the metabolism of thimerosal
   decomposition products, the observed association may be of functional
   relevance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: follow-up after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm
   repair (EAR) generally consists of serial diameter measurements. A size
   change after EAR, however, is the consequence of alterations of the
   excluded aneurysm sac volume.
   Objective: to assess the agreement between diameter measurements and
   volume measurements after endovascular aneurysm repair.
   Patients and methods: from 53 consecutive patients scheduled for EAR,
   follow-up of at least 6 months was available in 35 patients. CTA was
   performed on all patients at discharge, at 6 months and yearly
   thereafter. The resulting 113 datasets were processed on a workstation
   in a blinded and random older. Maximal aneurysm diameter (DMAX) was
   measured along the central lumen line. Total aneurysm volume was
   measured by manual segmentation. All measurements of an individual
   patient were compared with each other, resulting in 149 comparisons. The
   significance of individual size changes was classified based on the 95\%
   confidence limits of the intra-observer variability, using
   difference-of-means analysis. DMAX changes were compared to volume
   changes.
   Results: in 37\% of the comparisons, discordance was found between DMAX
   and volume measurements. A decrease in aneurysm size was missed using
   DMAX in 14\% of cases and an increase in 19\% of cases.
   Conclusion: aneurysm size changes after EAR are not noticed using
   maximal diameter measurements in over one-third of cases.}},

Abstract = {{We used estimates of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr and smolt
   density, estimated in three tributaries of the West River, Vermont,
   U.S.A., to determine (i) if smolt recruitment is density dependent or
   independent of parr density, (ii) if the proportion of parr migrating as
   smolts and cohort survival differ among tributaries, and (iii) the
   effect of parr maturity on smolt production and recruitment variability.
   We found that parr to smolt recruitment was best described with a linear
   function providing no evidence for density dependence in the recruitment
   dynamics of parr and smolts at the tributary scale. The proportion of
   age-1 parr recruiting to age-2 smolts did not systematically differ
   among tributaries or years (overall mean +/- 95\% CL: 18 +/- 11\%, range
   = 9-37\%), and mean age-1 to age-2 survival ranged less than twofold
   among tributaries (27-46\%) and was independent of cohort density.
   Survival of age-1 mature (39\%) and immature (33\%) parr was similar,
   but probability of smolting for mature parr (0.21) was threefold less
   than for immature parr (0.76). Quantifying smolt recruitment pathways
   involving parr maturation helped elucidate the population-level effect
   of parr maturation on smolt production and recruitment variability.}},

Abstract = {{We explored whether teacher feedback modified children's preferences and
   perceptions of a target child with behavior problems. First- and
   second-grade children (M age = 7.8 years) viewed a videotape of a target
   actor presented as having a liked, average, or disliked reputation. A
   second videotape depicted a teacher's verbal responses to the target's
   behavior as (a) positive, (b) neutral-salient, or (c) corrective. Bath
   salience and valence of teacher feedback were assessed. Main effects of
   feedback and reputation indicated that feedback had at least minimal
   effects at each level of the target's reputation. Teacher feedback is
   discussed with respect to its effects on perceptions of behavior versus
   affective responses toward behavior-problem children. A significant
   interaction showed that when combined with a liked reputation, positive
   and neutral-salient feedback conditions increased the salience and
   positive evaluation of the target child, thus illustrating the
   importance of considering nonevaluative teacher attention in combination

Abstract = {{Fibrosing alveolitis (FA) is characterized by persistent inflammation
   and elevated production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),
   interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist

   IL-1ra gene (IL-1RN) and position -308 in the TNF-alpha gene (TNF-A) are
   overrepresented in other chronic inflammatory disease populations. We
   have tested the hypothesis that predisposition to FA may also be
   influenced by these polymorphisms by genotyping 88 cases and matched
   controls from England and 61 cases and 103 unmatched controls from
   Italy. The rarer allele for IL-1RN and TNF-A was designated allele 2 in
   each case. For IL-1RN allele 2, in the English group, the relative odds
   of FA were increased in homozygous subjects by an odds ratio (OR) of
   10.2 (95\% confidence intervals {[}CI], 1.26 to 81.4; p = 0.03) and for
   carriers by an OR of 1.85 (95\% CI, 0.94 to 3.63; p = 0.075). In the

   (OR 2.40; 95\% CI, 1.26 to 4.60; p = 0.008). Carriage of TNF-A allele 2

   allele 2 and TN F-A (-308) allele 2 confer increased risk of developing
   FA and, therefore, that unopposed IL-1 beta and/or excessive TNF-alpha
   may play a pathophysiologic role in this condition.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To determine the role of radiographic assessment in patients
   who under:went an adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding (ALCB) for the
   treatment of morbid obesity and to evaluate the frequency and type of
   postoperative complications.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 1995 to March 1998, 98 consecutive
   patients (18 men, 80 women; mean age, 39 years; age range, 22-62 years)
   with morbid obesity (mean body weight 132 kg; mean body mass index, 47.1
   kg/m(2)) underwent ALGB. In all patients, fluoroscopy was performed
   postoperatively to confirm band position and to exclude perforation and
   at 6-8 weeks later to measure and adjust the stoma between the pouch and
   stomach for optimal weight loss. All patients underwent another
   examination 12 months postoperatively, whereas patients with
   unsatisfactory weight loss or patients suspected of having complications
   were examined earlier and on several occasions.
   RESULTS: Port puncture was feasible in all cases, and stomal adjustments
   could easily be repeated. Absolute (ie, total) weight loss after 1 year
   ranged from 8.8\% to 39.2\% (mean, 18.3\%). Twenty patients showed
   unsatisfactory weight loss. No early complications occurred. Fate
   complications occurred in 34 patients and included,product 1 dilatation
   (concentric or eccentric with posterior slippage), eccentric band
   herniation, band penetration, disconnection, axial pouch herniation, and
   port-site infection.
   CONCLUSION: ALCB is an effective method in the treatment of morbid
   obesity. Radiographic assessments are crucial in the management of
   weight loss and detection postoperative complications.}},

Abstract = {{The phrase ``Washington Consensus{''}has become a familiar term in
   development policy circles in recent years, but,it is now used in
   several different senses, causing a great deal of confusion In :this
   article the author distinguishes between his original meaning as a
   summary of the lowest common denominator of policy advice addressed by
   the Washington-based institutions (including the World Bank) and
   subsequent use of the term to signify; neoliberal or
   market-fundamentalist policies. He argues that the latter policies could
   not be expected to provide an effective framework for combatting poverty
   but that the original advice is still broadly valid. The article
   discusses alternative ways of addressing the confusion. It argues that
   any policy manifesto designed to eliminate poverty needs to go beyond
   the original version but concludes by cautioning that no consensus an a
   wider agenda currently exists.}},

Abstract = {{A stepped care approach would link different patient needs to

   treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN), discussion of a stepped care
   approach is speculative. Because AN typically demands expert and

   inapplicable for these patients. A stepped care approach poses

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Acute exposure to a novel environment, such as an open field, generally
   results in a prolactin surge, while several days of exposure to the open
   field is often characterized by a decline in prolactin. As exposure to
   the open field is a psychological stressor, altering the animal's
   interpretation of the event should alter prolactin levels. In the
   present study, juvenile male and female rats were habituated to the open
   field for 1 or 5 days prior to testing in the chamber alone or with a
   same-sex conspecific. Levels of prolactin were measured across all rats,
   and play (pins) was recorded for animals tested with a conspecific. Five
   days of habituation to the chamber resulted in lower levels of prolactin
   and more play than 1 day of habituation. Across both conditions of
   habituation, testing with a conspecific caused lower levels of prolactin
   than testing alone. In addition, play and prolactin were negatively
   correlated. The presence of a conspecific in a stressful situation may
   have reduced stress by altering the animal's negative interpretation of
   the open field. Further, as the intensity of the social interaction
   increased (more play), prolactin levels decreased. (C) 2000 Academic

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the hypothesis that there is substantial use of a
   practitioner of alternative/complementary medicine by patients
   traditionally considered to be underserved.
   Design: Cross-sectional, self-administered survey study.
   Settings: Three university hospital-affiliated general ambulatory
   clinics serving patients of different socioeconomic status and racial
   origin.
   Subjects: Five hundred and thirty-six (93\% of those attending)
   consecutive clinic attendees.
   Outcome Measures: Past use and desired future use of one or more
   practitioners of five modalities of alternative/complementary medicine
   and willingness to pay for these modalities out-of-pocket.
   Results: Past usage and desired future usage of one or more
   practitioners of alternative/complementary medicine was comparable at
   the three clinic sites despite wide differences in socioeconomic status
   and willingness/ability to pay out-of-pocket for these services.
   Multivariable analyses revealed lower self-rated health status and
   female gender (both p < 0.006) but not income, race, age or education as
   independent, significant predictors of use of a practitioner of
   alternative/complementary medicine.
   Conclusion: Usage of alternative/complementary medicine is not confined
   to any well-circumscribed socioeconomic group and is common in patients
   often considered to be underserved. Self-assessed lower health status is
   significantly and independently associated with use of a practitioner of

Abstract = {{A novel self-initiating multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-based
   direction-finding (DF) and polarization-estimation algorithm in
   spatio-polarizational beamspace is herein presented for an arbitrarily
   spaced array of identically oriented electromagnetic vector sensors. An
   electromagnetic vector sensor, already commercially available, is
   composed of six colocated, but diversely polarized, antennas distinctly
   measuring all six electromagnetic-held components of a multisource
   incident wave field. This proposed algorithm: 1) exploits the incident
   sources' polarization diversity; 2) decouples the estimation of the
   sources' arrival angles from the estimation of the sources' polarization
   parameters; 3) uses ESPRIT on pairs of vector sensors to self-generate
   coarse estimates of the arrival angles to start off its MUSIC-based
   iterative search without any a priori information on the incident
   sources' parameters; 4) estimate the sources' polarization states; and
   5) automatically pairs the z-axis direction-cosine estimates with the
   y-axis direction-cosine estimates and with the polarization estimates.
   Monte Carlo simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{In 1989 we published a critical review of cancer epidemiology in
   petroleum workers, which included as a component of the review a
   meta-analysis by cancer site. Subsequently we have completed three
   additional reviews and meta-analyses on cell-type-specific leukemias
   (1995), multiple myeloma (1997), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2000). The
   objective of the present investigation was to update our 1989 review and
   mete-analysis of nonlymphohematopoietic cancers in cohort studies of
   petroleum workers. Included in the present investigation were cohort
   studies of petroleum workers from the United States, the United Kingdom,
   Canada, Australia, Finland, Sweden, and Italy. Individual studies were
   reviewed with regard to specific cancer sites. For each cancer of
   interest, risk ratios from the individual studies were presented. In
   some studies, subcohort analyses stratified by exposure parameters such
   as length of employment, job category, and hire year were also reported.
   These subcohort or stratified analyses were reviewed and the results of
   these analyses were taken into consideration in our interpretation. In
   addition to the qualitative review of individual studies, a
   meta-analysis was performed to combine data from individual cohort
   studies of petroleum workers. The primary purpose of the mete-analysis
   was to provide a summary measure of risk for each cancer site. Based on
   a review and meta-analyses of cohort studies of more than 350,000
   petroleum workers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada,
   Australia, Finland, Sweden, and Italy, we concluded that there was no
   increased mortality from digestive cancers (stomach, large intestine,
   liver, or pancreas), lung cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, or
   brain cancer. The summary standardized mortality ratios for these cancer
   sites were all below unity. Significant increases of melanoma mortality
   were reported in some small groups of refinery workers in the United
   Kingdom and upstream operation workers in Canada, but no responsible
   agent(s) had been identified. The observed mortality from skin cancer in
   all other studies was similar to the expected. In particular, no
   significant increase of skin cancer mortality was reported in any of the
   U.S. studies. Elevated mortality from prostate cancer was noted in
   short-term workers at a U.S. refinery and in shortterm workers employed
   in certain crafts at U.S. crude oil operations. However, the absence of
   an upward trend by length of employment in these workers argued against
   an association between exposure to petroleum products and prostate
   cancer. For all petroleum workers as a whole, mortality from prostate
   cancer was as expected. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Taking the Fushun Basin as an example, this paper analyses the relation
   of coal metamorphism to the normal geothermal field and additional

   paleogeothermal field and corresponding coal metamorphism of the Basin.
   The 2-D simulation of the superimposition of coal geothermal
   metamorphism and telemagmatic thermal metamorphism has also been
   preliminarily accomplished. The computer simulation results have shown
   that the coal, formed in the Paleogene, in the Fushun Basin had an
   R-o,R-m value of only 0.3 +/- and the intrusion of diabase sills in the
   Later Oligocene increased the coal rank to the low metamorphism stage
   (R-o,R-m = 0.5-1.0\%). It has been found in the simulation, that the way
   in which the thermal flow in basement rock is controlled using the
   results from paleogeothermal structural analysis is obviously better
   than the method in which a value is artificially selected for the
   thermal flow according to the basin basement. In addition, the former
   can be used to study the variation of R-o,R-m itself, so it is also
   better than the method to perform back-confining analysis using R-o,R-m
   values. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   CD4(+)CD45RA(-)CCR5(+) cells (Th1 cells) through the relapse and
   remission phases in comparison to HC, while MS-W showed a significant
   increase of CD4(+)CD45RO(+)CD62L(-) cells (Th1 cells) only at the

   (Th2 cells) in comparison to HC. On the other hand, a selective increase
   of CD4(+)CD45RO(+)CD30(+) cells was found in hyperIgEaemic myelitis. The
   percentage of mature NK cells (CD3(-)CD16(+)CD56(+) cells) as well as
   double negative T cells (CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) cells) decreased
   significantly in HAM/TSP in comparison to HC. Our findings therefore

Abstract = {{GH/growth factors have been shown to increase angiotensin type 1
   receptor expression. In the present study we determined the cis-acting
   regulatory region controlling GH-induced transcription of the human
   type-1 angiotensin receptor (hAT(1)). In human proximal tubule cells
   transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter
   plasmid under the control of the hAT(1) promoter, GH induced CAT
   activity. Serial deletions of the hAT(1) promoter region indicated that
   an area between -314 bp and -70 bp upstream of the 5'-end of the cDNA
   sequence was essential for this activation to occur. Although sequence
   analysis identified putative multiple nuclear protein binding sites in
   this region, we determined that a 12 bp sequence (5'-CAGAGGGAGGAG-3',
   GAGA box) located between -161 bp and -149 bp was important for
   GH-mediated activation. Using mobility shift assays we demonstrated
   increased DNA binding activity to the labeled GAGA box in nuclear
   extracts treated with GH, suggesting this sequence is a GH response
   element. Southwestern analysis identified an 18 kDa GAGA box-binding
   protein (GAGA-BP). GH-induced activity of the GAGA-BP occurred within
   2.5 min and reached a maximum at 5 min. Activation did not require de
   novo protein synthesis. Removal of the GAGA box abolished GH-induced
   transcription as well as basal transcription of the hAT(1) gene.
   Additional studies demonstrated that epidermal growth factor,
   platelet-derived growth factor and insulin activate the GAGA-BP,
   suggesting these growth factors can also regulate the transcription of
   the hAT1 gene through the GAGA box. Our data show that the GAGA-BP acts
   as a trans-acting factor binding to the cis-acting regulatory element in
   the hAT(1) promoter, which is necessary for the basal and growth
   factor(s)-mediated transcriptional activation of the hAT(1) gene.}},

Abstract = {{The population pharmacokinetics of tobramycin was investigated in a
   group of 327 adult hospitalized patients receiving once-daily
   administration of tobramycin at a dose of 7 mg kg(-1). The patients had
   an average age of 57 +/- 18 y and an average weight of 65 +/- 14 kg; 153
   of the patients were female. Data, comprised of 575 serum
   concentrations, were analyzed using a nonlinear mixed-effect model
   (NONMEM) with a first-order conditional estimation method and were best
   described with a one-compartment model. The patient covariates including
   body weight, gender, age and creatinine clearance (CLCR) were added in a
   stepwise fashion to identify their potential influences on tobramycin
   pharmacokinetics. Results showed that tobramycin clearance (CL) was
   linearly correlated with CLCR (proportionality constant: 0.066 +/- 0.002
   x CLCR (ml min(-1))) and the volume of distribution (V-d) was linearly
   related to body weight (proportionality constant: 0.40 +/- 0.024 x body
   weight (1 kg(-1))). The mean population estimates for CL and V-d were
   4.53 1 h(-1) and 27.3 1, respectively. The half-life of tobramycin was
   estimated to be 4.2 h. The inter-individual variability in CL and V-d
   were 37.0 and 28.5\%, respectively. The residual error was 1.2 mg 1(-1).
   Based on the results, optimal dosing intervals for renal impaired
   patients were calculated and were comparable with the intervals derived
   from the previous established nomogram. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Density functional theory with the combined Becke 3-LYP
   exchange-correlation energy function using the 6-31G{*} basis set was
   applied to study the structures and vibrational IR spectra of amino-oxo
   and amino-hydroxy forms of guanine, The calculated force fields were
   corrected by scaling the forces fields over a convenient set of local
   internal coordinates, The scale factors were determined by least-squares
   fitting of the theoretical frequencies to the experimental ones of the
   two parent molecules, isocytosine and imidazole, The predicted
   vibrational frequencies of two tautomers of guanine were compared with
   the available observed matrix-isolated IR spectra with mean deviations
   of about 6.6 cm(-1) for amino-oxo form and 6.0 cm(-1) for amino-hydroxy
   form, The results made it possible to give reliable assignments of the
   IR spectra of isolated guanine, This study shows that the scaled density
   functional force field approach enables us to give a good interpretation
   of vibrational spectra of large molecules through the transferability of
   scale factors.}},

Abstract = {{Since amphiphilic drugs are known to interact with biomembranes, we
   investigated Local vessel damage and thrombosis which might be brought
   about by intravenous dosing using chlorpromazine (CPZ) as a
   representative compound. CPZ-induced hemolysis was suppressed by an
   increase in sucrose concentration in the medium, characterizing this
   hemolysis to be colloid-osmotic lysis, which includes the enhancement of
   membrane phospholipid fluidity and consequent small pore formation in
   the membranes. This was supported by the observation that hemolysis by
   filipin, not featuring the stage of small pore formation, was not
   affected by sucrose. {[}C-14]Glucose-entrapping liposomes were degraded
   by CPZ, and this degradation was enhanced by an increase in the
   intravesicle glucose concentration. These results indicated that the
   compound could induce colloid-osmotic lysis in erythrocytes and
   artificial membrane vesicles, CPZ also injured cultured porcine aortic
   endothelial cells (PAEC), as evidenced by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
   leakage, This injury was also suppressed by increase in sucrose
   concentration in the medium, suggesting that colloid-osmotic lysis again
   occurred. When rats were intravenously injected with CPZ, local
   endothelial cell (EC) injury and associated thrombus formation were
   observed, suggesting that CPZ's action was also evident in vivo. To our
   knowledge, this is the first finding which suggests that an
   intravenously dosed amphiphilic drug can injure local ECs based on a
   colloid-osmotic lysis mechanism leading to thrombosis.}},

   genomic pel clone, Southern hybridization, with the 4.1-kb genomic pel
   clone or 2.13-kb hph-B cassette as probes, detected integration of pel

   (immunoblot) analysis with antibodies against Cg-14 PL detected a single
   pi, secreted by L-2.5 at a molecular mass of 41.5 kDa, whereas the PL of
   C, gloeosporioides had a molecular mass of 39 kDa. When pi, activity was
   measured 4 days after inoculation in pectolytic enzyme-inducing media
   (PEIM), transformed isolates Cm-PL-3 and Cm-PL-10 showed additive PL
   activity relative to both Cg-14 and L-2.5. Transformed isolates also
   showed additive maceration capabilities on avocado pericarp relative to
   the wild-type C, magna alone, but did not reach the maceration ability
   of C, gloeosporioides, However, more severe maceration and damping off
   developed in watermelon seedlings inoculated with the transformed
   isolates compared with the two wild-type isolates, which showed no
   symptom development on these seedlings during the same period. Results
   clearly show the contribution of a single pel to the pathogenic
   abilities of C, magna and suggest that PL, is a pathogenicity factor
   required for the penetration and colonization of Colletotrichum species.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration and molecular weight of hyaluronan (HA) in the
   synovial fluid of the hip joint were determined in 13 patients (aged
   62.8 +/- 9.4 years) who had undergone prior total hip arthroplasty(THA),
   23 patients (aged 65.0 +/- 8.2 years) with osteoarthritis of the hip
   joint (OA), and 13 patients (aged 40.2 +/- 2.7 years) with idiopathic
   osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ION). A sample of synovial fluid was
   obtained during revision THA because of loosening of the total hip
   prosthesis for the THA group, and during the first replacement surgery
   or osteotomy for the OA and ION groups. The concentration of HA in the
   synovial fluid was 0.64 +/- 0.42 mg/ml in the THA group, 1.07 +/- 0.28
   mg/ml in the OA group, and 1.30 +/- 0.56 mg/ml in the ION group. The
   concentration of HA in the synovial fluid of the THA patients was
   significantly lower than that of the OA and ION patients (P = 0.0156 vs
   OA, P = 0.003 vs ION). The molecular weight of HA was 309 +/- 88.3 x
   10(4) Da in the THA group, 377 +/- 201 x 10(4) Da in the OA group, and
   240 +/- 148 x 10(4) Da in the ION group; these values do not differ
   significantly (P = 0.259 vs OA, P = 0.174 vs ION). Among the THA
   patients, there was no relation between the concentration of HA and the
   age of the patient, length of time since the first operation, or type of
   prosthesis fixation; there was also no relation between the molecular
   weight of HA and each of these factors. These results suggest that a
   pseudo-synovial membrane is regenerated after THA, and that it produces
   HA of the same molecular weight as that in patients with OA and ION,
   although in smaller quantities.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on neurons of the rat dorsolateral
   septal nucleus (DLSN) were examined by intracellular and whole-cell
   patch-clamp recording techniques. An outward current was induced by 5-HT
   (1-100 mu M) in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC50 for 5-HT was
   4.8 mu M. Also, 8-OH-DPAT (10-100 mu M) produced the outward current an
   EC50 of 17 mu M. Amplitudes of the outward currents produced by 5-HT
   (100 mu M) and 8-OH-DPAT (100 mu M) were 117 +/- 4 (n = 6) and 58 +/- 8
   pA (n = 6), respectively. Fluvoxamine (200 nM), a specific serotonin
   re-uptake inhibitor, enhanced the 5-HT (1 mu M) - induced outward
   current: the EC50 for 5-HT was 0.5 mu M in the presence of fluvoxamine
   (200 nM). L-694 247 (100 mu M) and CP 93129 (100 mu M) also produced
   outward currents with amplitudes of 33 +/- 3 (n = 4) and 18 +/- 5 pA (n
   = 4), respectively in DLSN neurons. DOI (100 mu M) and RS 67333 (100 mu
   M) did not produce outward currents. NAN 190 shifted, in a parallel
   manner, the concentration-response relationship of 5-HT to the right.
   The Lineweaver-Burk plot of the concentration-response curve showed that
   NAN-190 depressed the 5-HT-induced current in a competitive manner. The
   current-voltage relationship indicates that the 5-HT-induced current
   reversed polarity at a potential close to the equilibrium potential of
   K+. Ba2+ (100 mu M-1 mM) partially depressed the outward current
   produced by 5-HT. These results suggest that 5-HT induces multiple K+
   currents via 5-HT1A receptors in DLSN neurons. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

   grow epitaxial YSZ films was shifted toward the lower region. Therefore,
   epitaxial growth of YSZ films could be achieved at a very low pressure
   of 2 x 10(-4) Pa compared with the known O-2 pressure region used for
   epitaxial growth, The roughness of surfaces was very low, within

Abstract = {{Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is thought to play an important role as a
   modulator of levels of IL-10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), To
   address the therapeutic effects of rlL-12 in an endogenous sepsis model
   in mice, which closely mimics the pathophysiology of septicaemia in man,
   the effects of rIL-12 on the levels of cytokines such as IL-10 and
   IFN-gamma, and on the survival of septic mice infected with Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa PAO1 were examined. First, in the endogenous sepsis model,
   the serum levels of IFN-gamma and IL-10 remained normal until days 8 and
   10, respectively, when significant rises were seen, On day 11, levels of
   IFN-gamma returned to normal, but levels of IL-10 remained high,
   Interestingly, the IL-10 serum level reached a maximum 2 days later than
   the IFN-gamma serum level. In the light of these results, septic mice
   were given 0.01 mu g of rIL-12 by intraperitoneal injection and the
   serum levels of endogenous cytokines and the survival times were
   examined. Mire treated with rIL-12 on days 5, 6 and 7 after infection
   survived significantly longer than control septic mice treated with
   saline only, Treatment with rlL-12 also led to a significant increase of
   the serum IFN-gamma level and a decrease of the serum IL-10 level on day
   11. These results suggest that rIL-12 exerts therapeutic activity
   against endogenous sepsis caused by P. aeruginosa by stimulating
   proinflammatory responses and attenuating anti-inflammatory responses.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study is to evaluate bioenergy supply
   potentials, land use changes, and CO2 emissions in the world, using a
   global land use and energy model (GLUE) including land use competitions
   and overall biomass flows. Through a set of simulations, the following
   results were obtained: (1) Supply potentials of energy crops produced
   from surplus arable lands will be strongly affected by food supply and
   demand parameters in the future, such as animal food demand per capita.
   (2) The policy option, i.e. the world, large-scale introduction of
   modern fuelwood by felling and planting in existing forest, will cause
   drastic reduction of the mature forest area but will cause little
   reduction of the accumulated CO2 emissions coming from both energy and
   forest sectors. One reason for this is that the additional CO2 emissions
   owing to the land use conversion from the mature forest to the growing
   forest will partly cancel out the CO2 reduction owing to the fuel
   substitution from fossil fuels to fuelwood. (3) When energy recovery of
   paper scrap is given priority to material recycling, bioenergy will
   substitute partly for fossil fuels; however the decrease in recycled
   paper scrap will cause an increase in roundwood felling demand. Hence,
   the results will be similar to those of (2). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{To investigate the influence of antibiotics used as feed additives on
   the immune response to erysipelas live vaccine, the pig inoculation test
   was applied. Avilamycin, osytetracycline quaternary salt, enramycin,
   virginiamycin and tylosin phosphate were selected as test antibiotics.
   Five experimental feeds containing each antibiotic at the highest
   concentration permitted for feed additives in Japan, and the basal diet
   lacking antibiotics were examined. Twenty-nine pigs were divided into
   six groups. At first all the groups were fed with the antibiotic-free
   basal diet for 7 days, and then each group received the experimental
   feeds. On the 14th day after feeding with test feeds all the pigs,
   except for one control pig in each group, were immunized with the
   vaccine and all the pigs were then challenge-exposed to a virulent
   strain of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae 14 days after vaccination. The
   clinical response was observed every day for 14 days. In all the groups,
   most of the vaccinated pigs did not develop any clinical signs of acute
   erysipelas after the challenge exposure, whereas non-vaccinated control
   pigs died or showed severe generalized erythema with profound depression
   and anorexia. No differences in the protection against the challenge
   exposure were observed among the groups. Therefore, the present results
   suggest that these selected antibiotics would not interfere with the

Abstract = {{In non-destructive dimensional measurement of high aspect ratio micro

   information due to the lack of observation light. Again, conventional

   large. Furthermore, the AFM, though popular among the semiconductor
   industry, is also limited in terms of dimensional measurement, because
   its system is usually designed for planar samples. Thus, we have
   developed a new sensor-integrated micro resonating cantilever probe and
   a new dimensional measurement machine, which allows the probe's vertical
   access to microstructures in a sample. The new probe is made of tungsten
   carbide super hard alloy and possesses design flexibility according to
   its intended application. Validity of the system is confirmed through
   the measurement experiment of EDM drilled and chemically etched micro

Title = {{Evolution of long planetary wave packets in a continuously stratified

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2111-2123}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent TOPEX/Poseidon observations show an enhanced (weakened) westward
   propagation of long planetary Rossby waves at extratropics (Tropics) and
   they usually propagate faster in the western basin than in the eastern
   basin in all major oceans. The evolution of a long planetary wave packet
   in a continuously stratified ocean in response to the various forcing
   functions is analytically investigated using the wave packet theory. For
   a wave packet with a large vertical scale, the stratification variation
   and the vertical shear of the mean zonal current act in concert, causing
   the wave packet to propagate directly against the mean zonal
   current-called the counter-Doppler-shift (CDS) effect. It is found that
   the speed ratio between the zonal baroclinic zonal current and the
   classic theory increases with the latitude, the eastward zonal current,
   and the local vertical scale.
   The vertical scale of a wave packet plays a critical role in the
   propagation, the structure, and spatial-scale development of a wave
   packet. It is found that the beta and stratification effects increase
   (decrease) the vertical spatial scale of a vertically westward
   (eastward) Lilted wave packet. For a wave packet with a large (small)
   vertical scale, the vertical spatial scale increases (decreases) when
   the wave packet is lilted westward in an eastward zonal current. The
   structural change could effectively separate the extratropic oceanic
   responses into two kinds of systems with two different vertical scales
   and strengthen the CDS effect, enhancing speeds in western ocean basins.
   Several analytical solutions for the wave packet are also obtained.
   The author concludes that the evolution of a wave packet with a large
   vertical scale in a zonal current may account for all major features of
   the sea surface height anomalies observed in the TOPEX/Poseidon data.
   The possible forcing functions are the atmospheric wind forcing at the
   sea surface and the ocean topographic forcing on the seafloor, but not
   the surface cooling or heating.}},

Abstract = {{The contents of mall-bound hydroxycinnamic acids and their dimers were
   compared between elongated and non-elongated cells of
   suspension-cultured Mentha, Wall-bound peroxidase activity was also
   investigated. The main hydroxycinnamic acids esterified to these two
   kinds of cell walls were ferulic and caffeic acids. Eleven
   dehydrodicaffeic acid isomers and six dehydrodiferulic acid isomers
   formed through C-C and C-O-C coupling processes, were detected by GC-MS
   from the extracts released from the walls of non-elongated cells. On the
   other hand, only four dehydrodicaffeic acid isomers and three
   dehydrodiferulic acid isomers were found in the walls of elongated
   cells. Amounts of monomers of ferulic and caffeic acids and their
   5,5'-dehydrodimers in non-elongated cell walls were about ten and twenty
   times higher, respectively, than those in the elongated cell walls.
   There was a close correlation between the amount of 5,5'-dehydrodimers
   and activity of wall-bound peroxidase in non-elongated and elongated
   cells. The level of 5,5'-dehydrodimers accumulated at a higher rate than
   monomers in non-elongated cell walls. These results suggest that the
   dimerization of ester-linked ferulic and caffeic acids by peroxidase and
   the increase in amounts of their 5,5'-dehydrodimers are important
   factors in the cessation of cell elongation in Mentha suspension
   culture.}},

Abstract = {{Photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties of
   poly(2-methoxy-5-nonyloxy-p-phenylene vinylene) (MN-PPV), one of the
   soluble poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivatives is synthesized
   through a dehydrochlorination reaction. The EL peak at 576 nm with a low
   threshold voltage in the monolayer structure is independent of the bias.
   When the Ale layer is very thin (less than or equal to 10 nm) in the
   bilayer structure of ITO/MN-PPV/Alq(3)/Al, the intrinsic emission only
   from MN-PPV is obtained. When the Alq(3) layer gets thicker (similar to
   30 nm), the intrinsic emission from Alq(3) at 520 nm will increase
   gradually with the bias, while emission from MN-PPV decreases. Based on
   the energy levels and field-assisted tunneling at the surface, we
   consider that this color-variable EL is ascribed to the redistribution
   of the electric field on the devices and field-assisted charge crossing
   through the triangular energy barrier at high biases. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Multicast is the ability to transmit information from a single source
   node to multiple selected destination nodes in a network. Current trends
   in networking applications indicate that there will be an increasing
   demand in future networks for multicast communication. Efficient
   multicast communication is critical to the network performance. Banyan
   networks have been proposed for use in ATM high-speed communications
   networks and have been used for the interconnection of processors in
   scalable parallel computers. This paper addresses the performance issues
   of supporting multicast communication in banyan networks. Previous work
   on the performance of banyan networks has been primarily for the
   networks which can support only one-to-one communication (i.e., unicast
   banyan networks). We present here an analytical model for the
   performance of banyan networks which support multicast communication
   (i.e., multicast banyan networks). Our model yields a set of equations
   that can be solved for the throughput of the network. We show that the
   throughput of a multicast banyan network is generally higher than that
   of a unicast banyan network. In particular, we obtain that the
   throughput of a multicast banyan network is Theta(N), where N is the
   size of the network, compared with Theta(N/log N) for a unicast banyan
   network. In addition to throughput, we also derive formulas for another
   important performance metric, packet loss probability, for multicast
   banyan networks in this paper. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The approximate synthesis of a planar four-bar linkage for rigid-body
   guidance consists in finding all the relevant parameters of the linkage
   that produces a set of poses of its coupler link that best approximate a
   large number of prescribed poses. By ``large{''} we mean here a number
   larger than that allowing for an exact matching of poses. Moreover, the
   approximation error in the synthesis equations is measured in the
   least-square sense, the problem thus giving rise to an optimization
   problem. Each solution of this problem, producing a local minimum of the
   approximation error yields one dyad, the combination of any pail. of
   these then yielding one linkage. While purely numerical methods yield
   only isolated local minima, we apply here the contour method in an
   attempt to finding all the real stationary points of the problem at
   hand. First, symbolic computations are used to derive the underlying
   normal equations of the optimization problem. The normal equations are
   then reduced to a set of two bivariate polynomial equations. These two
   equations are plotted in the plane of the two unknown variables, the two
   contours that they define in this plane being then overlapped. In
   principle, their intersections provide, visually, all the teal solutions
   of the problem under study as well as the numerical conditioning of
   these solutions. Finally, numerical techniques are used to refine a
   solution to the desired accuracy. An example is included to illustrate
   the method. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Breast carcinoma is relatively uncommon in younger women and
   whether or not young age at diagnosis is an adverse prognostic factor in
   this disease has been controversial. Our aim in this report is to
   determine whether the histopathologic features and outcome in young and
   old are different, and whether age is a prognostic factor for relapse.
   Methods: A retrospective study of consecutive 281 stage I or II breast
   carcinoma patients who had modified radical mastectomy was carried out.
   The patients with a median follow-up period of 45 months were divided
   two groups according to their ages. The histopathological features and
   survival of Group 1 and Group 2 were compared with each other.
   Univariate and multivariate prognostic factor analysis for relapse were
   carried out.
   Results: The patients in Group 1 (younger than 35 years of age) had the
   worst histopathological features related to the prognosis than those in
   Group 2 and the difference between the two groups was statistically
   significant. Whereas the rates of 5-year overall survival were 65\% in
   Group 1 and 98\% in Group 2 (P < 0.05), the rates of 5-year relapse-free
   survival were 40\% and 80\%, respectively (P < 0.05). In univariate
   analysis of all patients, pathologic tumour size, pathologic axillary
   status, number of metastatic lymph nodes, pathologic stage, age,
   lymphatic vascular invasion were statistically significant factors
   associated with relapse. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that number
   of metastatic nodes (risk ratio RR:4.3 in more than three nodes) and age
   (RR:3.6 in Group 1) were the most important independent prognostic
   factors for relapse. In the patients without axillary involvement, both
   of univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that pathologic tumour
   size (RR:5.1 in pT(2)) and age (RR:4 in Group 1) were the independent
   prognosticators for relapse.
   Conclusions: Young patients with breast cancer had the worst
   histopathological features and the worst survival than their older
   counterparts. Age was an independent significant prognostic factor for
   relapse. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Hilar cancers carry a dismal prognosis. Palliation of obstructive
   jaundice in patients with hilar cancer can be achieved by either
   surgical or nonsurgical means. Selection of the appropriate palliative
   measures is a challenging problem. Segmental bilioenteric anastomosis
   procedures were performed on 19 patients with hilar cancer. Seventeen of
   the bypasses were done to the segment III duct, known as the ligamentum
   teres approach, and two bypasses were to the segment V duct. Five
   patients, who had already been stented percutaneously or endoscopically,
   were operated on after the stents were clogged and a duodenal
   obstruction ensued. There were two postoperative deaths (10.5\%) and
   four postoperative complications (21\%). All of the 17 surviving
   patients experienced improvement in the level of jaundice
   postoperatively and the levels of serum total and direct bilirubin
   decreased by 78.9\% and 84.2\%, respectively. Two patients developed
   late cholangitis before death and were treated by external biliary
   drainage; one developed duodenal obstruction and was treated by
   gastrointestinal anastomosis. The mean length of hospital stay was 15.2
   days. Mean survival was 8.2 months and the mean period of well-being was
   7.8 months. Median survival was 7 months and median period of well being
   was 7 months. Three patients are still alive at 8, 8, and 24 months.
   These data suggest that the ligamentum teres approach offers effective
   palliation for patients with unresectable hilar cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Healthy People 2000 (HP2000) is a national agenda of health
   promotion and disease prevention objectives, with specific health
   behavior goals in 22 priority areas. The U.S. Army Health Risk Appraisal
   (HRA) is a self-administered health-habits survey, inquiring about
   tobacco and alcohol use, physical activity, nutrition, and
   safety-related practices, given to more than 400,000 active-duty U.S.
   Army soldiers in die 1990s. This article compares the health behaviors
   of U.S. Army soldiers, as measured by the HRA, with the HP2000
   objectives.
   Methods: We compared cross-sectional analyses of self-reported health
   behaviors of active-duty Army personnel responding to HRA questionnaires
   in 1991 (n=78,256) and in 1997-1998 (n=59,771) with corresponding HP2000
   objectives. We also calculated longitudinal changes for personnel who
   took more than one HRA (n=86,393).
   Results: By 1991-1998, the Army exceeded HP2000 physical fitness goals
   by at least 50\% and also exceeded goals fur eating high-fiber foods and
   using bicycle helmets. The Army did not meet goals for nutrition,
   tobacco use, and seat-belt use.
   Conclusions: The Army has made good progress toward the HP2000 goals.
   However, improvement is needed to meet the tobacco, nutrition, and

   components during roasting. However, roasting for 10 min at 220 degrees
   C caused a significant decrease (P < 0.05) not only in molecular species
   containing more than four double bonds, but also in the amount of diene
   and triene species present in TAGs (with a few exceptions). These
   results suggest that no significant changes in molecular species or
   fatty acid distribution of TAGs would occur within 25 min of roasting at
   180 degrees C, ensuring that a good-quality product would be attained.

Abstract = {{Although it is well accepted that bone tissue metabolism is regulated by
   external mechani cal loads, it remains unclear to what load-induced
   physical signals bone cells respond. In this study, a novel
   computer-controlled stretch device and parallel plate flow chamber were
   employed to investigate cytosolic calcium (Ca-i(2+)) mobilization in
   response to a range of dynamic substrate strain levels (0.1-10 percent,
   1 Hz) and oscillating puidJIow (2 N/m(2), 1 Hz). In addition, we
   quantified the effect of dynamic substrate strain and oscillating fluid
   flow on the expression of mRNA for the bone matrix protein osteopontin
   (OPN). Our data demonstrate that continuum strain levels observed for
   routine physical activities (<0.5 percent) do not induce Ca-i(2+)
   responses in osteoblastic cells in vitro. However, there was a
   significant increase in the number of responding cells at larger strain
   levels. Moreover, we found no change in osteopontin mRNA level in
   response to 0.5 percent strain at 1 Hz. In contrast, oscillating fluid
   flow predicted to occur in the lacunar-canalicular system due to routine
   physical activities (2 N/m2, 1 Hz) caused significant increases in both
   Ca-i(2+) and OPN mRNA. These data suggest that, relative to fluid flow,
   substrate deformation may play less of a role in bone cell
   mechanotransduction associated with bone adaptation to routine loads.

Abstract = {{To explore the structure and function of the aspirations of Latino boys
   and girls, theoretical and methodological approaches of future
   orientation and possible selves were integrated. In interviews with 38
   students, the content, priority, optimism, internality, temporal
   extension, and specificity of students' hoped-for selves were assessed.
   Students showed high educational and occupational aspirations and high
   rates of optimism and internal control across five domains of hoped-for
   selves. The occupational domain was a greater priority for boys than for
   girls. Girls reported more constrained views of their futures than did
   boys. Students reported global fears in the domain of personal
   well-being, and limited specificity within occupational and educational
   domains. The combination of limited specificity and global fears might
   result in an imbalance between hoped-for and feared selves. The
   imbalance might have negative repercussions for students' future
   academic motivation and highlights the possible need for further
   research and possible educational reform.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to introduce the results of thumb and
   finger reconstruction using transplantation of the big toe wraparound
   flap combined with the second toe or the second and third toes. Between
   August of 1981 and December of 1998, in a series of 64 cases involving
   58 patients with digitless hands, either (1) the thumb and index fingers
   were reconstructed by transplantation of a big toe wraparound flap
   combined with the adjacent second toe harvested from the ipsilateral
   foot; or (2) the thumb, index, and long fingers were reconstructed by
   transplantation of an ipsilateral big toe wraparound flap combined with
   the adjacent second and third toes. The phalanx of the new thumb was
   usually an iliac block. The success rate of this series was 92.2
   percent. At long-term followup, the average static 2-point
   discrimination was less than 10 mm. The distance between the tip of the
   new thumb and the new index finger ranged from 6 to 10 cm (average, 8
   cm). opposition action was nimble and forceful. The patients could lift
   a 6- to 12-kg weight with their reconstructed digits. All patients were
   satisfied with their new hands and were able to use them in their daily
   activities. The transplants for reconstructing the thumb and fingers are
   harvested from the same foot in a procedure known as one-foot donation.
   Function of the bilateral digitless hand can be recovered with this
   procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of
   quantities such as amplitude, duration, area, size index, number of
   peaks and irregularity coefficient applied to the classification of
   motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in neuromuscular disorders.
   Methods: We have analyzed 215 potentials recorded from 20 neurogenic
   patients and 240 potentials recorded from 14 myogenic patients. The
   statistical values for each parameter and correlation coefficients
   between parameters have been analyzed.
   Results: The percentages of potentials unclassified by amplitude,
   duration, area/amplitude, area and size index were 31, 34, 28, 15 and
   15\%, respectively. Neither the number of phases and turns nor the
   irregularity coefficient may be used for the differentiation between
   neuro- and myogenic groups. There was also a set of MUAPs that were not
   properly classified by any of the above parameters. Among the
   unclassified potentials there were more potentials from myogenic cases.
   These unclassified myogenic MUAPs were predominantly irregular, whereas
   most of the unclassified neurogenic MUAPs were simple. In neurogenic
   cases, parameters describing the size of the potential (amplitude,
   duration, area) were not significantly correlated with those describing
   the shape (number of phases and turns), whereas in myogenic cases some
   correlation between these parameters was significant.
   Conclusions: MUAP quantities, due to the different correlation between
   them in myogenic and neurogenic disorders, have different sensitivities.
   Indexes were more sensitive than simple parameters and were also much
   more effective in the evaluation of atypical potentials. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Heterochrony, evolutionary changes in rate or timing of development
   producing parallelism between ontogeny and phylogeny, is viewed as the
   most common type of evolutionary change in development. Alternative
   hypotheses such as heterotopy, evolutionary change in the spatial
   patterning of development, are rarely entertained. We examine the
   evidence for heterochrony and heterotopy in the evolution of body shape
   in two clades of piranhas. One of these is the sole case of heterochrony
   previously reported in the group; the others were previously interpreted
   as cases of heterotopy. To compare ontogenies of shape, we computed
   ontogenetic trajectories of shape by multivariate regression of
   geometric shape variables (i.e., partial warp scores and shape
   coordinates) on centroid size. Rates of development relative to
   developmental age and angles between the trajectories were compared
   statistically. We found a significant difference in developmental rate
   between species of Serrasalmus, suggesting that heterochrony is a
   partial explanation for the evolution of body shape, but we also found a
   significant difference between their ontogenetic transformations; the
   direction of the difference between them suggests that heterotopy also
   plays a role in this group. In Pygocentrus we found no difference in
   developmental rate among species, but we did find a difference in the
   ontogenies, suggesting that heterotopy, but not heterochrony, is the
   developmental basis for shape diversification in this group. The
   prevalence of heterotopy as a source of evolutionary novelty remains
   largely unexplored and will not become clear until the search for
   developmental explanations looks beyond heterochrony.}},

Title = {{Is there social transmission of feather pecking in groups of laying hen
   chicks?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Feather pecking is an abnormal behaviour where laying hens peck the
   feathers of conspecifics, damaging the plumage or even injuring the
   skin. If it occurs in a flock, more and more birds show it within a
   short period of time. A possible mechanism is social transmission.
   Several studies have shown that laying hen chicks, Gallus gallus
   domesticus, are able to modify their own behaviour when observing the
   behaviour of other chicks, for example, when feeding and foraging. As
   there is good experimental evidence that feather pecking originates from
   foraging behaviour, we hypothesized that feather pecking could also be
   socially transmitted. To test this, we reared 16 groups of 30 chicks.
   After week 4, the birds were regrouped into 16 groups of 20 chicks into
   each of which we introduced either five chicks that showed high
   frequencies of feather pecking or, as controls, five chicks that had not
   developed feather pecking. We then determined the feather-pecking rate
   and the frequency of ft,raging, dustbathing, feeding, drinking,
   preening, moving, standing and resting of all birds in a group. Data
   from the introduced birds were analysed separately and excluded from the
   group data. Chicks in groups with introduced feather-pecking chicks had
   a significantly higher feather-pecking sate than chicks in the control
   groups. In addition, birds in groups with introduced feather peckers
   showed significantly lower foraging frequencies than those in the
   control groups, although the housing conditions were identical and there
   were no differences in either the number or the quality of the stimuli
   relevant to foraging behaviour. The study therefore suggests that
   feather pecking is socially transmitted in groups of laying hen chicks.

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL HEMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{885-894}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Erythropoiesis is positively regulated by stem cell factor,
   interleukin 3, and erythropoietin, which synergize to allow the
   production of hemoglobinized red blood cells from erythroid progenitors.
   In contrast, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and
   transforming growth factor beta(1), (TGF-beta(1)) are powerful
   inhibitors of erythropoiesis. Interferon gamma and alpha act principally
   by inducing apoptosis, The aim of this study was to elucidate the
   mechanisms by which TGF-beta(1) inhibits erythropoiesis.
   Materials and methods. We used an in vitro serum-free system of human
   red blood cell production, From a virtually pure population of CD36(+)
   erythroid progenitors, stem cell factor, interleukin 3, and
   erythropoietin allowed massive proliferation (x300) and promoted
   terminal red blood cell differentiation.
   Results. We show here that TGF-beta(1) (2 ng/mL) inhibited the growth of
   CD36(+) cells by 15-fold. TGF-beta(1) markedly accelerated and increased
   erythroid differentiation as assessed by hemoglobin and glycophorin
   expression, Furthermore, May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining and
   ultrastructural analysis revealed that TGF-beta(1) induced full
   differentiation toward normal enucleated red cells even in the absence
   of macrophages, This acceleration of erythroid differentiation did not
   modify the pattern of hemoglobin chains expression from adult or fetal
   erythroid progenitors. Analysis of apoptosis, cell cycle and Ki-67
   expression showed that TGF-beta(1) inhibited cell proliferation by
   decreasing the cycle of immature erythroid cells and accelerating
   maturation toward orthochromatic normoblasts that are not in cycle.
   Conclusion. We showed that TGF-beta(1) is a paradoxical inhibitor of
   erythropoiesis that acts by blocking proliferation and accelerating
   differentiation of erythroid progenitors, (C) 2000 International Society

Abstract = {{We have identified a retinoic acid response element (RARE) within a

   (RA) treatment. Mutations within the sequence TTTTCTG, located 2 bp
   downstream of the RARE, posteriorized transgene activity. However, the
   onset of transgene expression and its response to RA were
   indistinguishable from wild type. While the TTTTCTG motif resembles a
   CDX binding site, human CDX1 protein did not interact with this element
   in vitro. Three additional regions were also shown to control transgene
   expression in neurectoderm, establishing that multiple elements
   constitute the Hoxd4 neural enhancer. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science ireland

Abstract = {{We analyze four ASCA X-ray observations of the Wolf-Rayet binary system
   WR 140 obtained between 1993 and 1997 by making use of hydrodynamic
   colliding wind (CW) shock models. The analysis shows that the CW shock
   models are able to accurately reproduce the X-ray spectra at different
   orbital phases using mass-loss and orbital parameters that are within
   the ranges allowed by the uncertainties. However, some adjustment in the
   currently accepted values of the semimajor axis and time of periastron
   passage may eventually be required. Models that allow for different
   electron and ion temperatures provide better fits to the data. Extra
   absorption is inferred from CW shock models above that expected from the
   winds and interstellar medium, the origin of which is not yet known. We
   also report the serendipitous discovery of hot plasma at temperatures in
   excess of similar to 2 keV and X-ray emission lines in spectra extracted
   from the diffuse Cygnus superbubble background in the vicinity of WR
   140.}},

Title = {{Tumor stroma as the main source of inhibin production in ovarian
   epithelial tumors}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{PROBLEM: Elevated serum inhibin levels have been found in ovarian cancer
   patients; however, the source of the elevated inhibin is uncertain.
   Previous studies of activin in human ovarian cancer suggest that activin
   may promote the growth of the tumor. The aims of this study were to
   examine the source of elevated inhibin from ovarian epithelial tumors
   (OETs) and to preliminarily investigate the role of the
   gonadotropin-inhibin/activin relationship in the development of OET.
   METHOD OF STUDY: The protein and mRNA expression of alpha and beta A
   subunits of inhibin/activin were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
   and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 120
   OETs, including 30 benign cystadenomas, 30 borderline tumors, and 60
   carcinomas. Stromal and epithelial cells were microdissected from 23
   OETs to further examine the expression of alpha and beta A subunits by
   RT-PCR. Dimeric inhibin A and activin A production were measured by
   using the two-site ELISA from three OET cell lines in culture under
   treatment of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone
   (LH).
   RESULTS: beta A subunit was expressed in the epithelial component of
   100\% of the cystadenomas, in 80\% of borderline tumors, and in 75\% of
   the carcinomas, but not in tumor stroma. Inhibin alpha expression was
   not found in the epithelium of all OETs studied, but focal inhibin alpha
   immunoreactivity was seen in the tumor stroma (mainly luteinized stromal
   cells) in the majority of cases. Dimeric activin A was produced by all
   of the three OET cell lines with a 1.5-1.9-fold increment after FSH
   stimulation. However, activin A production was not augmented by LH
   treatment. No inhibin A was produced by the three OET cell lines with or
   without gonadotropin stimulation,
   CONCLUSIONS: The stroma of OET is the major source in the production of
   inhibin alpha (monomer). Dimeric inhibin A production may be the result
   of combined efforts of the tumor stroma (alpha subunit) and epithelium
   (beta A subunit). Cellular, compartmental expression of inhibin and
   activin subunits may play a role in the development of OET, although the
   mechanism remains undefined. The unopposed activin A production
   stimulated by FSH in OET cell lines suggests that activin production may
   represent one of the cellular mechanisms of growth promotion by FSH.}},

Abstract = {{The specific pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)

   PAC(1)-R-s (which does not contain either the ``hip{''} or ``hop{''}
   cassette), and another form, PAC(1)-R-hop (which contains the ``hop{''}
   cassette). We also have applied an innovative molecular histochemical
   technique, in situ reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR), and determined that these two splice isoforms are colocalized
   in the neuroepithelial from the primitive streak stage. (C) 2000

   difference scheme to all levels of grids, and then starting from the
   coarsest grid, solve the discretized equation with an ADI method at each
   grid level, with the solution from the previous grid level as the
   initial guess. The multilevel procedure stops as the ADI finishes its
   iterations on the finest grid. Analytical and experimental results show
   that the proposed method is highly accurate and efficient while

Abstract = {{Controlled potential electrolysis with the dropping mercury electrode,
   in which a small volume (typically 0.5 to 1.0 mL) of the electrolyzed
   solution is stirred by the falling off drops, enables coulometric and
   mechanistic studies unaffected by products formed at the electrode
   surface. Such electrodes allow establishment of equipotential conditions
   over the whole electrode surface. Electrolysis is practically complete
   within 8 to 12 h. When electrolysis products or stable intermediates are
   electroactive, recording of current-voltage curves during the
   electrolysis allows detection and following of relatively slow chemical
   reactions (with hall-lives of the order of tens of minutes) which might
   affect results of preparative electrolyses and would otherwise remained
   undetected. Reactions of electrogenerated species with limited lifetimes
   can be followed in this way which would be difficult to detect and
   follow by other techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorinated alumina catalysts obtained by reacting a gamma-alumina with
   hydrogen chloride show high initial activity in isobutane-butene
   alkylation. After a few hours on stream however, the conversion decays
   due to self poisoning. This work attempts at improving the catalyst
   lifetime by modifying the Al2O3-Cl catalyst. Best results were obtained
   by adding small amounts of alkaline cations to the alumina before
   chlorination. For a particular cation, lithium or sodium, the
   improvement in catalyst lifetime depends on the chlorination procedure
   (pre-treatment with CCl4, final temperature). Addition of cations also
   enhances the selectivity for octanes, mainly by decreasing the amount of
   cracked products. Degradation of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane was found to
   occur over the Al2O3-Cl catalysts at 273 K. The influence of cation
   addition on this process was examined. Thus, the occurrence of
   dimethylhexanes and cracked or heavier alkanes among alkylation products
   may be explained by the degradation of 2,2,4-TMP. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   the analysis of this kind of sample is the relatively high intrinsic
   sampling variance which restricts the attainable overall analytical

Title = {{Nuclear phenomena during conjugation of Heliophrya erhardi (ciliata,
   suctoria). II. The orientation of postmeiotic and metagamic division
   spindles is organized by the cytoskeleton}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{211-228}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Whereas the spindles of the meiotic divisions appear in a random
   orientation within the co-conjugants of Heliophrya erhardi, the spindles
   of the postmeiotic and metagamic nuclei show a distinct fixed position
   within the conjugational bridge and in the cytoplasm of each partner's
   cell body In postmeiotic divisions, the spindle orientation results in a
   different functional determination of the division products. For their
   later fate, mostly a concentration gradient of ``cytoplasmic factors{''}
   was postulated {[}29]. But above all, the question arises, what is the
   mechanistic basis for the spindle orientation?
   We followed the sequential steps of conjugation by time lapse
   microcinematography and by EM-observation. The result of the maturation
   divisions are 12 to 24 haploid nuclei {[}11] from which only one nucleus
   reaching the conjugational bridge survives and starts the postmeiotic
   division. The position of this gonal nucleus is fixed on the left
   marginal side of the bridge by a dense microfilament network surrounding
   the nucleus in a cage-like manner and anchoring it to the epiplasmic
   septum separating the co-conjugants. During the following division, the
   spindle extends parallel to the septum fixed by cytoskeletal elements
   during anaphasic spindle elongation. Additionally, at metaphase, a basal
   body appearing at the spindle pole proximal to the pellicle nucleates
   microtubules (MTs) which penetrate the microfilamentous cage and contact
   also the nuclear envelope. The fixation of the spindle axis parallel to
   the separating septum by cytoskeletal elements guarantees the
   positioning of one pronucleus as the future stationary nucleus on the
   left side, and the other - the presumptive migratory nucleus - on the
   right side of the conjugational bridge.
   After exchange of the migratory nuclei and subsequent fusion with
   formation of the diploid synkaryon, one metagamic division follows
   immediately in each partner cell. From meta- to telophase the spindles
   exhibit in most cases a strict central-peripheral orientation, at which
   the anterior daughter nucleus (oriented to the cell's center) becomes
   the macronucleus anlage, while the posterior nucleus condenses to the
   micronucleus. Interestingly, this spindle orientation is held in
   position by aster-like organized microtubules radiating out to a
   microfilamentous cap situated at the anterior spindle pole. As an
   organizing center for this cytoskeletal structure again a basal body is
   responsible, which is localized between nuclear envelope and cap region
   from meta- to telophase.
   It is evident, that in both divisions, the orientation of the spindle
   axis and consequently the fate of the division products depends
   completely on the existence of a cytoskeletal organizing structure,
   which is comparable to the asters of mitotic spindles in some higher
   eukaryotes.}},

Abstract = {{A scrutiny of the matrix elements within the f shell of the
   spin-other-orbit interaction H-soo has revealed many unexpected
   proportionalities that go beyond an application of the Wigner-Eckart
   theorem to Racah's groups G(2) and SO(7). An explanation is sought by
   using the automorphisms of SO(8) by means of which the states of the
   atomic f shell are generated by two alternative SO(7) bases of the type
   (1/2 1/2 1/2)(4), each augmented by two parity labels. Transformations
   between the bases can be made by reversing the relative phases of the
   two angular-momentum states 3 and 0 that comprise Luny one of the four
   SO(7) spinors. The method is exemplified by the single-electron
   spin-orbit interaction H-so, for which a component can be found that is
   invariant under the phase reversal. The extension from H-so to H-soo is
   described for the component z(6) of H-soo, and several examples drawn

Abstract = {{In this paper, it has been shown that the existence of anaerobic
   pathways under aerobic: conditions is not always due to poor
   environmental conditions. There are two sources of lactate in cultured
   cells, oxidative glutaminolysis and reductive glycolysis. Only the
   latter is measured in the CR ratio as a value more negative than the
   oxycaloric equivalent for the relevant catabolic substrate. The validity
   of the value for the CR ratio can be determined by Mayer's enthalpy
   balance method. Highly exothermic ratios are no reflection of
   thermodynamic efficiency but in many cases indicate the need for ATP not
   supplied by, or insufficiently available from, oxidative
   phosphorylation. For other types of cell grown in culture, a highly
   exothermic CR ratio is due to the fact that there are not sufficient
   quantities of the appropriate anabolic precursors in the culture medium.
   Then, biosynthetic precursors must be constructed from substrates using
   the catabolic pathways and this leads to the reduction of pyruvate in
   order to conserve NAD(+). An on-line measurement of the CR ratio would
   monitor cell growth and could be used to control fed-batch cultures. (C)

Abstract = {{Substance P (SP) is the major endogenous ligand for neurokinin 1 (NK1)
   receptors and, together with acetylcholine, has an important role in
   motivated behaviors involving the limbic shell and motor core of the
   nucleus accumbens (NAc). To determine the functional sites for SP
   activation of NK-1 receptors and potential interactions with cholinergic
   neurons in these regions, the authors examined the electron microscopic
   immunocytochemical localization either of antisera against the NK1
   receptor or of the NK1 receptor and either 1) SP or 2) the vesicular
   acetylcholine transporter (VAchT) in rat NAc. In both the NAc shell and
   core, NK1 receptor labeling was localized mainly to somatic and
   dendritic plasma membranes and nearby endosomal organelles in aspiny
   neurons. In sections through the ventromedial shell that were processed
   for NK1/SP labeling, 46\% of the NK1-immunoreactive dendrites; (n = 603
   dendrites) showed symmetric or appositional contacts with SP-containing
   terminals. These terminals and several others that formed symmetric
   synapses also occasionally were immunoreactive for NK1 receptors.
   Analysis of the shell region for NK1/VAchT labeling showed that 61\% of
   the total immunoreactive dendrites (n = 534 dendrites) contained NK1
   receptors without VAchT, 29\% contained both products, and 10\%
   contained VAchT only. Many of the labeled somata and dendrites also
   received synaptic contact from VAchT-containing terminals. These
   findings suggest that, in the NAc, NK1 receptors are recycled through
   endosomal compartments and play a role in modulating mainly the
   postsynaptic responses, but also the presynaptic release, of SP and/or
   inhibitory neurotransmitters onto aspiny interneurons, some of which are
   cholinergic. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   to active transcurrent faults and suffers current compression along its
   western side and transpression along its eastern-southeastern side. It
   must be considered as a compressional relay zone along a splay of the

Abstract = {{Background The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs newer than diuretics
   and beta-blockers has not been established. We compared the effects of
   the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine once daily with the diuretic
   combination co-amilozide on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in
   high-risk patients with hypertension.
   Methods We did a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial in Europe
   and Israel in 6321 patients aged 55-80 years with hypertension (blood
   pressure greater than or equal to 150/95 mm Hg, or greater than or equal
   to 160 mm Hg systolic). Patients had at least one additional
   cardiovascular risk factor. We randomly assigned patients nifedipine 30
   mg in a long-acting gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS) formulation
   (n=3157), or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mu g plus amiloride
   2.5 mg; n=3164). Dose titration was by dose doubling, and addition of
   atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg. The primary outcome was
   cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke.
   Analysis was done by intention to treat.
   Findings Primary outcomes occurred in 200 (6.3\%) patients in the
   nifedipine group and in 182 (5.8\%) in the co-amilozide group (18.2 vs
   16.5 events per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.10 {[}95\% CI
   0.91-1.34], p=0.35). Overall mean blood pressure fell from 173/99 mm Hg
   (SD 14/8) to 138/82 mm Hg (12/7). There was an 8\% excess of withdrawals
   from the nifedipine group because of peripheral oedema (725 vs 518,
   p<0.0001), but serious adverse events were more frequent in the
   co-amilozide group (880 vs 796, p=0.02). Deaths were mainly non-vascular
   (nifedipine 176 vs co-amilozide 172; p=0.81). 80\% of the primary events
   occurred in patients receiving randomised treatment (157 nifedipine, 147
   co-amilozide, difference 0.33\% {[}-0.7 to 1.4]).
   Interpretation Nifedipine once daily and co-amilozide were equally
   effective in preventing overall cardiovascular or cerebrovascular
   complications. The choice of drug can be decided by tolerability and
   blood-pressure response rather than long-term safety or efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient protocol for in vitro propagation of Thamnocalamus
   spathiflorus (Trin.) Munro, an evergreen temperate bamboo, through
   multiple shoot formation from zygotic embryos excised from germinating
   seeds, as well as from nodal explants taken from a 2-year-old plant has
   been developed. Multiple shoot formation was standardized in both the
   cases on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 5.0 mu M
   6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1.0 mu M indole-3-butyric acid (IBA).
   Clumps of three to four microshoots when transferred to plant growth
   regulator-free medium following 14 days' initial culture on medium
   supplemented with 150.0 mu M IBA, resulted in 100\% rooting with five to
   12 roots per rooted plant. Then, 18 months following the transfer of in
   vitro propagated plants into earthen pots containing soil and growth
   under outdoor conditions, gas and water vapour exchange rates were
   measured at different light levels (0, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 mu
   mol(-2) s(-1)), and compared with seedlings of the same age. Light
   optima for photosynthesis were recorded similar to 1000 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1) in in vitro propagated plants as well as seedlings. Water use
   efficiency increased with increase in the light intensity up to 1000 mu
   mol m(-2) s(-1) and then decreased subsequently at higher light
   intensities. Stomatal conductance and transpiration also increased with
   the increase in light intensity up to 2000 mu mol(-2) s(-1).
   Intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) and the ratio of intercellular CO2
   concentration to ambient CO2 (C-i/C-a) decreased with the increase in
   light intensity up to 500 mu mol(-2) s(-1) and then reached nearly
   constant levels at higher light intensities. The results show that in
   vitro propagated and hardened plants of T. spathiflorus are
   morphologically as well as functionally comparable to seed raised plants
   of the same age, within the limits of this study. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{DNA gyrase is the only enzyme known to negatively supercoli DNA. The
   enzyme is a heterotetramer of A(2)B(2) subunit composition. Alignment of
   the primary sequence of gyrase B (GyrB) from various species shows that
   they can be grouped into two classes. The GyrB of Gram-negative
   eubacteria has a stretch of about 165 amino acids in the C-terminal
   half, which is lacking in other GyrB subunits and type II
   topoisomerases. In Escherichia coli, no function has so far been
   attributed to this stretch. In this study, we have tried to assess the
   function of this region both in vivo and in vitro. A deletant (GyrB
   Delta 160) lacking this region is non-functional in vivo. The holoenzyme
   reconstituted from gyrase A (GyrA) and GyrB Delta 160 shows reduced but
   detectable supercoliing and quinolone-induced cleavage activity in
   vitro. GyrB Delta 160 retains its ability to bind to GyrA and
   novobiocin. However, when reconstituted with GyrA, the deletant shows
   greatly impaired DNA binding. The intrinsic ATPase activity of the GyrB
   Delta 160 is comparable to that of wild type GyrB, but this activity is
   not stimulated by DNA. These studies indicate that the additional
   stretch present in GyrB is essential for the DNA binding ability off.

Abstract = {{Although seminolipid has long been suspected to play an essential role
   in spermatogenesis because of its uniquely abundant and temporally
   regulated expression in the spermatocytes, direct experimental evidence
   has been lacking. We have tested the hypothesis by examining the testis
   of the UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase-deficient mouse,
   which is incapable of synthesizing seminolipid. Spermatogenesis in
   homozygous affected males is arrested at the late pachytene stage and
   the spermatogenic cells degenerate through the apoptotic process. This
   stage closely follows the phase of rapid seminolipid synthesis in the
   wild-type mouse. These observations not only provide the first
   experimental evidence that seminolipid is indeed essential for normal
   spermatogenesis but also support the broader concept that cell surface
   glycolipids are important in cellular differentiation and cell-to-cell
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{The electrophysiological properties of parasympathetic preganglionic
   neurons (PGN) in L6 and S1 spinal cord slices from neonatal rats were
   studied using the patch clamp techniques. PGN were identified by
   retrograde axonal transport of a fluorescent dye (Fast Blue) injected
   intraperitoneally before the experiment. PGN in the intermediolateral
   region of the spinal cord wen divided into two classes (tonic PGN and
   phasic PGN) on the basis of firing properties during prolonged (300 ms)
   depolarizing current pulses. Tonic neurons exhibited a prolonged
   discharge (average maximum: 5.6); whereas phasic PGN fired on average
   only 1.4 spikes during depolarizing pulses. PGN were usually oval in
   shape. The mean long axis of tonic PGN (20.7+/-0.5 mu m) was
   significantly (P<0.05) larger than that of phasic PGN (16.7+/-0.3 mu m).
   Tonic and phasic PGN had similar resting membrane potentials, thresholds
   for spike activation, input resistances and action potential durations.
   The duration of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) in tonic PGN
   (200.5+/-11.9 ms) was longer than in phasic PGN (137.6+/-9.8 ms).
   4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 0.5 mu M) reduced the threshold for spike
   activation in tonic and phasic PGN. 4-AP also unmasked tonic firing in
   phasic PGN (average maximum: 5.5 spikes during 300 ms depolarizing
   current pulses) and increased firing frequency by 19\% in tonic PGN.
   These data indicate that the different discharge patterns of
   parasympathetic PGN are dependent in part on differences in the
   expression of 4-AP-sensitive K+ channels. The two types of PGN may
   provide an innervation to different targets in the pelvic viscera. (C)

Abstract = {{Intrahippocampal administration of the histamine H-1 receptor antagonist
   pyrilamine (3.2-32 mu g/side) but not the histamine H-2 receprtor
   antagonist cimetidine (1.0-10 mu g/side) increased the number of errors
   in the working memory task with a three-panel runway setup. The increase
   in working memory errors induced by intrahippocampal 32 mu g/side
   pyrilamine was significantly reduced by concurrent infusion of the
   histamine H-1 receptor agonist 2-pyridylethylamine (3.2 and 10 mu
   g/side). The cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (1.0 and 3.2 mu
   g/side) and D-cycloserine (0.32 and 1.0 mu g/side), the partial agonist
   at the glycine binding site on the NMDA receptor/channel complex,
   reduced the increase in working memory errors induced by
   intrahippocampal 32 mu g/side pyrilamine. These results suggest that the
   hippocampal histaminergic activity via histamine H-1 receptor is
   necessary for normal working memory processes and that the
   septohippocampal cholinergic activation and positive modulation of the
   NMDA receptor/channel through activation of the glycine site can
   alleviate dysfunction of hippocampal histamine H-1 receptor-mediated

Abstract = {{Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and the whole cell voltage clamp technique
   were used to investigate the function of the extracellular loop between
   the second and third transmembrane domains (TM2-TM3) of the
   gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)-R). A conserved
   arginine residue in the TM2-TM3 loop of the GABA(A)-R alpha(2) subunit
   was mutated to alanine, and the mutant alpha(2)(R274A) was co-expressed
   with wild-type beta(1) and gamma(2S) subunits in human embryonic kidney
   (HEIK) 293 cells. The GABA EC50 was increased by about 27-fold in the
   mutant receptor relative to receptors containing a wildtype alpha(2)
   subunit. Similarly, the GABA EC50 at alpha(2) (L277A)-beta(1 gamma)Y(2S)
   and alpha(2) (K279A)beta(1)gamma(2S) GABA(A)-R combinations was
   increased by 51- and 4-fold, respectively. The alpha(2)(R274A) or
   a,(L277A) mutations also reduced the maximal response of
   piperidine-4-sulfonic acid relative to GABA by converting piperidine
   4-sulfonic acid into a weak partial agonist at the GABA(A)-R. Based on
   these results, we propose that alpha(2)(Arg-274) and alpha(2)(Leu-277)

Abstract = {{The glucose oxidase gene (GO) of Aspergillus niger was cloned into the
   yeast shuttle vector YEp352 with combinations of various promoters and
   terminators, and then used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
   Expressed GO was successfully secreted into culture medium due to the
   presence of the intrinsic signal peptide of GO. Four different promoters
   fused to GO were tested: bidirectional galactose dehydrogenase 1 and 10
   (GAL1, GAL10) promoters, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD)
   promoter and an yeast hybrid ADH2-GPD promoter consisting of alcohol
   dehydrogenase II (ADH2) and GPD promoter. The intrinsic terminator of GO
   as well as the GAL7 terminator were also compared for better production
   of GO. Deletion of most of the terminating region from GO yielded only a
   slight amount of GO while the presence of either terminator greatly
   increased GO production. The GAL10 promoter produced the least amount of
   GO, GAL1 and GPD promoters were moderate. and the ADH2-GPD hybrid
   promoter was the best among all tested. However, the hybrid promoter was
   tightly regulated by the presence of an excess amount of either glucose
   or ethanol, and it appeared that 2\% glucose and 1.5\% ethanol
   supplement was the best concentration for GO production. It was possible
   to produce 260 IU ml(-1) of GO; an equivalent of 5 g l(-1), under the
   presence of 2\% glucose and 1.5\% ethanol. UV mutagenesis of a
   recombinant S. cerevisiae was also applied and it further increased the
   yield of GO to 460 IU ml(-1) under the presence of 2\% glucose and 1.5\%
   ethanol without any changes in cell growth. Corn steep liquor which is
   commonly used in bioindustry is a good alternative substrate for high
   priced glucose for the hybrid promoter and suggests a cost effective
   means for commercial mass production of GO using recombinant yeast. (C)

Abstract = {{Cerebral vasospasm is the major factor of mortality and morbidity in the
   patients who have an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
   Erythrocyte lysate (hemolysate), oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb), and bloody
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the causative agents for vasospasm.
   However, the signal transduction pathways for the action of these
   spasmogens are not clear. In this study, we examined the possible effect
   of these spasmogens on the p21Ras protein, an important factor in the
   signal cascade, in rabbit basilar artery. Hemolysate enhanced p21Ras
   precipitation over a 7-day period. The initial increase of p21Ras
   precipitation occurred after the tissues were incubated for 2 days with
   hemolysate. The peak effect of hemolysate, which was markedly increased
   compared with control (P<0.05, ANOVA), was observed on day 3. OxyHb and
   blood CSF, in contrast, failed to produce consistent or marked changes
   in p21Ras precipitation, p21Ras inhibitors FTPase inhibitor 1 and
   manumycin abolished hemolysate-induced enhancement of p21Ras
   immunoprecipitation. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, failed to
   reduce the effect of hemolysate on p21Ras. We concluded that hemolysate
   activates p21Ras in the rabbit basilar artery. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an extensively glycosylated type
   I ectoprotein anchored in the plasma membrane by a hydrophobic
   transmembrane domain. In tissue culture as well as in vivo, the
   extracellular domain of ACE is released into the culture medium by a
   regulated proteolytic cleavage. To identify the cellular proteins that
   regulate ACE processing and cleavage-secretion, ACE-bound proteins were
   purified by affinity chromatography and characterized by microsequencing
   and Western blotting. One protein was identified as ribophorin and
   another as immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), a chaperone. Metabolic
   labeling and immunoprecipitation of ACE confirmed its interaction with
   BiP. Overexpression of BiP inhibited ACE secretion, an effect
   accentuated by the expression of an enzymatically inactive mutant BiP,
   This inhibition was caused by the retention of ACE precursors by BiP in
   the endoplasmic reticulum, as revealed by immunoprecipitation and
   immunofluorescence experiments. However, treatment with a phorbol ester,
   phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, enhanced ACE secretion even from cells
   overexpressing BiP. Western blot analysis of ACE-associated proteins
   with antibodies to protein kinase C (PRC) revealed the presence of its
   specific isozymes. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate caused
   marked reduction in ACE association of selective PKC species. Thus, our
   studies have identified PKC and BiP as two proteins that directly
   interact with ACE and modulate its cell-surface expression and cleavage
   secretion.}},

Abstract = {{Recent ideas on modular localization in local quantum physics are used
   to clarify the relation between on- and off-shell quantities in particle
   physics; in particular, the relation between on-shell crossing symmetry
   and off-shell Einstein causality. Among the collateral results of this
   new non-perturbative approach are profound relations between crossing
   symmetry of particle physics and Hawking-Unruh-like thermal aspects (KMS
   property, entropy attached to horizons) of quantum matter behind causal
   horizons, aspects which hitherto were exclusively related to Killing
   horizons in curved spacetime rather than with localization aspects in
   Minkowski space particle physics. The scope of this modular framework is
   amazingly wide and ranges from providing a conceptual basis for the d =
   1 + 1 bootstrap-formfactor programme for factorizable d = 1 + 1 models
   to a decomposition theory of quantum field theories in terms of a finite
   collection of unitarily equivalent chiral conformal theories placed a
   specified relative position within a common Hilbert space (in d = 1 + 1
   a holographic relation and in higher dimensions more like a scanning).
   The new framework gives a spacetime interpretation to the Zamolodchikov
   algebra and explains its thermal aspects.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfasalazine (SSA) was investigated for its effects on phagocytic
   activity of normal human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN),
   proliferation of mononuclear cells (MNC) and cultured glomerular
   mesangiai cells. At concentrations from 25 to 100 mu M, it inhibited
   phagocytic activity of PMN and the H-3-thymidine incorporation of
   phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human MNC in a dose-dependent
   manner. At comparable concentrations, sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic
   acid, two of its major metabolites, did not show similar effects. SSA
   exhibited an inhibitory effect on both mouse and rat mesangial cells but
   at rather higher concentrations (0.5 mM). Excretion of interleukin
   (IL)-8 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PMN was also markedly
   deterred in a dose-dependent manner but excretion of IL-X by
   LPS-stimulated MNC was not interfered by SSA. Production of tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1 beta by mouse mesangial cells was
   not blocked by SSA but production of IL-4 by these cells was inhibited
   by it (>0.1 mM). Inhibition of MNC was not due directly to cytotoxic
   effect of SSA on these cells as shown by fluorescein diacetate stain.
   Collectively, SSA inhibits phagocytosis and IL-8 excretion by PMN as
   well as mitogen-stimulated MNC reaction. On the other hand, at high
   concentrations, it inhibits glomerular mesangial cells and their IL-4
   excretion but not TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta excretion. These results can
   account for minimal nephrotoxic characteristic of SSA and suggest that
   it may be helpful in the treatment of immune-mediated
   glomerulonephritis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The dimeric interface of the leucine zipper coiled coil from GCN4 has
   been used to probe the contributions of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding
   interactions to protein stability. We have determined the energetics of
   placing Ile or Asn residues at four buried positions in a two-stranded
   coiled coil. As expected, Ile is favored over Asn at these buried
   positions, but not as much as predicted by considering only the
   hydrophobic effect. It appears that interstrand hydrogen bonds form
   between the side-chains of the buried Asn residues and these contribute
   to the conformational stability of the coiled-coil peptides. However,
   these contributions are highly dependent on the locations of the Asn
   pairs. The effect of an Ile to Asn mutation is greatest at the N
   terminus of the peptide and decreases almost twofold as we move the
   substitution from the N to C-terminal heptads. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{A model study is presented to clarify the relationship between gravity
   wave properties observed in the stratosphere and the sources for the
   waves, presumed to be in the troposphere. The observations are
   balloon-borne radiosondes launched from Cocos Island in the tropical
   Indian Ocean (12 degrees S, 97 degrees E), and the analysis of these
   data is described in a companion paper {[}Vincent and Alexander, this
   issue]. The dominant time variations in the observed gravity wave
   activity are annual and quasi-biennial patterns in the zonal momentum
   flus and kinetic energy density. The background zonal winds at this site
   vary with the same periods, and these are known to be capable of causing
   dramatic variations in the observable properties of the waves even if
   the sources for the waves are constant in time. The results presented
   here clarify (1) the nature of the sources for the gravity waves
   observed in the stratosphere, (2) the limitations of the observations
   for observing the full range of gravity wave perturbations potentially
   present in the atmosphere, and (3) the role the observed waves can play
   in forcing the quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) in the zonal winds at
   this latitude. The stratospheric waves appear to originate near the
   height of the tropopause, so the source is apparently related to deep
   convection. No seasonal or interannual variations in the convection need
   be assumed to understand the observations. The waves at the tropopause
   appear to have a phase speed distribution that is narrowly confined near
   zero phase speed relative to the ground, The source is likely related to
   slowly propagating tropospheric convection and the wind near the
   tropopause. Variations observed in the stratospheric data are caused by
   both the wind shear in the stratosphere and the ability of waves with
   these characteristics to propagate vertically without severe
   dissipation, Higher phase speed waves may be present and could carry
   significant momentum flux vertically into the stratosphere and
   mesosphere but would be extremely difficult to see in these radiosonde
   data. The observed waves can contribute substantially to the descent of
   the eastward shear zones characteristic of the ``westerly{''} phase of
   the QBO in the lower stratosphere zonal winds.}},

Abstract = {{The acid-base equilibria of 2-(n-alkyl)fulleropyrrolidines and
   N-methyl-2-(n-alkyl)fulleropyrrolidines in aqueous micellar media of a
   sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant are examined experimentally and
   modeled theoretically by using ab initio 3-21G({*}) methods. The pK(a)
   values, for 2-(n-alkyl)fulleropyrrolidines and
   N-methyl-2-(n-alkyl)fulleropyrrolidines; determined both by HCl and NaOH
   titration with potentiometric detection of the end point, are equal to
   6.3 +/- 0.1 and 7.5 +/- 0.1, respectively, and are independent of the
   alkyl chain length within a range of C1 to C8, The obtained results
   indicate that the fullerene cage fused to a pyrrolidine ring increases
   the acidity of the protonated pyrrolidine nitrogen mainly due to the
   induced electronic effects and, to a smaller extent, by structural
   effects. The 3-21G({*}) estimated free energy difference, Delta E (with
   solvation corrections incorporated based on the Cramer-Truhlar SM5.4
   solvation model), between the protonated and unprotonated
   fulleropyrrolidines, and the experimental pK(a) values have been
   correlated for 37 different nitrogenous bases, A 0 < pK(a) < 4 range was
   covered with these bases which include the presently investigated
   fulleropyrrolidines. Correlation between the calculated Delta E and
   experimental pK(a) values is good (Delta E = 2.3126 pK(a) + 280.49,
   correlation coefficient is equal to 0.95) and indicates that the effect
   on pK(a) of the micellar environment, utilized in the present study for
   solubilization of the fulleropyrrolidines, is negligible. Comparison of
   the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels for the protonated and
   free-base forms of the investigated fulleropyrrolidines indicates that
   electron deficiency of the C-60 cage and the HOMO-LUMO energy gap caused
   by N-protonation are increased. This result agrees well with the earlier
   electrochemical results for fulleropyrrolidinium cations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The extracellular protein Rein controls neuronal migrations
   in parts of the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. In vivo, absence of
   Rein correlates with up-regulation of the docking protein Dab1 and
   decreased Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Loss of the Rein receptor
   proteins, apolipoprotein receptor 2 and very low density lipoprotein
   receptor. results in a Rein-like phenotype accompanied by increased Dab1
   protein expression, Complete loss of Dab1, however, recapitulates the
   Rein phenotype.
   Results: To determine whether Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation affects Dab1
   protein expression and positioning of embryonic neurons, we have
   identified Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites. We then generated mice
   in which the Dab1 protein had all the potential tyrosine phosphorylation
   sites mutated. This mutant protein is not tyrosine phosphorylated during
   brain development and is not upregulated to the extent observed in the
   Rein or the apoER2 and VLDLR receptor mutants. Animals expressing the
   non-phosphorylated Dab1 protein have a phenotype similar to the
   dab1-null mutant.
   Conclusions: Dab1 is downregulated by the Rein signal in neurons in the
   absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites
   and not downregulation of Dab1 protein are required for Rein signaling.

Abstract = {{Proton exchange, residence time, and gas uptake measurements are used to
   explore collisions and reactions of HCl, HBr, and HNO3 with 70 wt \%
   D2SO4 at 213 K. These studies help to provide a detailed picture of HX
   (X = Cl, Br, NO3) energy transfer to sulfuric acid and the fate of the
   HX molecules immediately after thermalization at the D2O/D2SO4 surface.
   We find that the three molecules readily dissipate their excess kinetic
   energy and become trapped momentarily in the interfacial region.
   However, only 11 +/- 3\% of the thermalized HCl and 22 +/- 3\% of the
   thermalized HBr molecules undergo H --> D exchange; the HCl and HBr that
   do not react are found to desorb from the acid within 2 x 10(-6) s. In
   contrast, more than 95\% of the initially trapped HNO3 molecules are
   converted to DNO3, The HX molecules that undergo exchange dissolve
   within the deuterated acid for characteristic times of 5 x 10(-5) s
   (HCl), 3 x 10(-3) s (HBr), and 1 x 10(-1) s (HNO3) before they desorb,
   thermally as DX. The scattering experiments imply that the desorption of
   thermalized HCl and HBr molecules is, on average, faster than their
   solvation and reaction in the interfacial and bulk regions of 70 wt \%
   D2SO4 Although HNO3 is less acidic than HCl or HBr, it appears to
   hydrogen bond more strongly to surface D2O and D2SO3, enabling it to be
   captured by the acid in nearly every collision.}},

Abstract = {{ETO (MTG8) was first described due to its involvement in the (8;21)
   translocation frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemias. In the
   t(8;21) the AML1 gene on chromosome 21 is fused to ETO on chromosome 8.
   The resultant hybrid protein is comprised of the DNA, binding domain of
   AML-1 and the majority of ETO. This study examines the subnuclear
   distributions of ETO, AML-1B and AML-1/ETO proteins fused to green
   fluorescence protein in living cells using fluorescence microscopy.
   Further, we identified a 40 amino acid portion of ETO (amino acids
   241-280) that was sufficient to cause nuclear import of green
   fluorescent protein. Mutational analysis demonstrated that lysine 265
   and/or arginine 266 were required for nuclear impart of ETO, but that
   the surrounding basic residues were not critical, ETO interacted with
   the nuclear import proteins importin-alpha and beta in vitro, and
   mutations in ETO that abolish nuclear localization also abolished the in
   vitro interaction with importin-alpha and beta. These data suggest that
   ETO enters the nucleus via an importin-mediated pathway. additionally,
   ETO and AMIL-1/ETO co-localized to punctate nuclear bodies distinct from
   those containing promyelocytic leukemia protein. Nuclear body formation
   was dependent upon a region of ETO N-terminal to the nuclear
   localization signal. Thus, ETO and AML-1/ ETO reside in potentially
   novel subnuclear compartments.}},

Abstract = {{Context A recent outbreak of syphilis among users of an Internet chat
   room challenged traditional methods of partner notification and
   community education because locating information on sexual partners was
   limited to screen names and privacy concerns precluded identifying
   sexual partners through the Internet service provider.
   Objectives To determine the association of Internet use and acquisition
   of syphilis and to describe innovative methods of partner notification
   in cyberspace.
   Design, Setting, and Patients Outbreak investigation conducted at the
   San Francisco (Calif) Department of Public Health (SFDPH) in June-August
   1999 of 7 cases of early syphilis among gay men linked to an online chat
   room; case-control study of 6 gay men with syphilis reported to SFDPH in
   July-August 1999 (cases) and 32 gay men without syphilis who presented
   to a city clinic in April-July 1999 (controls),
   Main Outcome Measures Association of syphilis infection with Internet
   use, Internet use among cases vs controls, and partner notification
   methods and partner evaluation indexes.
   Results During the outbreak, cases were significantly more likely than
   controls to have met their sexual partners through use of the Internet
   (67\% vs 19\%; odds ratio, 8.7; P=.03). We notified and confirmed
   testing for 42\% of named partners; the mean number of sexual partners
   medically evaluated per index case was 5.9,
   Conclusions In this study, meeting sexual partners through the Internet
   was associated with acquisition of syphilis among gay men. Public health
   efforts must continually adapt disease control procedures to new venues,
   carefully weighing the rights to privacy vs the need to protect public
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Various substituted poly(phenylthiophene)s have been studied by X-ray
   diffraction. They are semicrystalline, with very different degrees of
   crystallinity. Those with para-substituted phenyl groups have a low
   degree of crystallinity, whereas those with ortho-substituted phenyl
   groups are more crystalline. The most crystalline materials in this
   study have two equally long substituents on the phenyl ring, one at the
   ortho position and the other at the ortho or meta position on the
   opposite side of the phenyl ring. Poly(3-(2,5-dioctylphenyl)thiophene)
   (PDOPT) was most thoroughly studied, and a structural model is proposed.
   The structure of PDOPT is quite different from previously studied
   substituted polythiophenes in that the octyl side chains are directed
   normal to the thiophene planes. In this way, the conjugated polymer
   chains are kept separated from each other. Solution-cast and spin-cast
   PDOPT films are anisotropic, with the octyl side chains oriented normal
   to the film surface in both cases. This is contrary to the situation for
   poly(3-alkylthiophene)s, where solution-cast and spin-cast films orient
   in different ways.}},

Title = {{Theoretical and numerical study of a symmetrical triple flame using the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2000}},

Abstract = {{In non-premixed turbulent combustion the reactive zone is localized at
   the stoichiometric surfaces of the mixture and may be locally
   approximated by a diffusion flame. Experiments and numerical simulations
   reveal a characteristic structure at the edge of such a two-dimensional
   diffusion flame. This `triple flame' or `edge flame' consists of a
   curved flame front followed by a trailing edge that constitutes the body
   of the diffusion flame. Triple names are also observed at the edge of a
   lifted laminar diffusion flame near the exit of burners. The speed of
   propagation of the triple flame determines such important properties as
   the rate of increase of the flame surface in non-premixed combustion and
   the lift-off distance in lifted flames at burners. This paper presents
   an approximate theory of triple flames based on an approximation of the
   flame shape by a parabolic profile, for large activation energy and low
   but finite heat release. The parabolic flame path approximation is a
   heuristic approximation motivated by physical considerations and is
   independent of the large activation energy and low heat release
   assumptions which are incorporated through asymptotic expansions.
   Therefore, what is presented here is not a truly asymptotic theory of
   triple flames, but an asymptotic solution of a model problem in which
   the flame shape is assumed parabolic, Only the symmetrical flame is
   considered and Lewis numbers are taken to be unity. The principal
   results are analytical formulas for the speed and curvature of triple
   flames as a function of the upstream mixture fraction gradient in the
   limit of infinitesimal heat release as well as small but finite heat
   release. For given chemistry, the solution provides a complete
   description of the triple flame in terms of the upstream mixture
   fraction gradient, The theory is validated by comparison with numerical
   simulation of the primitive equations.}},

   prepare self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold. The SAMs were
   characterized by ellipsometry, by measurement of the advancing water
   droplet contact angle, and by reflection absorption infrared (RAIR)
   spectroscopy. SAMs prepared from the diisocyanides 1 and 2, which have a
   flexible alkyl chain between the two isocyanide end groups, were found
   to form monolayer films in which both isocyanide groups are bound to the
   surface. SAMs prepared from the diisocyanides 3-6, which have rigid aryl
   or phenylethynyl structures between the two isocyanide end groups, were
   found to bind to gold through one CN group. Analyses of the RAIR spectra
   of these SAMs are consistent with surface selection rules for adsorbates
   that are oriented with their long molecular axis normal to the surface.
   Measurements of advancing water droplet contact angles and ellipsometric
   film thicknesses of SAMs prepared from 3-6 further support a surface

Abstract = {{Succinate:quinone reductases are membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze
   electron transfer from succinate to quinone. Some enzymes in vivo reduce
   ubiquinone (exergonic reaction) whereas others reduce menaquinone
   (endergonic reaction). The succinate:menaquinone reductases all contain
   two heme groups in the membrane anchor of the enzyme: a proximal heme
   (heme b(P)) located close to the negative side of the membrane and a
   distal heme (heme b(D)) located close to the positive side of the
   membrane. Heme b(D) is a distinctive feature of the
   succinate:menaquinone reductases, but the role of this heme in electron
   transfer to quinone has not previously been analyzed. His28 and His113
   are the axial ligands to heme b(D) in Bacillus subtilis
   succinate:menaquinone reductase. We have individually replaced these His
   residues with Leu and Met, respectively,resulting in assembled
   membrane-bound enzymes. The H28L mutant enzyme lacks succinate:quinone
   reductase activity probably due to a defective quinone binding site. The
   H113M mutant enzyme contains heme b(D) with raised midpoint potential
   and is impaired in electron transfer to menaquinone. Our combined
   experimental. data show that the heme b(D) center, into which we include
   a quinone binding site, is crucial for succinate:menaquinone reductase
   activity. The results support a model in which menaquinone is reduced on
   the positive side of the membrane and the transmembrane electrochemical
   potential provides driving force for electron transfer from succinate
   via heme b(P) and heme b(D) to menaquinone.}},

Abstract = {{The hormone leptin is implicated in the regulation of appetite and body
   weight in rodents, primates and humans. We reported that the leptin gene
   (ob) is expressed in the brain, but the factors which control ob
   expression in the central nervous system are not known. We previously
   showed that brain-derived rat C6 glioblastoma cells express ob mRNA and
   protein. In the present study we examined the regulation of ob
   expression in C6 cells. Leptin and leptin receptor immunoreactivity was
   detected in C6 cells, suggesting a possible autocrine role for leptin.
   The identity of the leptin immunoreactivity (OB-ir) in C6 cells was
   confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using two leptin
   specific polyclonal antibodies. Using RT-PCR analysis a product of the
   expected size for the short, but not the long, leptin receptor isoform
   was detected in C6 cells. Cells were maintained in serum-free (SF) media
   for 0-24 h in the presence of various regulators of leptin expression.
   Leptin mRNA levels were significantly higher in cells treated with
   dbcAMP (1 mM), IGF 1 (100 ng/ml) or insulin (5 mu g/ml) compared to SF
   controls. In contrast, corticosterone (10(-7)M) reduced leptin mRNA. In
   the presence of dbcAMP, C6 cells undergo a dramatic alteration in
   morphology which is coincident with an apparent increase in the number
   of leptin-ir nuclei and an increase in leptin immunoreactivity. In
   contrast to C6 cells, glucocorticoids are reported to increase leptin
   levels in adipocytes/adipose tissue, while increases in intracellular
   cAMP levels are reported to reduce leptin levels. Overall, our in vitro
   data suggest that the regulation of leptin gene expression in C6
   glioblastoma cells is different from that in adipocytes. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A large part of germ cells die apoptotically during testicular
   development in rodents. In the present study, a wave of germ cell
   apoptosis was observed between days 10 and 30 of postnatal life by in
   situ 3'-end labeling and DNA fragmentation analysis. To explore the
   potential involvement of Bcl-2 family members in this process, the
   expression and localization of some Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2,
   Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bak, Bar, and Bad) and p53 were analyzed during
   testicular development in the rat by Western blotting and
   immunohistochemistry. The dynamic changes in the expression profiles of
   Bcl-2 family proteins are consistent with a model in which germ cells
   are primed for apoptosis during the first cycle of spermatogenesis by de
   novo expression of the death effecters Bar and Bad in a p53-dependent
   manner and these proteins are prevented from triggering further
   apoptosis after the first spermatogenic cycle has been set up by
   anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-w. To examine
   whether the pro-survival effect of stem cell factor (SCF) on germ cells
   in vitro is mediated by Bcl-2 family proteins, the correlation between
   the pro-survival effect of SCF on germ cells and the expression of the
   above-mentioned apoptosis-related gene products in the seminiferous
   tubules at stage XII of the epithelial cycle were also investigated
   using a tubular culture system. The data suggest that SCF supports germ
   cell survival during spermatogenesis by up-regulating pro-survival Bcl-2
   family proteins, Bcl-w and Bcl-xL, and down-regulating pro-apoptosis
   Bcl-2 family proteins, e.g. Bar. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{Galactosylceramide (GalCer) is an alternative receptor allowing HIV-1
   entry into CD4(-)/GalCer(+) cells. This glycosphingolipid recognizes the
   V3 loop of HIV gp120, which plays a key role in the fusion of the HIV
   envelope and cellular membrane. To inhibit HIV uptake and infection, we
   designed and synthesized analogs of GalCer. These amphiphiles and
   bolaamphiphiles consist of single and double hydrocarbon and/or
   fluorocarbon chain beta-linked to galactose and galactosamine. They
   derive from serine (GalSer), cysteine (GalCys), and ethanolamine
   (GalAE). The anti-HIV activity and cytotoxicity of these galactolipids
   were evaluated in vitro on CEM-SS (a CD4(+) cell line), HT-29, a CD4(-)
   cell line expressing high levels of GalCer receptor, and/or HT29
   genetically modified to express CD4. GalSer and GalAE derivatives,
   tested in aqueous medium or as part of liposome preparation, showed
   moderate anti-HIV-l activities (IC50 in the 20-220 mu M range), whereas
   none of the GalCys derivatives was found to be active. Moreover, only
   some of these anti-HIV active analogs inhibited the binding of
   {[}H-3]suramin (a polysulfonyl. compound which displays a high affinity
   for the V3 loop) to SPC3, a synthetic peptide which contains the
   conserved GPGRAF region of the V3 loop. Our results most likely indicate
   that the neutralization of the virion through masking of this conserved
   V3 loop region is not the only mechanism involved in the HIV-1 antiviral
   activity of our GalCer analogs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Autoreactive T cells ale a component of the normal immune system. It has
   been proposed that some of these autoreactive T cells even have a
   protective function. Recent studies support this notion by demonstrating
   that (a) myelin basic-protein (MBP-) specific T cells show
   neuroprotective effects in vivo, and (b) activated antigen-specific
   human T cells and other immune cells produce bioactive brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in vitro. Furthermore, BDNF is expressed in
   different types of inflammatory cells in brain lesions of patients with
   acute disseminated leukoencephalopathy or multiple sclerosis. We
   postulate that the neuroprotective effect of T cells and other immune
   cells observed in vivo is at least partially mediated by BDNF and other
   neurotrophic factors. The concept of neuroprotective autoimmunity has
   obvious implications for the therapy of multiple sclerosis and other

Abstract = {{We report herein a comprehensive study of (porphinato)iron
   {[}PFe]-catalyzed isobutane oxidation in which molecular oxygen is
   utilized as the sole oxidant; these catalytic reactions were carried out
   and monitored in both autoclave reactors and sapphire NMR tubes. In situ
   (19)F and (13)C NMR experiments, coupled with GC analyses and optical
   spectra obtained from the autoclave reactions have enabled the
   identification of the predominant porphyrinic species present during
   PFe-catalyzed oxidation of isobutane. Electron-deficient PFe catalysts
   based on 5,10,15, 20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin
   {[}(C(6)F(5))(4)PH(2)],
   2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octabromo-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porp
   hyrin {[}Br(8)(C(6)F(5))(4)PH(2)], and
   5,10,15,20-tetrakis(heptafluoropropyl)por {[}(C(3)F(7))(4)PH(2)]
   macrocycles were examined. The nature and distribution of hydrocarbon
   oxidation products show that an autoxidation reaction pathway dominates
   the reaction kinetics, consistent with a radical chain process. For each
   catalytic system examined, PFe(II) species were shown not to be stable
   under moderate O(2) pressure at 80 degrees C; in every case, the PFe(II)
   catalyst precursor was converted quantitatively to high-spin PFe(III)
   complexes prior to the observation of any hydrocarbon oxidation
   products. Once catalytic isobutane oxidation is initiated, all reactions
   are marked by concomitant decomposition of the porphyrin-based catalyst.
   In situ (17)O NMR spectroscopic studies confirm the incorporation of
   (17)O from labeled water into the oxidation products, implicating the
   involvement of PFe-OH in the catalytic cycle. Importantly,
   Br(8)(C(6)F(5))(4)PFe-based catalysts, which lack macrocycle C-H bonds,
   do not exhibit augmented stability with respect to analogous catalysts
   based on (C(6)F(5))(4)PFe and (C(3)F(7))(4)PFe species. The data
   presented are consistent with a hydrocarbon oxidation process in which
   PFe complexes play dual roles of radical chain initiator, and the
   species responsible for the catalytic decomposition of organic
   peroxides. This modified Haber-Weiss reaction scheme provides for the
   decomposition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide intermediates via reaction
   with PFe-OH complexes; the PFe(III) species responsible for
   hydroperoxide decomposition are regenerated by reaction of PFe(II) with

Abstract = {{The structure of epitopes recognised by anti-pectin monoclonal,
   antibodies (mAbs) has been investigated using a series of model
   lime-pectin samples with defined degrees and patterns of methyl
   esterification, a range of defined oligogalacturonides and enzymatic
   degradation of pectic polysaccharides. In immune-dot-assays, the
   anti-homogalacturonan (HG) mAbs JIM5 and JIM7 both bound to samples with
   a wide range of degrees of methyl esterification in preference to fully
   de-esterified samples. In contrast, the anti-MG phage display mAb PAM1
   bound most effectively to fully de-esterified pectin. In competitive
   inhibition ELISAs using fully methyl-esterified or fully de-esterified
   oligogalacturonides with 3-9 galacturonic acid residues, JIM5 bound
   weakly to a fully de-esterified nonagalacturonide but JIM7 did not bind
   to any of the oligogalacturonides tested. Therefore, optimal JIM5 and
   JIM7 binding occurs where specific but undefined methyl-esterification
   patterns are present on HG domains, although fully de-esterified HG
   samples contain sub-optimal JIM5 epitopes. The persistence of mAb
   binding to epitopes in pectic antigens, with 41\% blockwise
   esterification (P41) and 43\% random esterification (F43) subject to
   fragmentation by endo-polygalacturonase II (PG II) and endo-pectin lyase
   (PL), was also studied. Time course analysis of PG II digestion of P41
   revealed that JIM5 epitopes were rapidly degraded, but a low level of
   PAM1 and JIM7 epitopes existed even after extensive digestion,
   indicating that some HG domains were more resistant to cleavage by PG
   II. The chromatographic separation of fragments produced by the complete
   digestion of P41 by pectin lyase indicated that a very restricted
   population of fragments contained the PAM1 epitope while a
   (1-->4)-beta-D-galactan epitope occurring on the side chains of pectic
   polysaccharides was recovered in a broad range of fractions. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The consensus view about the constitution of the T cell receptor
   repertoire has shifted greatly even during this decade. Although the
   discovery of autoimmunity in the fifties had clearly shown that a
   repertoire must exist directed against self antigens, the extent of this
   repertoire was not fully appreciated. In our work we have tried to
   elucidate the nature of the antigenic specificities against which this
   self-directed repertoire is directed. The non-tolerized (residual)
   self-directed repertoire is a direct consequence of the hierarchy of
   antigenic determinant display, and is the most important influence in
   the organism's choice of which T cells to delete. Certain determinants
   remain ``silent{''} and are neither displayed in the thymus nor in the
   periphery: these are a heterogeneous group which are invisible to T
   cells for a variety of reasons. One reason relates to the processing and
   presentation of determinants, and a second derives from the nature of
   the T cell receptor (TcR) and the avidity of the T cell for its target
   specificity. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The connections between the medial temporal cortical areas and CA1 of
   the hippocampus were examined in the Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata) by
   means of retrograde and anterograde tract tracing methods with wheat
   germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WC;A-HRP) and
   fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow). The posterior
   parahippocampal (areas TF1, TF2, and TH), perirhinal (areas 35 and 36),
   and ventral inferotemporal areas (areas TEav and TEpv) were reciprocally
   connected with CA1. Projection fibers from CA1 to the medial temporal
   cortical areas originated in the pyramidal cell laver. whereas those
   from the medial temporal cortical areas to CA1 terminated in the
   molecular layer. Each of these cortical areas was reciprocally connected
   with the entire rostrocaudal extent of CA1. However, the intensity of
   the connections varied along the rostrocaudal axis of CA1: areas TH and
   TF2 were connected most markedly with the anterior and middle parts of
   CA1, respectively. Areas TF, 35, 36, TEav, and TEpv were connected
   predominantly with the posterior part of CA1. In the coronal plane of
   CA1, labeled cells were located in proximal CA1 (i.e., near the
   prosubiculum), but not in distal CA1 (i.e., near CA2). The medial
   temporal cortical areas in direct reciprocal connection with CAI were
   presumed to be involved in the memory system, especially in the system

Abstract = {{In the pteropod mollusc Clione limacina, two groups of locomotor
   motoneurons, located in the pedal ganglion, innervate the dorsal and
   ventral muscle layers of the ipsilateral wing through the wing nerve.
   Separate branches of this nerve go either only to the dorsal muscle
   layer or only to the ventral one. In the present study, growth of novel
   neurites of the wing motoneurons was induced by cutting the wing nerve.
   In addition, all other peripheral nerves and connectives of the pedal
   ganglion were cut, except for the pedal commissure to the contralateral
   pedal ganglion. Thus, the neurites were allowed to grow only towards the
   contralateral pedal ganglion. We have found that the novel neurites,
   entering the contralateral pedal ganglion, were capable of growing
   everywhere inside the central nervous system (CNS) and into any
   peripheral nerve. However, they preferred the wing nerve. This finding
   suggests that the preference is caused by the guiding cues in the wing
   nerve or the at;tractive influence of the wing muscles. Because the
   contralateral pedal ganglion and nerves were left intact. the growth
   direction of the new neurites could be determined only by factors
   permanently existing in the CNS, rather than induced by nerve injury or
   muscle denervation. Within the wing nerve, the neurites could not
   discriminate between the nerve branches going to the dorsal and ventral
   muscle layers. They formed synapses on muscles of both layers, despite
   the fact that the muscles were innervated by their own motoneurons. J.

Abstract = {{We consider the equilibrium state of a quantum system weakly coupled to
   a quantum bath within second order perturbation theory. It was
   previously shown by Romero-Rochin and Oppenheim {[}Physica A 155, 52
   (1989)] that the equilibrium state deviates from the canonical form,
   e(-beta Hs)/Z(s) (H-s is the free system Hamiltonian and Z(s) the
   canonical partition function). We reproduce this result via a different
   derivation, starting from the non-Markovian, rather than the Markovian,
   quantum Master equation. Our derivation sheds new light on the mechanism
   that stabilizes the deviation from the canonical form and shows that it
   involves an interplay between a static distortion to the equilibrium
   state and dynamical system-bath correlations. We show that this
   deviation is a necessary consequence of translational invariance and
   vanishes when the rotating-wave-approximation is applied. The deviation
   is also shown to vanish for a two-level system off-diagonally coupled to
   a heat bath or when the Lamb shifts are neglected. Two ways for
   numerically evaluating the second order deviations are described.
   Finally, the deviations from canonical equilibrium are given an
   illuminating geometrical interpretation in terms of the phase space
   Wigner distribution. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Mouse mutants have a key role in discerning mammalian gene function and
   modelling human disease; however, at present mutants exist for only
   1-2\% of all mouse genes. In order to address this phenotype gap, we
   have embarked on a genome-wide, phenotype-driven, large-scale
   Nethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen for dominant mutations of
   clinical and pharmacological interest in the mouse. Here we describe the
   identification of two similar neurological phenotypes and determination
   of the underlying mutations using a novel rapid mapping strategy
   incorporating speed back-crosses and high throughput genotyping, Two
   mutant mice were identified with marked resting tremor and further
   characterized using the SHIRPA behavioural and functional assessment
   protocol. Back-cross animals were generated using in vitro fertilization
   and genome scans performed utilizing DNA pools derived from multiple
   mutant mice. Both mutants were mapped to a region on chromosome 11
   containing the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (Pmp22), Sequence
   analysis revealed novel point mutations in Pmp22 in both lines, The
   first mutation, H12R, alters the same amino acid as in the severe human
   peripheral neuropathy Dejerine Sottas syndrome and Y153TER in the other
   mutant truncates the Pmp22 protein by seven amino acids, Histological
   analysis of both lines revealed hypomyelination of peripheral nerves,
   This is the first report of the generation of a clinically relevant
   neurological mutant and its rapid genetic characterization from a
   large-scale mutagenesis screen for dominant phenotypes in the mouse, and
   validates the use of large-scale screens to generate desired clinical
   phenotypes in mice.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1995 and 1997 a neurological condition in pheasant poults from

   upright. The condition characteristically affected poults from seven
   weeks of age and the incidence on any one site was low. No significant
   bacteria were isolated consistently from brain tissue. The condition was
   characterised histologically by a non-suppurative meningoencephalitis,
   in which lesions were found predominantly in the cerebellum in 61 of 81
   samples examined (75.3 per cent). A non-suppurative myelitis was
   recorded in 16 of 20 spinal cords examined. No lesions were recorded in
   peripheral neural tissue and lesions were rare in other tissues. The
   condition appeared not to have been recorded previously in pheasants. A
   viral aetiology was suspected but Newcastle disease virus was not

Abstract = {{Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) was interfaced to mass
   spectrometry (MS) with an electrospray ion (ESI) source for the
   separation and accurate molecular mass determination of the individual
   intrinsic membrane proteins that comprise the photosystem II (PS II)
   major light-harvesting complex (LHC II) and minor (CP24, CP26 and CP29)
   antenna system, whose molecular masses range between 22 000 and 29 000.
   PS LI is a supramolecular complex intrinsic of the thylacoid membrane,
   which plays the important role in photosynthesis of capturing solar
   energy, and transferring it to photochemical reaction centers where
   energy conversion occurs. The protein components of the PS II major and
   minor antenna systems were extracted from spinach thylacoid membranes
   and separated using a butyl-silica column eluted by an acetonitrile
   gradient in 0.05\% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. On-line
   electrospray MS allowed accurate molecular mass determination and
   identification of the protein components of PS II major and minor
   antenna system. The proposed RPLC-ESI-MS method holds several advantages
   over sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the
   conventional technique for studying membrane proteins, including a
   better protein separation, mass accuracy, speed and efficiency. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates endothelial cell
   (EC) migration. The protein kinase Akt activates the endothelial NO
   synthase (eNOS) by phosphorylation of Ser-1177, Therefore, we
   investigated the contribution of Akt-mediated eNOS phosphorylation to
   VEGF-induced EC migration. Inhibition of NO synthase or overexpression
   of a dominant negative Akt abrogated VEGF-induced cell migration. In
   contrast, overexpression of constitutively active Akt was sufficient to
   induce cell migration. Moreover, transfection of an Akt site
   phospho-mimetic eNOS (S1177D) potently stimulated EC migration, whereas
   a non-phosphorylatable mutant (S1177A) inhibited VEGF-induced EC
   migration. Our data indicate that eNOS activation via phosphorylation of
   Ser-1177 by Akt is necessary and sufficient for VEGF-mediated EC
   migration. (C) 2000 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Abstract = {{Growth of preimplantation embryos is influenced by autocrine trophic
   factors that need to act by the 2-cell stage, but their mode of action
   is not yet described, This report shows that late zygote and 2-cell
   stage mouse embryos responded to embryo derived platelet-activating
   factor (PAF) with transient increases in intracellular calcium
   concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)). {[}Ca2+](i) transients were single global
   events and were specifically induced by embryo-derived PAF. They were
   blocked by inhibition of phospholipase C (U 73122) and an inositol
   trisphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonist (xestospongin C), indicating the
   release of calcium from IP3-sensitive intracellular stores. Transients
   were also inhibited by the absence of calcium from extracellular medium
   and partially inhibited by treatment with dihydropyridine (nifedipine,
   10 mu M), but not pimozide (an inhibitor of an embryonic T-type calcium
   channel). (+/-)BAY K8644 (an L-type channel agonist) induced {[}Ca2+](i)
   transients, yet these were completely inhibited by nifedipine (10 mu M).
   The complete inhibition of BAY K8644, but only partial inhibition of PAF
   by nifedipine shows that L-type channels were only partly responsible
   for the calcium influx. Depolarization of 2-cell embryos by 50 mM K+ did
   not inhibit PAF-induced calcium transients, showing that the influx
   channels were not voltage-dependent. Depletion of intracellular calcium
   stores by thapsigargin revealed the presence of store-operated channels.
   The interdependent requirement for IP3-sensitive internal calcium stores
   and extracellular calcium in the generation of PAF-induced transients
   may be explained by a requirement for capacitative calcium entry via
   store-operated channels. A functionally important role for the
   PAF-induced transients is supported by the observation that inhibition
   of {[}Ca2+](i) transients by a PAF-antagonist (WEB 2086) or an
   intracellular calcium chelator (1,2-bis
   (2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid
   tetrakis-acetoxymethyl ester; BAPTA-AM) caused marked inhibition of
   early embryo development. Growth inhibition by BAPTA-AM was relieved by
   addition of exogenous PAF.}},

Abstract = {{Germline alterations of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene have been
   implicated at least in half of familial breast cancers. Nevertheless, in
   sporadic breast cancer no mutation of this gene has been characterized
   to date. In sporadic breast tumors, other BRCA1 gene loss of function
   mechanisms, such as down-regulation of gene expression, have been
   suggested. In an effort to better understand the relationship between
   BRCA1 expression and malignant transformation, we have adapted the new
   real-time quantitative PCR method based on a 5' nuclease assay and the
   use of doubly labeled fluorescent TaqMan probes to quantify BRCA1 mRNA.
   We have compared expression of BRCA1 mRNA with or without exon 11 in the
   normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10a and in three cancer cell lines
   (MCF-7, MDA-MB231 and HBL100) by comparing two methods of
   quantification: the comparative CT and the standard curve. We found that
   the full length BRCA1 mRNA, which encodes the functional nuclear
   protein, was down-regulated in tumor cells when compared with MCF10a
   cells. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{After release, neurotransmitters are removed from the extracellular

   serve this function for the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric
   acid (GABA). However, it is largely unknown to which proportion GABA is
   taken up by GABAergic interneurons, glia cells or principal neurons. We
   analyzed the distribution of mRNA for the main GABA-transporter subtype
   in the hippocampus, GAT-1, in adult rats. Most interneurons were
   strongly stained for GAT-1 mRNA, indicating re-uptake by the
   GABA-releasing cells. Surprisingly, prominent signals for GAT-1 were
   also found throughout the principal cell layers (granule and pyramidal
   cells). These data indicate that GABA transporters may be present in
   non-GABAergic projection cells of the rat hippocampus which contribute
   to the clearance of GABA from the extracellular space. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Epithermal neutrons have been measured using a neutron dosimeter via a
   coherent demodulation technique. This dosimeter consists of
   CsI(Tl)-photodiode scintillation detectors, four of which are coupled to
   neutron-gamma converting foils of various sizes. Neutron-gamma
   converting foils of In, Au and Co materials were used, each of which has
   a large capture cross section which peaks in the epithermal neutron
   energy region. The type of foil was selected according to the material
   properties that best correspond to the energy of the epithermal neutrons
   to be measured. III addition, the proposed technique was applied using
   Au-foils in order to measure the Cd ratio. The validity of the proposed
   technique was examined using an Am-241-Be source placed in a testing
   stack of polyethylene blocks, and the results were compared with the
   theoretical values calculated by the Monte Carlo calculation. Finally,
   the dosimeter was applied for measuring epithermal neutrons and the Cd
   ratio in an experimental beam-tube of the TRIGA reactor. (C) 2000

   lies close to the proposed camphor access channel. The results show that

Abstract = {{The receptor for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mediates multiple
   cellular responses, including stimulation of both proliferative and
   anti-apoptotic pathways. We have examined the role of cross talk between
   the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR) in mediating responses to IGF-1, In COS-7 cells, IGF-1
   stimulation causes tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R beta subunit,
   the EGFR, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and the Shc adapter
   protein, Shc immunoprecipitates performed after IGF-1 stimulation
   contain coprecipitated EGFR, suggesting that IGF-1R activation induces
   the assembly of EGFR-Shc complexes. Tyrphostin AG1478, an inhibitor of
   the EGFR kinase, markedly attenuates IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of
   EGFR, Shc, and ERK1/2 but has no effect on phosphorylation of IGF-1R,
   IRS-1, and protein kinase B (Akt), Cross talk between IGF-1 and EGF
   receptors is mediated through an autocrine mechanism involving matrix
   metalloprotease-dependent release of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF),
   because IGF-1-mediated ERK activation is inhibited both by
   {[}Glu(52)]Diphtheria toxin, a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, and the
   metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. These data demonstrate
   that IGF-1 stimulation of the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway and the
   EGFR/Shc/ERK1/2 pathway occurs by distinct mechanisms and suggest that
   IGF-1-mediated ``transactivation{''} of EGFR accounts for the majority
   of IGF-1-stimulated Shc phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the
   ERK cascade.}},

Abstract = {{Linear dispersion of elastic constants in non-centrosymmetric crystals
   has the effect of lifting phase-velocity degeneracy along those acoustic
   axes which do not lie in symmetry planes. The separating of the sheets
   of the isofrequency (or slowness) surface, even though slight at low
   frequencies, nevertheless has a striking effect on the phonon intensity
   pattern near to the removed degeneracy. Phonon focusing abides by the
   shape of the slowness surface. whose curvature is singular at the
   degeneracy point. Hence, a small perturbation breaking the degeneracy
   entails a large change of the curvature in a small region scaling in
   size with the magnitude of the perturbation. As a result, new phonon
   focusing caustics may arise, and existing caustics may undergo major
   changes near acoustic axes. Theoretical analysis reveals possible
   patterns of local transformation of the slowness surface leading to
   different types of critical behaviour of phonon focusing. Criteria, in
   terms of the elastic constants of a given crystal are obtained for the
   emergence of focusing caustics.}},

Abstract = {{Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction requires a large cytoplasmic
   multi-protein complex that binds microtubules in an Hh-dependent manner.
   Here, we show that three members of this complex, Costal2 (Cosa), Fused
   (Fu), and Cubitus interruptus (Ci), bind each other directly to form a
   trimeric complex. We demonstrate that this trimeric signaling complex
   exists in Drosophila lacking Suppressor of Fused (Su(fu)), an extragenic
   suppressor of fu, indicating that Su(fu) is not required for the
   formation, or apparently function, of the Hh signaling complex. However,
   we subsequently show that Su(fu), although not a requisite component of
   this complex, does form a tetrameric complex with Fu, Cos2, and Ci. This
   additional Su(fu)-containing Hh signaling complex does not appear to be
   enriched on microtubules, Additionally, we demonstrate that in response
   to Hh Ci accumulates in the nucleus without its various cytoplasmic
   binding partners, including Su(fu), We discuss a model in which Su(fu)
   and Cosa each bind to Fu and Ci to exert some redundant effect on Ci
   such as cytoplasmic retention. This model is consistent with genetic
   data demonstrating that Su(fu) is not required for Hh signal
   transduction proper and with the elaborate genetic interactions observed
   among Su(fu), fu, cos2, and ci.}},

Abstract = {{Single molecule spectral dynamics originate from changes (1) within the

   assignment of fluorescence behaviour to distinct molecular states is
   required. We realized this by means of a perylene based chromophore with
   an amino substituent. The fluorescence spectrum of this dye depends
   strongly on the amino group conformation relative to the chromophore.
   Thus different conformers of the chromophore can be distinguished. Here
   we evidence the occurrence of spectrally defined conformers and report
   transitions between them, revealed by single molecule spectroscopy. (C)

Abstract = {{We examined the mechanism of H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and its
   relationship to oxidation in human leukemia cells. The HL-60
   promyelocytic leukemia cell line was sensitive to H2O2, and at
   concentrations up to about 20-25 mu M, the killing was mediated by
   apoptosis, There was limited evidence of lipid peroxidation, suggesting
   that the effects of H2O2 do not involve hydroxyl radical. When HL-60
   cells were exposed to H2O2 in the presence of the spin trap
   alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN), we detected a
   12-line electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum assigned to the
   POBN/POBN. N-centered spin adduct previously described in
   peroxidase-containing cell-free systems. Generation of this radical by
   HL-60 cells had the same H2O2 concentration dependence as initiation of
   apoptosis, In contrast, studies with the K562 human erythroleukemia cell
   line, which is often used for comparison with the HL-60, and with high
   passaged HL-60 cells (spent HL-60) studied under the same conditions
   failed to generate POBN., Cellular levels of antioxidant enzymes
   superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase did not
   explain the differences between these cell lines. Interestingly, the
   K562 and spent HL-60 cells, which did not generate the radical, also
   failed to undergo H2O2-induced apoptosis, Based on this we reasoned that
   the difference in H2O2-induced apoptosis might be due to the enzyme
   myeloperoxidase. Only the apoptosis-manifesting HL-60 cells contained
   appreciable immunoreactive protein or enzymatic activity of this
   cellular enzyme. When HL-60 cells were incubated with methimazole or
   4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, which are inhibitors of myeloperoxidase,
   they no longer underwent H2O2-induced apoptosis, Hypochlorous acid
   stimulated apoptosis in both HL-60 and spent HL-60 cells, indicating
   that another oxidant generated by myeloperoxidase induces apoptosis and
   that it may be the direct mediator of H2O2-induced apoptosis, Taken
   together these observations indicate that H2O2-induced apoptosis in the
   HL-60 human leukemia cell is mediated by myeloperoxidase and is linked
   to a non-Fenton oxidative event marked by POBN..}},

Abstract = {{Peroxides and other reactive oxygen species damage arteries during
   ischemia-reperfusion. Here, we report on the effects of H(2)O(2) on
   contractility of pig coronary artery. We either treated 3-mm coronary
   artery rings with 0 to 0.5 mM H(2)O(2) in organ baths or we perfused the
   arteries with H(2)O(2) and then cut them into rings. In each instance,
   we monitored the force of contraction of 3-mm rings in H(2)O(2)-free
   solution with 30 mM KCI and then we determined the A23187 induced
   endothelium dependent relaxation as a percent of this contraction.
   Treatment with H(2)O(2) in the organ bath caused a decrease in the
   contraction but it did not affect the percent relaxation. Treating
   arteries with H(2)O(2) by luminal perfusion did not affect the
   contraction but it decreased the percent relaxation. Perfusion alone
   decreased the amount of endothelium remaining in the arteries and
   perfusing with H(2)O(2) decreased it further. The percent relaxation
   with A23187 correlated well with the endothelium remaining in the
   arteries. We propose that H(2)O(2) and shear stress can cause a loss of
   endothelium and that endothelium can also protect the underlying smooth
   muscle against luminal H(2)O(2). (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In studies on metabolism of vascular smooth muscle, it was observed that
   incubation of intact porcine carotid artery strips with 3\% bovine or
   porcine serum albumin had profound effects on the oxidation of
   substrates and O-2 consumption. Arteries incubated over 180 min with
   charcoal-treated and dialyzed albumin demonstrated time-dependent
   stimulation of glucose oxidation (145\%; P < 0.0001, n = 6) and O-2
   consumption (116\%; P < 0.001, n = 6). These results were not mimicked
   by incubation with 3\% solutions of ovalbumin or porcine skin gelatin.
   However, the oxidation of the medium chain fatty acid octanoate was
   inhibited in the presence of albumin over a broad range of octanoate
   concentrations (0.5-5.0 mM). Short chain fatty acid oxidation (acetate,
   5 mM), in contrast, was not inhibited by albumin. Wash-out of albumin
   only partially reversed the stimulation of O-2 consumption and
   incubation of arteries with a polyanionic compound, polyethylene
   sulfonate (5 mg/ml), blunted the stimulatory effect of albumin on O-2
   consumption. Albumin also produced anaplerosis of the Krebs cycle, and
   an increase in the content of glutamate and alanine (P < 0.005, n = 8).
   The metabolic effects of albumin were associated with time-dependent
   uptake of albumin (30.9 +/- 1.5 nmol/g per 210 min; P < 0.01, n = 15).
   ATP-dependent proteolysis of the albumin taken up was also observed.
   These results demonstrate novel and important intracellular effects of
   serum albumin on energy metabolism of vascular smooth muscle. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The effects of the mu-opioid receptor agonists buprenorphine and
   morphine on immune and neuroendocrine functions through acute action in
   the rat mesencephalon periaqueductal gray (PAC) were evaluated.
   Buprenorphine is an analgesic recently approved for the treatment of
   drug dependency. In this study, it was shown that injection of an
   equianalgesic dose of buprenorphine (related to morphine) into the
   ventral-caudal PAG did not alter splenic NK cell, T cell, and macrophage
   functions, whereas morphine significantly (p < 0.001) suppressed splenic
   NK cell cytotoxic activity (14-50\% reduction), splenic and thymic T
   cell proliferation to concanavalin A (Con A, 43-76\% reduction), antiTCR
   (T cell receptor) (85\% reduction) and IL-2 (36-48\% reduction), and
   macrophage functions including nitric oxide (36-41\% reduction) and
   TNF-alpha production (26\%), and phagocytosis of Candida albicans
   (39\%). In addition, buprenorphine was associated with significant (p <
   0.0001) reductions in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and
   corticosterone (CSO) plasma levels, without altering norepinephrine (NE)
   and serotonin splenic dialysate levels. In contrast, morphine
   significantly (p < 0.0001) increased glucocorticoid and catecholamine
   levels in plasma and spleen dialysates, respectively. These results
   indicated that buprenorphine did not activate either the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with glucocorticoid release,
   or the sympathetic nerve (SNS) activity with bioamine production, and
   was not associated with immunosuppression. The lack of effects of
   buprenorphine on neuroendocrine systems may be related to its partial
   agonist properties, the absence of effects on immune system function,
   and may be associated with the reduction in craving observed in
   addictive disorders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study contributed to identifying the current levels of
   organochlorine pollutants in four Creek wetlands of international
   importance (the Evros and Aries Deltas, and Kerkini and Prespa Lakes),
   using the cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis as a suitable
   bioindicator in a region where such information is scarce. Residue
   levels of eight polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 13
   organochlorine pesticide (OC) compounds were measured in cormorant eggs.
   Most PCBs and OCs (except dieldrin and endrin) were found in at least
   some of the study areas. Median concentrations of five PCBs (IUPAC 8,
   20, 52, 138, 180) and of six OCs (alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, lindane,
   heptachlor, 4,4'-DDE and 4,4'-DDT) differed significantly among the
   areas. The median totals of the PCBs were highly significant among the
   areas, being unexpectedly highest in Prespa Lake (68.43 ppb), despite
   its remoteness, and lowest in Evros Delta samples (12.17 ppb). Aldrin
   that was found in samples from Evros, Aries and Prespa probably
   accumulated in wintering grounds. In all of the areas, the relative
   proportions of alpha-BHC and 2,4'-DDD were the highest of all OCs.
   Fingerprint and cluster analyses illustrated overall differences in the
   PCB patterns, being greatest between the deltas than between the lakes,
   but, inversely, for OCs the differences were smaller in the deltas.
   Differences were attributed to targe variations in the cormorants' diet
   between areas and different regimes of pollutant management in the two
   types of wetland. Correlations of pollutants varied considerably among
   areas and they were more diverse in OCs. The Sigma OCs/Sigma PCBs ratio
   indicates agrochemical pollution in all areas. An important finding was
   that levels of both pollutant groups were too low to have any biological
   implications on the cormorants and, additionally, suggest that they have
   a negligible impact on the environment of the wetlands studied. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{KjPn 8 is an extreme polypolar planetary nebula with a large-scale
   structure characterized by a giant biconical envelope. Spasmodic bipolar
   ejections in changing directions have occurred over thousands of years
   to create this peculiar nebula. Narrowband images of the core of KjPn 8
   have now been obtained with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on board
   the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and are reported here. The central star
   is finally revealed in these observations, and its compact nebular core
   is resolved into a remarkably young elliptical ring, currently expanding
   at only 16 km s(-1). This ring is the ionized inner region of larger
   molecular CO and H(2) counterparts, all sharing the same orientation.
   The highest speed and youngest outflows are perpendicular to this
   central ring, which is identified as the latest event in the creation of
   this nebula. It is shown that the formation history of KjPn 8 has
   involved two distinct and consecutive planetary nebulae-like events,
   probably originating from a binary core evolution with components of
   very similar mass. These characteristics indicate that KjPn 8 may be a
   rare object in our Galaxy and the first ever detected of this class.}},

Abstract = {{The chiral beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol (MET), which is
   marketed as a racemate, is a highly extracted drug with rapid
   absorption. The enantiomeric disposition of MET is reported following
   racemic administration as a single and as multiple ol al dosing foul
   times per day for four days in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=6 in each
   group). Plasma was collected and enantiomeric concentrations of MET were
   determined using a stereospecific HPLC assay. The R/S ratio for AUC is
   not statistically different from unity either after single or after
   multiple administration of racemate. The oral clearance after single
   dose was 1.99 +/- 0.87 and 2.26 +/- 0.85 ml min(-1) kg(-1) for R- and
   S-MET, respectively. These values were decreased to 0.59 +/- 0.21 and
   0.64 +/- 0.26 ml min(-1) kg(-1) after multiple administration of
   racemate. The corresponding values for the elimination half-lives were
   approximately 35 and 33 min after single and multiple dose
   administration For both enantiomers, respectively. These results may
   suggest a saturable first pass metabolism of MET as its enantiomers are
   accumulated in plasma following multiple dosing in the rat model. (C)

Abstract = {{Although anecdotal reports have suggested that sexual activity increases
   the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI), controlled studies to
   evaluate the magnitude of this risk have only recently been conducted.
   Using on epidemiologic technique celled the case-crossover method, the
   Myocardial Infarction Onset Study (MIOS) has provided quantitative data
   on sexual activity as a trigger of MI onset. Sexual activity was found
   to double the relative risk of acute MI in healthy individuals and
   patients with a prior history of angina or MI, However, the absolute
   risk of sexually triggered MI remains extremely low, because the
   baseline risk of MI is low for most individuals and the increased risk
   due to sexual activity is transient. Regular exercise also was found to
   reduce the risk of MI by sexual activity. Given that >12 million people
   in the United States have coronary artery disease, these findings should
   be more widely disseminated to reassure patients that, in most cases,
   sexual activity carries little risk of causing a cardiac event. In the
   future, advances in research on the triggering of MI ore likely to yield
   new approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular events through
   prospective identification of the vulnerable plaques that lead to
   coronary thrombosis, and prophylactic measures to sever the link between
   triggers and their potentially disastrous consequences. (C) 2000 by

Volume = {{187}},

Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{A higher number of epidermal mucous cells was observed in Atlantic
   halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) yolk sac larvae kept in seawater
   from 50 m depth, containing 7.5 X 10(4)-10.3 X 10(4) bacteria/ml (DAPI),
   as compared to larvae kept in seawater from 200 m depth with 3.3 X
   10(4)-5.0 X 10(4) bacteria/mi. The affected mucous cells were identified
   as saccular cells. The number of saccular cells was also higher in
   larvae kept in incubators with seawater that were supplemented with
   Lactobacillus plantarum (about 10(6) bacteria/ml). Thus, it appeared
   that the number of bacteria in the seawater could affect the
   proliferation of saccular cells in halibut larvae. Furthermore, survival
   of the halibut larvae was affected by pre-incubation of eggs and
   hatching larvae with different strains of commensal bacteria isolated
   from fish. A larval survival of 94.4\% was obtained following
   pre-incubation with an apathogenic Vibrio salmonicida strain, whereas V.
   iliopiscarius sp. nov. reduced survival to 63.4\% in the first 12 days,
   compared to 81\% survival in the control group. In the same period,
   survival following incubation with L. plantarum was 95.8\%. Survival 32
   days post-hatching was significantly higher in the groups of halibut
   larvae pre-incubated with L. plantarum (68.4\%) and V. salmonicida
   (72.8\%), as compared to the control group (58.2\%). Pre-incubation with
   V. iliopiscarius resulted in 41.8\% survival at day 32, which was
   significantly lower than the control group. Thus, pre-incubation of
   halibut eggs and hatching larvae with strains of commensal bacteria may
   subsequently affect larval survival, and in the present study, an
   indigenous apathogenic strain closely resembling the marine pathogen V.
   salmonicida resulted in the highest survival. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We present exactly simultaneous X-ray and TeV monitoring with RXTE and
   HEGRA of the TeV blazar Mrk 501 during 15 days in 1998 June. After an
   initial period of very low flux at both wavelengths, the source
   underwent a remarkable hare in the TeV and X-ray energy bands, lasting
   for about 6 days and with a larger amplitude at TeV energies than in the
   X-ray band. At the peak of the TeV flare, rapid TeV flux variability on
   subhour timescales is found. Large spectral variations are observed at
   X-rays, with the 3-20 keV photon index of a pure power-law continuum
   flattening from Gamma = 2.3 to Gamma = 1.8 on a timescale of 2-3 days.
   This implies that during the maximum of the TeV activity the synchrotron
   peak shifted to energies greater than or similar to 50 keV, a behavior
   similar to that observed during the longer lasting, more intense flare
   in 1997 April. The TeV spectrum during the flare is described by a power
   law with photon index Gamma = 1.9 and an exponential cutoff at similar
   to 4 TeV; an indication for spectral softening during the flare decay is
   observed in the TeV hardness ratios. Our results generally support a.
   scenario in which the TeV photons are emitted via inverse Compton
   scattering of ambient seed photons by the same electron population
   responsible for the synchrotron X-rays. The simultaneous spectral energy
   distributions can be fit with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model
   assuming a substantial increase of the magnetic field and the electron
   energy by factors of 3 and 10, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins (Env) of
   amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) and the G protein of vesicular
   stomatitis virus VSV-G) have been successfully used in recent
   preclinical gene therapy studies We report here the generation of
   infectious HIV-l-derived Vector particles pseudotyped with the Env of
   the molecular clone 10A1 of MLV and with chimeric envelope glycoprotein
   Variants derived from gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) and MLV.
   Formation of infectious HIV-I (GaLV) pseudotype vectors was only
   possible with the substitution of the cytoplasmic tail of GaLV Env with
   that of MLV. The lentiviral vectors exhibited a host cell range
   identical with that of MLV(GaLV) and MLV(10A1) vectors, which are known
   to enter cells either via the GaLV-receptor Glvr-1 (Pit-1) or via the
   amphotropic receptor Ram-1 (Pit-2) in addition to Glvr-1, respectively.
   Thus, HIV-1(GaLV) and HIV-1(10A1) pseudotype vectors may be useful for
   efficient gene transfer into a variety of human tissues like primary
   human hematopoietic cells. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between the erbB tyrosine kinase receptors and their
   ligands plays an important role in tumor growth via the regulation of
   autocrine and paracrine loops. We report the effect of heregulin beta 1,
   the ligand for erbB-3 and erbB-4 receptors, on the regulation of
   vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, using a panel of
   breast and lung cancer cell lines with constitutive erbB-2
   overexpression or engineered to stably overexpress the erbB-2 receptor.
   We demonstrate that heregulin beta 1 induces VEGF secretion in most
   cancer cell lines, while no significant effect was observed in normal
   human mammary and bronchial primary cells. Overexpression of erbB-2
   receptor results in induction of the basal level of VEGF and exposure to
   heregulin further enhances VEGF secretion. This is associated with
   increased VEGF mRNA expression. In contrast, VEGF induction is
   significantly decreased in a T47D cell line where erbB-2 is functionally
   inactivated. Conditioned media from heregulin-treated cancer cells, but
   not from normal cells, stimulates endothelial cell proliferation; this
   paracrine stimulation is inhibited by co-exposure to a specific VEGF
   neutralizing antibody, Furthermore, heregulin-mediated angiogenesis is
   observed in the in vivo CAM assay. This study reports the first evidence
   of VEGF regulation by heregulin in cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the competitive epoxidations of olefins with cis- and
   trans-stilbenes and with cyclooctene and trans-stilbene in iron
   porphyrin complex-catalyzed epoxidation reactions by H2O2, tert-butyl
   hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), and m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) in
   protic solvent (i.e., a solvent mixture of CH3OH and CH2Cl2) and aprotic
   solvent (i.e., a solvent mixture of CH3CN and CH2Cl2) at room
   temperature under catalytic reaction conditions. The competitive
   epoxidations were also carried out with in situ generated high-valent
   iron(IV) oxo porphyrin cation radical complexes in aprotic solvent under
   stoichiometric reaction conditions. By determining the ratios of epoxide
   products formed in the competitive epoxidations, we were able to
   conclude unambiguously that the reactive species generated in protic
   solvent are high-valent iron(IV) oxo porphyrin cation radical complexes
   3 and the intermediates formed in aprotic solvent are oxidant-iron
   porphyrin intermediates 2. A protic solvent such as methanol is proposed
   to function as a general-acid catalyst, thereby increasing the rate of
   O-O bond cleavage of 2 to form 3. In the absence of general-acid
   catalysis such as in aprotic solvent, the rate of O-O bond cleavage of 2
   is relatively slow and 2 transfers its oxygen to olefins prior to the
   formation of 3. To further examine the effect of the general-acid
   catalysis on the nature of epoxidizing intermediates, we carried out
   competitive epoxidations in the solvent mixtures of alcohol/CH2Cl2 using
   alcohols of varying pK(a) values and in the presence of an acid (i.e.,
   HClO4) in aprotic solvent. The product ratios were found to vary
   depending on the strength of the solvent acidity, demonstrating that the
   reaction of 2 with olefin competes with the 0-0 bond cleavage of 2 that
   leads to the formation of 3. We also reported for the first time that a
   high-valent iron(IV) oxo porphyrin cation radical intermediate
   containing electron-deficient porphyrin ligand shows an unexpected
   preference for trans-stilbene over cis-stilbene in the competitive
   epoxidations of cis- and trans-stilbenes.}},

Abstract = {{Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been reported to decrease
   stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity by decreasing mRNA expression.
   This investigation was designed to determine whether structurally
   related compounds of CLA have a direct inhibitory effect on SCD
   activity. Trans-10,cis-12 CLA had strong inhibitory activity on SCD
   while cis-9,trans-11, and trans-9,trans-11 isomers had no effect.
   Trans-10 octadecenoate was not inhibitory, whereas cis-12 octadecenate
   was inhibitory, but not as effective as trans-10,cis-12 CLA. Of the
   oxygenated derivatives, 9-peroxy-cis/trans-10, trans-12 octadecadienoate
   was a more effective inhibitor than trans-10,cis-12 CLA, whereas
   9-hydroxy-trans-10, cis-12. octadecadienoate was less effective.
   Interestingly, cis-11 octadecadienoate and cis-12 octadecen-10-ynoate
   were slightly inhibitory. However, trans-9 and trans-11 octadecenoates,
   and trans-9,cis-12 octadecadienoate were all inactive under test
   condition, as were linoleate, oleate, and arachidonate. Derivatives of
   CLA acid modified to alcohol, amide or chloride were all inactive. A
   cis-12 double bond appears to be a key structural feature for inhibiting
   SCD activity, especially when coupled with a trans-10 double, whereas a
   cis-11 double bond is less effective. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have impaired ability to
   use context, which may manifest as alterations of relatedness within the
   semantic: network. However, impairment in context use may be more
   difficult to detect in high-functioning adults with ASD. To test context
   use in this population, we examined the influence of context on memory
   by using the ``false memory{''} test. In the false memory task, lists of
   words were presented to high-functioning subjects with ASD and matched
   controls. Each list consists of words highly related to an index word
   not on the list. Subjects are then given a recognition test. Positive
   responses to the index words represent false memories. We found that
   individuals with ASD are able to discriminate false memory items from
   true items significantly better than are control subjects. Memory in
   patients with ASD may be more accurate than in normal individuals under
   certain conditions. These results also suggest that semantic
   representations comprise a less distributed network in high-functioning
   adults with ASD. Furthermore, these results may be related to the
   unusually high memory capacities found in some individuals with ASD.
   Research directed at defining the range of tasks performed superiorly by
   high-functioning individuals with ASD will be important for optimal
   vocational rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{The epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of receptors (EGFR) is
   overproduced in estrogen receptor (ER) negative (-) breast cancer cells.
   An inverse correlation of the level of EGFR and ER is observed between
   ER- and ER positive (+) breast cancer cells. A comparative study with
   EGFR-overproducing ER- and low-level producing ER+ breast cancer cells
   suggests that EGF is a major growth-stimulating factor for ER- cells. An
   outline of the pathway for the EGF-induced enhanced proliferation of ER-
   human breast cancer cells is proposed. The transmission of mitogenic
   signal induced by EGF-EGFR interaction is mediated via activation of
   nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). The basal level of active NF-kappa
   B in ER- cells is elevated by EGF and inhibited by anti-EGFR antibody
   (EGFR-Ab), thus qualifying EGF as a NF-kappa B activation factor.
   NF-kappa B transactivates the cell-cycle regulatory protein, cyclin D1.
   which causes increased phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, more
   strongly in ER- cells. An inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase,
   Ly294-002, blocked this event. suggesting a role of the former in the
   activation of NF-kappa B by EGF. Go6976. a well-characterized NF-kappa B
   inhibitor, blocked EGF-induced NF-kappa B activation and up-regulation
   of cell-cycle regulatory proteins. This low molecular weight compound
   also caused apoptotic death, predominantly more in ER- cells. Thus
   Go6976 and similar NF-kappa B inhibitors are potentially novel low
   molecular weight therapeutic agents for treatment of ER- breast cancer
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background-This study was performed to compare implantation of a DDI
   pacemaker with rate hysteresis with no implant in respect to syncopal
   recurrences in patients with severe cardioinhibitory tilt-positive
   neurally mediated syncope.
   Methods and Results-Forty-two patients from 18 European centers were
   randomized to receive a DDI pacemaker programmed to 80 bpm with
   hysteresis of 45 bpm (19 patients) or no pacemaker (23 patients).
   Inclusion criteria were greater than or equal to 3 syncopes over the
   last 2 years and a positive cardioinhibitory (Vasovagal Syncope
   International Study types 2A and 2B) response to tilt testing. The
   median number of previous syncopal episodes was 6; asystolic response to
   tilt testing was present in 36 patients (86\%) (mean asystole, 13.9 +/-
   10.2 seconds). All patients were followed up for a minimum of 1.0 years
   and a maximum of 6.7 years (mean, 3.7 +/- 2.2). One patient (5\%) in the
   pacemaker arm experienced recurrence of syncope compared with 14
   patients (61\%) in the no-pacemaker arm (P = 0.0006). In the
   no-pacemaker arm, the median time to first syncopal recurrence was 5
   months, with a rate of 0.44 per year. On repeated tilt testing performed
   within 15 days after enrollment, positive responses were observed in
   59\% of patients with pacemakers and in 61\% of patients without
   pacemakers (P = NS).
   Conclusions-In a limited, select group of patients with tilt-positive
   cardioinhibitory syncope, DDI pacing with hysteresis reduced the
   likelihood of syncope. The benefit of the therapy was maintained over
   the long term. Even in untreated patients, the syncopal recurrence
   burden was low. A negative result of tilt testing was not a useful means
   to evaluate therapy efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{Facilitated transport of oxygen was investigated in ethyl cellulose

   the jet, jet width angle and volume flow. The following article
   describes the nozzle types installed in the Bochum wide hot strip mill
   of Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG and reports about the experience made with
   these nozzles in practical operation. Only by changing the nozzle type

Abstract = {{Salmonella typhimurium invades host macrophages and induces apoptosis
   and the release of mature proinflammatory cytokines. SipB, a protein
   translocated by Salmonella into the cytoplasm of macrophages, is
   required for activation of Caspase-1 (Casp-1, an interleukin {[}IL]-1
   beta-converting enzyme), which is a member of a family of cysteine
   proteases that induce apoptosis in mammalian cells. Casp-1 is unique
   among caspases because it also directly cleaves the proinflammatory
   cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-18 to produce bioactive cytokines. We show
   here that mice lacking Casp-1 (casp-1(-/-) mice) had an oral S.
   typhimurium 50\% lethal dose (LD50) that was 1,000-fold higher than that
   of wild-type mice. Salmonella breached the M cell barrier of casp-1(-/-)
   mice efficiently; however, there was a decrease in the number of
   apoptotic cells, intracellular bacteria, and the recruitment of
   polymorphonuclear lymphocytes in the Peyer's patches (PP) as compared
   with wild-type mice. Furthermore, Salmonella did not disseminate
   systemically in the majority of casp-1(-/-) mice, as demonstrated by
   significantly less colonization in the PP, mesenteric lymph nodes, and
   spleens of casp-1(-/-) mice after an oral dose of S. typhimurium that
   was 100-fold higher than the LD50. The increased resistance in
   casp-1(-/-) animals appears specific for Salmonella infection since
   these mice were susceptible to colonization by another enteric pathogen,
   Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which normally invades the PP. These
   results show that Casp-1, which is both proapoptotic and
   proinflammatory, is essential for S. typhimurim to efficiently colonize
   the cecum and PP and subsequently cause systemic typhoid-like disease in
   mice.}},

Abstract = {{Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has been implicated in
   immunosuppression. However, it remains obscure whether regulation of T
   cells by TGF-beta contributes to the immunosuppression in vivo. To
   address this issue, we developed transgenic mice expressing Smad7, an
   intracellular antagonist of TGF-beta/Smad signaling, selectively in
   mature T cells using a plasmid construct coding a promoter element (the
   distal lck promoter) that directs high expression in peripheral T cells.
   Peripheral T cells were not growth inhibited by TGF-beta in Smad7
   transgenic mice. Although Smad7 transgenic mice did not spontaneously
   show a specific phenotype, antigen-induced airway inflammation and
   airway reactivity were enhanced in Smad7 transgenic mice associated with
   high production of both T helper cell type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines.
   Thus, blockade of TGF-beta/Smad signaling in mature T cells by
   expression of Smad7 enhanced airway inflammation and airway reactivity,
   suggesting that regulation of T cells by TGF-beta was crucial for
   negative regulation of the inflammatory (immune) response. Our findings
   also implicated TGF-beta/Smad signaling in mature T cells as a
   regulatory component of allergic asthma.}},

Abstract = {{The chameleon's ability to change skin color depending on environment to
   increase its chances of surviving served as an inspiration in the
   development of self-adaptive supertough wear-resistant coatings. Surface
   chemistry, structure and mechanical properties of these thin (0.5 mu m)
   coatings reversibly change with applied load and environment, providing
   the best wear protection. Coating designs developed in-house are
   reviewed together with a critical analysis of design reports in the
   literature. `Chameleon' coatings were prepared using novel nanocomposite
   structures, consisting of crystalline carbides, diamond-like carbon
   (DLC), and transition metal dichalcogenides. Various mechanisms were
   activated to achieve surface self-adaptation and supertough
   characteristics. They included: transition of mechanical response from
   hard and rigid to quasi plastic by grain boundary sliding at loads above
   the elastic limit; friction induced sp(3) --> sp(2) phase transition of
   the DLC phase; re-crystallization and reorientation of the
   dichalcogenide phase; change of surface chemistry and structure from
   amorphous carbon in humid air to hexagonal dichalcogenide in dry
   nitrogen and vacuum; and sealing the dichalcogenide phase to prevent
   oxidation. These mechanisms were demonstrated using WC/DLC, TiC/DLC, and
   WC/DLC/WS2 coatings. The hardness of WC/DLC and TiC/DLC composites was
   between 27-32 GPa and scratch roughness was 4-5 fold above that of
   nanocrystalline carbides. The WC/DLC/WS2 composites survived millions of
   sliding cycles in vacuum and air under 500-1000 MPa loading, and
   exhibited excellent friction recovery in humid <--> dry environmental
   cycling. Their friction coefficients were about 0.1 in humid air, 0.03
   in vacuum, and as low as 0.007 in dry nitrogen. The proposed `chameleon'
   concept can dramatically increase wear-resistant coating applicability,
   durability, and reliability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction and development. The history of prion diseases is one of
   the most exciting chapters of the story of medicine in the twentieth
   century. It began in the nineteen twenties when Creutzfeldt (in one
   patient) and Jakob (in five patients) described a clinically polymorphic
   cerebral syndrome with a subacute or chronic course and fatal outcome.
   Although later reviews of these pioneer studies have cast doubt on the
   nosology of some of these cases, the eponym has been maintained over the
   years. It is even possible that the miliary sclerosis described by
   cowers in the nineteenth century was in fact a spongiform
   encephalopathy. Subsequently the nosological limits of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
   disease remained ill-defined This explains the large number of names
   given to it whilst it continued to be included in the chapter on
   degenerative conditions of the nervous system. Perhaps the turning point
   was when, in the nineteen sixties, Carleton Gajdusek et al showed that
   it was transmissible. Previously Gajdusek and Zigas had (in 1957)
   described the disease kuru in a group of indigenous cannibals in Papua
   (New Guinea). The possibility of a parallel between this kuru and the
   scrapie of sheep (in which transmission had been proved twenty years
   before) led them to experiment and eventually prove its infectious
   nature. Over the following years, reports of iatrogenic cases with
   different routes of transmission gave further proof The absence of
   conventional microorganisms responsible for this group of conditions led
   Prusiner (in 1982) to suggest the theory of the infecting proton or
   prion. Conclusion. This theory led to better understanding of several
   pathological and physiopathological aspects, however, we are aware that
   the full story of prion diseases is still being written at the present
   time.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed efficient screened-exchange local-density
   approximation (sX-LDA) methods for films and superlattices (FLM/SL) with
   which to calculate self-consistent electronic structures for both
   occupied and unoccupied states. Considering nonuniform charge densities
   and local-field effects in the z direction for FLM/SL, we have employed
   nonlocal Thomas-Fermi wave vectors to define the screened-exchange
   interaction. Three methods, for bulk, superlattice, and film, have been
   implemented in the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave
   method. The film sX-LDA method was then applied to the Si(100)2x1
   surface. The calculated occupied surface states show very good agreement
   with experiment. On the other hand, an underestimation of the correction
   to the unoccupied surface states, by about 0.2 eV, was estimated in
   comparison with available GW calculations. The ionization energy of Si
   was evaluated with the film geometry to be 5.35 eV by virtue of the
   quasiparticle corrections, showing good agreement with the experimental
   value of 5.15 +/- 0.08 eV. Rie also present an application of the
   superlattice sX-LDA method to {[}001] ordered InAs/InSb heterojunctions
   and superlattices. Band gaps and band offsets under strained conditions
   were directly calculated by sX-LDA without any experimental data as
   input. Slightly larger valence-band offsets than the LDA results. by
   about 0.08 eV, agree with the consequence of the GW calculations,
   indicating an increase of the potential negativity in the InAs region.
   This potential change along with the charge redistribution at the
   interface is found to be crucial to evaluate accurate band gaps of the
   superlattices.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The goal for tissue engineering of vascular grafts is the

   intact, xenogeneic vessel by repopulation with human autologous cells.
   To this purpose, a gentle nondenaturing and nondeterging
   acellularization procedure for xenogeneic aortas was developed, This
   structure was reseeded with pre-expanded peripheral vascular endothelial
   cells (EC) and myofibroblasts using specifically designed bioreactors,
   Methods. Aortas from 15-30 kg female landrace pigs were acelullarized
   with a 0.1\% trypsin solution for between 24 and 96 hr, Human vascular
   cells were harvested from saphenous vein biopsy specimens, Acellularized
   vessels were reseeded with EC and myofibroblasts. Cell viability after
   reseeding was assayed by fluorescence staining. Morphologic features of
   the acellularized matrix and tissue engineered vessel was assayed by
   transmission and scanning electron microscopy and histologic analysis.
   Nitric oxide-synthetase activity was investigated by mass spectrometric
   analysis of bioreactor supernatants. The in vivo immune response was
   tested by subcutaneous implantation of acellularized porcine aortic
   tissue in a rat model.
   Results. The acellularization procedure resulted in an almost complete
   removal of the original resident cells, and the 3-D matrix was loosened
   at interfibrillar zones, However, the 3-D arrangement of the matrix
   fibers was grossly maintained. The 3-D matrix was covered with a fully
   confluent human endothelial cell layer obtained by continuous stress
   challenge in the bioreactor, Myofibroblasts migrated into positions
   formerly occupied by the xenogeneic cells. Nitric oxide synthetase
   activity was maintained in the bioartificial graft. T-lymphocyte and
   CD18 positive leukocyte infiltrate were greatly reduced after
   acellularization of porcine aortic specimens after implantation in the
   rat.
   Conclusions, Porcine vessels were acellularized and consecutively fully
   repopulated with human EC and myofibroblasts, This approach may
   eventually lead to the engineering of vessels immunologically acceptable
   to the host using a relatively short preparation period of 2-3 weeks. We
   expect matrix turnover in vivo leading to a gradual assimilation of the
   matrix structure by the host mediated by the hosts autologous cells.}},

Abstract = {{In force measurements with the atomic force microscope (AFM) often
   nonelastic deformations of the sample are observed. This is especially
   the case for AFM experiments on ice. In this paper two theoretical
   approaches are used to calculate the indentation of the tip. First, in
   an extended plastic indentation model we assume that the pressure
   exerted by the tip plastifies the sample material once the pressure
   exceeds three times the yield stress. The rate of plastification limits
   the indentation speed. With two parameters this model adequately
   describes measured force curves on ice in a temperature range of -4
   degrees C to -20 degrees C and for driving speeds of 0.8 to 110 mu m/s.
   The calculation also shows that in general plastic deformation can lead
   to different force curves depending on the driving speed. For low
   driving speeds a jump-in and a linear force curve is expected. For fast
   driving speeds plastic deformation leads to curved force curves with
   gradually increasing slope. Second, in a hydrodynamic model we assume
   that the presence of the tip surface leads to an interfacial premelting
   of the ice. The flow of the liquidlike water out of the gap between tip
   and bulk ice is limiting the indentation speed of the tip. The
   hydrodynamic model does not fit measured force curves as good as the
   extended plastic indentation model and viscosities which are
   unrealistically high need to be assumed. Hence, we can exclude that a
   liquidlike layer of a thickness significantly larger than a monolayer
   exists in AFM experiments on ice. (C) 2000 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and insulin-like growth
   factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) play a role in the normal development
   of breast tissue and possibly in the etiology of breast cancer. Breast
   density is one of the strongest predictors of breast cancer. In a
   cross-sectional analysis within the Nurses' Health Study, we compared
   the associations of plasma levels of endogenous IGF-I and IGFBP-3 with
   breast density in 65 premenopausal and 192 postmenopausal women, The
   digitized film screen mammograms were evaluated by the computer-assisted
   Toronto method, in which visually selected gray-scale cut points are
   used to assess breast density. Generalized linear models and Spearman's
   partial correlation coefficients described the associations between
   breast density and IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and the IGF-I:IGFBP-3 ratio.
   Premenopausal breast density was positively correlated with ICF-I and
   inversely correlated with IGFBP-3; the association was strongest for the
   IGF-I:IGFBP-3 ratio and breast density (r = 0.39; P = 0.001). In
   contrast, the correlation between breast density and the IGF-I:IGFBP-3
   ratio among postmenopausal women was -0.02 (P = 0.83). The associations
   of IGF-I:IGFBP-3 ratio with breast density differed significantly
   between premenopausal and postmenopausal women (P = 0.01). Mammographic
   density is positively associated with plasma IGF-I levels and inversely
   associated with plasma IGFBP-3 levels among premenopausal women, but not
   among postmenopausal women. These results are consistent with previous
   studies that showed a positive association between a higher
   IGF-I:IGFBP-3 ratio and subsequent risk of breast cancer only among
   premenopausal women. The findings raise the possibility that
   premenopausal levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 could be in the etiological
   pathway that relates higher breast density with increased breast cancer
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{The transcription factor NF-kappa B stimulates the transcription of
   proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha, LPS (endotoxin) and
   hypoxia both induce NF-kappa B activation and TNF-alpha gene
   transcription. Furthermore, hypoxia augments LPS induction of TNF-alpha
   mRNA. Previous reports have indicated that antioxidants abolish NF-kappa
   B activation in response to LPS or hypoxia, which suggests that reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) are involved in NF-kappa B activation. This study
   tested whether mitochondrial ROS are required for both NF-kappa B
   activation and the increase in TNF-alpha mRNA levels during hypoxia and
   LPS, Our results indicate that hypoxia (1.5\% O-2) stimulates NF-kappa B
   and TNF-alpha gene transcription and increases ROS generation as
   measured by the oxidant sensitive dye 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein
   diacetate in murine macrophage J774.1 cells. The antioxidants
   N-acetylcysteine and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic acid abolished the
   hypoxic activation of NF-kappa B, TNF-alpha gene transcription, and
   increases in ROS levels. Rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex
   I, abolished the increase in ROS signal, the activation of NF-kappa B,
   and TNF-alpha gene transcription during hypoxia. LPS stimulated NF-kappa
   B and TNF-alpha gene transcription but not ROS generation in J774.1
   cells. Rotenone, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic acid, and N-acetylcysteine
   had no effect on the LPS stimulation of NF-kappa B and TNF-alpha gene
   transcription, indicating that LPS activates NF-kappa B and TNF-alpha
   gene transcription through a ROS-independent mechanism. These results
   indicate that mitochondrial ROS are required for the hypoxic activation
   of NF-kappa B and TNF-LU gene transcription, but not for the LPS
   activation of NF-kappa B.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility management schemes that reduce signaling traffic load and
   connection setup time play a pivotal role in designing future personal
   communication services (PCS) network. It concerns users' Quality of
   Service (QoS)requirements and the efficient use of network resources. In
   recent years, many mobility management schemes have been proposed for
   the reduction of signaling traffic and network load. regardless of the
   specific protocol, all such technologies must support two fundamental
   mechanisms. One is location management (knowing where the users are) and
   the other is handover management (making the transition between cells
   smooth). In location management, a mobile user has to register when
   entering a new registration area (RA) and to deregister when leaving. To
   reduce the signaling cost in registration and deregistration, Lin and
   Noerpel proposed an implicit deregistration scheme. That is, a mobile
   will not perform deregistration when leaving a RA. As a result, there
   are two consequences. First, we need a large registration database.
   Second, even with a large database, it will become full eventually. Then
   we have to select a record to delete when a new mobile moves into the
   RA. In the original implicit deregistration scheme, the oldest record is
   deleted. In this paper, we propose two more reasonable and effective
   criteria to determine which record should be deleted from the database
   when a new mobile moves into an RA and the database is full. The purpose
   is to decrease the database size and ensure a low probability that a
   valid record will be replaced at the same time. The two parameters used
   are call-to-mobility ratio (CMR) and average call arrival interval. When
   the database is full, the proposed method will delete the record that
   has the lowest CMR or that will have to wait for the longest time for an
   expected call arrival. Simulation results show that the modified
   approach has significant improvements on the database sizes. (C) 2000

   The general result of the analysis of the presteady-state kinetics is
   that glucoamylase G1 is affected by the protonation states of three
   groups, with pK(a) values of 2.7, 4.5 and 5.7 in the free enzyme and of
   2.7, 4.75 and 6.5 in the first enzyme-substrate complex. The protonation
   of the group in the enzyme-substrate complex with a pK(a) 6.5 had no
   effect on k(2) (1640 s(-1))or k(-2) (20 +/- 4 s(-1)), but resulted in a
   stronger enzyme-substrate interaction, due to a decrease of K-1 from 40
   to 6.3 mM. In other words, when the substrate is bound, the pK(a) of the
   acid group changes to increase the fraction of reactive enzyme. Since
   this pK(a) parallels that of the Michaelis complex, known from the
   pH-dependence of k(cat), the group in question is most probably the
   catalytic acid Glu-179. Protonation of Glu-179 thus is of no importance
   in the second step, clearly indicating that this step represents a
   conformational change and not the actual hydrolysis step of the
   reaction. Protonation of the pK(a) = 4.75 group leads to a small
   decrease in k(2) to 1090 s(-1), and also to minor changes in K-1. The
   group with pK(a) = 2.7 leads to a major decrease of k(2), of which the
   limit may be zero, but shows no effect on K-1. Thus no difference is
   seen between the pK(a) values of the free enzyme and of the first
   enzyme-substrate complex at low pH.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Complete venous thrombosis of the pancreas after
   simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation usually results in
   graft loss. We describe a technique, that allows salvage of the graft
   after complete venous thrombosis.
   Methods. A total of 150 patients with insulin dependent diabetes
   mellitus/end stage renal disease underwent SPK over the past decade at
   the University of Miami. Of these, three patients developed complete
   venous thrombosis after induction therapy with anti-interleukin-2R
   antibody and i.v. tacrolimus. These three patients underwent surgical
   thrombectomy followed by heparinization and oral anticoagulation, The
   splenic vein was opened distally at the tail of the pancreas and the
   superior mesenteric vein at the level of the mesentery or head of the
   pancreas. Thrombectomy was performed with a Fogarty catheter, The portal
   anastomosis was not opened or manipulated. The arterial ``Y{''} graft
   was not clamped and the right iliac vein was controlled proximally with
   a double wrapped vessel-loop to contain possible thrombus. In one
   patient, the partially thrombosed splenic artery was opened at the tail
   of the pancreas and thrombectomy was performed in the same fashion.
   There were no apparent technical problems. A pancreatic biopsy was not
   performed, nor was acute rejection treated empirically.
   Results. Intraoperative and serial Doppler ultrasound showed good flow
   through the allograft, In all three patients the exocrine and endocrine
   function of the pancreas was preserved with a mean follow-up of 15
   months.
   Conclusions. The described surgical thrombectomy followed by systemic
   anticoagulation may be useful in the salvage of the allograft pancreas
   in case of complete venous thrombosis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To compare clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of
   dogs with eclampsia with those of dogs without eclampsia.
   Design-Retrospective study.
   Animals-31 dogs with eclampsia (affected) and 31 with dystocia
   (controls).
   Procedure-information on signalment, type of diet, reproductive history,
   litter size, time from whelping to eclampsia, body weight, clinical
   signs, results of physical examination and hematologic and biochemical
   analyses, response to calcium supplementation. and reccurrence was
   obtained from the medical records of all dogs with eclampsia evaluated
   between 1995 and 1998 and compared with information from medical records
   of 31 of 102 dogs with dystocia evaluated during the same period.
   Results-Dogs with eclampsia weighed less. had a smaller body
   weight-to-litter size ratio, higher rectal temperature and heart and
   respiratory rates, and lower plasma total solids concentration than
   control dogs. Ionized calcium concentration was less than or equal to
   0.8 mmol/L for all but 1 of the affected dogs; median concentration for
   the affected dogs was significantly less than that for control dogs. Six
   (19\%) dogs did not manifest typical clinical signs associated with
   eclampsia. Twelve (39\%) dogs with eclampsia had previous litters, none
   had a history of eclampsia. Affected dogs were discharged from the
   hospital within hours after admission, but 3 dogs returned 1 to 3 weeks
   later because of recurrence of eclampsia.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Eclampsia develops primarily in
   small-breed dogs with large litters. Plasma ionized calcium
   concentrations > 0.8 mmol/L in dogs with clinical signs typical of
   hypocalcemia may indicate that other causes of clinical signs should be
   considered. In addition, some dogs with eclampsia may have low ionized
   calcium concentrations and not manifest typical clinical signs.}},

   159-169; Lavelle, J. Geophys. Res. 102 (1997) 3405-3420], are predicted
   from theory and experiments but have yet to be documented for
   hydrothermal plumes. In contrast, bifurcation of volcanic plumes (which
   are dynamically analogous to hydrothermal plumes) is very common
   {[}Ernst el al., Bull. Volcanol. 56 (1994) 159-169] and thus bifurcation
   of hydrothermal plumes should be expected {[}Lavelle, J. Geophys. Res.
   102(1997) 3405-3420; Ernst et al., BRIDGE Newslett. 10 (1996) 76-77].
   Recent 38 kHz echo-sounder and water-column chemical tracer studies near
   the Steinaholl vent site (Reykjanes Ridge, Iceland), identified a
   bubble-rich hydrothermal plume intruding at three levels (two main ones
   and a subsidiary one) before reaching the sea surface and spreading
   there {[}Ernst et al., BRIDGE Newslett. 10 (1996) 76-77; Olafsson et
   al., RIDGE Events 2 (1991) 35-38; German et al., Earth Planet. Sci.
   Lett. 121 (1994) 647-654]. The two main intrusions (ca. 100 and 200 m
   above the vent) show lateral development of two lobes away from the vent
   and are consistent with the 350 m rise of a bubble plume yielding
   seafloor and surface gas fluxes of similar to 2.5x10(-3) and 0.75x10(-1)
   m(3)/s, respectively. The bubble-rich core of the hydrothermal plume
   also penetrates the 150 m deep thermocline and generates an intrusion
   visible at the sea surface. Although bifurcation of the bent-over plume
   could have been initiated by crossflow alone {[}Ernst et al., Bull.
   Volcanol. 56 (1994) 159-169], several other processes may also have
   enhanced plume bifurcation; including interaction with the thermocline
   and entrainment of the plume lobes by horseshoe eddies in the lee of a
   150 m high hill on the seafloor. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Hall coefficient, electrical resistivity, and Seebeck coefficient of

   results showed maxima in both Hall coefficient and the electrical
   resistivity just below the onset of the intrinsic conduction range. This
   anomaly was qualitatively explained by the deviation of the Coulomb
   scattering from the usual assumption of independence due to the
   degenerate nature of the samples. The estimated energy gap for different
   samples of about 160 meV seems to confirm the existence of the second
   low temperature phase beta(2). This second phase is a probable reason
   for the relatively high thermoelectric figure of merit observed. (C)

Abstract = {{Background. The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) in kidney
   transplantation has improved early graft survival. However, its
   long-term use is associated with impairment of renal function and
   increased cardiovascular risk, factors. To avoid CsA-related long-term
   adverse effects, patients were converted to either azathioprine (AZA) or
   mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1 year after transplantation.
   Methods. Between September 1995 and January 1997, 64 stable renal
   transplant recipients on CsA and prednisone treatment were included in a
   prospective, randomized study. Patients were randomized for conversion
   of CsA to 2 mg/kg AZA (n=30) or 1 g of MMF twice daily (n=34). All
   patients remained on low-dose steroids. To decrease the total
   immunosuppressive load, a dose reduction in MMF and AZA was performed at
   4 and again at 8 months after conversion. Mycophenolic acid trough
   levels were measured at regular intervals.
   Results. After conversion, a decrease in serum creatinine was found for
   both groups: for MMF, 132 to 109 mu mol/L (P=0.016); and for AZA, 123 to
   112 mu mol/L (P<0.0001). After conversion, more acute rejections
   occurred in the AZA group (11/30) compared to the MMF group (4/34)
   (P=0.04), Dose reduction of MMF to 500 mg twice daily and of AZA to 1.0
   mg/kg elicited three rejections in both groups. The incidence of side
   effects and infections were similar.
   Conclusion, Discontinuation of CsA spared renal function. In patients
   converted to MMF significantly less rejections occurred compared to
   patients converted to AZA. Furthermore, dose reduction of both AZA and
   MMF is possible in the majority (72\%) of the patients.}},

Abstract = {{Most small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are synthesized by RNA polymerase II,
   but U6 snRNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase III. In the fruit fly
   Drosophila melanogaster the RNA polymerase specificity of the snRNA
   genes is determined by a few nucleotide differences within the proximal
   sequence element (PSE), a conserved sequence located similar to 40-65 bp
   upstream of the transcription start site. The PSE is essential for
   transcription of both RNA polymerase II-transcribed and RNA polymerase
   III-transcribed snRNA genes and is recognized in Drosophila by a
   multi-subunit protein factor termed DmPBP. Previous studies that
   employed site-specific protein-DNA photocrosslinking indicated that the
   conformation of the DNA-protein complex is different depending upon
   whether DmPBP is bound to a U1 or U6 PSE sequence. These conformational
   differences of the complex probably represent an early step in
   determining the selection of the correct RNA polymerase. We have now
   obtained evidence that DmPBP modestly bends the DNA upon interacting
   with the PSE and that the direction of DNA bending is similar for both
   the U1 and U6 PSEs. Under the assumption that DmPBP does not
   significantly twist the DNA, the direction of the bend in both cases is
   toward the face of the DNA helix contacted by the 45 kDa subunit of
   DmPBP. Together with data from partial proteolysis assays, these results
   indicate that the conformational differences in the complexes of DmPBP
   with the U1 and U6 PSEs more likely occur at the protein level rather
   than at the DNA level.}},

Abstract = {{The failure and flow of sea ice on scales small and large is
   characterized by the propagation of oriented leads and cracks. In this
   paper a theory for the dynamical treatment of anisotropic oriented flaws
   in sea ice is developed and used to examine the interaction of these
   oriented flaws under idealized stress forcing. The essential idea of the
   theory is to take one or more oriented weak leads imbedded in thick ice.
   A constitutive law for both the thin and thick ice is taken to be
   similar to laboratory observations, which are consistent with Mohr
   Coulomb-like failure. Application of normal continuum mechanics boundary
   conditions leads to anisotropic flow and failure characteristics of this
   anisotropic composite under both near- and far-field forcing. The local
   failure characteristics show that there is a preferred orientation for
   failure with the intersection between ``leads{''} increasing as
   confinement increases. For spatially separated interacting flaws the
   theory predicts a preference for the weakening of flaws in a narrow
   range of angles of similar to 10 degrees-20 degrees relative to the
   principal far-field stress. Imbedding isolated flaws leads to simulated
   damage directions consistent with local failure characteristics. In the
   case where the ice is considered to have available flaws in all
   directions, fracture propagation is found to proceed by picking out
   oriented flaws alternating in direction along large-scale damage strikes
   with individual flaw alignments of similar to 20 degrees relative to
   far-field principal stresses. The mechanisms responsible for these
   results and how this anisotropic sea ice rheology might be implemented
   in current dynamic/thermodynamic sea ice models are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Erythroid protein 4.1 (4.1R) is an 80-kd cytoskeletal protein that
   stabilizes the membrane-skeletal network structure underlying the lipid
   bilayer, Using the carboxyl terminal domain (22/24 kd) of 4.1R as bait
   in a yeast 5-hybrid screen, we isolated cDNA clones encoding a
   polypeptide of elF3-p44, which represents a subunit of a eukaryotic
   translation initiation factor 3 (elF3) complex. The elF3 complex
   consists of at least 10 subunits that play an essential role in the
   pathway of protein translation initiation, Northern blot analysis
   revealed that elF3-p44 (approximately 1.35 kb) is constitutively
   expressed in many tissues, The essential sequence for this interaction
   was mapped to the carboxyl-terminus of 4.1R (residues 525-622) and a
   region (residues 54-321) of elF3-p44, The direct association between
   4.1R and elF3-p44 was further confirmed by in vitro binding assays and
   coimmunoprecipitation studies. To characterize the functions of
   elF3-p44, we depleted elF3-p44 from rabbit reticulocyte lysates either
   by anti-elF3-p44 antibody or by GST/4.1R-80 fusion protein. Our results
   show that the elF3-p44 depleted cell-free translation system was unable
   to synthesize proteins efficiently, The direct association between 4.1R
   and elF3-p44 suggests that 4.1R may act as an anchor protein that links
   the cytoskeleton network to the translation apparatus.}},

Abstract = {{Cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and comparative
   genomic hybridization (CGH) were used to identify genes that are
   involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer. For that
   purpose, we chose a cell line established in vitro from a prostatic
   adenocarcinoma which was nontumorigenic in nude mice and followed its
   progression to a tumorigenic cell line. Stepwise changes were observed
   in the cell line as it became tumorigenic. The composite karyotype at
   the nontumorigenic stage (CA-HPV-10) was 68 similar to 77,XXY, -(1, 9,
   13, 14, 19, 22),+(4, 5, 11, 18, 20, 21),+ (del(1) (q23q31)=M1 (two
   copies), + der(9)t(1;9)(q24 similar to q31;p23) = M5(two
   copies),der(14)t(14;?)(q10;?) = M17 in the majority of metaphases. These
   two derivative chromosomes were also observed a previous study. Our CGH
   analysis clearly showed that this deleted region in M1 is, in fact,
   translocated with derivative M5 and, in reality, is amplified. The cell
   line established from nodule (SCID 5029 p11, showed a number of new
   changes, as described; however, the most significant change was
   amplification of the 8q23 similar to qter region, harboring c-myc. This
   region was translocated with chromosomes 2, 4, and 16 as der(2)
   t(2;8)(q33;q23)=M12, der(4)t(4;8)(q34;q23)=M11, and
   der(16)t(8;16)(q24;q21)=M9. We deduce from our study that amplification
   of c-myc and other genes in the 8q23 similar to qter region were
   important in progression but did not lead to tumorigenicity. The
   population that became tumorigenic (SCID 5019 II) showed almost all of
   the same changes in the karyotype as observed in the nodular cell line;
   the only significant change was the appearance of
   der(11)t(4;11)(q32;q22)=M7 and the addition of another copy of
   t(3q;7p)=M2. These new changes lead to loss of chromosomes 3p, 4pter
   similar to q34, 6, 7q21 similar to qter, 11q22 similar to qter, and 18q,
   and gain of 3q, 7p, 8q23 similar to qter, and 11pter similar to q22,
   before the cell line became tumorigenic. The clonal selection of the
   population is proven by the presence of a number of the same derivative
   chromosomes in both the nodular and tumorigenic cell line. As it
   progressed to tumorigenicity, some of the same changes observed in the
   original study re-appear at different stages of malignancy, although it
   was absent in the nontumorigenic cell line. These are: der(16)t(8;1
   6)(q24;q21)=M9 in the nodular cell line and der(11)t(4;11)(q32;q22)=M7
   in the tumorigenic cell line. In our system, amplificafion of c-myc and
   other genes in der(2)t(2;8)(q33;q23) =M12, der(4) t(4;8)(q34;q23= M11
   together with the presence of der(16)t(8;16)(q24;q21)=M9 and
   der(11)t(4;11)(q32;q22)=M5 makes the cell line tumorigenic. It is either
   nontumorigenic, with the presence of a marker equivalent to der(16)=M9
   and der(11)=M7 observed in the original study, and only nodular (SCIL)
   5019 p11, present study), with the presence of number of markers with
   c-myc amplification (M9, M11, and M12). There is accumulation of all the
   above-mentioned changes in the same cell before it becomes tumorigenic.

Abstract = {{Methamphetamine users are at increased risk of hepatitis A, but modes of
   transmission are unclear. The authors conducted a case-control study
   among methamphetamine users during an outbreak in Iowa in 1997.
   Twenty-eight reported, laboratory-confirmed, hepatitis A cases did not
   differ from 18 susceptible controls with respect to age, sex, or number
   of doses used. When compared with controls in multivariate analysis,
   case-patients were more likely to have injected methamphetamine (odds
   ratio (OR) = 5.5, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 27), to have used
   methamphetamine with another case-patient (OR = 6.2, 95\% CI: 0.95, 41),
   and to have used brown methamphetamine (OR = 5.5, 95\% CI: 0.51, 59).
   Receptive needle sharing was reported by 10 of the 20 case-patients who
   injected. Methamphetamine use with another case-patient was also
   associated with hepatitis A in an analysis restricted to noninjectors
   (OR = 17, 95\% CI: 1.0, 630). During this outbreak, hepatitis A may have
   been transmitted from person to person among methamphetamine users
   through the fecal-oral and the percutaneous routes. Methamphetamine
   users should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and should be given
   immune globulin if they used methamphetamine with a case-patient in the
   last 2 weeks. Persons who intend to continue using methamphetamine
   should be advised about safer practices.}},

Abstract = {{When spherical tensors are rotated by certain angles, coherence transfer
   selection rules may apply. For example, a pi rotation cleanly inverts
   the coherence order. A pi/2 rotation of a T-0(1) tensor creates only
   T-+/- 1(1) tensors. In this work estimations are given for the coherence
   transfer leakage under the action of rotations with small errors in the
   rotation angle or axis. Although the theory is stated with particular
   applications to NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) in mind it is equally
   applicable wherever nonideal rotations of spherical tensors are
   considered (e.g., quantum computing and relaxation theory). In NMR it is
   useful for the estimation of coherence transfer leakage, especially in
   pulse sequences with many n pi pulses. The results are also applicable
   to spinors and half-integer representations of the rotation group. (C)

Abstract = {{In the present study, we show that IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 are able
   to induce functional CXCR4 surface expression on resting in
   vitro-generated CD4(+) CXCR4(-) CCR7(+) memory T cells.
   Cytokine-mediated induction of CXCR4 expression was associated with an
   increase in CXCR4 transcription, enhanced stromal-derived
   factor-1-induced T cell migration in vitro, and increased susceptibility
   of these cells to infection with X4 strains of HIV-1, CXCR4 expression
   could also be induced through an alternative pathway, following
   coculture of these cells with CD40-activated, autologous, CD34(+)
   progenitor-derived dendritic cells. Although these dendritic cells
   express transcripts for IL-7 and IL-15, addition of neutralizing
   anti-IL-7R and IL-15 mAbs did not block induction of CXCR4 expression.
   Indeed, dendritic cell-mediated up-regulation of CXCR4 expression was
   found to depend on CD40/CD154 and CD134/CD134L interactions. Whereas
   activated autologous dendritic cells induced the expression of both
   CXCR4 and CD25 on a portion of CCR7(+) memory T cells, concomitant
   CD3-mediated activation of these cells further enhanced CD25 expression,
   but, in contrast, prevented induction of CXCR4 expression. This
   observation suggests that triggering of the CD134 and CD154 molecules,
   in contrast to TCR/CD3 complex-mediated stimulation, results in
   simultaneous T cell activation and CXCR4 expression. Taken together,
   these results show that common gamma-chain-interacting cytokines as well
   as signals mediated via noncognate interactions between activated
   dendritic cells and memory T cells are involved in the up-regulation of

Abstract = {{Site-specific S-glutathionylation is emerging as a novel mechanism by
   which S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) may modify functionally important
   protein thiols. Here, we show that GSNO-Sepharose mimicks site-specific
   S-glutathionylation of the transcription factors c-Jun and p50 by free
   GSNO in vitro. Both c-Jun and p50 were found to bind to immobilized GSNO
   through the formation of a mixed disulphide, involving a conserved
   cysteine residue located in the DNA-binding domains of these
   transcription factors. Furthermore, we show that c-jun, p50, glycogen
   phosphorylase b, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, creatine
   kinase, glutaredoxin and caspase-3 can be precipitated from a mixture of
   purified thiol-containing proteins by the formation of a
   mixed-disulphide bond with GSNO Sepharose. With few exceptions, protein
   binding to this matrix correlated well with the susceptibility of the
   investigated proteins to undergo GSNO- but not diamide-induced
   mixed-disulphide formation in vitro. Finally, it is shown that covalent
   GSNO-Sepharose chromatography of HeLa cell nuclear extracts results in
   the enrichment of proteins which incorporate glutathione in response to
   GSNO treatment. As suggested by DNA-binding assays, this group of
   nuclear proteins include the transcription factors activator protein-1,
   nuclear factor-kappa B and cAMP-response-element-binding protein. In
   conclusion, we introduce GSNO-Sepharose as a probe for site-specific
   S-glutathionylation and as a novel and potentially useful tool to
   isolate and identify proteins which are candidate targets for
   GSNO-induced mixed-disulphide formation.}},

Abstract = {{Malonamidase (MA) E2 was previously purified and characterized from
   Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110. The gene encoding this enzyme has
   been cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The
   recombinant MAE2 was purified to homogeneity from the transformed E.
   coli. The biochemical properties of the recombinant enzyme are
   essentially identical to those from wild-type B. japonicum. A database
   search showed that the MAE2 protein has a high sequence similarity with
   the common signature sequences of the amidase family. The only exception
   is that the aspartic residue in these signature sequences is replaced by
   a glutamine residue. In order to identify amino acid residues essential
   for enzyme activity, a series of site-directed mutagenesis studies and
   steady-state kinetic experiments were performed. Gln(195), Ser(199),
   Cys(207) and Lys(213) of the common signature sequences were selected
   for site-directed mutagenesis. Among the mutants, Q195D, Q195E and S199C
   showed less than 0.02\% of the k(cat) value of the wild-type enzyme, and
   S199A, Q195L and Q195N exhibited no detectable catalytic activities.
   Mutants (K213L, K213R and K213H) obtained by replacement of the only
   conserved basic residue, Lys(213), in the signature sequences, also
   displayed significant reductions (approx. 380-fold) in K-cat value,
   whereas C207A kept Full activity. These results suggest that MAE2 may
   catalyse hydrolysis of malonamate by a novel catalytic mechanism, in
   which Gln(195), Ser(199) and Lys(213) are involved.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously identified several genes whose RNA products are
   induced in HA-1 hamster cells under conditions where a cytoprotective
   adaptive response is observed. One of these genes, designated adapt78,
   was found to have a human homolog with some homology to
   glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78). We subsequently determined that
   adapt78 and grp78 mRNAs are induced by the same stress agents and
   conclude that adapt78 is a stress-response gene and putative new member
   of the grp stress gene family. Here we extend these studies to assess
   the effect of overexpressing adapt78 on stress protection and growth
   arrest. HA-1 cells stably transfected with adapt78 cDNA were found to
   exhibit significantly reduced calcium- and hydrogen peroxide-mediated
   cytotoxicity as compared with control transfectants. In addition,
   adapt78 stable overexpressors exhibited significantly reduced cell
   growth. Both cytoprotection and growth arrest accompanied only modest
   overexpression of adapt78. Flow cytometry revealed that the growth
   arrest occurred in G(1)-phase. Immunoflourescent analysis revealed that
   Adapt78 protein exhibits significant perinuclear staining suggestive of
   endoplasmic reticulum localization in addition to cytoplasmic
   localization. These data indicate that adapt78 is both cytoprotective
   and growth suppressive and that these effects may be mediated by Adapt78
   protein at the endoplasmic reticulum. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The G protein-coupled CXC-chemokine receptor CXCR-2 mediates activation
   of neutrophil effector functions in response to multiple ligands,
   including IL-8 and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2). Although
   CXCR-2 has been successfully cloned and expressed in several cell lines,
   the molecular properties of the native neutrophil-expressed receptor
   have remained largely undefined, Here we report on the identification
   and characterization of distinct CXCR-2 glycoforms and their subcellular
   distribution in neutrophils, Immunoprecipitation and Western blot
   analyses of surface-expressed receptors covalently linked to IL-8 or
   NAP-2 as well as in their unloaded state revealed the occurrence of a
   single CXCR-2 variant with an apparent size of 56 kDa. According to
   deglycosylation experiments surface-expressed CXCR-2 carries two
   N-linked 9-kDa carbohydrate moieties that are both of complex structure.
   In addition, two other CXCR-2 variants of 38 and 40 kDa were found to
   occur exclusively intracellular and to carry N-glycosylations of high
   mannose or hybrid type, These receptors did not participate in
   ligand-induced receptor trafficking, while surface-expressed CXCR-2 was
   internalized and re-expressed following stimulation with NAP-2, By
   enzymatic removal of one 9-kDa carbohydrate moiety in surface-expressed
   CXCR-2 we can show that neither NAP-2-induced trafficking nor signaling
   of the receptor is dependent on its full glycosylation, Instead,
   glycosylation was found to protect CXCR-2 from proteolytic attack, as
   even partial deglycosylation is associated with serine protease-mediated
   disappearance of the receptor from the neutrophil surface, Thus,
   although not directly involved in signaling, glycosylation appears to be
   required to maintain neutrophil responsiveness to CXC-chemokines during
   inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Aldehyde-containing triterpene saponins have adjuvant properties, but

   saponins have two normonoterpene ester moieties, linked linearly to
   their fucosyl residue, that play a critical role in the stimulation of
   CTL. These ester moieties are also responsible for these saponins'
   instability and toxicity. Based on the structure-activity relationships
   for the different groups of Q. saponaria saponins, new semi-synthetic
   analogs were developed that have the adjuvanticity of quillaja saponins,
   yet with less toxicity and greater stability in aqueous solutions. The
   quillaja saponin analogs were prepared by replacing their hydrolytically
   unstable ester groups with another lipophilic chain linked by a stable
   amide bond on these saponins' glucuronic acid residue. One of these
   analogs, GPI-0100, is a dodecylamide saponin derivative that stimulates

Abstract = {{Genes MAGE, BAGE, GAGE and LAGE-1/NY-ESO-1 code for antigens that are

   tumors of various histological types and not on normal tissues, these
   antigens qualify for cancer immunotherapy, To identify new genes with
   tumor-specific expression, we applied a cDNA subtraction approach, i.e.,
   representational difference analysis, to a human sarcoma cell line. We
   obtained two cDNA clones that appeared to be tumor specific, The
   corresponding genes were named SAGE and HAGE because they have the same
   pattern of expression as genes of the MAGE family. SAGE encodes a
   putative protein of 904 amino acids and shows no homology to any
   recorded gene. Like the MAGE-A genes, it is located in the q28 region of
   chromosome X. Expression of gene SAGE was observed mainly in bladder
   carcinoma, lung carcinoma, and head and neck carcinoma but not in normal
   tissues, with the exception of testis, Gene MAGE, which is located on
   chromosome 6, encodes a putative protein of 648 amino acids. This
   protein is a new member of the DEAD-box family of ATP-dependent RNA
   helicases. Gene HAGE is expressed in many tumors of various histological
   types at a level that is 100-fold higher than the level observed in
   normal tissues except testis, Because of this tumor-specific expression,
   genes SAGE and HAGE ought to encode antigens that could be useful for
   antitumoral therapeutic vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Evaluation of results a longer than 10-year-follow-up of
   patients with upper cervical lesions due to rheumatoid arthritis who
   underwent occipitocervical fusion.
   Objective. To determine the final outcome of patients with upper
   cervical lesions due to rheumatoid arthritis treated by occipitocervical
   fusion.
   Summary of Background Data. There are few studies reporting the final
   outcome of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated by
   occipitocervical fusion and observed for longer than 10 years.
   Methods. The subjects were 16 patients with rheumatoid arthritis with
   myelopathy who underwent occipito-cervical fusion with a rectangular rod
   more than 10 years ago. All patients had irreducible atlantoaxial
   dislocation, and 11 also had vertical dislocation of the axis. All
   patients had preoperative nuchal pain, and were classified into Class II
   (two patients), Class IIIA (nine patients), and class IIIB (five
   patients) according to Ranawat's pre-operative neurologic
   classification.
   Results. The atlas-dens interval remained the same as immediately after
   surgery. Vertical dislocation returned to the preoperative condition,
   despite successful surgical correction. Preoperative occipital pain
   disappeared or was reduced in all cases. Myelopathy improved in 12 of
   the 16 patients (75\%) by more than one class in the Ranawat
   preoperative neurologic classification. Survival rate at 10 years after
   surgery was 38\%; mean age at death was 70.7 years. The postoperative
   periods during which patients could walk by themselves ranged from 6
   months to 13 years (mean, 7.5 years).
   Conclusions. Occipitocervical fusion for patients with rheumatoid
   arthritis is useful for decreasing nuchal pain, reducing myelopathy, and
   improving prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular properties of CA1 neurons were studied in hippocampal slices 24
   hr after acquisition of trace eyeblink conditioning in young adult and
   aging rabbits. Aging rabbits required significantly more trials than
   young rabbits to reach a behavioral criterion of 60\% conditioned
   responses in an 80 trial session. Intracellular recordings revealed that
   CA1 neurons from aging control rabbits had significantly larger, longer
   lasting postburst afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) and greater spike
   frequency adaptation (accommodation) relative to those from young adult
   control rabbits. After learning, both young and aging CA1 neurons
   exhibited increased postsynaptic excitability compared with their
   respective age-matched control rabbits (naive and rabbits that failed to
   learn). Thus, after learning, CA1 neurons from both age groups had
   reduced postburst AHPs and reduced accommodation. No learning-related
   differences were seen in resting membrane potential, membrane time
   constant, neuron input resistance, or action potential characteristics.
   Furthermore, comparisons between CA1 neurons from trace-conditioned
   aging and trace-conditioned young adult rabbits revealed no
   statistically significant differences in postburst AHPs or
   accommodation, indicating that similar levels of postsynaptic
   excitability were attained during successful acquisition of trace
   eyeblink conditioning, regardless of rabbit age. These data represent
   the first in vitro demonstration of learning-related excitability
   changes in aging rabbit CA1 neurons and provide additional evidence for
   involvement of changes in postsynaptic excitability of CA1 neurons in
   both aging and learning.}},

Abstract = {{A decentralized control configuration is proposed for the
   semicontinuous, extractive distillation of a low-boiling azeotropic
   mixture of acetone and methanol. The separation is performed in a
   middle-vessel column (MVC), having a large external middle vessel, from
   which the column is fed, and to which a full-liquid sidedraw from the
   stage above the feed tray is sent. The extractive agent, water, feeds
   the column on a scheduled basis to facilitate the separation. Based upon
   the simplicity of a decentralized configuration and the desire to avoid
   controller overrides, a DB-control configuration is selected. This
   configuration, in which the distillate flow rate is manipulated to
   control the composition of the distillate, and the bottoms flow rate is
   manipulated to control the composition of the bottoms product, has been
   widely labeled as inoperable. Herein, the configuration is shown to
   perform satisfactorily when a middle vessel with a full-liquid sidedraw
   is utilized. A cyclic campaign is simulated showing the satisfactory
   performance of the DB-MVC control configuration. The advantages of the
   control configuration are discussed and design specifics are provided.
   An analysis of the campaign, highlighting the problems overcome, is
   given. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The self-diffusion of hydrogen on the (100) copper surface is
   investigated using a quantum kinetic equation approach. The dynamics of
   the adatom is described with a multiple-band model and the surface
   phonons represent the thermal bath responsible for the diffusion
   mechanism. Using the Wigner distribution formalism, the diffusive motion
   of the adatom is characterized in terms of the correlation functions of
   the adatom-phonon interaction. The diffusion coefficient exhibits two
   terms related to phonon mediated tunneling (incoherent part) and to
   dephasing limited coherent motion (coherent part). The competition
   between these two contributions induced a transition from a thermally
   activated regime to an almost temperature independent regime at a
   crossover temperature T{*}. A numerical analysis is performed using a
   well-established semiempirical potential to describe the adatom-surface
   interaction and a slab calculation to characterize the surface phonons.
   These calculations show that two-phonon processes represent the relevant
   contribution involved in the adatom-phonon coupling. The temperature
   dependence of the diffusion constant is thus presented and the relative
   contribution of the incoherent versus the coherent part is analyzed.
   Both contributions exhibit a change of behavior around 100 K from an
   exponential to a power law temperature dependence as the temperature
   decreases. This change is due to the confinement of the motion of the
   adatom in the ground energy band at low temperature. The incoherent part
   is shown to be the dominant contribution at high temperature and is
   characterized by an activation energy and a prefactor equal to Delta
   E=0.49 +/- 0.01 eV and D(0)approximate to 2.44x10(-3) cm(2)/s,
   respectively. At low temperature, the power law dependence of the two
   contributions is different since the coherent part increases slowly as
   the temperature decreases whereas the incoherent part decreases. The
   crossover temperature is estimated to be equal to T{*}=125 K. Below
   T{*}, the coherent part becomes the main contribution and the diffusion
   constant exhibits an almost temperature independent behavior. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The interlayer magnetoresistance of the quasi-two-dimensional organic
   conductor alpha-(BEDT-TTF)(2)TlHg(SCN)(4) was measured during both up
   and down sweeps of long-pulse magnetic fields extending up to 36 T. The
   temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram was extensively studied through
   the field and temperature dependences of both the background and the
   oscillatory parts of the magnetoresistance. The hysteretic behavior of
   the magnetoresistance, the field-dependent Peierls-Like transition
   temperature (T-P), and the temperature-dependent kink transition were
   investigated. The field sensitivity of T-P is interpreted on the basis
   of a competition between the Pauli and orbital effects in a mixed-charge
   and spin-density-wave state. Besides, a splitting of the kink transition
   is observed when the magnetic field is strongly tilted with respect to
   the normal to the conducting plane. Analysis of the oscillatory part of
   the magnetoresistance reveals a hysteretic behavior of the amplitude of
   the oscillations linked to the rr orbit around both the kink transition
   and B-max. Field-independent effective cyclotron mass parameters are
   derived in both the density wave and the normal metallic states.}},

   the Canlong local fauna. This form is characterized by brachyodont and

   premolars, whose talonids are large and rather crescentic although
   lacking entoconids; the mandible is slender with a short symphysis, the

   backward-expanded. Plesiomorphic peculiarities of Mekodontherium bring
   to light that it was rather close to the stem from which the genera

Abstract = {{Study Design. A prospective randomized trial in 97 patients with a
   whiplash injury caused by a motor vehicle collision.
   Objectives. The study evaluates early active mobilization versus a
   standard treatment protocol and the importance of early versus delayed
   onset of treatment.
   Summary of Background Data. There is no compelling evidence to date on
   the management of acute whiplash-associated disorders. The few studies
   describing treatment, however, provide evidence to support the
   recommendation that an active treatment in the acute stage is preferable
   to rest and a soft collar in most patients.
   Methods. Patients were randomized to four groups. Active versus standard
   treatment and early (within 96 hours) versus delayed (after 2 weeks)
   treatment. Measures of range of motion and pain were registered
   initially and at 6 months.
   Results. Eighty-eight patients (91\%) could be followed up at 6 months.
   Active treatment reduced pain more than standard treatment (P < 0.001).
   When type and onset of treatment were analyzed, a combined effect was
   seen. When active treatment was provided, it was better when
   administered early, and if standard treatment was provided, it was
   better when administered late for reduction of pain (P = 0.04) and
   increasing cervical flexion (P = 0.01).
   Conclusions. in patients with whiplash-associated disorders caused by a
   motor vehicle collision treatment with frequently repeated active
   submaximal movements combined with mechanical diagnosis and therapy is
   more effective in reducing pain than a standard program of initial rest,
   recommended use of a soft collar, and gradual self-mobilization. This
   therapy could be performed as home exercises initiated and supported by
   a physiotherapist.}},

Abstract = {{The R\&D pipeline management problem has far-reaching economic
   implications for new-product-development driven industries, such as
   pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agrochemical industries. Effective
   decision-making is required with respect to portfolio selection and
   project task scheduling in the face of significant uncertainty and an
   ever-constrained resource pool. In this paper, the here-and-now
   stochastic optimization problem inherent to the management of an R\&D
   pipeline is described in its most general form. Subsequently, a
   computing architecture, Sim-Opt, is presented that combines mathematical
   programming and discrete event system simulation to assess the
   uncertainty and control the risk present in the pipeline. The concept of
   timelines, that studies multiple unique realizations of the controlled
   evolution of the discrete-event pipeline system, is introduced. Three
   different implementations of the decision-making module in Sim-Opt have
   been described and studied through an example case study. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the recovery from early local pulmonary injury after
   irradiation and to determine whether regional differences exist.
   Methods: For 110 patients treated for breast cancer or malignant
   lymphoma, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion
   and ventilation scans and CT scans were made before, 3, 18, and 48
   months after radiotherapy. Dose-effect relations for changes in local
   perfusion, ventilation, and density were determined for each individual
   patient using spatially correlated SPECT and CT data sets, for each
   follow-up period. Average dose-effect relations for both subgroups were
   determined, as well as dose-effect relations for different regions.
   Results: In general, partial improvement of local pulmonary injury was
   observed between 3 and 18 months for each of the three endpoints. After
   18 months, no further improvement was seen. Patients with breast cancer
   and malignant lymphoma showed a similar improvement (except for the
   perfusion parameter), which was attributed to a recovery from the early
   radiation response and could not be explained by contraction effects of
   fibrosis of lung parenchyma. No regional differences in radiosensitivity
   18 months after treatment were observed, except for the dorsal versus
   ventral region. This difference was attributed to a gravity-related
   effect in the measuring procedure.
   Conclusion: For all patients, a partial recovery from early local
   perfusion, ventilation, and density changes, was seen between 3 and 18
   months after radiotherapy. After 18 months, local lung function did not
   further improve (lymphoma patients). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Mannan-binding lectin (MEL) and Clq activate the complement cascade via
   attached serine proteases, The proteases Clr and Cls were initially
   discovered in a complex with Clq, whereas the MEL-associated serine
   proteases 1 and 2 (MASP-1 and -2) were discovered in a complex with MEL.
   There is controversy as to whether MBL can utilize Clr and Cls or,
   inversely, whether Clq can utilize MASP-1 and 2, Serum deficient in Clr
   produced no complement activation in IgG-coated microwells, whereas
   activation was seen in mannan-coated microwells, In serum, Clr and Cls
   were found to be associated only with Clq, whereas MASP-1, MASP-2, and a
   third protein, MAp19 (19-kDa MEL-associated protein), were found to be
   associated only with MEL. The bulk of MASP-1 and MAp19 was found in
   association with each other and was not bound to MEL or MASP-2, The
   interactions of MASP-1, MASP-2, and MAp19 with MEL differ from those of
   Clr and Cls with Clq in that both high salt concentrations and calcium
   chelation (EDTA) are required to fully dissociate the MASPs or MAp19
   from MEL, In the presence of calcium, most of the MASP-1, MASP-2, and
   MAp19 emerged on gel-permeation chromatography as large complexes that
   were not associated with MEL, whereas in the presence of EDTA most of
   these components formed smaller complexes. Over 95\% of the total MASPs
   and MAp19 found in serum are not complexed with MBL.}},

   butorphanol (a mu/delta/kappa mixed opioid receptor agonist) for 3 days,
   Naloxone precipitated withdrawal syndrome and decreased the levels of DA

   obtained were similar to those of morphine-dependent rats except for the
   changes in DOPAC levels, Concomitant infusion of H-7 and opioid blocked
   both the expression of withdrawal signs and the decreases in DA, DOPAC,
   and HVA levels in a dose-dependent manner, These results suggest that
   the enhancement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and/or protein kinase C
   activity accompanying the increase of DA neuron activity during
   continuous infusion of opioids leads to an abrupt reduction in levels of
   DA and its metabolites precipitated by naloxone, which is intimately

Abstract = {{One of the major binding sites for factor VIII inhibitors is located
   within the A2 domain. In this study, phage display technology was used
   to isolate 2 human monoclonal antibodies, termed VK34 and VK41, directed
   toward the heavy chain of factor VIII. The V-H domain of a single-chain
   variable domain antibody fragment (scFv) VK34 is encoded by germline
   gene segment DP-10, Epitope-mapping studies revealed that scFv VK34 is
   directed against amino acid residues Arg(489)-Ile(508) , a previously
   identified binding site for factor VIII inhibitors in the A2 domain.
   ScFv VK34 inhibited factor VIII activity with a titer of 280 BU/mg. The
   V-H domain of VK41 was encoded by germline gene segment DP-47, A phage
   corresponding to VK41 competed with a monoclonal antibody for binding to
   amino acid residues Asp(712)-Ala(736) in the acidic region adjacent to
   the A2 domain. Reactivity of VK41 with a factor VIII variant in which we
   replaced amino acid residues Asp(712)-Ala(736) for the corresponding
   region of heparin cofactor II was strongly reduced. In addition,
   substitution of Tyr(718,719,723) for Phe abrogated binding of VK41 to
   factor VIII. ScFv VK41 did not inhibit factor VIII activity. This study
   not only defines the primary structure of human anti-factor VIII
   antibodies reactive with the A2 domain, it also describes an antibody
   with an epitope not previously identified in the antibody repertoire of
   hemophilia patients with an inhibitor, (C) 2000 by The American Society

Abstract = {{We investigate the scaling properties of eigenstates of a
   one-dimensional Anderson model in the presence of a constant electric
   field. The states show a transition from exponential to factorial
   localization. For infinite systems this transition can be described by a
   simple scaling law based on a single parameter lambda(infinity) =
   l(infinity)/l(el), the ratio between the Anderson localization length
   l(el) and the Stark localization length l(el). For finite samples,
   however, the system size N enters the problem as a third parameter. In
   that case the global structure of eigenstates is uniquely determined by
   two scaling parameters lambda(N) = l(infinity)/N and lambda(infinity) =
   l infinity/l(el).}},

Abstract = {{A giant Paleodictyon gomezi with a maximum mesh diameter of 13 cm and
   covering more than 0.5 m(2) occurs in the lower Eocene flysch near
   Zumaya. The giant Paleodictyon occurs with flute casts and, therefore,
   must have been produced deeply in the sediment. The lengthening of mesh
   cells parallel and perpendicular to the flute casts implies changing
   current directions during trace production. Rows of elongate and offset
   mesh cells reflect the row-by-row production of the trace; however: the
   base line followed by the trace fossil producer (meandering or spiral)
   cannot be reconstructed because of incomplete preservation. The
   extraordinary size of this giant Paleodictyon contradicts the
   evolutionary trend of deep-sea trace fossils toward optimization and
   miniaturization, since similar large Paleodictyon specimens occur in
   Silurian flysch. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mixed integer linear programming model has been developed for the
   production scheduling of polybutene (PB) process of Daelim Industrial
   Co. (DIC) in Korea. The PB process is composed of one reactor, 13
   storage tanks and two package types. It produces seven reactor products.
   Most of the tanks are practically dedicated to a specific product but in
   general, any tanks can be shared by multiple products. Also, two major
   products use multiple tanks. The reactor is operated on block mode. The
   products are liquid and they should be stored in tanks before packaging.
   The unique characteristics of this scheduling problem exists on the fact
   that the product in tank should be locked for 3-15 days in order to
   check the quality specifications after run-down from the reactor. The
   primary objective of scheduling is reducing the number of quality
   checking process because it causes great loss in production time and
   tank utilization. The model is composed of about 1500-2000 integer
   variables. The branching priorities are adjusted according to the
   importance of variables based on current manual scheduling practice and
   it greatly enhanced the convergence of mixed integer model. The
   scheduling system was successfully implemented in real plant and
   replaced the manual work of scheduler. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Particle and string actions on coset spaces typically lack a quadratic
   kinetic term, making their quantization difficult. We define a nation of
   twisters on these spaces, which are hypersurfaces in a vector space that
   transform linearly under the isometry group of the coset. By associating
   the points of the coset space with these hypersurfaces, and the internal
   coordinates of these hypersurfaces with momenta, it is possible to
   construct manifestly symmetric actions with leading quadratic terms. We
   give a general algorithm and work out the case of a particle on AdS(p)
   explicity. In this case, the resulting action is a world-line gauge
   theory with sources (the gauge roup depending on p), which is equivalent
   to a nonlocal world-line sigma model.}},

Abstract = {{A novel protein kinase, TOPK (T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase), was
   isolated from a lymphokine-activated killer T (T-LAK) cell subtraction
   cDNA fragment library. The open reading frame of the TOPK gene encodes a
   protein of 322 amino acids, possessing a protein kinase domain profile.
   The cap site analysis of the 5'-end of TOPK mRNA revealed two forms, a
   major full-length form and a minor spliced form at the 5'-site, both
   encoding the same protein. A BLAST homology search and phylogenetic
   analysis indicated that TOPK is related to dual specific
   mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK). The transfection of the
   TOPK gene to COS-7 cells up-regulated a phosphorylation of p38 MAPK but
   not ERK1/2 or SAPK/JNK. Gel precipitation study indicated that TOPK
   protein can be associated with p38 in vitro. Tissue distribution of TOPK
   mRNA expression was specific for the testis, T-LAK cells, activated
   lymphoid cells, and lymphoid tumors. On the other hand, deactivated
   T-LAK, cells did not show TOPK mRNA expression. These data suggest that
   TOPK is a newly identified member of a novel MEK3/6-related MAPKK that
   may be enrolled in the activation of lymphoid cells and support
   testicular functions.}},

   prepared by enantiodifferentiation processes involving Pseudomonas

   For the resolution of amine 9, we have found that utilization of
   triethylamine as non-reactive base enhances the reaction rate and the
   enantioselectivity of the process. The key coupling reaction of (R)-6
   and (R)-9 has been conducted through derivatization of the amine with
   the labile trimethylsilyl group, which liberates the amino group of the
   resulting amino alcohol (R,R)-11 upon column chromatography

   zone. The leaves were collected from adult trees in December and April.
   The measurement was made with a white beam of synchrotron radiation
   calibrated with thin samples from MicroMatter, The results indicate that
   some metals such as Ti, V, Fe and Zn have major content in samples that
   were collected in places with a high traffic flow, even in the leaves
   that have been washed, The levels of Mn, Co, Cu and Ni did not show
   significant differences between the samples. The Pb level also did not
   vary significantly. This was expected because in Brazil gasoline without
   Pb has been used for many years. The results seem to indicate that the
   leaves from Nerium oleander absorb metals from the atmosphere and may be
   used as an environmental indicator. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   crystals is not well known at the microscopic level. This drawback makes
   impossible the adequate rationalisation of the already known molecular
   magnets and, in the long run, stops the progress towards a rational

   the properties of the intermolecular magnetic interactions (also known
   as through-space magnetism) on nitronyl nitroxides, obtained by
   combining the analysis of molecular crystals with high level ab initio
   computations. These results show that the magnetic properties of
   nitronyl nitroxides cannot be rationalized by looking only at the
   relative orientations of the ONCNO groups, the spin containing groups in
   nitronyl nitroxides, as assumed up to now. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Barx1 and Barx2 are homeodomain proteins originally identified using
   regulatory elements of genes encoding certain cell adhesion molecules
   (CAMs). In the present study, we characterize regions of Barx2 that bind
   to regulatory elements of genes encoding three CAMs, L1, neuron-glia
   CAIM (Ng-CAM), and neural CAM (N-CAM), and identify domains of Barx2
   that regulate N-CAM transcription. The homeodomain of Barx2 was
   sufficient for binding to homeodomain binding sites (HBS) from all three
   CAM genes. The presence of a 17-amino acid Barx basic region resulted in
   a 2-fold decrease in binding to HBS sequences from the Ng-CAM and L1
   genes, whereas it led to a 6.5-fold increase in binding to the HBS from
   the N-CAM promoter. Thus, the Barx basic region influences the strength
   and specificity of Barx2 binding to DNA In co-transfection experiments,
   Barx2 repressed N-CAM promoter activity. A 24-residue N-terminal region
   of Barx2 was essential for repression. When this region was absent,
   Barx2 activated the N-CAM promoter. A 63-residue C-terminal domain was
   required for this activation, In GST pull-down experiments, Barx2 bound
   to proteins of the CREB family, CREB1 and ATF2. Overall, these findings
   provide a framework for understanding developmental and physiological
   contexts that influence repressor or activator functions of Barx2.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the delta agonists SNC80 and deltorphin II on ambulation

   30, 60 nmol, i.c.v.) induced similar, dose-dependent biphasic locomotor
   effects in non-habituated subjects. An initial decrease in exploratory
   activity was associated with anxiogenic signs such as pile-erection,
   freezing behaviour and pupil dilation for each drug. Pre-treatment with
   the 6 antagonist naltrindole (10 nmol, i.c.v.) inhibited the depressant
   effect, but not the subsequent stimulant effect, on locomotor activity
   in response to 30 nmol deltorphin II in this assay (P<0.05). In
   habituated rats, deltorphin II (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 3 nmol, i.c.v.) caused
   significant, naltrindole-reversible increases in locomotor activity
   (P<0.05 for all doses) at 1000-fold lower doses than those required for
   a similar response to SNC80 (10, 30, 100, 300 nmol, i.c.v.).
   Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that these compounds penetrate the brain
   to similar extents following i.c.v. injection. The substantial potency
   difference between deltorphin II and SNC80 in stimulating locomotor
   activity in habituated rats suggests pharmacological heterogeneity for
   these delta opioid receptor agonists. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All

Abstract = {{The M.FokI adenine-N-6 DNA methyltransferase recognizes the asymmetric
   DNA sequence GGATG/CATCC. It consists of two domains each containing all
   motifs characteristic for adenine-N-6 DNA methyltransferases. We have
   studied the specificity of DNA-methylation by both domains using 27
   hemimethylated oligonucleotide substrates containing recognition sites
   which differ in one or two base pairs from GGATG or CATCC. The
   N-terminal domain of M.FokI interacts very specifically with
   GGATG-sequences, because only one of the altered sites is modified. In
   contrast, the C-terminal domain shows lower specificity. It prefers
   CATCC-sequences but only two of the 12 star sites (i.e. sites that
   differ in 1 bp from the recognition site) are not accepted and some star
   sites are modified with rates reduced only 2-3-fold. In addition,
   GGATGC- and CGATGC-sites are modified which differ at two positions from
   CATCC. DNA binding experiments show that the N-terminal domain
   preferentially binds to hemimethylated GGATG/C(m)ATCC sequences whereas
   the C-terminal domain binds to DNA with higher affinity but without
   specificity. Protein-protein interaction assays show that both domains
   of M.FokI are in contact with each other. However, several DNA-binding
   experiments demonstrate that DNA-binding of both domains is mutually
   exclusive in full-length M.FokI and both domains do not functionally
   influence each other. The implications of these results on the molecular
   evolution of type IIS restriction/modification systems are discussed.

Abstract = {{To examine the variations in regional cerebral blood flow during
   execution and learning of reaching movements, we employed a family of
   kinematically and dynamically controlled motor tasks in which cognitive,
   mnemonic and executive features of performance were differentiated and
   characterized quantitatively. During O-15-labeled water positron
   emission tomography (PET) scans, twelve right-handed subjects moved
   their dominant hand on a digitizing tablet:From a central location to
   equidistant targets displayed with a cursor on a computer screen in
   synchrony with a tone. In the preceding week, all subjects practiced
   three motor tasks: 1) movements to a predictable sequence of targets; 2)
   learning of new visuomotor transformations in which screen cursor motion
   was rotated by 30 degrees-60 degrees; 3) learning new target sequences
   by trial and error, by using previously acquired routines in a task
   placing heavy load on spatial working memory. The control condition was
   observing screen and audio displays. Subtraction images were analyzed
   with Statistical Parametric Mapping to identify significant brain
   activation foci. Execution of predictable sequences was characterized by
   a modest decrease in movement time and spatial error. The underlying
   pattern of activation involved primary motor and sensory areas,
   cerebellum, basal ganglia. Adaptation to a rotated reference frame, a
   form of procedural learning, was associated with decrease in the imposed
   directional bias. This task was associated with activation in the right
   posterior parietal cortex. New sequences were learned explicitly.
   Significant activation was found in dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior
   cingulate cortices. In this study, we have introduced a series of
   flexible motor tasks with similar kinematic characteristics and
   different spatial attributes. These tasks can be used to assess specific
   aspects of motor learning with imaging in health and disease. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Angiotensin II (Ang PI) stimulates the activation of extracellular
   signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a subgroup of the mitogen-activated
   protein kinase (MAPK) family, in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells
   (VSMC). This ERR activation was recently shown to be a critical
   regulatory factor for Ang II-mediated migration and growth. Pt has been
   demonstrated that the thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TRO) blocked Ang
   II-induced DNA synthesis and migration in VSMC. Here we provide evidence
   for TRO to inhibit Ang II-induced ERK activation which was suggested to
   constitute the mechanism by which this agent blocks Ang II-induced VSMC
   growth and migration. We have found that pretreatment with PD98059,
   which selectively blocks the activity of ERI( pathway at the level of
   MAPK kinase, decreased Ang II-induced AP-1 activation and that TRO is
   capable of inhibiting Ang II-induced AP-1 activation. On the other hand,
   the other thiazolidinediones pioglitazone (PIO) and rosiglitazone (ROSI)
   had little effect on Ang II-induced activation of ERK or AP-1,
   suggesting the inhibitory effects of TRO on VSMC activation by Ang TI be
   independent of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma
   (PPAR gamma) for which thiazolidinediones are ligands. Ang II-induced
   ERK activation was inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC)-specific
   inhibitor GF109203X while TRO was also able to block PRC activator
   phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced ERK activation.
   Accordingly, TRO may inhibit Ang II-induced MAPK activation at least
   partly by an inhibition of PKC. These results support the assumption
   that by targeting MAPK activation, TRO may inhibits the critical
   signaling steps leading to restenosis and atherosclerosis that may
   result in part from dysregulated VSMC growth and migration induced by
   Ang II. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The cyclin D1 gene encodes the regulatory subunit of the holoenzyme that
   phosphorylates and inactivates the retinoblastoma pRB protein. Cyclin D1
   protein levels are elevated by mitogenic and oncogenic signaling
   pathways, and antisense mRNA to cyclin D1 inhibits transformation by the
   ras, neu, and src oncogenes, thus linking cyclin D1 regulation to
   cellular transformation. Caveolins are the principal protein components
   of caveolae, vesicular plasma membrane invaginations that also function
   in signal transduction, We show here that caveolin-1 expression levels
   inversely correlate with cyclin D1 abundance levels in transformed
   cells. Expression of antisense caveolin-1 increased cyclin D1 levels,
   whereas caveolin-1 overexpression inhibited expression of the cyclin D1
   gene. Cyclin D1 promoter activity was selectively repressed by
   caveolin-1, but not by caveolin-3, and this repression required the
   caveolin-1 N terminus, Maximal inhibition of the cyclin D1 gene promoter
   by caveolin-1 was dependent on the cyclin D1 promoter T-cell
   factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-1-binding site between -81 to -73. The
   T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor sequence was sufficient for
   repression by caveolin-1. We suggest that transcriptional repression of
   the cyclin D1 gene may contribute to the inhibition of transformation by
   caveolin-1.}},

Abstract = {{Momordica charantia trypsin inhibitor II (MCTI-II) inhibits the
   amidolytic activity of factor Xa with a K-i value 10-100-fold smaller
   than those of other squash family inhibitors. It also inhibits factor X
   activation mediated by factor VIIa-tissue factor complex or factor IXa.
   Comparison of other squash family inhibitors reveal Trp at position 7
   (P-2') and a deletion at position 25 (P-20') are characteristics of
   MCTI-II. In order to elucidate the effect of these positions on the
   inhibitory activity, wt chemically synthesized three inhibitors:
   S-MCTI-II whose amino acid sequence is identical to natural MCTI-II,
   S-MCTI-II(7L) whose P-2'(Trp) is substituted with Leu, and
   S-MCTI-II(25N) whose P-20'(deletion) is filled with Asn. The
   dissociation constants of the complexes of human factor Xa with
   S-MCTI-II, S-MCTI-II(7L), and S-MCTI-II(25N) were 1.3 x 10(-6) M, 2.8 x
   10(-5) M, and 7.3 x 10(-6) M, respectively. They inhibited factor X
   activation mediated by factor Wa with the same degree. As in the case of
   natural MCTI-II, S-MCTI-II suppressed factor X activation mediated by
   factor IXa, while S-MCTI-II(7L) and S-MCTI-II(25N) did not. Both the Trp
   at the P-2' position and deletion at the P-20' position are thus likely
   required for the inhibition of factor Xa, trypsin, and factor IXa, while
   these two positions do not affect factor X activation initiated by the
   factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   eight oxygen atoms. The structure is made up of zigzag strings of PuO8
   distorted edge-sharing polyhedron parallel to the a axis. Tellurium
   atoms are coordinated to three oxygen atoms. PuTe2O6 melts at 1125 K
   incongruently and decomposes according to the reaction:
   PuTe2O6(s)-->PuO2(s)+2TeO(2)(g). The kinetics of decomposition under

   (LMWH) enoxaparin sodium (Lovenox) were evaluated in a rat model of
   focal ischemia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 min of
   occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery using the intraluminal
   suture method. Enoxaparin at doses of 0, 10 or 15 mg/kg was administered
   to groups of rats 1,8, 24 and 32 h after artery occlusion. Motor
   impairment was evaluated by performance on the traverse beam and
   accelerating rotarod tests. Animals were sacrificed 48 h after occlusion
   and brain sections were stained with 2\% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
   chloride for determination of infarct volume. Forty percent of the rats
   receiving 15 mg/kg enoxaparin died as a result of intracranial
   hemorrhage. Untreated rats exhibited large lesions involving the caudate
   putamen and much of the cortex. In enoxaparin - treated rats the damage
   was mainly confined to the caudate putamen. The sensorimotor behavior of
   the 10 mg/kg enoxaparin group was significantly better than that of
   untreated animals. Motor performance of the survivors in the 15 mg/kg
   group was poor due to hypoactivity and weakness resulting from excessive
   bleeding. These results suggest that LMWH may have a neuroprotective

Abstract = {{Myocardial phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in the regulation
   of Ca2+ mobilization and contractile performance in the heart. However,
   the molecular identity of this myocardial PLD and the mechanisms that
   regulate it are not well understood. Using subcellular fractionation and
   Western blot analysis, we found that PLD2 is the major myocardial PLD
   and that it localizes primarily to sarcolemmal membranes. A 100-kDa
   PLD2-interacting cardiac protein was detected using a protein overlay
   assay employing purified PLD2 and then identified as alpha-actinin using
   peptide-mass fingerprinting with matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy. The direct association between
   PLD2 and alpha-actinin was confirmed using an in vitro binding assay and
   localized to PLD2's N-terminal 185 amino acids. Purified alpha-actinin
   potently inhibits PLD2 activity (Ic(50) = 80 nM) in an
   interaction-dependent and ADP-ribosylation factor-reversible manner.
   Finally, alpha-actinin co-localizes with actin and with PLD2 in the
   detergent-insoluble fraction from sarcolemmal membranes. These results
   suggest that PLD2 is reciprocally regulated in sarcolemmal membranes by
   alpha-actinin and ARF1 and accordingly that a major role for PLD2 in
   cardiac function may involve reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.}},

Abstract = {{Mcm2-7 proteins that play an essential role in eukaryotic DNA
   replication contain DNA-dependent ATPase motifs in a central domain
   that, from yeast to mammals, is highly conserved. Our group has reported
   that a DNA helicase activity is associated with a 600 kDa human Mcm4, 6
   and 7 complex. The structure of the Mcm4,6,7 complex was visualized by
   electron microscopy after negative staining with uranyl acetate. The
   complex contained toroidal forms with a central channel and also
   contained structures with a slit. Gel-shift analysis indicated that the
   level of affinity of the Mcm4,6,7 complex for single-stranded DNA was
   comparable to that of SV40 T antigen, although the Mcm4,6,7 complex
   required longer single-stranded DNA for the binding than did SV40 T
   antigen. The nucleoprotein complexes of Mcm4,6,7 and single-stranded DNA
   were visualized as beads in a queue or beads on string-like structures.
   The formation of these nucleoprotein complexes was erased by Mcm2 that
   is a potential inhibitor of the Mcm4,6,7 helicase. We also found that
   the DNA helicase activity of Mcm4,6,7 complex was inhibited by the
   binding of Mcm3,5 complex. These results support the notion that the
   Mcm4,6,7 complex functions as a DNA helicase and the formation of 600
   kDa complex is essential for the activity. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   O-4 (where x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7) ferrites have been
   reported. The ferrite samples were prepared by standard double sintering
   ceramic technique and structural analysis was carried out using X-ray
   diffraction. The lattice parameter (a) increases with increase in x. The
   average grain size obtained from SEM micrographs shows an initial
   decrease up to x=0.4 and then it increases. The saturation magnetization
   (M-s) and initial permeability (mu(i)) decrease with cobalt content up
   to x=0.4 and then a small increase is observed in case of mu(i). This
   has been attributed to high positive value of anisotropy constant (k(1))
   for Co2+. The Curie temperature of the samples decreases with increase
   in the content of cobalt (x) due to reduction in the A-B interaction.
   The initial permeability of the samples remains almost independent of
   frequency in the frequency range studied viz. 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The
   measurement of AC susceptibility with temperature reveals the single
   domain (SD) state of the samples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All

Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{It is now well accepted that the p53 C-terminus plays a central role in
   controlling the activity of the wild-type molecule. In our previous
   studies, we observed that a C-terminally altered p53 protein (p53AS),
   generated by an alternative spliced p53 mRNA, induces an attenuated
   p53-dependent apoptosis, compared to that induced by the regularly
   spliced form (p53RS). In the present study we analysed the
   interrelationships between these two physiological variants of wild-type
   p53, and found that in cells co-expressing both forms, in contrast to
   the expected additive effect on the induction of apoptosis, p53AS
   inhibits apoptosis induced by p53RS, This inhibitory effect is specific
   for p53-dependent apoptosis and was not evident in a p53-independent
   apoptotic pathway induced by growth factor deprivation. Furthermore, the
   expression of p53AS in transiently transfected cells caused both
   inhibition of apoptosis and inhibition of the p53RS-dependent
   transactivation of a number of p53 target genes. These results suggest
   that expression of an alternatively spliced p53 form may serve as an
   additional level in controlling the complexity of p53 function by the
   C-terminal domain.}},

Abstract = {{Charged tau leptons emerging in a long baseline experiment with a muon

   20 GeV muon storage ring, within the strong mixing scheme and on the
   basis of the squared mass differences which are compatible with all
   reported neutrino anomalies, including the LSND data. In contrast to
   other solutions which ignore the Los Alamos anomaly, we find charged tau
   production rates which should be measurable in a realistic set up. As a
   consequence, determining the complete mass spectrum of neutrinos as well
   as all three mixing angles seems within reach. Matter effects are
   discussed thoroughly but are found to be small in this situation. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of calculating the free energy surfaces
   of charge transfer (CT) reactions in electronically delocalized systems
   involving direct electronic overlap of the donor and acceptor units. The
   model includes two electronic states of the solute linearly coupled to a
   linearly responding solvent in both the diagonal and off-diagonal terms
   of the Hamiltonian matrix. The exact solution for the adiabatic free
   energy surfaces along the CT reaction coordinate is derived as a
   function of the reorganization parameters invariant to the extent of
   electron delocalization and the parameter of electron delocalization.
   For dipolar solutes, the latter is defined through adiabatic
   differential and transition dipoles measured by optical spectroscopy.
   The invariant reorganization energy is the real, observable
   reorganization energy determining the vertical transition energy,
   bandwidth, and the activation energy of self-exchange transitions. The
   Golden Rule expression for the ET rate constant is obtained in the
   adiabatic electronic basis of the solute by treating the non-Condon
   off-diagonal coupling to the solvent as a perturbation. The ET matrix
   element entering the rate constant is fully determined in terms of the
   adiabatic vacuum splitting of the electronic levels and the
   delocalization parameter, The CT energy gap law is very asymmetric with
   a shallow branch in the inverted region due to the dependence of the
   delocalization parameter on the CT driving force.}},

   deregulates cell growth arrest in certain cancer cell types, We have
   pursued the mechanism of growth arrest in Hep3B cells, a p53-mutant
   human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line, In stable or transient
   HBV-X transformed Hep3B cells, HBV-X increased protein and mRNA levels
   of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21(wafl/cipl),
   increased binding of p21(wafl/cipl) with cyclin-dependent kinase 2
   (CDK2), markedly inhibited cyclin E and CDK2 associated phosphorylation
   of histone HI and induced the activation of a p21 promoter reporter
   construct, By using p21 promoter deletion constructs, the HBV-X
   responsive element was mapped to a region between -1185 and -1482,
   relative to the transcription start site, Promoter mutation analysis
   indicated that the HBV-X responsive site coincides with the ets factor
   binding sites. These data indicate that in human hepatocellular
   carcinoma cells, HBV-X can circumvent the loss of p53 functions and
   induces critical downstream regulatory events leading to transcriptional
   activation of p21(wafl/cipl). AS a consequence, there is an increased
   chance of acquisition of mutations which can enhance the genesis of
   hepatomas, Our results also emphasize the chemotherapeutic potential of
   p21(wafl/cipl) inhibitors, particularly in the HBV-X infected hepatoma
   which lacks functional p53.}},

Abstract = {{A proline scan at positions 2 and 3 of the opioid peptide dynorphin
   A(1-11)-NH2 led to the discovery of the analogue {[}Pro(3)]Dyn
   A(1-11)-(NH2). This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for
   the kappa opioid receptor (K-i(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K-i ratio kappa/mu/delta
   = 1/2116/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall
   reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at mu and
   delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties.
   Despite its high kappa affinity, {[}Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 is a
   relatively weak antagonist in both the {[}S-35]GTP(gamma)S assay (IC50 =
   380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K-e = 244 nM). Discrepancies
   between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential
   kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons.
   Since the {[}S-35]GTP gamma S assay uses the same membrane preparations
   as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an
   explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to
   reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.}},

Abstract = {{A recently developed dual ensemble Monte Carlo (DE-MC) simulation has
   been applied to the study of pervaporation of a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid
   mixture, modeled for an ethanol and water mixture, occurring in MFI-type
   silicalite membrane. From the simulation results for the binary system,
   it is indicated that ethanol LJ molecules can readily enter the membrane
   pore, whereas no water LJ molecules penetrate into the pore, resulting
   in the formation of an adsorbed phase with the silanol groups on the
   external surface. The molecular density profile obtained for the binary
   system clearly reveals the adsorption site of ethanol, and it was found
   that the amount of adsorbed ethanol in the membrane decreases linearly
   from the feed side to the vacuum side. The total extent of ethanol
   adsorption in the membrane pore from the binary mixture is smaller than
   that from the pure liquid component when the ethanol activity is the
   same. These observed behaviors are in qualitative agreement with
   experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{We have performed density functional theory calculations on the
   adsorption of ethene onto the \{111\} surface of platinum. We find that
   the adsorption energy is sensitive to the k-point sampling used, with
   low k-point sampling giving rise to overestimated adsorption energies,
   close to the values predicted from small cluster calculations. Six
   adsorption modes (bridge, fee hollow, hcp hollow, atop bridge, atop
   hollow, and cross bridge) were investigated on a rigid Pt \{111\}
   surface. The most stable site was the bridge site (di-sigma type
   adsorption) with an adsorption energy of 108.7 kJ mol(-1) and C-C bond
   length of to 1.483 Angstrom, which is significantly longer than the
   calculated gas-phase ethene bond length of 1.334 Angstrom. The recently
   proposed fee hollow site adsorption was found to be significantly less
   stable (63.6 kJ mol(-1)) although slightly more favorable than the atop
   (pi adsorbed) modes. The effect of surface relaxation on the adsorption
   energy and structure was investigated by allowing the entire Pt \{111)
   slab to relax, giving rise to large changes in the positions of the
   coordinating Pt atoms. The bridge site shows displacements of 0.235
   Angstrom out of the surface for the two Pt atoms directly coordinated to
   the ethene C atoms with an increase in the adsorption energy of 18.6 kJ
   mol(-1) compared to the rigid surface case from 108.7 to 127.3 kJ
   mol(-1). The effect of Pt relaxation was greatest on the atop sites with
   the single Pt atoms coordinated to the ethene moving 0.356 Angstrom out
   of the surface for both adsorption modes. This was accompanied by an
   increase of the adsorption energy of 26 kJ mol(-1) with the atop bridge
   (85.8 kJ mol(-1)) slightly more stable than the atop hollow (84.8 kJ
   mol(-1)). The hollow sites were affected by surface relaxation so much
   so that the energetic order of the atop and hollow sites is reversed
   when surface relaxation is included, indicating that the latter are
   unlikely to be observed. We conclude that the large effect of both the
   k-point sampling and surface relaxation on the adsorption energy is
   based on a compromise between the extended electronic states and
   localized bonding. The effect of periodic calculations with converged
   k-point sampling is to accurately treat the repulsion between the
   extended electronic states and the molecule. The effect of surface
   relaxation is to allow the atoms involved in localized bonding to move
   out of the surface, reducing the repulsion due to the extended
   electronic states and so increasing the adsorption energy. As such, the
   use of cluster calculations, especially for molecules with weak
   interactions with the surface, would be expected to result in
   significant overestimation of the adsorption energies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the pathogenesis of proximal diabetic
   neuropathy (PDN) with nerve and muscle biopsies. Background: Recent
   evidence suggests that nerve ischemia secondary to immune-mediated
   vasculopathy rather than diabetic microangiopathy may be responsible for
   PDN. Method: Fifteen patients with PDN and two diabetic controls
   underwent nerve and muscle biopsy and clinical, electrophysiologic, and
   laboratory evaluation. There were eight men and seven women between 49
   and 79 years of age with type II diabetes. All had progressive, painful,
   asymmetric, proximal weakness with duration of 5 weeks to 12 months.
   None had evidence of systemic autoimmune disorder. Results: Four
   patients showed the distinctive findings of polymorphonuclear
   small-vessel vasculitis affecting epineurial vessels with transmural
   infiltration of postcapillary venules with polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
   Immunoglobulin M (IgM) deposits were found along the endothelium and
   intramurally in affected vessels. IgM staining was seen in the
   subperineurial space and in the endoneurium. Activated complement
   deposition was seen along endothelium of small vessels. Three of these
   four patients were evaluated within 6 seeks of onset of PDN, and the
   fourth patient during acute flare of PDN 6 months after the initial
   onset. Six patients showed ``perivasculitis{''} with mononuclear cell
   infiltrates around small epineurial vessels without vasculitis
   (fibrinoid necrosis or transmural inflammation). One patient showed
   recanalized vessels with transmural lymphocytes without fibrinoid
   necrosis, possibly suggesting healed vasculitis. Conclusion: These
   distinctive pathologic findings support that proximal diabetic
   neuropathy has an immune-mediated inflammatory basis and suggest that
   polymorphonuclear vasculitis with immune complex and complement
   deposition may be the primary event in the acute phase of proximal
   diabetic neuropathy.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of carbon monoxide with H-faujasite (H-FAU) and
   metal-exchange Li-FAU zeolites has been investigated by means of cluster
   and embedded cluster approaches at the HF/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. In
   the case of the protonated zeolite, the adsorption energy of the bare
   quantum cluster is evaluated to be -1.90 kcal/mol for the H-FAU/CO
   complex. Inclusion of the Madelung potential field from the zeolite
   framework has an effect. of lengthening the OH distance, hence enhancing
   the binding energies of the H-FAU/CO (-3.10 kcal/mol). For adsorption of
   CO on the metal-exchanged zeolites, the Madelung potential was found to
   differentiate the different types of zeolites (ZSM-5 and FAU), that
   cannot be drawn from the typical 3T-quantum cluster. This finding
   clearly demonstrates that acidity does not depend only on the Bronsted
   group center, but also on the dimension of the channel where the
   Bronsted group is located. The adsorption energy of the embedded cluster
   model (-6.69 kcal/mol) lies between those of the bare quantum duster
   model (-5.81 kcal/mol) and the simple naked Li(I)/CO system (-13.14
   kcal/mol). Correction of the 3T cluster model to take into account the
   long range contribution of the electrostatic potential of the zeolite
   crystal is found to agree with the experimental observation. (C) 2000

Title = {{IscU as a scaffold for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis: Sequential

Abstract = {{Iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
   cells is known to be mediated by two highly conserved proteins, termed
   IscS and IscU in prokaryotes. The homodimeric IscS protein has been
   shown to be a cysteine desulfurase that catalyzes the reductive
   conversion of cysteine to alanine and sulfide. In this work, the time
   course of IscS-mediated Fe-S cluster assembly in IscU was monitored via
   anaerobic anion exchange chromatography, The nature and properties of
   the clusters assembled in discrete fractions were assessed via
   analytical studies together with absorption, resonance Raman, and
   Mossbauer investigations. The results show sequential cluster assembly
   with the initial IscU product containing one {[}2Fe-2S](2+) cluster per
   dimer converting first to a form containing two {[}2Fe-2S](2+) clusters
   per dimer and finally to a form that contains one {[}4Fe-4S](2+) cluster
   per dimer, Both the {[}2Fe-2S](2+) and {[}4Fe-4S](2+) clusters in IscU
   are reductively labile and are degraded within minutes upon being
   exposed to air. On the basis of sequence considerations and
   spectroscopic studies, the {[}2Fe-2S](2+) clusters in IscU are shown to
   have incomplete cysteinyl ligation. In addition, the resonance Raman
   spectrum of the {[}4Fe-4S](2+) cluster in IscU is best interpreted in
   terms of noncysteinyl ligation at a unique Fe site. The ability to
   assemble both {[}2Fe-2S](2+) and {[}4Fe-4S](2+) clusters in IscU
   supports the proposal that this ubiquitous protein provides a scaffold
   for IscS-mediated assembly of clusters that are subsequently used for
   maturation of apo Fe-S proteins.}},

Abstract = {{A number of carboxyl groups in turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3)
   have low pK(a) values. A previous study suggested that neighboring amino
   groups were primarily responsible for the low carboxyl pK(a) values.
   However, the expected elevation in pK(a) values for these amino groups
   was not observed. in the present study, site-directed mutagenesis is
   used to investigate the origins of perturbed carboxyl pK(a) values in
   OMTKY3, Electrostatic calculations suggest that Lys 34 has large
   effects, 0.4-0.6 unit, on Asp 7, Glu 10, and Glu 19 which are 5-11
   Angstrom away from Lys 34. Two-dimensional H-1 NMR techniques were used
   to determine pK(a) values of the acidic residues in OMTKY3 mutants in
   which Lys 34 has been replaced with threonine and glutamine.
   Surprisingly, the pK(a) values in the mutants are very close to those of
   the wild-type protein. The insensitivity of the acidic residues to
   replacement of Lys 34 suggests that long-range electrostatic
   interactions play less of a role in perturbing carboxyl pK(a) values
   than originally thought, We hypothesize that hydrogen bonds play a key
   role in perturbing some of the carboxyl ionization equilibria in OMTKY3.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a sensitive and specific marker,
   allowing the detection of even minor myocardial cell injury. in patients
   with severe pulmonary embolism (PE), myocardial ischemia may lead to
   progressive right ventricular dysfunction. It was therefore the purpose
   of this study to test the presence of cTnT and its prognostic
   implications in patients with confirmed PE.
   Methods and Results-Fifty-six patients with confirmed PE were enrolled
   in this prospective study. PE was confirmed by pulmonary angiography,
   lung scan, or echocardiography and subsidiary analyses. Severity of PE
   was assessed by a clinical scoring system, and cTnT was measured within
   12 hours after admission, cTnT was elevated (greater than or equal to
   0.1 mu g/L) in 18 (32\%) patients with massive and moderate PE but not
   in patients with small PE. In-hospital death (odds ratio 29.6, 95\% CI
   3.3 to 265.3), prolonged hypotension and cardiogenic shock (odds ratio
   11.4, 95\% CI 2.1 to 63.4), and need for resuscitation (odds ratio 18.0,
   95\% CI 2.6 to 124.3) were more prevalent in patients with elevated
   cTnT, cTnT-positive patients more often needed inotropic support (odds
   ratio 37.6, 95\% CI 5.8 to 245.6) and mechanical ventilation (odds ratio
   78.8, 95\% CI 9.5 to 653.2). After adjustment, cTnT remained an
   independent predictor of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 15.2, 95\% CI 1.22
   to 190.4).
   Conclusions-cTnT may improve risk stratification in patients with PE and
   may aid in the identification of patients in whom a more aggressive
   therapy may be warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Both HCFC- and pentane-blown rigid polyurethane foams have been prepared
   from polyols derived from soybean oil. The effect of formulation
   variables on foam properties was studied by altering the types and
   amounts of catalyst, surfactant, water, crosslinker, blowing agent, and
   isocyanate, respectively. While compressive strength of the soy foams is
   optimal at 2 pph of surfactant B-8404, it increases with increasing the
   amount of water, glycerin, and isocyanate. It also increases linearly
   with foam density. These foams were found to have comparable mechanical
   and thermo-insulating properties to foams of petrochemical origin. A
   comparison in the thermal and thermooxidative behaviors of soy- and
   PPO-based foams revealed that the former is more stable toward both
   thermal degradation and thermal oxidation. The lack of ether linkages in
   the soy-based rather than in PPO-based polyols is thought to be the
   origin of improved thermal and thermo-oxidative stabilities of soy-based
   foams. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The highly conserved ubiquitin/proteasome pathway controls the
   degradation of many critical regulatory proteins. Proteins are
   posttranslationally conjugated to ubiquitin through a concerted set of
   reactions involving activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligase (E3)
   enzymes. Ubiquitination targets proteins for proteolysis via the
   proteasome and may regulate protein function independent of proteolysis.
   We describe the cloning and functional analysis of new members of the
   HECT domain family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Murine Wwp1 encoded a
   broadly expressed protein containing a C2 domain, four WW domains, and a
   catalytic HECT domain. A Caenorhabditis elegans gene was cloned encoding
   a HECT domain protein (CeWWP1), which was highly homologous to murine
   and human WWP1. Disruption of CeWwp1 via RNA interference yielded an
   embryonic lethal phenotype, despite the presence of at least six
   additional C. elegans genes encoding HECT domain proteins. The embryonic
   lethality was characterized by grossly abnormal morphogenesis during
   late embryogenesis, despite normal proliferation early in embryogenesis.
   CeWWP1 must therefore have unique and nonredundant functions critical
   for embryogenesis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical modification, mutagenesis, chemical rescue, and isotope effect
   studies are used to identify and probe the roles of several conserved
   amino acid groups in catalysis by human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.
   Time- and pH-dependent inactivation of human dihydroorotate
   dehydrogenase by trinitrobenzenesulfonate implicates at least one
   critical lysyl residue in catalysis. Of four highly conserved lysines,
   only the cognate of Lys255 was previously suggested to have catalytic
   functionality. We now show that replacement of either Lys184 or Lys186
   by mutagenesis does not impact, whereas substitution of Lys100
   abolishes, enzymatic activity. However, activity is partially restored
   to K100C (or K100A) by inclusion of exogenous primary amines in reaction
   mixtures. This rescued activity saturates with respect to numerous
   amines and exhibits a steric discrimination reflected in K-d,K-(amine)
   values. For all amines, rescued k(cat) values were only similar to 10\%
   of wild type and independent of amine basicity. K-M values for
   dihydroorotate and coenzyme Q(0) were similar to wild type. Thus,
   exogenous amines (as surrogates for Lys 100) apparently complement a
   chemical, not binding, step(s) of catalysis, which does not entail
   proton transfer. III support of this postulate, solvent kinetic isotope
   effect analysis indicates that Lys 100 stabilizes developing negative
   charge on the isoalloxazine ring of flavin mononucleotide during hydride
   transfer, as has been observed for a number of flavoprotein
   oxidoreductases. Ser215 of human dihydroarotate dehydrogenase (DHODase)
   was also studied because of its alignment with the putative active-site
   base Cys130 of Lactococcus lactis DHODase. Substantial retention of
   activity by S215C, yet complete loss of activity for S215A, is
   consistent with Ser215 serving as the active-site base in the human
   enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{The novel nonlinear optical method of second harmonic
   generation-circular dichroism (SHG-CD) has been used to follow the
   adsorption and redox properties of a peripheral membrane protein, horse

   SHG-CD response is shown to be affected by the oxidation state of the
   heme within surface-adsorbed cytochrome c, as is consistent with the
   sensitivity of SHG to the chirality of the heme. SHG-CD measurements
   show that adsorbed cytochrome c is reducible by ascorbate at alkanethiol
   surfaces, but not at phospholipid/alkanethiol hybrid bilayer membranes
   (HBMs). The adsorption of cytochrome c at the model membrane surfaces
   was verified by surface plasmon resonance. Surface-enhanced resonance
   Raman measurements show that cytochrome c adsorbed on a hybrid bilayer
   membrane retains the Fe-heme conformation associated with solution-phase
   cytochrome c and is reducible by applying potential to the supporting
   electrode. The inability of ascorbic acid to reduce cytochrome c
   associated with the HEM is attributed not to a change in its redox
   potential, but rather to the nature of the interaction of cytochrome c

Abstract = {{Background-Both retrospective studies and prospective randomized trials
   have shown that beta-blockers improve survival and reduce the risk of
   reinfarction in patients with myocardial infarction. To evaluate whether
   beta-blockers exert similar protective benefits during and after
   coronary intervention, we studied the incidence of postprocedure
   creatine kinase (CK)-MB elevation in patients with or without prior
   beta-blocker therapy and its effect on intermediate-term (approximate to
   1 year) survival.
   Methods and Results-We prospectively analyzed 1675 consecutive patients
   undergoing coronary intervention; of these patients, 643 (38.4\%) were
   on beta-blocker therapy before the intervention. The incidence of CK-MB
   elevation after coronary intervention was 13.2\% in patients on
   beta-blocker therapy before intervention and 22.1\% in patients who were
   not on beta-blockers (P<0.001). Patients with prior beta-blocker therapy
   had lower persistent/recurrent postprocedure chest pain and lower
   preprocedure and postprocedure heart rates and mean blood pressures
   compared with patients who were not on beta-blockers (P<0.001). Multiple
   linear regression analysis revealed prior beta-blocker therapy as the
   sole independent factor for lower CK-MB release after coronary
   intervention. During intermediate-term follow-up at 15+/-3 months,
   patients on beta-blocker therapy before intervention had lower mortality
   rates compared with those not on beta-blockers (0.78\% versus 1.96\%;
   P=0.04), although the benefit was independent of the reduction in CK-MB
   release.
   Conclusions-Our nonrandomized, prospective analysis suggests that prior
   beta-blocker therapy has a cardioprotective effect in limiting CK-MB
   release after coronary intervention and that it is associated with a
   lower mortality at intermediate follow-up.}},

   a stretched polyelectrolyte shows a sawtooth pattern as a function of
   the externally imposed end-to-end distance. This nonmonotonic behavior
   arises from a cascade of conformational transitions between
   necklace-like structures with different number of beads. The transitions

Abstract = {{Synthesis, solution structures, and electrochemistry of several
   dinuclear Mn-2(II,II) complexes (1-4) and Mn-2(III,III) complexes (6 and
   8), derived from a functional catalase mimic
   {[}(L-1,L-2)Mn-2(II,II)(mu(13)-O2CCH3)](2+) (1) are described that
   enable testing of the role of intramolecular hydroxide ligands on the
   redox properties. Addition of 1 equiv of hydroxide to 1 or 3 forms
   {[}(L-1,L-2)Mn-2(II,II)(mu(13)-O2CCH3)(mu-OH)](+) (7A or 7B,
   respectively), possessing two six-coordinate Mn(II) ions bridged by
   hydroxide and acetato ligands. Two-electron oxidation of 7 with O-2
   occurs by forming {[}(L-1,L-2)Mn-2(III,III)(mu(1,3)-O2CCH3)(mu-OH)](3+)
   (8) and H2O2 with no ligand rearrangements in methanol. Reaction of 8
   with 2-3 equiv hydroxide forms
   {[}(L-1,L-2)Mn-2(II,III)(mu-O)(OH)(O2CCH3)](+) in which deprotonation of
   mu-OH- to yield mu-O2- favors subsequent addition of a terminal
   hydroxide ligand, accommodated by a bridging-to-terminal
   ``carboxylate-shift''. Preservation of six-coordinate Mn(II) ions
   throughout all hydroxide-induced transformations is observed, including
   oxidation by Oz. Cyclic voltammetry reveals that addition of mu-OH-
   converts the two-electron redox couple II,II/III,III for complexes 1-4
   to sequential one-electron couples at lower reduction potentials,
   yielding substantial stabilization of the II,III and III,III oxidation
   states by Delta E = 440 and 730 mV, respectively. Binding of a second
   OH- to 7A or 7B forms (L-1,L-2)Mn-2(II,II)(mu(13)-O2CCH3)(OH)(2),
   containing two six-coordinate Mn(II) ions with two terminal hydroxides
   and a mu(1,3)-bridging acetato. Electrochemistry reveals that
   displacement of the bridging hydroxide to a terminal site upon addition
   of the second OH- restores a two-electron redox couple II,II/III,III but
   now at a higher reduction potential with considerable loss of the
   electrochemical stabilization energy provided by the mu-OH- (Delta E =
   250 and 350 mV loss for Mn-2(II,II) and Mn-2(III,III), respectively).
   These results indicate a considerably stronger influence of bridging vs
   terminal hydroxide ligands in stabilizing the higher oxidation states
   and separating the one-electron redox potentials of bimetallic centers.
   By contrast, in the absence of mu-OH- bridges the longer separation with
   the mu(1,3)-carboxylato bridge in dimanganese-(II,II) complexes leads to
   nearly complete uncoupling of the Mn(II) oxidation potentials, thus
   yielding a two-electron redox transition to (III,III). We hypothesize
   that this ``bridging hydroxide effect{''} may be due to both greater
   screening of the repulsive intermetallic electric potential energy and
   increased resonance stabilization of the mixed-valence (II,III)
   oxidation state by charge delocalization. These data provide a
   physicochemical basis for interpretation of the catalase activity of
   these complexes and of dimanganese catalase enzymes (see the following
   manuscript).}},

Abstract = {{Geophysical observations as well as deformation experiments indicate
   that under hydrothermal conditions, crustal faults can be significantly
   weakened with respect to conventional brittle-plastic strength
   envelopes. Pressure solution has long been proposed as a mechanism
   leading to fault weakness. However, pressure solution has also been
   proposed as contributing to interseismic fault healing, and the
   competition between the weakening and healing effects of pressure
   solution is unclear. To investigate this issue, we have conducted rotary
   shear experiments on synthetic faults containing granular halite (NaCl)
   gouge using NaCl-saturated mixtures of water and methanol as pore fluid.
   The NaCl-water-methanol system was chosen as a rock analogue because
   pressure solution is known to be important in this system at ambient
   conditions. We explored the influence of varying pore fluid composition
   (hence pressure solution rate), gouge grain size, and wall rock surface
   roughness, as well as normal stress and sliding velocity on slip
   behavior. All experiments were done under drained conditions. An
   acoustic emission detection system allowed detection of brittle events
   in the gouge. The results show no evidence for steady state pressure
   solution-controlled fault slip. Frictional, rate-insensitive behavior
   was observed, whereas the microstructures and compaction behavior
   clearly demonstrated that pressure solution was active in the gouge. Our
   data show that fluid-assisted healing effects dominated over weakening,
   causing fault strength to be controlled mainly by brittle-frictional
   processes. Existing models describing pressure solution-controlled fault
   creep may not be applicable to a porous gouge undergoing compaction as
   well as slip.}},

Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) plays an important role in the
   degradation of extracellular matrix components under several
   physiological and pathological conditions. The expression of this
   protease is upregulated by mitogenic growth factors and proinflammatory
   cytokines, which have been shown to activate different sets of
   mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. Here we provide
   evidence that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase
   1/2 (ERK1/2) or the p38 MAP kinase pathway is sufficient to induce
   transcription from the MMP-1 promoter in human primary fibroblasts,
   whereas modulation of mRNA stability seems to be of minor importance.
   Upregulation of MMP-1 expression by mitogenic or inflammatory stimuli is
   blocked by specific small molecular weight inhibitors of the ERK pathway
   or the p38 pathway, respectively, and constitutively active kinases
   within the ERK1/2 pathway (MEKK1, MEK1) or the p38 pathway (ASK1, MEKK1,
   MKK3) are potent activators of the MMP-1 promoter. The current study
   provides evidence that distinct extracellular signals leading to
   upregulation of MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts are relayed
   independently through different MAP kinase pathways and are integrated
   at the level of the promoter, (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Volume = {{173}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{107-122}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Several models commonly employed to represent the mass transfer in
   osmotic distillation (OD) systems are applied to the results of pure
   water OD experiments carried out with two commercial asymmetric porous
   membranes. Molecular and Knudsen diffusion mechanisms are tested to
   model the vapour transport across the membrane. When using the global
   structural characteristics specified by the membrane manufacturer, both
   diffusion models underestimate the membrane permeability to water
   vapour. The exceptionally high experimental permeability can be
   predicted by a Knudsen mechanism when considering the Teflon top layer
   alone. The membrane support is envisaged as an additional resistance to
   water transfer in the liquid form, leading to splitting of the
   asymmetric membrane into a series of two resistances: one resistance to
   gas transfer in the top layer and another to liquid transfer in the
   support layer. In this model, the gas membrane contribution is estimated
   to cover 40-70\% of the total mass transfer resistance; the film of
   diluted brine entrapped in the membrane support can cover up to 30\% of
   the total mass transfer resistance and the diluted brine boundary layer
   up to 60\%, indicating the sensitivity of the OD system to concentration
   polarisation. Classical empirical correlations of dimensionless numbers
   are fitted to the experimental flux results to try and predict the mass
   transfer coefficients of the brine boundary layer in the OD system. The
   poor quality of the model is attributed to the special hydrodynamics of
   the membrane module whose geometry does not fit in the reference of the
   correlations, i.e. straight circular ducts. The heat transfer associated
   with water transport is integrated into the mass transfer equations. The
   thermal effect due to evaporation and condensation at both
   liquid-membrane interfaces appears to be significant: a high vapour flux
   of 12 kg m(-2) h(-1) generates a transmembrane temperature difference of
   approximately 2 degrees C inducing a 30\% driving force reduction.
   Finally, the temperature polarisation in the liquid compartments is
   shown to be of minor importance in comparison with the heat transfer
   resistance constituted by the membrane itself. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{V442 Ophiuchi is a low-inclination (noneclipsing) nova-like cataclysmic
   variable. We have obtained medium resolution (1-3.5 Angstrom),
   time-resolved optical spectroscopy of this interacting binary star
   spanning an interval of 4 yr, from 1995 August to 1999 June. Using an
   Her radial velocity curve constructed from our combined spectroscopic
   data sets, we have determined that P-orb = 0.1243 days for V442 Oph,
   breaking the long-standing 1 day alias ambiguity in its orbital period.
   V442 Oph shares many of the characteristics of the group of cataclysmic
   variables known as the SW Sextantis stars. Its Doppler tomograms and
   orbital phase-dependent emission-line behavior, including the occurrence
   of a prominent transient absorption event, are consistent with those of
   other SW Sex stars. V442 Oph also displays single-peaked rather than
   double-peaked emission lines, strong He II lambda 4686 emission, and a
   phase offset of +0.08 between the Ha emission-line radial velocities and
   the phasing of He II. We discuss the role of V442 Oph as one of three
   known low-inclination examples of SW Sex stars. Like the other
   low-inclination SW Sex stars, LS Pegasi and V795 Herculis, the Balmer
   emission lines in V442 Oph have high velocity components that extend to
   approximate to +/- 1900 km s(-1) and follow an apparent S-wave pattern
   in the trailed spectrum. Finally, we compare two models for the SW Sex
   stars involving accretion stream overflow, in the context of a
   low-inclination system in which our line of sight likely extends over
   the entire face of the disk.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a unified approach to all kinds of quantum capacities we show
   that the rate of quantum information transmission is bounded by the
   maximal attainable rate of coherent information. Moreover, we show that
   if for any bipartite state the one-way distillable entanglement is no
   less than coherent information, then one obtains Shannon-like formulas
   for all the capacities. The inequality also implies that the decrease of
   distillable entanglement due to the mixing process does not exceed that
   of the corresponding loss of information about a system.}},

   assays, namely the Ames assay and the Drosophila wing spot test, have
   been selected for examining the antimutagenic potential of three

   chosen as a positive mutagen against which antimutagenic potential of
   alpha-tocopherol (Vit. E), caffeic acid (CA) and glutathione (GSH) was
   assessed. Vit. E did not exert any antimutagenic response while CA and
   GSH were effective in reducing the mutational events induced by AFB(1).

   The structure of the compounds, based on IR and C-13 NMR spectroscopies,
   including extensive C-13 labeling, depends on the M(CO)(5). Kinetic
   studies of the formation of 2 and 3 show that, in both cases, the
   reaction is slowed by the addition of free CO, but the inhibition is
   much greater with Os(CO)(5). The initial step is dissociation of CO from
   Os(CO)(4)(eta(2)-C2H2), and the inhibition results from the competition
   between the reverse of this dissociation and reaction of the unsaturated
   intermediate with Os(CO)(5), or Ru(CO)(5). With CO added to the system,
   subsequent steps in the condensation may become rate-limiting. Studies
   of the Rut (CO)(5)/Os(CO)(4)(eta(2)-C2H2) system with (CO)-C-13-enriched
   reactants reveal further details about the course of the reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Critical behaviour of the physical properties at the B2 double left
   right arrow IC double left right arrow C(R) phase transitions in
   TiNi-based shape memory alloys has been analyzed in the frame of the
   charge density wave (CDW) model. Variation of total resistance at the
   Peierls-type B2 double left right arrow IC double left right arrow C(R)
   transition in TiNiMe (Me=Cr, Fe, Al, Ge) alloys has been found to be a
   sum of the beta-phase normal contribution, fluctuating CDW resistance
   rho(f)(T) in the incommensurate state and resistance change due to the
   energy gap formation rho(c)(T) in the commensurate state. The fitting
   parameters such as the energy gap at saturation Delta(0) and the number
   of electrons involved in the process of the CDW's formation psi(0) have
   been determined as a function of the alloy chemical composition and
   thermal treatment at moderate temperature. The critical resistive
   fluctuations in the incommensurate phase follow a power law d(rho
   f)/dt{*} similar to t({*}m) with critical exponent m = -1. In the frame
   of the CDW model this means that the process of electron scattering from
   periodic distortion is strongly limited to a definite plane of the
   crystal and system is two-dimensional, The change of rho(c) with
   temperature is controlled by the activation energy law corresponding to
   electron single excitations through the gap Delta(T), with a varying
   psi(T) effective number of the electrons involved in the process. The
   total enthalpy measured during cooling is compared with the heat
   calculated for the energy gap opening at the Fermi level during the IC
   double right arrow C(R) transition in the frame of the Shottky anomaly
   approximation. Both values are of the same order. When hydrostatic
   pressure is applied to the material, a small drop in the conductivity is
   observed around P similar to 2 GPa and interpreted as CDW pinning by
   commensurability locking at a temperature higher than the transition
   temperature at normal pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The twin pillars of sustainable development are the conservation of
   natural resources and the management of waste. Waste is generated
   whenever a product is serviced or repaired, or when it is ultimately
   discarded at the end of its useful life. In order to manage such waste,
   the servicing options and costs must first be ascertained. This paper
   presents an algorithm for the generation of optimal disassembly and
   re-assembly sequences for the servicing of products with multiple
   defects, subject to constraints such as inaccessible components. The
   multiple service action (MSA) algorithm determines the minimum total
   servicing cost for a product network based on Floyd's Algorithm, a
   shortest path algorithm. Well-established shortest path algorithms,
   which compute the shortest route between any pair of nodes in a network,
   are unable to handle multiple defects. The product network is first
   constructed, depicting the components and subassemblies as nodes, and
   embodying in directed arcs, the labour, materials and tooling costs
   associated with disassembly and re-assembly, as well as the cost to
   repair, reuse, recycle or dispose the defective components. The MSA
   algorithm was tested on seven different product networks representing
   multiple defective components that can be serviced by different feasible
   routes. For each feasible service route, associated costs were computed.
   It was established that the algorithm was able to generate optimum
   disassembly and re-assembly routes for the servicing of products with
   multiple defects subject to constraints.}},

Abstract = {{A series of (Me(3)TACN)Fe-II derivatives with soft coligands have been
   investigated, where Me(3)TACN is N,N',N
   ``-trimethyl-1,3,7-triazacyclononane. Treatment of Me(3)TACN with FeCl2
   afforded a compound with the empirical formula (Me(3)TACN)FeCl2 (1).
   Compound 1, which is a versatile precursor reagent, was shown by
   single-crystal X-ray diffraction to be the salt
   {[}(Me(3)TACN)(2)Fe2Cl3]{[}(Me(3)TACN)FeCl3], containing isolated
   {[}(Me(3)TACN)(2)Fe2Cl3](+) and {[}(Me(3)TACN)FeCl3](-) subunits.
   Treatment of 1 with NaBPh4 gave the known {[}(Me(3)TACN)(2)Fe2Cl3]BPh4,
   while the addition of Me(3)TACN to FeCl42- gave {[}(Me(3)TACN)FeCl3](-).
   Oxygenation of 1 afforded {[}(Me(3)TACN)FeCl2](2)(mu-O), which was shown
   crystallographically to be centrosymmetric with a pair of distorted
   octahedral Fe centers. The Fe-N bond trans to the Fe-O bond is elongated
   by 0.2 A relative to the other Fe-N distances. Solutions of 1 and
   thiolates absorb CO to give {[}(Me(3)TACN)Fe(SPh)(CO)(2)]BPh4 and
   (Me(3)TACN)Fe(S2C2H4)(CO) (v(CO) = 1896 cm(-1)). Treatment of 1 with
   excess CN- afforded {[}(Me(3)TACN)Fe(CN)(3)](-), isolated as its PPh4+
   salt 5. Crystallographic and spectroscopic studies show that 5 is low
   spin with a C-3 nu structure; its Fe-N distances contracted by 0.23
   Angstrom relative to those in {[}(Me(3)TACN)FeCl3](-). Aqueous solutions
   of 1 bind CO upon the addition of CN- to produce
   (Me(3)TACN)Fe(CN)(2)(CO) (6). Analogous to 6 is
   (Me(3)TACN)Fe(CN)(2)(CNMe), prepared by methylation of 5. The metastable
   dicarbonyl {[}(Me(3)TACN)FeI(CO)(2)]I was prepared by treatment of
   FeI2(CO)(4) with Me3TACN and was crystallographically characterized as
   its BPh4- salt. Values of E-1/2 for {[}(Me(3)TACN)FeCl3](-), 5, and 6
   are -0.409, -0.640, and 0.533 V vs Fc/Fc(+), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of ZrZn2 is calculated by a self-consistent
   linear muffin-tin orbital method within the atomic sphere approximation.
   From fixed-spin-moment calculations the magnetic moment dl is estimated
   as a function of magnetic field H. By fitting the calculated values of
   M(H) to the form H = aM + bM(3) + cM(5) + dM(7) + eM(9), the
   coefficients a, b, c, d, e are estimated as functions of the lattice
   constant. It is shown that the values of a and b are negative and
   positive, respectively, at the observed lattice constant at ambient
   pressure. With decreasing lattice constant the value of a changes its
   sign from negative to positive, which means that the ferromagnetic state
   is unstable. At a lattice constant a little smaller than the critical
   one, the value of b also changes its sign from positive to negative.
   These results, together with the other coefficients c-e, indicate a
   broad maximum in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility when
   the effect of spin fluctuations is taken into account. However, thr
   absolute value of b is so small that the metamagnetic transition does
   not occur. It is shown that the anomalous temperature dependence of the
   susceptibility of ZrZn2 observed recently at high pressure is well
   described by the present calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The carbonized hollow fiber membranes were prepared through gelation of
   polyamic acid solution, imidization and carbonization of polyamic acid
   (PAA) gel by mainly controlling the gelation conditions. The
   microstructure of the carbonized membranes was evaluated by micropore
   volume, which was measured by molecular probe method. The permeation
   properties of pure CO2, pure CH4 and CO2/CH4 mixture through the
   carbonized membranes were measured and analyzed. High CO2/CH4
   permselectivity was achieved by the carbonized membrane which was
   prepared under a specific condition (gelation condition: temperature 275
   K, pH of coagulant 9.4; carbonization condition: temperature 1023 K,
   time 3 h). The permeance of CO2 at 298 K and the activation energy for
   CO2 permeation for mixed gas system were almost equal to those for pure
   gas system in this carbonized membrane. On the other hand, the permeance
   of CH4 for mixed gas system decreased in comparison to that for pure gas
   system due to the hindrance of CH4 permeation by CO2 molecules existing
   inside the micropores, so that the activation energy for CH4 permeation
   increased and the CO2/CH4 permselectivity for mixed gas system was
   greater in comparison to results from pure gas permeation.
   It was found that the micropores of 0.43-0.50 nm played a very important
   role to create high CO2/CH4 permselectivity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The Carboniferous-Permian stage in the evolution of the Parana Basin is
   characterized by the long-wavelength deposition of up to similar to 2.5
   km of sediment in the continental interior. The tectonics of the region
   during this time were dominated by convergence and active subduction
   along the nearby Panthalassan margin of Gondwana. While subsidence in
   the basin is clearly related to the major tectonic events at the plate
   margin, there is a distinct delay between the onset of subduction and
   the initiation of basin deposition. This, and the nature of basin
   stratigraphy, suggests that the large-scale subsidence may have been the
   dynamic response of the lithosphere to mantle how associated with the
   penetration of accumulated slab material through the phase change at 660
   km depth. We present numerical experiments of mantle convection which
   show that subducting slabs can stagnate at the 660 km depth phase change
   and intermittently penetrate through. The associated (negative) dynamic
   topography remains at relatively low amplitudes as the subducting
   material pools and then increases rapidly to a maximum during the phase
   of penetrative how. We find that the predicted delay time between
   initial descent of the slab and the maximum surface topography
   corresponds with evidence from the geological record. Several models of
   sedimentation based on the evolving dynamic topography are presented,
   and a simulation generated using infill rates independently estimated
   for the basin provides a close fit to the amplitude and horizontal
   length scale of material accumulation in the Parana Basin.}},

Abstract = {{We present an investigation on the potential of first-row transition

   M = Ti, V, Cr, and Mn (R = Me, Et) in high-spin electron configuration
   bearing two nitrogen ligands L,L' (NH2- and NH3) in order to elucidate
   the effect of partially filled d-levels on the elementary steps of
   ethylene polymerization. The olefin uptake energy is found to diminish
   almost linearly with an increasing number of d-electrons due to a
   successive destabilization of the metal acceptor orbital. Ethylene
   insertion barriers were calculated to be between 6 and 16 kcal/mol (R =
   Et) and are less affected by the d-electron count than by the type of
   the transition metal and its oxidation state. The dominant termination
   process for most systems is a beta-hydrogen transfer (BHT) to the
   monomer. Its barrier follows the trends of the olefin insertion, but is
   higher in absolute values for the majority of systems. In the case of
   the Cr(IV) d(2) system, with the overall best performance, possible real
   size catalysts were investigated. It is shown that by taking the
   specific electronic situation in d(n) systems into account, olefin
   insertion barriers below 10 kcal/mol together with high termination
   barriers can be achieved.}},

   workpiece and tolerance information as input to an algorithm for
   defining points accessibility. For each measurement point, the algorithm
   determines all feasible inspection probe orientations, as a subset of
   the total set of available orientations for a given CMM probe. A
   heuristic algorithm then groups the measurement points into a set of
   clusters which provide the maximum number of probe orientations. This
   methodology was applied to three examples which contain solid model and
   free-form surface representations.}},

Abstract = {{A non-destructive characterization of the structure in nanostructured
   thin films and multilayers is an area of significant importance. In this
   context the grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) technique has
   become a powerful tool. In the present paper the various parameters that
   define the structure in thin films and multialyers are discussed
   together with their origin. The GIXS theory relevant to determining
   these parameters is then discussed in brief. The applicability of the
   GIXS technique to various materials is clearly demonstrated through
   examples ranging from Pt-BN composite thin films to Ni-Nb/C multilayers
   to organic multilayers made from Cd-arachidate and Zn-arachidate (metal
   substituted fatty acid salts). The structural parameters of these thin
   films and multilayers were determined using GIXS irrespective of their
   nature inorganic or organic, indicating the suitability of this method
   for 3-dimensional structural characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To investigate patterns of referral, disease and treatment for
   healthy children who had received two or more dental general
   anaesthetics (DGA) for exodontia.
   Methods Records from 200 episodes of repeat DGA were studied
   retrospectively.
   Results The mean age of patients at first referral was 5y4m, and the
   mean interval before repeat was 22 months. Self-referrals rose from 14\%
   at DGA1 to 30\% at DGA2. New caries at second referral, where all
   diagnosed disease had been treated at DCA1, accounted for only 15\% of
   the total. Where a specific request was made in the referral, only 8\%
   of letters matched the charting made in hospital. 30\% of all specific
   requests were honoured, but then required treatment for previously
   diagnosed caries at DGA2. 75\% of single-tooth extractions required
   repeat DGA for caries left at DGA1.
   Conclusions It may be too optimistic to address only the most grossly
   diseased teeth when a child requires GA exodontia. A more radical
   treatment-planning approach, combining primary care, secondary care and
   public health considerations, may be required to avoid the unnecessary
   use of DGA.}},

   The folding product of a semiflexible chain exhibits a toroidal

   from coiled states to toroidal states stochastically. Some chains fold
   directly by winding around a ring along a chain. Others fold through rod
   states, which are kinetically trapped metastable states. Both in toroids
   and rods, sliding motions are noticeable. Large toroids are generated as
   the intermediate conformation first, and then they become smaller

Abstract = {{For the particular case of an excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo system with
   diffusion, we investigate the transition from annihilation to crossing
   of the waves in the head-on collision. The analysis exploits the
   similarity between the local and the global phase portraits of the
   system. We find that the transition has features typical of the
   nucleation theory of first-order phase transitions, and may be
   understood through purely geometrical arguments. In the case of periodic
   boundary conditions, the transition is an infinite-dimensional analog of
   the creation and the vanishing of limit cycles via a homoclinic Andronov
   bifurcation. Both before and after the transition, the behavior of
   a;single cell continues to be typical for excitable systems: a stable
   equilibrium state, and a threshold above which an excitation pulse can
   be induced. The generality and qualitative character of our argument
   shows that the phenomenon described can be observed in excitable systems
   well beyond the particular case presented here. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{To study the role of MAPK cascades in the regulation of naturally
   occurring human immunodeficiency virus type I long terminal repeats
   (HIV-1 LTRs), we analyzed several HIV-1 LTRs from patients at different
   stages of disease progression. One of these naturally occurring HIV-1
   LTRs contains an insertion termed the most frequent naturally occurring
   length polymorphism (MFNLP) and exhibited high inducibility upon T cell
   activation. We found that the protein kinase mixed lineage kinase
   3/src-homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich kinase, a specific
   activator of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK signaling
   pathway in T lymphocytes, induces high transcriptional activation of
   this promoter. Promoter inducibility is inhibited by the SAPK/JNK
   inhibitor, the JNK binding domain of the JNK interacting protein 1, and
   Tam-67 (N-terminal deletion mutant of c-Jun). In electrophoretic
   mobility shift assay, several protein complexes were found to bind to
   the MFNLP sequence in T cells. me identified AP-1 factors c-Fos and JunB
   as MFNLP-binding proteins, whose binding: is abolished by introducing
   point mutations in the 3'-half of the MFNLP sequence. Introduction of
   these point mutations into the MFNLP containing HIV-1 LTR reduced
   src-homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich kinase -mediated
   transactivation. These data indicate that the AP-1-like binding site in
   the MFNLP sequence gives rise to a higher inducibility of natural
   HIV-LTRs by the SAPK/JNR. signaling pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Hypertension and pregnancy-related hypertension are major public health
   problems of largely unknown causes. We describe a mutation in the
   mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), S810L, that causes early-onset
   hypertension that is markedly exacerbated in pregnancy. This mutation
   results in constitutive MR activity and alters receptor specificity,
   with progesterone and other steroids lacking 21-hydroxyl groups,
   normally MR antagonists, becoming potent agonists. Structural and
   biochemical studies indicate that the mutation results in the gain of a
   van der Waals interaction between helix 5 and helix 3 that substitutes
   for interaction of the steroid 21-hydroxyl group with helix 3 in the
   wild-type receptor. This helix 5-helix 3 interaction is highly conserved
   among diverse nuclear hormone receptors, suggesting its general role in
   receptor activation.}},

   2.7.10(-7) and 5.8.10(-7) M, respectively. Calibration curves were
   linear up to 1.8 mM of each analyte, Retention times were found to
   increase with increasing eluent concentration and a linear relationship
   was observed between log k' and log{[}Na2B4O7] for all analytes. This
   behaviour is attributed to the progressive formation of a binary
   electrical double layer at the surface of the zwitterionic stationary
   phase. Retention times of analytes could be manipulated by varying the
   concentration of the eluent. This new suppressed-EIC system was applied
   to the (SO42-, Cl-, NO3- NO2- and Br-) in snow and rainwater samples.

   taste receptor gene, Tre1, that controls the taste sensitivity to
   trehalose in Drosophila melanogaster. The Tre1 gene encodes a novel
   protein with similarity to G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane
   receptors. Disruption of the Tre1 gene lowered the taste sensitivity to
   trehalose, whereas sensitivities to other sugars were unaltered.
   Overexpression of the Tre1 gene restored the taste sensitivity to
   trehalose in the Tre1 deletion mutant. The Tre1 gene is expressed in
   taste sensory cells. These results provide direct evidence that Tre1
   encodes a putative taste receptor for trehalose in Drosophila.}},

Abstract = {{Given the critical role of cytokines in the regulation of an
   inflammatory response, we investigated whether certain cytokines are
   expressed in the brains of normal mice during maturation that could
   contribute to the immune-privileged nature of the CNS or potentially
   influence an immune-mediated illness such as experimental allergic
   encephalomyelitis. The gene expression of IFN gamma (Th1 cytokine) and
   IL-4 (Th2 cytokine) was analyzed in the brain of several strains of
   mice. IFN gamma was not detectable. However, IL-4 was present in the
   brains of neonatal mice, but not adult mice. Resident CNS cells are
   believed to be the source of the IL-4, because mice deficient in T cells
   (SCID and RAG2-/-) expressed the IL-4 gene in the CNS. Further analysis
   indicated that the gene expression of the Th2 cytokine transcription
   factor, GATA-3, correlated with IL-4 and IL-10 expression in the brain.
   Since GATA-3-deficient mice have an abnormal CNS, brain-derived Th2
   cytokines may play an important role in CNS development, as well as
   potentially contribute to the immune-privileged nature of the brain. (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives: To compare the proportion of HIV seroconversions
   attributable to other sexually transmitted diseases in the intervention
   and comparison arms of the Mwanza sexually transmitted diseases (STD)
   intervention trial.
   Design: Case-control study of 96 cases of HIV seroconversion and 974
   HIV-negative controls, nested within the Mwanza trial cohort.
   Methods: Data on reported STD symptoms during 2 years of follow-up, and
   serological evidence of recent syphilis, were used to obtain odds ratios
   (ORs) for HIV seroconversion, adjusted for community age, marital
   status, sex partners and travel. Population-attributable fractions (PAF)
   of HIV seroconversions associated with these STD exposures were
   calculated separately for the intervention and comparison arms, and for
   men and women.
   Results: In men in the comparison arm, adjusted ORs for ulcers (14.8),
   discharge (3.3), any symptom (4.1) and any STD (4.0) were highly
   significant. There were no significant associations between HIV
   incidence and STD exposures in the intervention arm. The PAF were
   consistently higher in the comparison arm than the intervention arm. In
   men, the PAF for any STD was 39.6\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI,
   12.4-58.3)] in the comparison arm but only 12.0\% (CI, 0.0-35.9) in the
   intervention arm. The PAF for women were lower than for men.
   Conclusions: These are minimal PAF estimates and they do not account for
   STD effects on HIV infectiousness. Nevertheless, a substantial
   proportion of new HIV infections in men in the comparison arm were
   attributable to STD. Lower PAF in the intervention arm than in the
   comparison arm for men provide further evidence of the role of STD
   cofactors in HIV transmission, supporting the hypothesis that the Mwanza
   intervention reduced the duration of symptomatic STD, thus reducing the
   HIV risk associated with such STD. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \&

   Although the activity of the UvrAB complex which can induce DNA

   topology and DNA topoisomerases remains unclear. We examined the effect
   of topoisomerase inhibitions on a NER in vivo system. The repair
   analysis of intracellular plasmid revealed that the DNA damage on
   positive supercoils generated by gyrase inhibition remained unrepaired,
   whereas the DNA damage was repaired in topoisomerase I mutants. These

Abstract = {{Prodromal symptoms, including disturbances of perceptions, beliefs,
   cognition, affect, and behavior, are often the first symptoms of
   schizophrenia. Little is understood about the initial, prodromal stage
   of schizophrenia, despite the compelling research and clinical need. The
   development and psychometric properties of a new, time-efficient
   instrument to characterize and date the initial symptoms of a psychotic
   illnesses, the Symptom Onset in Schizophrenia (SOS) scale, is described
   in this paper. The SOS rates the presence and dates the onset of 16
   general prodromal, positive, negative, and disorganizational symptoms,
   as well as a clinician, family, and patient global rating of onset of
   illness. Inter-rater reliability for the presence of each symptom in 35
   patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or schizophreniform
   disorder was good to excellent, with kappa coefficient > 0.7 for 12
   items, and > 0.5 for all items. Agreement on symptom duration was good
   to excellent for individual items (ICC = 0.7-1.0) and for global rating
   of duration of illness (ICC = 0.97). Our data indicate that the SOS is a
   reliable, valid, time-efficient tool useful to retrospectively assess
   the onset of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. Further
   study is underway to evaluate other psychometric properties of the SOS,
   including test-retest reliability and predictive validity. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Exploratory recruitment was investigated in an artificial experimental
   set-up on location in French Guyana. Groups of 200 freshly collected
   spiders of the neotropical social theridiid Anelosimus eximius were
   released on an open circular surface and offered a choice between two
   accessible shelters. Results indicated that a clear-cut collective
   decision was not always reached, unlike what we found using a different
   set-up in another set of experiments. Simulations were conducted using
   available information in order to explore the potential causes for this
   difference. Theoretical projections fit experimental data and strongly
   suggest that variability in the collective response results from a
   combination between modifications of the environment's properties and
   alteration of the recruitment procedure. Multiple variants of the
   theoretical set-up (including external bias) are investigated and
   emphasize plasticity in the collective response. New experimental
   studies are suggested and adaptative value of exploratory recruitment in

Abstract = {{TOGp is the human homolog of XMAP215, a Xenopus microtubule-associated
   protein that promotes rapid microtubule assembly at plus ends. These
   proteins are thought to be critical for microtubule assembly and/or
   mitotic spindle formation. To understand how TOGp interacts with the
   microtubule lattice, we cloned full-length TOGp and various truncations
   for expression in a reticulocyte assays, the microtubule binding domain
   is contained within a basic 600-amino acid region near the N terminus,
   with critical domains flanking a region homologous to the microtubule
   binding domain found in the related proteins Stu2p (S. cerevisiae) and
   Dis1 (S. pombe). Both full-length TOGp and the N-terminal fragment show
   enhanced binding to microtubule ends. Full-length TOGp also binds
   altered polymer lattice structures including parallel protofilament
   sheets, antiparallel protofilament sheets induced with zinc ions, and
   protofilament rings, suggesting that TOGp binds along the length of
   individual protofilaments. The C-terminal region of TOGp has a low
   affinity for microtubule polymer but binds tubulin dimer. We propose a

Abstract = {{The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is believed to selectively degrade
   post-synthetically damaged proteins in eukaryotic cells. To study this
   process we used calmodulin (CaM) as a substrate because of its
   importance in cell regulation and because it acquires isoaspartyl
   residues in its Ca2+-binding regions both in vivo and after in vitro
   ``aging{''} (incubation for 2 weeks without Ca2+). When microinjected
   into Xenopus oocytes, in vitro aged CaM was degraded much faster than
   native CaM by a proteasome-dependent process. Similarly, in HeLa cell
   extracts aged CaM was degraded at a higher rate, even though it was not
   conjugated to ubiquitin more rapidly than the native species. Ca2+
   stimulated the ubiquitination of both species, but inhibited their
   degradation. Thus, for CaM, ubiquitination and proteolysis appear to be
   dissociated. Accordingly, purified muscle 26 S proteasomes could degrade
   aged CaM and native Ca2+-free (apo) CaM without ubiquitination. Addition
   of Ca2+ dramatically reduced degradation of the native molecules but
   only slightly reduced the breakdown of the aged species. Thus, upon Ca2+
   binding, native CaM assumes a non-degradable conformation, which most of
   the age-damaged species cannot assume. Thus, flexible conformations, as
   may arise from age-induced damage or the absence of ligands, can promote
   degradation directly by the proteasome without ubiquitination.}},

Abstract = {{The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADE16 and ADE17 genes encode
   5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase isozymes
   that catalyze the penultimate step of the de novo purine biosynthesis
   pathway. Disruption of these two chromosomal genes results in adenine
   auxotrophy, whereas expression of either gene alone is sufficient to
   support growth without adenine. In this work, me show that an ade16
   ade17 double disruption also leads to histidine auxotrophy, similar to
   the adenine/histidine auxotrophy of ade3 mutant yeast strains. We also
   report the purification and characterization of the ADE16 and ADE17 gene
   products (Ad16p and Ade17p). Like their counterparts in other organisms,
   the yeast isozymes are bifunctional, containing both
   5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase and inosine
   monophosphate cyclohydrolase activities, and exist as homodimers based
   on cross-linking studies. Both isozymes are localized to the cytosol, as
   shown by subcellular fractionation experiments and immunofluorescent
   staining. Epitope-tagged constructs were used to study expression of the
   two isozymes, The expression of Ade17p is repressed by the addition of
   adenine to the media, whereas Ade16p expression is not affected by
   adenine. Ade16p was observed to be more abundant in cells grown on
   nonfermentable carbon sources than in glucose-grown cells, suggesting a
   role for this isozyme in respiration or sporulation.}},

Title = {{Mechanism of suppression of cardiac L-type Ca2+ currents by the
   phospholipase A(2) inhibitor mepacrine}},

Volume = {{399}},

Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Phospholipase A(2) plays a crucial role in the release of arachidonic
   acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids and in myocardial injury during
   ischemia and reperfusion. Mepacrine, a phospholipase A(2) inhibitor, has
   been shown to protect the heart from ischemic injury. In order to
   examine the mechanism of this protection, we investigated the effects of
   mepacrine on the L-type Ca2+ current (I-Ca,I-L) in rat single
   ventricular myocytes. Extracellular application of mepacrine
   significantly inhibited I-Ca,I-L in a tonic- and use-dependent manner.
   The inhibition was also concentration-dependent with an IC50 of 5.2 mu
   M. Neither the activation nor the steady-state inactivation of I-Ca,I-L
   was altered by mepacrine. The mepacrine-induced inhibition of I-Ca,I-L
   was reversible after washout of the inhibitor. Addition of 1 mu M AA
   partially reversed the mepacrine-induced inhibition of I-Ca,I-L.
   Intracellular dialysis, with 2 mM cAMP, significantly increased I-Ca,I-L
   but did not prevent the mepacrine-induced inhibition of I-Ca,I-L. In
   addition, extracellular application of isoproterenol or membrane
   permeable db-cAMP did not reverse the mepacrine-induced inhibition of
   I-Ca,I-L. Biochemical measurement revealed that incubation of
   ventricular myocytes with mepacrine significantly reduced intracellular
   cAMP levels. The mepacrine-induced reduction of cAMP production was
   abolished by addition of AA. Our results demonstrate that mepacrine
   strongly inhibits cardiac I-Ca,I-L. While mepacrine is a phospholipase
   A, inhibitor and reduces cAMP production, its inhibitory effect on
   I-Ca,I-L mainly results from a direct block of the channel. Therefore,
   we speculate that the protective effect of mepacrine during myocardial
   ischemia and reperfusion mostly relates to its blockade of Ca2+
   channels. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune skin disease mediated
   by autoantibodies against desmoglein 1. The endemic form is thought to
   have an environmental cause. The Terena reservation of Limao Verde in
   Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, is a recently identified focus of the
   disease, with a prevalence of 3.4 percent in the population. We tested
   the hypothesis that normal subjects living in an endemic area have
   antibodies against desmoglein 1.
   Methods: We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect
   antibodies against desmoglein 1 in serum samples from 60 patients with
   endemic pemphigus foliaceus (fogo selvagem) who lived in Limao Verde or
   elsewhere in Brazil, 372 normal subjects (without pemphigus foliaceus)
   from Limao Verde and surrounding locations, and 126 normal subjects from
   the United States and Japan.
   Results: Antibodies against desmoglein 1 were detected in 59 of the 60
   patients with fogo selvagem (98 percent) but in only 3 of the 126 normal
   subjects from the United States and Japan (2 percent). Antibodies were
   also detected in 51 of the 93 normal subjects from Limao Verde (55
   percent) and in 54 of the 279 normal subjects from surrounding areas (19
   percent). Serum samples obtained one to four years before the onset of
   disease were available for five patients; all five had antibodies in the
   initial serum samples, and the onset of disease was associated with a
   marked increase in antibody values.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of antibodies against desmoglein 1 is high
   among normal subjects living in an area where fogo selvagem is endemic,
   and the onset of the disease is preceded by a sustained antibody
   response. These findings support the concept that the production of
   antibodies against desmoglein 1 is initiated by exposure to an unknown
   environmental agent. (N Engl J Med 2000;343:23-30.) (C) 2000,

Abstract = {{Epsilon sequence (UUAACUUUA) has originally been found in the

   Escherichia coli via base pairing with nucleotides 458-466 located in
   the helical domain \#17 of 16S rRNA. We have recently reported that when
   the complementarity to 16S rRNA is extended, the epsilon is converted
   from an enhancer to an independent initiator of translation. Here we
   report the effect of two other structural parameters, positioning in
   mRNA and the degree of complementarity to 16S rRNA on the translation
   initiation activity of epsilon in E. coli cells. Our results show that E
   displays maximal activity as a translational initiator at its natural
   9-nucleotide-long complementarity to 16S rRNA and at a
   16-nucleotide-long distance to the initiation codon. Under these
   conditions its efficiency is comparable with that of the consensus
   Shine-Dalgarno sequence. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented for the preparation and use of fluorogenic peptide
   substrates that allows for the configuration of general substrate
   libraries to rapidly identify the primary and extended specificity of
   proteases. The substrates contain the fluorogenic leaving group
   7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (ACC). Substrates incorporating the
   ACC leaving group show kinetic profiles comparable to those with the
   traditionally used 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) leaving group. The
   bifunctional nature of ACC allows for the efficient production of single
   substrates and substrate libraries by using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
   (Fmoc)-based solid-phase synthesis techniques. The approximately
   3-fold-increased quantum yield of ACC over AMC permits reduction in
   enzyme and substrate concentrations. As a consequence, a greater number
   of substrates can be tolerated in a single assay, thus enabling an
   increase in the diversity space of the library. Soluble positional
   protease substrate libraries of 137,180 and 6,859 members, possessing
   amino acid diversity at the P4-P3-P2-P1 and P4-P3-P2 positions,
   respectively, were constructed. Employing this screening method, we
   profiled the substrate specificities of a diverse array of proteases,
   including the serine proteases thrombin, plasmin, factor Xa,
   urokinase-type plasminogen activator, tissue plasminogen activator,
   granzyme B, trypsin, chymotrypsin, human neutrophil elastase, and the
   cysteine proteases papain and cruzain. The resulting profiles create a
   pharmacophoric portrayal of the proteases to aid in the design of
   selective substrates and potent inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{The human EBAG9 was previously identified as an estrogen responsive gene
   using CpG-genomic binding site cloning (Watanate et al, (1998) Mel.
   Cell. Biol. 18: 442-449). Recently it was revealed that the EBAG9 is
   identical with RCAS1 which is a cancer cell. surface antigen implicated
   in immune escape. Here, we isolated and analyzed the 5'-flanking region
   of human EBAG9 gene. We determined transcription initiation site, which
   has a homology with an initiator element YYCAYYYY, and found that TATA
   motif was absent. Deletion analysis of the 5'-flanking region using
   MCF-7 breast cancer cells indicated that the sequences -86 to -36
   containing the ERE had the basal level of promoter activity and the
   upstream CC-rich region positively regulated the activity. EBAG9 pro
   meter luciferase reporters containing the ERE could respond to estrogen,
   and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that ER alpha bound to
   the ERE. Moreover, fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis has shown
   that the human EBAG9 gene is located at chromosome 8q23 which is
   frequently amplified in tumors. These findings suggest that the human
   EBAG9 might be involved in carcinogenesis as an estrogen responsive

Abstract = {{Integrin-mediated substrate adhesion of endothelial cells leads to
   intracellular signaling, including the activation of ERK 1/2
   (extracellular regulated kinases 1 and 2), members of the
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. MKP-1 is a
   dual-specificity protein phosphatase that may play an important role in
   regulating MAPK activity through dephosphorylation of threonine and
   tyrosine. Adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to
   fibronectin increased MKP-1 protein and mRNA levels, which reached a
   maximum at 60 min, while MAPK activity was maximal at 30 min. The MEK
   inhibitor PD98059 blocked activation of MAPK as well as the induction of
   MKP-1 during adhesion. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D blocked
   MKP-1 induction and produced prolonged MAPK activation during adhesion.
   In contrast, endothelial adhesion to poly-L-lysine did not alter MAPK
   activity or MKP-1 levels. These findings demonstrate that
   integrin-mediated adhesion of endothelial cells to fibronectin results
   in transcriptional activation of MKP-1 through a MAPK-dependent
   mechanism. Regulation of MKP-1 by MAPK likely represents an important
   negative-feedback mechanism. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The gas-phase acidities of the N1 and N3 sites of uracil have been

   this nucleic base. The experiments indicate that in the gas phase, the

   the N1 site (Delta H-acid = 333 +/- 4 kcal mol(-1)), in direct contrast
   to in solution, where the two sites are so close in acidity as to be
   unresolvable. This intrinsic difference and the coalescence in solution
   is interpreted through gas-phase and dielectric-medium calculations. The
   results point to a possible chemical reason that N1 is the preferred
   glycosylation site in nature: nature may simply take advantage of the
   differential N1 and N3 acidities in a nonpolar environment to achieve

Abstract = {{Since its discovery in 1966, adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) has
   been described as a helper-dependent parvovirus. However, in this study
   we demonstrate that AAV undergoes its complete life cycle, devoid of
   helper viruses or genotoxic agents, in the organotypic epithelial raft
   tissue culture system, a model of normal skin. AAV progeny production
   directly correlated with epithelial differentiation, as
   nondifferentiating keratinocytes were defective for this activity. Large
   nuclear virus arrays of particles of approximately 26 nm (parvovirus
   size) were observed in the granular layers of the raft epithelium by
   electron microscopy. Additionally, dosage-dependent histologic changes,
   some of which might be interpreted as cytopathology, were induced in the
   AAV-infected epithelial tissues. These data suggest a new biological
   model for AAV;that is, AAV is an epithelial-tropic autonomous parvovirus
   that can alter normal squamous differentiation. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes micelle exchange kinetics as a function of
   temperature for a pyrene derivative 1, a triglyceride containing a
   pyrenebutyrate ester, solubilized in aqueous micelles of Triton X-100.
   The kinetics were followed by stopped-flow fluorescence time-scan
   measurements in which the disappearance of excimer over time was
   monitored. Two components of the exchange process could be separated: a
   first-order process with an activation energy of 110 kJ/mol, and a
   second process with an activation energy of 160 kJ/mol. Because the
   second-order process had a rate (k(2) approximate to 1 x 10(6) M-1
   s(-1)) at 24.6 degrees C that was nearly independent of the pyrene probe
   (1, 1-octylpyrene, 1-dodecylpyrene), the second-order process was
   assigned to a fusion-fragmentation mechanism, rather than a
   ``sticky-collision{''} mechanism. The rates of the first-order process
   (k(1) approximate to 12 s(-1) for 1) at 24.6 degrees C increased with
   decreasing size of the probe. This step was attributed to a
   fragmentation-growth mechanism in which the fragmentation rate is rate
   limiting. Exchange by this mechanism must involve fragmentation of a
   micelle containing two probe molecules to form two sub-micelles large
   enough to bear one of the probes.}},

Abstract = {{The 26S proteasome, which catalyzes degradation of ubiquitinated

   Recently, it has been reported that the 26S complex can be dissociated
   into the lid complex and the 20S-proteasome-base complex in a mutant
   yeast and that the lid complex is required for ubiquitin-dependent
   proteolysis. In the present study, we established methods for rapid
   isolation of the 19S complex, the lid complex, and the base complex from
   wild-type yeast. The isolated 19S complex was capable of binding to the
   20S proteasome to reconstitute the 26S proteasome. In contrast with the
   previously reported result showing that Rpn10, a multiubiquitin chain
   binding subunit, is a component of the base complex, we present evidence
   that the lid complex isolated from wild-type yeast contains Rpn10. (C)

   function in the group treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor (DFU; 5
   mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks after induction of MI compared to the vehicle
   treated group. These results suggest that induction of COX-2 contributes
   to myocardial dysfunction, and that selective inhibition of COX-2 could
   constitute an important therapeutic target for the treatment of MI. (C)

Abstract = {{beta IGH3 protein has been recently involved in the pathogenesis of
   blinding corneal diseases, some of which have characteristic amyloid
   corneal deposits. The 124 codon of the beta ig-h3 gene seems to be
   crucial for the amyloidogenicity of the protein product. We presently
   report an in vitro system that reproducibly forms amyloid fibrils from
   beta IGIH3((110-131)) derived peptides. We also assessed the differences
   in fibril formation of two 22-amino acid peptides centered on the 124
   residue: the native form and the Arg124Cys peptide (mutation linked to
   lattice corneal amyloid dystrophy type 1). After dialysis of Arg124Cys
   peptide against PBS 1/15 M pH 7.4 for 72 hours, Congo red staining and
   electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of abundant material
   fulfilling the criteria of amyloid. Quantitative analysis with
   thioflavine T fluorescence studies confirmed the high capacity of
   Arg124Cys peptide to form amyloid fibrils when compared to the native
   form. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the NF-kappa B binding and functional activities in two

   liver. Gel mobility shift assays revealed two bands in NFSC nuclear
   extracts that correspond to p65/p50 heterodimers and p50/p50 homodimers.
   In contrast, a single and more intense band that migrates faster was
   detected in CFSC nuclear extracts. This band supershifts with either p65
   or p50 antibody. The differential NF-kappa B binding observed in these
   two cell lines appears to depend on the phosphorylation of the p65
   subunit rather than the expression levels of either p65 or p50. The
   nonphosphorylated NF-kappa B form, present in CFSC cells, possesses
   significantly lower transcriptional activity compared to phosphorylated
   NF-kappa B, found in NFSC cells. To our knowledge, this is the first
   report on the NF-kappa B regulation at the p65 protein in hepatic

Abstract = {{This article discusses the preparation of the water-insoluble adsorbent
   sulfhydryl chitin (s-chitin), by treatment of the chitin with sulfhydryl

   on the research results of adsorption capacity, the effect of pH value
   on adsorption, adsorption kinetics experiments, and selective adsorption
   experiments were observed. It has been shown that the s-chitin has much
   better adsorption for Pb-II, CuII, and CdII than chitin itself. The
   adsorption capacities of s-chitin for Pb-II, Cu-II, and Cd-II were
   108.3, 94.7, and 57.1 mg/g, respectively. It also had good adsorption
   properties for heavy metal ions. The adsorption capacities were also

Abstract = {{Background-Harmonic power Doppler imaging (HPDI) is a novel technique
   for assessing myocardial perfusion by contrast echocardiography in
   humans. The purpose of this study was to compare myocardial perfusion by
   HPDI with that obtained by Tc-99m-sestamibi single photon emission
   computed tomography (SPECT) during rest and pharmacological stress,
   Methods and Results-HPDI was performed on 123 patients who were referred
   for SPECT imaging for known or suspected coronary artery disease. Images
   were obtained at baseline and during adenosine infusion (0.14
   mg.kg(-1)min(-1)x6 minutes) in 3 apical views. Myocardial perfusion by
   HPDI was graded for each coronary territory as absent, patchy, or full.
   The persistence of absent or patchy myocardial perfusion by HPDI between
   rest and adenosine was interpreted as a fixed defect, whereas any
   decrease in perfusion grade was interpreted as a reversible defect.
   Overall concordance between HPDI and SPECT was 83 (81\%) of 103 for
   normal versus abnormal perfusion. Agreement between the 3 methods for
   each of the 3 coronary territories was 81\% (kappa=0.57) for the left
   anterior descending artery, 76\% (kappa=0.52) for the right coronary
   artery, and 72\% (kappa=0.40) for the left circumflex artery.
   Discrepancies between the 2 techniques were most notable in the
   circumflex territory, where fixed defects were observed in 33\% by HPDI
   but in only 14\% by SPECT (chi(2)=15.8, P=0.0001).
   Conclusions-This study demonstrates that HPDI can reliably detect
   myocardial perfusion during pharmacological stress, although there was a
   significantly higher number of falsely abnormal results in the
   circumflex territory.}},

Abstract = {{gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2) is the enzyme involved in
   glutathione metabolism and catalyzes the hydrolysis and transpeptidation
   of gamma-glutamyl compounds such as glutathione and its derivatives. The
   reaction is thought to proceed via a gamma-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate
   where a hitherto unknown catalytic nucleophile is gamma-glutamylated.
   Neither affinity labeling nor site-directed mutagenesis of conserved
   amino acids has succeeded so far in identifying the catalytic
   nucleophile. We describe here the identification of the catalytic
   nucleophile of Escherichia coli gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase by a novel
   mechanism-based affinity labeling agent,
   2-amino-4-(fluorophosphono)butanoic acid (1), a gamma-phosphonic acid
   monofluoride derivative of glutamic acid. Compound 1 rapidly inactivated
   the enzyme in a timedependent manner (k(on) = 4.83 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1)).
   The inactivation rate was decreased by increasing the concentration of
   the substrate. The inactivated enzyme did not regain its activity after
   prolonged dialysis, suggesting that 1 served as an active-site-directed
   affinity lable by phosphonylating the putative catalytic Ion-spray mass
   spectrometric analyses revealed that one molecule of 1 phosphonylated
   one molecule of the small subunit. LC/MS experiments of the proteolytic
   digests of the phosphonylated small subunit identified the N-terminal
   peptide Thr391-Lys399 as the phosphonylation site. Subsequent MS/MS
   experiments of this peptide revealed that the phosphonylated residue was
   Thr-391, the N-terminal residue of the small subunit. We conclude that
   the N-terminal Thr-391 is the catalytic nucleophile of E. coli
   gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. This result strongly suggests that
   gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase is a new member of the N-terminal
   nucleophile hydrolase family.}},

Pages = {{7736-7743}},

Abstract = {{The role of phosphatidic acid (PA) in regulating phospholipase C-beta 1
   (PLC-beta 1) activity was determined, PA promoted the binding of
   PLC-beta 1 to sucrose-loaded unilamellar vesicles (SLUV) containing
   phosphatidylcholine. PA increased enzymatic activity over a range of
   Ca2+ concentrations and reduced the Ca2+ concentration required for
   half-maximal stimulation of activity. PA did not affect the apparent K-m
   for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Lysophosphatidic acid also
   enhanced the binding of PLC-beta(1) to SLUV but was less effective in
   stimulating enzymatic activity. Diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and
   oleic acid had Little effect on activity. Anionic and neutral detergents
   did not stimulate activity. PA stimulation was relatively independent of
   acyl chain length. Dipalmitoyl-PA (16:0) was comparable to PA from egg
   lecithin and dimyristoyl-PA (C14:0) in stimulating activity, while
   dilauroyl-PA (C12:0) was slightly less effective. A 100 kDa catalytic
   fragment of PLC-beta(1) lacking amino acid residues C-terminal to
   His(880) did not bind to PA and was insensitive to stimulation by 7-15
   mol \% PA. Stimulation of 100 kDa enzymatic activity required 30 mol \%
   PA. PA increased receptor-G protein stimulation of PLC-beta(1) activity
   in membranes. These results demonstrate that PA stimulates basal and
   receptor-G protein-regulated PLC-beta(1) activity. PA stimulation occurs
   through both a C-terminal-dependent and an independent mechanism. The
   C-terminal-mediated mechanism for stimulation may constitute an
   important pathway for conferring specific regulation of PLC-beta(1) in
   response to increases in cellular PA levels.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Virtual reality techniques have recently been introduced into
   clinical medicine, This study examines the possibility of coronary
   artery fly-through using a dataset obtained by noninvasive coronary
   angiography with contrast-enhanced electron-beam computed tomography,
   Methods and Results-Ten patients were examined, and 40 to 60 transaxial
   tomograms (thickness, 1.5 mm; in-plane pixel dimensions, approximate to
   0.5x0.5 mm) were obtained after intravenous contrast injection. The
   datasets were processed on a graphics workstation using volume-rendering
   software. For fly-throughs, the contrast-enhanced lumen was made
   transparent and other tissue was made opaque. Then, key frames were
   selected in a path through the vessel, with software interpolation of
   frames between key frames. A typical movie contained 150 to 300 frames
   (10 to 15 key frames). Fly-throughs of coronary bypass grafts (n=3),
   left anterior descending arteries (LAD; n=6), and the intermediate
   branch (n=1) were reconstructed. Coronary calcifications were seen in 3
   patients. The fly-through of the intermediate branch, the bypass grafts,
   and one of the LADs did not show any irregularities. In 2 cases, a
   stenosis was visible in the LAD; its presence was confirmed by
   conventional coronary angiography.

Abstract = {{Capillary electrophoresis with an indirect UV detection was used in this
   study to analyse silicate, simultaneously with other nutrients (nitrite,
   nitrate, phosphate). The separation was achieved in a fused silica
   capillary filled with an electrolyte solution containing sodium chromate
   and an electroosmotic flow modifier, trimethyltetradecylammonium bromure
   (TTAB). The effect of the TTAB concentration and electrolyte solution pH
   on the electrophoretic mobility of the species is being discussed. The
   best simultaneous separation of these species is achieved with 0.2 mM
   TTAB and an electrolyte pH of Il within 10 min. Detection limits were
   0.73, 1.13, 0.60 and 1.32 mu M for nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and
   silicate, respectively. Reproducibility is below 10\% whatever the
   species. This method was applied to determine these species in different
   samples of river water and the results were compared with those of
   conventional colorimetric method measurements. The two methods do not
   give significantly different values for the mean concentration of these
   anions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, grain-boundary effects on the electrical transport and

   La0.8Ca0.2MnO3. The different ferromagnetic transition temperature (45
   K) and the different metal-semiconductor transition temperature (62 K)
   were observed in the samples with different grain boundaries. Wide grain
   boundaries can induce large grain-boundary effects on grain, and small
   grain size also induces large grain-boundary effects on grain due to the
   increase of grain boundaries. The possible mechanism of grain-boundary
   effect is explained as the strain effect of grain induced by the
   distortion at grain boundaries. The strain of grains should enhance the
   ferromagnetic double exchange interaction. (C) 2000 American Institute

   some carbon atoms with nitrogen atoms in the armchair carbon nanotube.
   The calculated band structures show that these nanotubes can be metals
   or semiconductors depending on the relative position of nitrogen and
   carbon atoms. The most stable non-metallic tubes are narrow energy gap
   (EG) semiconductors. Metallic tubes have two overlapped partially filled
   bands. The influence of Fermi vector positions on metal-insulator phase

Abstract = {{This study describes the formulation, characterisation and preliminary
   clinical evaluation of mucoadhesive, semi-solid formulations containing
   hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC, 1-5\%, w/w), polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP, 2 or
   3\%, w/w), poly carbophil (PC, 1 or 3\%, w/w) and tetracycline (5\%,
   w/w, as the hydrochloride). Each formulation was characterised in terms
   of drug release, hardness, compressibility, adhesiveness (using a
   texture analyser in texture profile analysis mode), syringeability
   (using a texture analyser in compression mode) and adhesion to a mucin
   disc (measured as a detachment force using the texture analyser in
   tensile mode). The release exponent for the formulations ranged from
   0.78+/-0.02 to 1.27+/-0.07, indicating that drug release was
   non-diffusion controlled. Increasing the concentrations of each
   polymeric component significantly increased the time required for 10 and
   30\% release of the original mass of tetracycline, due to both increased
   viscosity and, additionally, the unique swelling properties of the
   formulations. Increasing concentrations of each polymeric component also
   increased the hardness, compressibility, adhesiveness, syringeability
   and mucoadhesion of the formulations. The effects on product hardness,
   compressibility and syringeability may be due to increased product
   viscosity and, hence, increased resistance to compression. Similarly,
   the effects of these polymers on adhesiveness/mucoadhesion highlight
   their mucoadhesive nature and, importantly, the effects of polymer state
   (particularly PC) on these properties. Thus, in formulations where the
   neutralisation of PC was maximally suppressed, adhesiveness and
   mucoadhesion were also maximal. Interestingly, statistical interactions
   were primarily observed between the effects of HEC and PC on drug
   release, mechanical and mucoadhesive properties. These were explained by
   the effects of HEC on the physical state of PC, namely swollen or
   unswollen. In the preliminary clinical evaluation, a formulation was
   selected that offered an appropriate balance of the above physical
   properties and contained 3\% HEC, 3\% PVP and 1\% PC, in addition to
   tetracycline 5\% (as the hydrochloride). The clinical efficacy of this
   (test) formulation was compared to an identical tetracycline-devoid
   (control) formulation in nine periodontal pockets (greater than or equal
   to 5 mm depth). One week following administration of the test
   formulation, there was a significant improvement in periodontal health
   as identified by reduced numbers of sub-gingival microbial pathogens.
   Therefore, it can be concluded that, when used in combination with
   mechanical plaque removal, the tetracycline-containing semi-solid
   systems described in this study would augment such therapy by enhancing
   the removal of pathogens, thus improving periodontal health. (C) 2000

   Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. We examine the mass spectrum to determine
   the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry (SUSY) in this field theory
   and compare the results with those from the brane configurations. The
   spectrum is found to be invariant under the Type IIB SL(2, Z)
   transformation. We also discuss the theory with matter and its S-dual
   configuration. The result suggests that the equivalence under S-duality
   may be valid if we include all the heavy modes in the theories with

   happens in the field theory after dimensional reduction from 3D to 2D.

   were randomly chosen from a ranch located at Marin, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
   Milk and blood samples were taken from each animal and used to obtain

   tested against Rose Bengal antigen (RBT). Results showed that 86\% of
   the blood samples were positive on the PCR test, while 60\% were
   positive on the serological test. The pathogen was isolated from only
   one blood culture, Sixty four percent of the milk samples were positive
   on PCR tests, but failed to yield bacteria in culture, Biochemical and

Abstract = {{Mutations in the class I-like major histocompatibility complex gene
   called HFE are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC), a
   disorder of excessive iron uptake, We screened DNA samples from patients
   with familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) (n = 26), adults with Down
   syndrome (DS) (n = 50), and older (n = 41) and younger (n = 52) healthy
   normal individuals, for two HHC point mutations-C282Y and H63D, Because
   the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) E4 allele is a risk factor for AD and
   possibly also for dementia of the AD type in DS, DNA samples were also
   ApoE genotyped. Chi-squared analyses were interpreted at the 0.05 level
   of significance without Bonferroni corrections. In the pooled healthy
   normal individuals, C282Y was negatively associated with ApoE E4, an
   effect also apparent in individuals with DS but not with FAD. Relative
   to older normals, ApoE E4 was overrepresented in both males and females
   with FAD, consistent with ApoE E4 being a risk factor for AD; HFE
   mutations were overrepresented in males and underrepresented in females
   with FAD. Strong gender effects on the distribution of HFE mutations
   were apparent in comparisons among ApoE E4 negative individuals in the
   FAD and healthy normal groups (P < 0.002). Our findings are consistent
   with the proposition that among ApoE E4 negative individuals HFE
   mutations are predisposing to FAD in males but are somewhat protective
   in females. Further, ApoE E4 effects in our FAD group are strongest in
   females lacking HFE mutations, Relative to younger normals there was a
   tendency for ApoE E4 and H63D to be overrepresented in males and
   underrepresented in females with DS, The possibility that HFE mutations
   are import-ant new genetic risk factors for AD should be pursued

Abstract = {{In Escherichia coli, FtsZ, a homologue of eukaryotic tubulins, and ZipA,
   a membrane-anchored protein that binds to FtsZ, are two essential
   components of the septal ring structure that mediates cell division.
   Recent data indicate that ZipA is involved in the assembly of the ring
   by linking FtsZ to the cytoplasmic membrane and that the ZipA-FtsZ
   interaction is mediated by their C-terminal domains. We present the
   X-ray crystal structures of the C-terminal FtsZ-binding domain of ZipA
   and a complex between this domain and a C-terminal fragment of FtsZ, The
   ZipA domain is a six-stranded beta-sheet packed against three
   alpha-helices and contains the split beta-alpha-beta motif found in many
   RNA-binding proteins, The uncovered side of the sheet incorporates a
   shallow hydrophobic cavity exposed to solvent. In the complex, the
   17-residue FtsZ fragment occupies this entire cavity of ZipA and binds
   as an extended beta-strand followed by alpha-helix, An alanine-scanning
   mutagenesis analysis of the FtsZ fragment was also performed, which
   shows that only a small cluster of the buried FtsZ side chains is
   critical in binding to ZipA.}},

   achieved when the shoots were placed on the medium horizontally or
   vertically in an inverted position with the shoot tip down. Shoot tip
   removal slightly improved axillary branching, and additional defoliation
   strengthened this effect. Exogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) decreased
   shoot numbers, and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) did not replace
   defoliation nor diminish the size of callus formed at the base of the

Abstract = {{The frequencies of aneuploid and diploid sperm were determined in a
   47,XYY male using multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
   analysis, and compared with those from 10 control donors. A total of
   30,078 sperm from the patient was scored, 15,044 by two-color FISH for
   chromosomes 13 and 21, and 15,034 by three-color FISH for the sex
   chromosomes using chromosome 1 as an internal autosomal control for
   diploidy and lack of hybridization. The frequencies of X-bearing
   (49.73\%) and Y-bearing sperm (49.46\%) in control males were not
   significantly different from the expected 50\% (chi(2)-test for goodness
   of fit). The ratio of 24,X (50.60\%) to 24,Y sperm (48.35\%) in the
   patient, however, was significantly different from the controls (P =
   0.0144, chi(2)-test for independence) and from the expected 1:1 ratio (P
   = 0.0055, chi(2)-test for goodness of fit). There was no significant
   increase in the frequency of diploid sperm when compared with the
   controls (chi(2)-test for independence). Significantly increased
   frequencies were found for 24,YY (0.07\% vs. 0.02\%, P = 0.0009) and
   24,XY (0.44\% vs. 0.29\%, P = 0.0025), but not for 24,XX (0.05\% vs.
   0.05\%, P > 0.05), 24,+13 (0.07\% vs. 0.07\%, P > 0.05) or 24,+21 sperm
   (0.21\% vs. 0.18\%, P > 0.05) in the 47,XYY male when compared with
   control donors (chi(2)-test for independence). Our results support the
   theory that loss of the extra Y chromosome occurs during spermatogenesis
   in most cells. In this XYY patient there was a significant increase in
   the frequency of sperm with sex chromosomal abormalities but no
   suggestion of an interchromosomal effect on autosomes. All 3-color FISH
   studies in the literature demonstrate a significantly increased risk of
   gonosomal aneuploidy in XYY males, with the risk being on the order of

   Upon cessation of SpA exposure, the representation of conventional
   splenic (B-2 subset) lymphocytes normalized; however, we found that the

   treatment also induced a persistent loss of splenic S107-mu transcripts,

Abstract = {{New small endothermic transitions with remarkable hysteresis were found
   in many biopolymer-water systems including proteins and polysaccharides

   transition temperatures are usually around 40 degrees C fur fresh

   according to the preservation at various temperatures. The transition
   enthalpies per gram of water (Delta H-w) in the samples lie between 2
   and 20 J/g water, and are not so diverse from species to species for the
   fresh biopolymer-water systems. The Delta H-w decreases rapidly with the
   increase of water content of the samples. The remarkable narrowing of
   the band width of H-1-NMR signals of lysozyme-water and starch-water
   systems were observed at the temperature ranges of the endothermic
   transitions. The band widths showed fine hysteresis corresponding to the
   hysteresis behavior observed in the DSC measurements. The endothermic
   transitions observed in the DSC measurements must be brought about by
   the release of the cooperative motion of water and the biological

Abstract = {{A rigorous heterogeneous model for adiabatic ammonia reactors is used to
   explore the application of internal heat exchange theory to cross the

   ammonia reactors. The mathematical model is developed for adiabatic
   ammonia converters and the resulting two-point boundary value
   differential equation for the catalyst particles is solved using the
   orthogonal collocation method. Two simple configurations of reactors
   with heat interchangers are implemented. An industrial ammonia reactor
   having three adiabatic beds with Montecatini Edison catalyst and
   interstage cooling is used as the basis for comparison. The comparison
   shows that an increase of 13.37\% of the overall ammonia conversion is
   possible. The results presented in this study reveal the potential

Abstract = {{Evaluation of left ventricular function in the presence of valvular
   regurgitation is still a clinical problem because ejection phase indices
   including ejection fraction are heavily dependent on preload and
   afterload and cannot be regarded as reliable indices of contractility in
   diseases associated with altered loading conditions. The authors
   attempted to evaluate the usefulness of the new index-corrected ejection
   fraction in the evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function in patients
   with chronic mitral (MR) or aortic regurgitation (AR). The study
   included 21 patients with chronic severe MR (11 patients) and AR (10
   patients) with a mean age of 18 years. All patients underwent valve
   replacement or repair. Echo Doppler study was performed preoperatively
   and postoperatively and included measurement of the following LV
   parameters: end-diastolic dimension (EDD), end-diastolic volume (EDV),
   end-systolic dimension (ESD), end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection
   fraction (EF), systolic blood pressure/end-systolic dimension (SBP/ESD);
   also mitral and aortic stroke volume were calculated cross-sectional
   area (CSA) x time velocity integral TVI. Corrected ejection fraction
   (EFc) was derived from the following equation: EFc = {[}EF + root(ASV x
   MSV) / EDV] / 2.
   The mean preoperative EFc did not change significantly after surgical
   correction of mitral or aortic regurgitation. Preoperative EFc did not
   show significant difference compared with postoperative EF in the two
   groups. Preoperative EFc correlated significantly with other
   preoperative and postoperative indices of LV function. Postoperative EFc
   showed very close correlation with other postoperative parameters.
   Thus, using the new index-corrected ejection fraction in the assessment
   of LV function in patients with mitral or aortic regurgitation has
   several advantages: Noninvasive, independent of loading changes, helpful
   in predicting the immediate postoperative clinical course, and a
   reliable index for evaluation of LV systolic function preoperatively and
   postoperatively.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether mice exposed to an extended low dose of
   gamma-irradiation during most of their prenatal period express increased
   frequencies-of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (fMPCE) and/or
   micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (fMNCE) several weeks after
   the end of irradiation.
   Methods: Female CBA/Ca mice were gamma-irradiated for an average of 16
   days during their pregnancy. The mice were exposed to dose rates of 0,
   44, 99 and 265 mGy/day. At 1-2 days prior to parturition the mice were
   removed from exposure. Then, 36 days after birth, peripheral blood was
   drawn from all offspring (74 mice). Using flow-cytometer-based analysis,
   the frequencies of MPCE and MNCE were determined. From each animal about
   170 000 PCE were analysed.
   Results: No delayed effects in terms of higher fMPCE or fMNCE were
   observed among the in utero exposed mice of either gender. On the
   contrary, a significant (p<0.001) reduction of fMPCE was found among the
   male offspring exposed at the highest dose rate.
   Conclusion: Gamma-irradiation of mice during their prenatal stage did
   not induce damage in erythroid stem cells that can be detected as
   persistent or delayed chromosome aberrations (i.e. micronucleated
   erythrocytes) at 35 days after the end of exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine whether vaccination of patients with systemic
   lupus erythematosus (SLE) with influenza virus vaccine is associated
   with exacerbation of SLE.
   Methods. The study population comprised 24 patients with SLE who
   received influenza vaccine (cases group) and 24 other SLE patients who
   did not receive the vaccine (controls group). The primary outcome
   measure was the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores 6 weeks and
   12 weeks after vaccination. Secondary outcome measures included: number
   of SLE flares, defined as any increase in the SLEDAI greater than or
   equal to 3 points, and activity of renal disease. Repeated measurements
   MANOVA was used to compare the SLEDAI scores of the cases and controls.
   Results. All patients were women. The mean age at enrollment into the
   study was 46.1 and 40.6 years for the cases and controls, respectively.
   The mean disease duration was 9.1 for the cases and 9.3 years for the
   controls. SLEDAI scores for the cases and controls were 6.6 and 8.9 at
   vaccination, 4.9 and 6.8 at Week 6, and 5.1 and 6.7 at Week 12,
   respectively. The SLEDAI scores of the cases and controls at the 3
   different assessments were not statistically different (p = 0.28).
   However, within each group the decrease in the SLEDAI over time was
   statistically significant (p = 0.02). Three and 6 flares were observed
   in the cases and controls, respectively, (p = 0.27) during the 12 weeks
   of followup. Improvement in the renal disease was observed in the cases
   and controls.
   Conclusion. Influenza virus vaccine is safe for patients with SLE.
   Patients with SLE should be encouraged to receive the vaccine according
   to the recommendation given by the Immunization Practices Advisory
   Committee.}},

   communications system called IMT-2000 is expected to play an important
   role in this soon-to-arrive multimedia society. Wideband mobile services
   based on IMT-2000 will soon become a reality (early 2001). First, we
   look at the trends of wireless access technologies, centering on
   IMT2000. Wideband direct sequence code division multiple access (W-CDMA)
   will be a major component of a global IMT-2000 standard. Their, we
   address advanced wireless techniques, i.e., interference cancellation
   and employing an adaptive antenna array. which can enhance W-CDMA at a
   later date. Finally, requirements are discussed for future wireless

Abstract = {{The Topeka shiner (Notropis topeka) is imperiled by extensive changes in
   stream hydrology. Responses of shiners to changes or variation in stream
   hydraulics, however, have not been quantified, hampering conservation
   efforts. We quantified swimming endurance and behavior for Topeka
   shiners in a laboratory swim tunnel. Sustained swimming (>200 min) was
   observed at water velocities of 30-40 cm/s. Prolonged and burst swimming
   (approximately 10 min to less than 0.1 min) was observed at water
   velocities of 40-75 cm/s and endurance was negatively correlated with
   water velocity. Larger individuals (4.4-5.5 cm standard length)
   exhibited greater sustained swimming ability than smaller individuals
   (3.0-4.2 cm standard length). Oral grasping of wire mesh within the swim
   tunnel was frequently employed at moderate water velocities (35-50
   cm/s); this behavior may limit downstream displacement of shiners during
   freshers. Topeka shiners are capable of swimming speeds faster than
   water velocities which they typically inhabit. Fishways and culverts,
   therefore, may be employed to facilitate dispersal and recolonization.
   Swimming endurance data are used to determine optimal size and water
   velocities for such structures.}},

Abstract = {{Starting from trigonal and semimetallic CaSi2 we have found evidences
   for a new superconducting phase with onset of T-c up to 14K under
   pressure. In situ structural investigation shows that trigonal CaSi2
   actually transforms to a new phase with hexagonal symmetry at room
   temperature and approximate to 90 kbar and the lattice parameters
   dramatically shrink at approximate to 160 kbar, The presence of sp(2)
   silicon arrangement seems to be the condition promoting
   superconductivity in this, as well as in other, silicon-based materials.

Abstract = {{The ``cubic phase method{''} for growing crystals of membrane proteins
   uses a complex mixture of water, lipid, protein, and other components.
   The current view is that the cubic phase is integral to the process.
   Thus additives from whatever source introduce the possibility of
   destabilizing the phase, thereby compromising the crystallization
   process. Detergents are used to solubilize membrane proteins and are
   likely to be ported into the cubic medium with the target protein.
   Depending on the identity and concentration of the detergent, the cubic
   phase, which itself is membranous, may be solubilized or destabilized in
   such a way as to render it unsuitable as a crystal growing system. The
   nonionic detergent n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltopyranoside is commonly used in
   membrane protein work. In this study, we evaluate its effect on the
   cubic mesophase of hydrated monoolein. X-ray diffraction was used for
   phase identification and mesophase microstructure characterization. The
   results show that while low levels of the detergent are tolerated,
   increasing concentrations trigger a cubic-to-lamellar phase transition
   in a temperature-dependent manner. This finding is rationalized in the
   context of complementary molecular shapes of the lipid and the detergent
   and has implications for the mechanism of crystallization in lipidic
   mesophases as discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Islet beta-cells express low levels of lactate dehydrogenase and have
   high glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase activity. To determine whether
   this configuration favors oxidative glucose metabolism via mitochondria
   in the beta-cell and is important for beta-cell metabolic signal
   transduction, we have determined the effects on glucose metabolism and
   insulin secretion of acute overexpression of the skeletal muscle isoform
   of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-A. Monitored in single MIN6 beta-cells,
   LDH hyperexpression (achieved by intranuclear cDNA microinjection or
   adenoviral infection) diminished the response to glucose of both phases
   of increases in mitochondrial NAD(P)H, as well as increases in
   mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic free ATP, and cystolic free
   Ca2+. These effects were observed at all glucose concentrations, but
   were most pronounced at submaximal glucose levels. Correspondingly,
   adenoviral vector-mediated LDH-A overexpression reduced insulin
   secretion stimulated by 11 mmol/l glucose and the subsequent response to
   stimulation with 30 mmol/l glucose, but it was without significant
   effect when the concentration of glucose was raised acutely from 3 to 30
   mmol/l. Thus, overexpression of LDH activity interferes with normal
   glucose metabolism and insulin secretion in the islet beta-cell type,
   and it may therefore be directly responsible for insulin secretory
   defects in some forms of type 2 diabetes. The results also reinforce the
   view that glucose-derived pyruvate metabolism in the mitochondrion is
   critical for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the beta-cell.}},

Abstract = {{Flax (Linum ustitatissimum L.) is the source of natural fibers that
   provides biobased products for a variety of existing markets, but
   considerable processing and cleaning is required. Flax fibers, and bast
   fibers generally, are produced in the outer regions of the stem between
   bark and inner core tissues and require retting, which is the microbial
   separation of fiber from nonfiber tissues, as the first and most
   limiting stage of processing. Enzyme retting offers a method to overcome
   disadvantages of the current method, i.e., dew-retting, for high- and
   consistent-quality fibers with tailored properties for specific
   applications. Using chemical analyses, microscopy, and
   microspectroscopy, sites of carbohydrates, aromatics, and waxes plus
   cutins were identified in flax stems and their relationship to effective
   enzyme retting determined. Aromatics occur mostly in the inner, core
   tissues, with the fibers containing only small amounts located
   sporadically in cell corners of fiber bundles. Therefore, effective
   retting using enzymes to separate the aromatic-containing tissues from
   the fibers, but not to degrade aromatic compounds per se, is required.
   Waxes and cutin in the epidermal regions are effective barriers to
   enzyme penetration, and mechanical disruption facilitates enzyme
   penetration into the stems. Pectinases, with chelators to remove Ca++
   and destabilize pectin molecules, remove matrix compounds holding fibers
   within the stem and have been used in effective formulations to ret flax
   stems.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{During the years 1949-1952, the Mayak Production Association (MAYAK),
   which was processing weapons-grade plutonium, was discharging
   radioactive wastes into the Techa River. As a result, all components of
   the river system (water, bottom soils, and flood plains) were exposed to
   massive radioactive contamination. The protective measures taken in the
   1950's resulted in the improvement of the radioecological conditions in
   the Techa River. After 1952, the radioecological conditions in the area
   were mostly determined by the long-lived radionuclides Sr-90 and Cs-137.
   This article focuses on the dependencies governing the migration of
   radionuclides along the vertical and horizontal planes in different
   components of the river system over a 40-y period. Until the 1990's, a
   decrease in Sr-90 and Cs-137 contents was noted in environmental samples
   and foodstuffs produced in riverside villages. In the subsequent years,
   the radioecological situation on the Techa stabilized. The sources of
   the current contamination of the river are represented by the runoffs
   from by-pass canals and swampy upper reaches.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to determine the frequency and outcome of possible

   infants and children with pyogenic meningitis in the tropics. Children
   with meningitis aged between 6 weeks and 15 years (mean age 4.07 years;

   of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. The frequency of possible
   herniation was determined by clinical evaluation in relation to the
   severity of illness (high versus low risk) on presentation and
   performance of LP, Previously described scoring schemes were used.
   Eighteen (15\%) patients had evidence of herniation on presentation. The
   relative risk (RR) of herniation in high- versus low-risk patients was
   66.6 (9.3 to 477.1, 95\% CI), p < 0.0001 while the RR of death or
   neurological sequelae in high- versus low-risk patients was 2.6 (1.8 to
   3.7, 95\% CI) ,p < 0.0001, In 99 patients with known outcomes who had LP
   on presentation, 21 of 81 without herniation pre- or post-LP, four of
   four with herniation pre- and post-LP, seven of eight with herniation
   post-LP only, and Eve of six with herniation pre-LP only died or
   recovered with sequelae (chi(2) = 25.24, df = 3, p < 0.0001). It is
   concluded that outcome depends on the severity of illness and the

Abstract = {{A stochastic model for synthetic data generation is not available in the
   literature for daily flows of intermittent streams. Such a model is
   required in the planning and operation of structures on an intermittent
   stream for purposes where short time flow fluctuations are important. In
   this study a model is developed for such a case. The model consists of
   four steps: determination of the days on which flow occurs,
   determination of the days on which a flow increment occurs,
   determination of the magnitude of the how increment, and calculation of
   the flow decrement on days when the flow is reduced. The first two steps
   are modelled by a three-state Markov chain. In the third step, how
   increments on the rising limb of the hydrograph are assumed to be gamma
   distributed. In the last step an exponential recession is used with two
   different coefficients. Parameters of the model are estimated from the
   observed daily streamflow data for each month of the year. The model is
   applied to a daily flow series of 35 years' length. It is seen that the
   model can preserve the short-term characteristics (the ascension and
   recession curves and peaks) of the hydrograph in addition to the
   long-term characteristics (mean, variance, skewness, lag-one and higher
   lag autocorrelation coefficients, and zero flow percentage). The number
   of parameters of the model can be decreased by fitting Fourier series to
   their annual variation. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) produces a heat-stable
   enterotoxin (STa) that binds to and activates a putative intestinal
   receptor, guanylate cyclase, causing an increase in the intracellular
   levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Using flow cytometry
   and I-125-STa binding assays, we studied the distribution of
   STa-receptors on enterocytes isolated from different segments of the
   newborn calf's intestinal tract. We also investigated the effect of STa
   on the intracellular levels of cGMP and ion transport to the intestinal
   lumen. More STa-receptors were found on enterocytes prepared from the
   ileum than on enterocytes obtained from the other segments of the
   intestinal tract. Guanylate cyclase activity was higher in the ileum of
   STa-challenged calves than in the ileum of control calves. No changes
   were observed in the guanylate cyclase activity of the other intestinal
   segments of the STa-challenged and control calves. Na+ levels, as
   measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy, were significantly increased
   in the luminal contents of the ileum of STa-challenged calves, whereas
   serum Cl- levels were significantly lower in the STa-challenged calves
   than in control calves. This study supports previous observations on the
   role of guanylate cyclase in the initiation of STa-induced secretory
   diarrhoea and suggests that Na+/Cl- coupling may be the major mechanism
   for the loss of ions in the diarrhoeal response that is mostly induced

Abstract = {{Repair of the endothelium occurs in the presence of continued blood
   flow, yet the mechanisms by which shear forces affect endothelial wound
   closure remain elusive. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that shear
   stress enhances endothelial cell wound closure. Human umbilical vein
   endothelial cells (HUVEC) or human coronary artery endothelial cells
   (HCAEC) were cultured on type I collagen-coated coverslips. Cell
   monolayers were sheared for 18 h in a parallel-plate flow chamber at 12
   dyn/cm(2) to attain cellular alignment and then wounded by scraping with
   a metal spatula. Subsequently, the monolayers were exposed to a laminar
   shear stress of 3, 12, or 20 dyn/cm(2) under shear-wound-shear (S-W-sH)
   or shear-wound-static (S-W-sT) conditions for 6 h. Wound closure was
   measured as a percentage of original wound width. Cell area,
   centroid-to-centroid distance, and cell velocity were also measured.
   HUVEC wounds in the S-W-sH group exposed to 3, 12, or 20 dyn/cm(2)
   closed to 21, 39, or 50\%, respectively, compared with only 59\% in the
   S-W-sT cells. Similarly, HCAEC wounds closed to 29, 49, or 33\% (S-W-sH)
   compared with 58\% in the S-W-sT cells. Cell spreading and migration,
   but not proliferation, were the major mechanisms accounting for the
   increases in wound closure rate. These results suggest that
   physiological levels of shear stress enhance endothelial repair.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to map areas within the rat insular cortex
   from which respiratory responses originate and compare those sites with
   gastrointestinal control regions. The insular cortex was systematically
   microstimulated and histological location of responsive sites
   determined. Increased inspiratory airflow and decreased respiratory
   cycle duration were considered to be respiratory excitatory responses.
   The responses were localized in dysgranular and agranular insular cortex
   at levels caudal to the joining of the anterior commissure. More
   rostrally, respiratory inhibitory responses were elicited: these were
   manifested as a decrease in inspiratory airflow without a significant
   alteration in respiratory cycle duration. Respiratory inhibitory
   responses were usually accompanied by changes in gastric motility. These
   results suggest that the respiratory area in the rat insular cortex
   consist of two distinct zones which overlap a region modulating the
   gastrointestinal activity.}},

Abstract = {{The power supply to the north-east sector of London Underground Ltd's
   Central Line, and therefore the train service, was out of service for
   the majority of the time between the 24th and the 29th November 1993.
   During this period the power system faults were investigated, identified
   and corrected. This incident was the most extensive power fault on
   London Underground's power supply system in its recent history. The key
   cause was identified as an earth fault on a neutral cable of an
   alternator, which was located several kilometres from the part of the
   network that became inoperative. London Underground's power 22kV
   generation and distribution system is described, and the feed
   arrangements historically made to minimise the possibility of such an
   extensive outage are explained. The events leading to the loss of
   supply, subsequent identification and correction of the underlying main
   fault are described, and a model of the 150Hz harmonic earth-return
   current, which was the immediate cause of tripping owing to a series
   resonant circuit condition, is included. The effect of the neutral cable
   fault was to increase the 150Hz current to the point where it caused
   simultaneous multiple feeder breaker trips from earth-fault relays for
   the feeders supplying the northeast sector of the Central Line,
   resulting in loss of power to that sector. A comparison is made between
   the model and practically measured results.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental candelilla-shellac formulation for coating apples (Malus
   xdomestica Borkh.) was developed and compared with commercial
   shellac-based and carnauba-shellac-based coatings on `Gala' and
   `Delicious' apples by determining effects on quality attributes,
   respiration, and internal atmospheres. Fruit were stored at 5 degrees C
   for 7 days followed by storage at 21 degrees C for 14 days. Gloss of
   `Delicious' apples coated with candelilla-shellac formulations
   containing 7\% to 34\% shellac increased with increasing shellac
   concentrations. `Gala' and `Delicious' apples coated with a candelilla
   formulation containing 34\% shellac maintained quality similar to those
   coated with commercial carnauba-shellac-based coatings, as indicated by
   gloss, firmness, internal CO2, O-2 and ethanol levels, steady-state
   respiration rate, weight loss, and flavor. By comparison, shellac-coated
   fruit maintained the highest gloss throughout the experimental period.
   Shellac-coated apples were also firmer, contained more ethanol, and
   received higher flavor scores than did apples receiving other coating
   treatments. Gloss of all coated fruit decreased with time, although
   shellac-coated fruit lost less gloss over the 21-day storage period.
   Analysis of gloss, firmness, fruit respiration, ethanol, weight loss,
   and flavor demonstrate that the candelilla formulation containing 34\%
   shellac is competitive with current commercial carnauba-based

Abstract = {{The essential oil from the leaves of a Citrus interspecific somatic
   hybrid obtained by symmetric protoplast fusion between `Milam' lemon
   {[}purported sexual hybrid of C. Jambhiri `Lush (x) C, sinensis] and
   `Femminello' lemon (C. limon L. Burm f.) has been characterized by steam
   distillation CC-MS analysis and its composition compared with that of
   the corresponding oils obtained from the parent plants.
   The amount (\%) of the different classes of substances present in the
   oils show, in the new hybrid, an overall lowering of the hydrocarbon
   fraction and an increase of the oxygenated components. The somatic
   hybrid shows a close similarity in the amounts of terpenes,
   sesquiterpenes and alcohols with the `Milam' parent and in the amount of
   aldehydes with the other parent. Remaining oxygenated components appear
   lower in the hybrid with respect to both parents.
   Because of their genetic origins, the hybrid cells possess the nuclear
   genome of both parents and should potentially maintain all their genetic
   traits. However, the closer similarities found in the composition of the
   essential oils in the leaves of the somatic hybrid and the `Milam'
   parent could be interpreted as the dominance, in the nucleus, of the
   genetic information from this parent, although possible interactions
   between the nucleus and the mitochondrial genome cannot be at present
   accounted for since the origin of the latter is uncertain. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Background. It has been argued that by adding an opioid to the local
   anesthetic drug used for epidural analgesia during childbirth, one can
   reduce the risk of operative delivery.
   Objective. In a population-based observational study, to evaluate the
   effect of adding an opioid to a local anesthetic drug on the risk of
   instrumental delivery or cesarean section.
   Design. Comparison of delivery units adding/not adding opioid to the
   local anesthetic for epidural analgesia in labor.
   Setting. All deliveries using epidural analgesia in Sweden during
   1992-96 were evaluated on the basis of information stored at the Medical
   Birth Registry, the National Board of Health and Welfare, Stockholm.
   Method. A questionnaire was sent to all delivery units (n=61), as well
   as to the Head of corresponding Anesthesiology Department in each
   hospital, requesting information regarding the period when opioids
   (sufentanil) were first added to the local epidural analgesic.
   Parturients given epidural analgesia were divided into three
   time-related groups: those delivered before the introduction of opioids
   (n=34,071), when opioids were first added (12=7,236), and since the
   introduction of opioids (n=44,384). Odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) was used to assess the effect of sufentanil Versus no
   sufentanil, on the risk of operative delivery. The parturients were
   stratified for year of delivery, age, and parity.
   Main outcome measures. Instrumental delivery, cesarean section, length
   of stay in hospital post partum.
   Results. A significant reduction was observed in the incidence of
   instrumental delivery (OR 0.72; 95\% CI 0.68-0.76). A similar though
   less pronounced effect was evident concerning the risk of cesarean
   section for nulliparae (OR 0.79; 95\% CI 0.72-0.88) but not for
   multiparae (OR 0.93; 95\% CI 0.80-1.07). Fewer women with an opioid
   added to the local anesthetic spent more than 4 (or more than 7) days in
   hospital post partum, compared with those given epidural analgesia
   without an opioid.
   Conclusion. When added to the local anesthetic used for epidural
   analgesia, as in Sweden during the last 5 years, opioids appear to
   reduce the incidence of instrumental delivery and cesarean section and
   also the post partum hospital stay.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this experiment was to determine the factors
   influencing the transpiration rates of mature, clonal tea (Camellia
   sinensis L.) and estimate its transpiration efficiency. The heat pulse
   technique was used to measure transpiration rates of tea plants growing
   in the field as part of extensive canopies at Talawakelle, Sri Lanka
   during the period between 1 January and 19 February 1997. irrigation and
   shading treatments were used to determine the influence of soil water
   content (S) and irradiance on transpiration rate. The transpiration rate
   declined only slightly when S decreased from field capacity (44\%) to
   33\%. However, when S declined below 33\%, the transpiration rate showed
   a rapid decline from 1.6 to 0.71 per plant per day at 15\% S. When S was
   near field capacity, maximum transpiration rates of 0.53-0.931 plant(-1)
   h(-1) occurred between 1000 and 1500 h. The corresponding maxima when
   the S was near permanent wilting point (i.e. at -1.5 MPa matric
   potential) were 0.27-0.531 plant(-1) h(-1). Transpiration decreased
   linearly with decreasing irradiance throughout the range of radiation
   levels tested (i.e. from 100 to 15\% of full sunlight) at a rate of
   0.0311 per plant per day per \% reduction in solar irradiance. The daily
   transpiration rates of tea plants (0.42-1.071 per plant per day) under
   the natural shade of Grevillea robusta were considerably lower than the
   value of tea plants in the open, 3.5111 per plant per day. Spraying of
   an antitranspirant, Kaolin, decreased canopy temperature by 2-4 degrees
   C and especially around mid-day. Kaolin also decreased transpiration
   slightly during the period between 1000 and 1500 h. Transpiration
   efficiency (T-E) was 9.637 kg ha(-1) (made tea) mm(-1) of water
   transpired. The relationship between total dry matter yield and the
   ratio between transpiration and mean saturation vapour pressure deficit
   also was linear with a proportionality constant of 6.9 g kg(-1) kPa. (C)

Abstract = {{The penetration of two antibiotics, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin,
   through biofilms developed in an in vitro model system was investigated.
   The susceptibilities of biofilms and corresponding freely suspended
   bacteria to killing by the antibiotics were also measured. Biofilms of
   Klebsiella pneumoniae were developed on microporous membranes resting on
   agar nutrient medium. The susceptibilities of planktonic cultures and
   biofilms to 10 times the MIC were determined, Antibiotic penetration
   through biofilms was measured by assaying the concentration of
   antibiotic that diffused through the biofilm to an overlying filter disk
   Parallel experiments were performed with a mutant R. pneumoniae strain
   in which beta-lactamase activity was eliminated. For wild-type K.
   pneumoniae grown in suspension culture, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin
   MICs were 500 and 0.18 mu g/ml, respectively. The log reductions in the
   number of CFU of planktonic wild-type bacteria after 4 h of treatment at
   10 times the MIC were 4.43 +/- 0.33 and 4.14 +/- 0.33 for ampicillin and
   ciprofloxacin, respectively. Biofilms of the same strain were much less
   susceptible, yielding log reductions in the number of CFU of -0.06 +/-
   0.06 and 1.02 +/- 0.04 for ampicillin and ciprofloxacin, respectively,
   for the same treatment. The number of CFU in the biofilms after 24 h of
   antibiotic exposure was not statistically different from the number
   after 4 h of treatment. Ampicillin did not penetrate wild-type K.
   pneumoniae biofilms, whereas ciprofloxacin and a nonreactive tracer
   (chloride ion) penetrated the biofilms quickly. The concentration of
   ciprofloxacin reached the MIC throughout the biofilm within 20 min.
   Ampicillin penetrated biofilms formed by a beta-lactamase-deficient
   mutant. However, the biofilms formed by this mutant were resistant to
   ampicillin treatment, exhibiting a 0.18 +/- 0.07 log reduction in the
   number of CFU after 3 h of exposure and a 1.64 +/- 0.33 log reduction in
   the number of CFU after 24 h of exposure. Poor penetration contributed
   to wild-type biofilm resistance to ampicillin but not to ciprofloxacin.
   The increased resistance of the wild-type strain to ciprofloxacin and
   the mutant strain to ampicillin and ciprofloxacin could not be accounted
   for by antibiotic inactivation or slow diffusion since these antibiotics
   fully penetrated the biofilms. These results suggest that some other
   resistance mechanism is involved for both agents.}},

   exposure rate (ESER) are two characteristics that can be used to
   determine whether a fluoroscope is adjusted to operate at an optimal

   practical problems that are encountered when measuring these parameters.
   Because the energy response of the ion chamber used to measure exposure
   rates is different from that of the image intensifier, a fluoroscope
   with a perfect automatic exposure rate control will have an IIEER that
   depends on the phantom composition, phantom thickness, and x-ray tube
   potential. The authors developed a simple mathematic model to
   investigate the relationship of ion chamber response to image
   intensifier response and to determine the effects of phantom composition
   and thickness. Results from this model were compared with measurements
   made with two C-arm fluoroscopes. Variations of 40\% or more in the HEER
   and ESER can be ascribed to these phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{In this exploratory study, 30 couples, of which one partner had cancer,
   were tested with a questionnaire developed for evaluating the occurrence
   and degree of severity of physiological, psychological and psychosocial
   stressors. The questionnaire, filled out by the two partners separately,
   appeared to succeed well in documenting the types of stressors both the
   Patient and the spouse deemed relevant. It also appeared to provide an
   integrated picture of the patient's and the spouse's reactions to the
   patient's stress, considered in terms of emotional appraisal, cognitive
   appraisal, coping intentions and coping. Spouses were found to attribute
   greater psychological/psychosocial stress to the patients than the
   patients did themselves and to reflect greater uncertainty in their
   appraisal of concrete stress situations. Their environment-directed
   coping suggested that the spouses had the ability to control uncertainty
   in a manner allowing them to direct their efforts outwards in a desired
   direction. The questionnaire was seen as potentially useful for judging
   what psychological and psychosocial interventions are appropriate in
   such cases. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel computer method for the analysis of both
   aerial and grounding systems of conductors. The computer method based on
   an hybrid approach, allows to incorporate into a single linear system
   both lumped and distributed circuit parameters, evaluated by a rigorous
   electromagnetic field analysis, The conductor system is replaced by a
   suitable set of elementary current sources. These may be plain or
   hollow, bare or insulated, freely oriented and interconnected in the
   three dimensional space, which is considered formed by two half spaces
   each one homogeneous,linear and isotropic (e.g., air and soil),
   Therefore the method does not pose geometric and topological Limitations
   and enables to compute voltages and currents at the source (boundary)
   elements as well as vector potentials, electric and magnetic fields
   anywhere in the surrounding medium. The range of application of this
   method is sufficiently wide including any practical electric power
   system application. The method may be applied for frequencies up to 1
   MHz, thus covering the frequency spectrum of a typical full lightning
   too. Results which are derived first in the frequency domain ran be
   converted to the time domain by Fourier Transform algorithms. In this
   way it is also possible to analyze the response to transient signals of
   both aerial and grounding systems having complex; geometry.}},

Title = {{The interpretation of instrumental variables estimators in simultaneous

Journal = {{REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{In markets where prices are determined by the intersection of supply and
   demand curves, standard identification results require the presence of
   instruments that shift one curve but not the other. These results are
   typically presented in the context of linear models with fixed
   coefficients and additive residuals. The first contribution of this
   paper is an investigation of the consequences of relaxing both the
   linearity and the additivity assumption for the interpretation of linear
   instrumental variables estimators. Without these assumptions, the
   standard linear instrumental variables estimator identifies a weighted
   average of the derivative of the behavioural relationship of interest. A
   second contribution is the formulation of critical identifying
   assumptions in terms of demand and supply at different prices and
   instruments, rather than in terms of functional-form specific residuals.
   Our approach to the simultaneous equations problem and the
   average-derivative interpretation of instrumental variables estimates is
   illustrated by estimating the demand for fresh whiting at the Fulton
   fish market. Strong and credible instruments for identification of this
   demand function are available in the form of weather conditions at sea.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. The aims of our study were to evaluate survival and evolution of
   functional class and ventricular function in patients with severe
   congestive heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy.
   Methods. Inclusion criteria were: class III or IV heart failure, dilated
   left ventricle with ejection fraction < 40\%, history of poor controlled
   hypertension, and exclusion of other etiologies for heart failure. We
   studied 17 patients with these features; mean age was 64 +/- 7 years and
   70\% were male. They were followed up during a mean period of 3.3 +/- 1
   years (2 to 6; median 3 years).
   Results. Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 30 +/- 5\% (20
   to 40); 35\% of patients were in functional class III and 65\% in class
   IV; 100\% of patients received ACE inhibitors and diuretics, 53\%
   betablockers, and 35\% calcium-antagonists. Survival was 100\%. Left
   ventricular ejection fraction increased from 30 +/- 5\% to 44 +/- 11\%
   at one year, to 50 +/- 11\% at 3 years and 51 +/- 10\% at the end of
   follow-up (p < 0.001). This improvement was mainly due to a reduction in
   systolic left ventricular diameter (from 51 +/- 4 mm to 42 +/- 11 mm, p
   < 0.01), since diastolic diameter did not significantly changed (63 +/-
   4 to 59 +/- 11 mm).
   Conclusions. The evolution of severe systolic left ventricular
   dysfunction due to arterial hypertension is favourable at long-term,
   with null mortality and clinical ejection fraction and functional
   improvement. Nevertheless, the persistence of left ventricular
   dilatation suggests that myocardial damage caused by chronic pressure
   overload does not disappear.}},

Abstract = {{The charge density per unit length, the longitudinal component of the

   wave front depends weakly on the sort of gas used and, at relatively
   high pressures (8-24 torr), is (2-3) x 10(12) cm(-3). The energy
   deposited in the internal degrees of freedom is analyzed. It is shown
   that, for all gases used, most of the deposited energy (40-60\%) is
   spent on the excitation of the electron degrees of freedom. The fraction
   of the energy deposited in the high-energy degrees of freedom
   (ionization and dissociation) monotonically decreases with increasing

   studied based on the slave boson formalism of the Anderson model. When
   the dot-dot tunneling coupling is larger than the level broadening, the
   bonding and antibonding peaks of the Kondo resonances are observed. When
   the energy level difference between the two dots is large, the plateau
   structure of the conductance as a function of the gate voltage appears.
   The conductance at the plateau decreases as the dot-dot coupling
   increases, reflecting larger splitting of the bonding and anti-bonding

   for NRNs offering best effort services, taking into account the specific

   the commercial ISPs, such as congestion patterns, cost sharing and
   government subsidisation, governmental policy towards equal access and
   fairness, and over dimensioning of critical resources. The proposed
   model captures the above multi-objective policy concepts by using a
   pricing scheme consisting of two parts, a fixed part, that reflects
   specific policy parameters, and a variable part, that reflects the usage
   of the congested links. The latter part is used in order to reduce
   congestion and provide the revenue needed in order to upgrade the
   congested resources, We discuss the case study of applying the above

Abstract = {{Calcitriol oral pulse therapy has been suggested as the treatment of
   choice for secondary hyperparathyroidism, but its efficacy and safety
   are still under discussion. The present randomized multicenter study
   compares the effect of an 8-week course of daily versus intermittent
   (twice weekly) calcitriol therapy on parathyroid hormone (PTH)
   suppression in 59 children (mean age 8.4+/-4.7 years) with chronic renal
   insufficiency (mean C-cr 22.4+/-11.6 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) and secondary
   hyperparathyroidism. After a 3-week washout period, the patients were
   randomly assigned to treatment with daily oral calcitriol (10 ng/kg per
   day) or intermittent oral calcitriol (35 ng/kg given twice a week). The
   calcitriol dose was not changed throughout the study period of 8 weeks.
   At start of the study, the median intact PTH (iPTH) level was 485 pg/ml
   (range 83-2032) in the daily group (n=29) and 315 pg/ml (range 93-1638)
   in the intermittent group (n=30), After 8 weeks, the respective median
   iPTH concentrations were 232 pg/ml (range 63-1614) and 218 pg/ml (range
   2-1785) (ns). The mean iPTH decrease from baseline was 19.2+/-57.8\% and
   13.7+/-46.7\% respectively (not significant). Calcitriol reduced the
   iPTH concentration in 23/29 patients in the daily group and in 21/30 in
   the intermittent group. One episode of hypercalcemia (>11.5 mg/dl) was
   observed in both groups and a single episode of hyperphosphatemia (>7.5
   mg/dl) was observed in the daily group. It is concluded that oral
   calcitriol pulse therapy does not control secondary hyperparathyroidism
   more effectively than the daily administration of calcitriol in children
   with chronic renal failure prior to dialysis.}},

Abstract = {{dSix structurally distinct polysaccharides were fluorescently labeled
   and used to compare potential hydrolysis rates and substrate
   specificities of extracellular enzymes in bottom water and surface
   sediments. Potential hydrolysis rates differed by factors of 10-100
   among the six polysaccharides. The relative order of potential
   hydrolysis rates in sediments was distinctly different from that of the
   bottom water samples. In surface sediments, pullulan hydrolysis was
   extremely rapid, and relative hydrolysis rates decreased in the order
   pullulan >> laminarin > chondroitin sulfate > xylan > arahinogalactan >>
   fucoidan. In bottom water, in contrast, pullulan, arabinogalactan, and
   fucoidan were barely hydrolyzed, whereas chondroitin sulfate, xylan, and
   laminarin were hydrolyzed relatively rapidly. Hydrolysis rates decreased
   in the order xylan > chondroitin sulfate > laminarin >>> arahinogalactan
   congruent to pullulan congruent to fucoidan. The differences among the
   relative hydrolysis rates might reflect fundamental differences in
   seawater and sedimentary microbial communities with disparate
   extracellular enzymatic capabilities. Carbohydrates are significant
   constituents of dissolved organic carbon in seawater and are detectable
   as molecularly distinct structures in sediments of significant geologic
   age. Slow hydrolysis may provide the time required for geochemical
   transformations that further increase resistance to remineralization.}},

   co-crystallize with PP. However, at higher percentages, the EPDM
   obstructs the mobility of PP chains and hence decreases the PP
   crystallization rate. Aramid fibres are effective nucleating agents for
   PP crystallization, giving rise to the phenomenon of PP

Abstract = {{The chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 alpha was
   identified as a plasminogen binding protein by phage display analysis.
   MIP-2 alpha and a truncated form lacking 5 lysine residues in the
   COOH-terminal region (mut-MIP-2 alpha) were expressed in E. coli and
   purified to apparent homogeneity, Purified MIP-2 alpha but not mut-MIP-2
   alpha. bound specifically to plasminogen. with K-A of 3.7 x 10(9) M-1
   for the interaction of plasminogen with surface-bound MIP-2 alpha.
   Binding and competition experiments indicated that the interaction
   involves the region comprising the first 3 kringles of plasminogen and
   the COOH-terminal lysine-rich domain of MIP-2 alpha. Activation of
   plasminogen bound to surface-associated MIP-2 alpha by two-chain
   urokinase-type plasminogen activator (tcu-PA) was about 2.5-fold more
   efficient than in solution (catalytic efficiency k(cat)/K-M of 0.1 mu
   M(-1)s(-1) as compared to 0.04 mu M(-1)s(-1)). In contrast, binding of
   plasminogen to MIP-2 alpha in solution was very weak. as evidenced by
   the absence of competition of MIP-2 alpha with lysine-Sepharose or with
   human THP-1 cells for binding of plasminogen. In agreement with this
   finding, addition of excess MIP-2 alpha did not affect the main
   functional properties of plasmin(ogen) in solution, as indicated by
   unaltered activation rates of plasminogen by tcu-PA or tissue-type
   plasminogen activator (t-PA), t-PA-mediated fibrinolysis, and inhibition
   rate of plasmin by alpha(2)-antiplasmin. Thus, association of MIP-2
   alpha with surfaces exposes its COOH-terminal plasminogen-binding site,
   and may result in enhanced local plasmin generation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we examined the inhibitory effects on cell growth and the
   effects of quercetin on intracellular accumulation of adriamycin (ADR)
   in wild type Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (wild EAT cells) and their
   ADR-resistant strain. Quercetin strongly inhibited growth in both
   strains. Cell growth reached a plateau at 3.5 days in the wild type EAT
   cells and at 7 days in the ADR-resistant strain. The inhibitory
   concentration in 50\% of the ADR-resistant cells on day 7 (24 mu M) was
   twice that of the wild type EAT cells on day 4 (12 mu M) after
   continuous treatment with quercetin. Quercetin decreased the ADR
   accumulation in the wild type cells but did not affect it in the
   ADR-resistant cells. Further quercetin did not affect the retention of
   ADR in either strain. These results indicated that qeurcetin decreased
   ADR accumulation without extruding ADR in the wild type EAT cells. ADR
   accumulation in the ADR-resistant cells treated with quercetin for 7
   days was increased with increasing concentrations of quercetin. Moreover
   ADR accumulation in the ADR-resistant cells treated with 50 mu M
   quercetin for 7 days, increased to 186.6\% and to 181.9\% of that in
   untreated cells after 60 minutes and 120 minutes incubation,
   respectively, whilst it ina-eased to 70\% from 37.5\% of that in the
   wild type EAT cells after 60 minutes incubation. These findings
   indicated that quercetin might reverse ADR-resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Components in the optical spectra of surfaces and interfaces that are
   related to energy and lifetime derivatives of the bulk dielectric
   response can be understood if final-state coherence effects that are
   ignored in conventional quasistatic approaches are retained. The theory
   shows that the finite penetration depth of light in optically absorbing
   materials generates wave packets that are localized to the same region
   as the photon field. This eliminates the energy-conservation and
   causality violations of the conventional picture and in particular
   allows the surface or interface potential to influence energy gaps and
   broadening parameters. Since the localized packets are only stable
   dynamically, optical absorption is an intrinsically nonlocal process.
   The formulation also provides a quantitative physical basis for
   Lorentzian broadening, which is usually treated phenomenologically.}},

Abstract = {{Antisense oligonucleotides are potentially a powerful tool for the
   therapeutic manipulation of genes associated with cancer. However,
   pharmacological applications of oligonucleotides have been hindered by
   the inability to effectively deliver these compounds to their sites of
   action within cells. In this study, we have prepared
   peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates with the intent of improving
   intracellular delivery. The phosphorothioate oligonucleotide component
   of the conjugates was complementary to a site flanking the AUG of the
   message for P-glycoprotein, a membrane ATPase associated with multidrug
   resistance in tumor cells. Two types of peptide-antisense
   oligonucleotide conjugates, but not mismatched control conjugates,
   provided substantial inhibition of cell surface expression of
   P-glycoprotein. Surprisingly, the peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates
   were more potent in the presence of serum than when used under
   serum-free conditions; this is in striking contrast to most other
   approaches for intracellular delivery of nucleic acids. Effective
   inhibition of P-glycoprotein expression was attained with submicromolar
   concentrations of antisense conjugates under serum-replete conditions.
   The combination of relatively modest molecular size and good efficacy in
   the presence of serum proteins suggests that peptide-antisense
   oligonucleotide conjugates may have significant promise for in vivo
   therapeutic applications. BIOCHEM PHARMACOL 60;1:83-90, 2000. (C) 2000

Title = {{Thermal convection in a rotating layer of a magnetic fluid}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{157-168}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Thermal convection in magnetic fluids can be driven by buoyancy or by
   magnetic forces (due to the thermomagnetic effect). Depending on the
   direction of the applied temperature gradient, buoyancy effects: can be
   stabilizing (heating from above) or destabilzing (heating from below),
   whereas the magnetic forces always play a destabilizing role for
   magnetic fields perpendicular to the interface. We investigate the
   influence of rotations using both linear and weakly non linear analyses
   of the governing hydrodynamic equations in the Boussinesq approximation.
   With a linear stability analysis we determine the values of the
   wavelength and the temperature gradient at the onset of convection
   (critical values). These are calculated analytically in the case of
   stress free boundaries and numerically for rigid boundaries. We discuss
   the validity of the assumptions entering the calculations for stress
   free boundaries. In the case of free boundary conditions, asymptotic
   expressions of the critical values for high rotation rates are derived.
   When the system is heated from above and the magnetic forces only
   slightly exceed the buoyancy forces, linear results show that both the
   critical wavelength and the critical temperature gradient diverge.
   Again, this behavior is described by asymptotic expressions. We derive
   envelope equations for convection patterns characterized by both: one
   wave vector and two competing wave vectors of equal length but different
   directions. These equations show that the system always exhibits a
   forward bifurcation. The well-known Kuppers-Lortz instability is also
   present in magnetic fluids. This instability sets in at critical values
   for a sufficiently high rotation rate. In simple fluids the angle alpha
   depends only on the Prandtl number of the fluid. We show that for
   magnetic fluids this angle can be changed by changing the ratio of the
   buoyancy forces to the magnetic forces (i.e. by changing the magnetic
   field). There is also a weak dependence on the other magnetic parameters
   of the system. For a commercially available magnetic fluid this angle
   can be increased by approximately 10 degrees - 15 degrees compared to
   the simple fluid case.}},

Title = {{Impact of high transvalvular velocities early after implantation of
   Freestyle (R) stentless aortic bioprosthesis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEART VALVE DISEASE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{536-543}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and aim of the study: Stentless aortic bioprostheses have
   excellent hemodynamics, although heterogeneity in gradients has been
   observed. The present study was intended to determine whether high early
   postoperative transvalvular velocities correlate with other measures of
   left ventricular outflow obstruction, whether the phenomenon is
   transient, and whether high velocities observed early after surgery
   predict differences in subsequent valve performance or left ventricular
   remodeling.
   Methods: Sixty-eight consecutive patients who underwent implantation of
   Freestyle(R) stentless aortic bioprosthesis and survived to hospital
   discharge underwent early postoperative echocardiography. Peak
   transvalvular velocity was used to define a `high-velocity' group, based
   on mean (+ 1 SD) for the group. Mean pressure gradient, ratio of peak to
   proximal velocities, and effective orifice area were assessed; change in
   peak velocity and evidence of left ventricular mass regression were
   studied at one-year follow up.
   Results: Of 68 patients, 14 (21\%) had `high velocities' based on early
   postoperative peak transvalvular velocity >3.0 m/s. There was a higher
   prevalence of women (64\% versus 33\%, p = 0.04), and both body surface
   area (1.79 +/- 0.17 versus 1.95 +/- 0.20 m(2) p = 0.01) and implanted
   valve size (22.9 +/- 2.0 versus 24.9 +/- 2.1 mm, p = 0.003) were smaller
   among the `high-velocity' group. High velocity correlated with other
   measures of resistance to left ventricular outflow, including higher
   mean gradient (20.9 +/- 6.5 versus 8.3 +/- 4.2 mmHg, p < 0.001) and
   lower effective orifice area (1.15 +/- 0.36 versus 1.69 +/- 0.62 cm: p <
   0.001). High early postoperative velocities persisted at one year in
   eight of 13 (62\%) patients. Left ventricular mass regression occurred
   less often in the `high-velocity' group (38\% versus 77\% of patients, p
   = 0.03) and was present in only one of eight (12\%) patients in whom
   high velocity persisted at one year.
   Conclusion: High early postoperative transvalvular velocity suggests
   resistance to left ventricular outflow. High velocities are transient in
   some patients, although persistence of high transvalvular velocity
   suggests `prosthesis-patient mismatch' with incomplete relief of left

Abstract = {{The authors have measured the differential light-scattering cross
   sections and phase functions of single vapor-grown hexagonal ice
   particles levitated in an electrodynamic balance. The ice particles,
   grown at temperatures -5 degrees > T > -10 degrees C, were typically
   approximate to 50 mu m in diameter and tended to orient with the c axis
   either nearly vertical (parallel to the scattering plane normal) or
   horizontal (in the scattering plane). Helium-neon laser light scattered
   by a levitated crystal was collected in the angular ranges 20 degrees-65
   degrees and 115 degrees-160 degrees with a 1024-element linear
   photodiode array with an angular resolution of about 0.05 degrees. The
   particle size and orientation were measured a few seconds before and
   after the scattering measurements with top- and side-view video
   telemicroscopes. Three basic features are found in the scattering from
   vertically aligned crystals: (i) a strong ``halo{''} peak between about
   21 degrees and 35 degrees, (ii) a secondary peak with ripple structure
   between about 30 degrees and 70 degrees, and (iii) a weaker peak in the
   backscatter between 115 degrees and 160 degrees. The ripple structure is
   interpreted in terms of two-beam interference and is shown to provide a
   sensitive measure of crystal dimensions. The experimentally measured
   peak positions are compared with a simple model, and the authors discuss
   the effects of surface roughness, crystal imperfections, and tilted
   orientations on the measured scattering cross sections.}},

Abstract = {{Different techniques and different technique application procedures are
   available to determine soil hydraulic conductivity (K). The objective of
   this study was to determine the dependence of the K values on the
   selected technique and application procedure. Soil hydraulic
   conductivity was determined on a sandy loam soil in the near-saturated
   zone by the pressure infiltrometer, the tension infiltrometer field
   techniques, and the inverse method applied to laboratory outflow
   multistep experiments. Other experiments included a study of ascending
   and descending pressure heads (h) On the K values measured by the
   tension infiltrometer technique, and the effect of contact material on
   ponded infiltration rates. Differences between ascending and descending
   K means and coefficients of variation were <20\% for low pressure heads
   (h less than or equal to -120 mm). Three successive pending infiltration
   runs produced mean field-saturated hydraulic conductivities decreasing
   from 42.7 to 81.8 mm h(-1) to 12.9 to 20.6 mm h(-1) whether or not
   contact material was present on the infiltration surface. The mean
   values of K obtained by the selected three methods ranged between 47.1
   to 71.9 mm h(-1) at saturation and 0.2 to 2.6 mm h(-1) at h = -120 mm.
   The K(h) relationships obtained by the pressure with tension
   infiltrometer and multistep techniques were essentially overlapping. The
   pressure infiltrometer produced K(h) relationships that were different
   from those determined by the two Other techniques. In conclusion, ponded
   infiltration measurements were not usable for estimating unsaturated
   soil hydraulic conductivity, but contact material and ascending vs.
   descending direction had no substantial effect on infiltration rate.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to evaluate 1) the detection rate of
   atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance of endocervical
   cell type (AGUS-EC) and 2) the correlation between AGUS-EC on cytology
   and biopsy results using the conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test
   vs. the ThinPrep(R) Pap test (TPPT). Cervical-vaginal samples processed
   by the conventional Pap smear for 11 mo in 1996-1997 were identified, as
   were TPPTs collected for the smear interval in 1997-1998. Biopsy results
   were compared after a 9-mo follow-up for both groups. There were 112
   AGUS-EC cases from 82,754 conventional Pap smears (detection rate,
   0.14\%) compared with 58 cases from 82,252 TPPTs (detection rate,
   0.07\%) (P < 0.01). Biopsies were available in 72 of 112 patients from
   the conventional Pap smear group and 35 of 58 patients from the TPPT
   groups. Five dysplastic glandular lesions/AIS were diagnosed by biopsy
   in the 35 patients (14.3\%) from the TPPT group, compared with 2 of the
   72 patients (2.8\%) from the conventional Pap smear group (P < 0.05).
   there were no statistically significant differences between other
   follow-up diagnoses for the two methods. The use of TPPT resulted in
   fewer cases of AGUS-EC and better correlation with histology. The TPPT
   appears to be as sensitive as and more specific than the conventional
   Pap smear for detection of endocervical glandular lesions. (C) 2000

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Nest predation is the principal cause of mortality for many grassland
   birds. Predation rates may be higher on prairie dog colonies because
   they may have less available nesting cover and may increase predator
   abundance. We compared 14-day nest predation rates for 1,764 artificial
   nests on 102 black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies
   and their paired off-colony sites (similar habitat lacking prairie dogs)
   from 14 May to 26 June 1998 in South Dakota and Wyoming. Predation rates
   on colonies (66.2 +/- 2.2\%; (x) over bar +/- SE) were 29.5\% higher
   than at off-colony sites (51.1 +/- 2.7\%). Nesting cover on colonies was
   less dense and more uniform in structure and regression analysis showed
   differences in nest predation rates were correlated with estimates of
   mean nesting cover. Avian species associated with prairie dog colonies
   had smaller clutches and more broods/year than species associated with
   off-colony sites, suggesting a mechanism that may help compensate for
   increased risk of nest failure. Factors that influence predator-prey
   dynamics (e-g., habitat fragmentation) or foraging success (e.g., insect
   availability) also may help explain higher risk of nest predation on
   prairie dog colonies. Our conclusions support others in recommending
   protection of large, intact prairie dog ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Cytogenetic and molecular analyses have shown that the chromosome band
   12q22 is recurrently deleted in male germ cell tumors (GCTs), indicating
   the presence of a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in this region.
   To identify the TSG, we mapped the APAFI gene, a proapoptotic mammalian
   homologue of ced-4, to chromosomal band 12q22, that suggested that this
   might be the candidate deleted gene in GCTs. We further localized the
   gene between the polymorphic markers D12S1671 and D 12S 1082 at 1 2q22
   to determine the role of APAFI in the pathogenesis of CCT, and we
   characterized its normal genomic structure and analyzed its alterations
   in GCTs. The APAFI gene comprises 27 exons, with the coding region
   spanning 26. The region containing APAFI was found to be deleted in GCT
   by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, but without evidence of
   coding sequence alterations. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed
   APAFI gene expression at detectable levels in all GCT cell lines
   analyzed. An aberrant-sized APAFI protein was seen in one cell line.
   This and 2 other cell lines carrying APAFI deletions also exhibited
   defects in dATP-mediated caspase-3 activation. Caspase-3 activity was
   effectively restored by addition of recombinant caspase-9 and APAFI
   proteins, and to a lesser extent by caspase-9 alone, but not by APAFI
   alone. These data do not support a TSG role for APAFI, but defects in
   other components of the apoptotic pathway that may be related to 12q22
   deletion cannot be ruled out. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   describes the progress of the quinolones from the first to the third

Abstract = {{Mice are increasingly used in research. In particular, their wheel
   running is often used as a measure of activity, and as a marker of phase
   of circadian rhythms. Learning about the preferences of mice for
   different types of wheel may improve their welfare and suggest ways of
   increasing activity levels. Mice, Mus musculus, were given a choice
   between different types of running wheel by putting them in cages
   equipped with two wheels. Strong preferences were shown for wheels with
   a plastic mesh flooring, rather than the standard metal rods only. The
   mesh was even preferred over a solid base, although this effect was not
   seen in mice that had been given access only to wheels with the solid
   base immediately prior to the choice test. Small diameter wheels,
   sometimes sold as mouse wheels, were preferred less than standard-sized
   wheels with rods. The results suggest that types of running wheel often
   used in laboratories can be improved by considering the animals'
   preferences. The types of wheel tested here are easy to maintain and
   entail little additional cost, while increasing the mouse's interest in
   running and exercise.}},

Title = {{Restless legs syndrome in 218 patients: associated disorders}},
Journal = {{SLEEP MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{221-229}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder characterized by
   disagreeable sensations in the legs that occur at rest and are relieved
   by movement. These symptoms, which are worse at night, may result in
   sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia. Most patients are found on
   polysomnography (PSG) to have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).
   The disorder, idiopathic in most cases, may be sometimes associated with
   specific disorders.
   Methods: Using the Province of Manitoba Health database, we compared the
   diagnoses made in the 5 years prior to sleep laboratory evaluation of
   218 patients (103 men and 115 women) with RLS and 872 matched control
   subjects from the general population.
   Results: We found that 43.7\% of male RLS patients vs. 10.4\% of male
   controls and 46.1\% of female RLS patients vs. 22.8\% of female controls
   had been diagnosed as having psychological/psychiatric (most often
   depression) disorders (P<0.05). Extrapyramidal disease or movement
   disorders were previously diagnosed in 17.5\% of male RLS patients vs.
   0.2\% of male controls and in 23.5\% of female patients vs. 0.2\% of
   female controls (P<0.05). Many patients had been previously diagnosed
   with disorders of the musculoskeletal system: 35.9\% of male patients
   vs. 22.8\% of male controls and 49.6\% of female RLS patients vs. 23.3\%
   of female controls had been diagnosed as having diseases of joints
   (male; P = ns, female; P<0.05). Disorders of the back were also more
   frequently diagnosed in RLS patients: 21.4\% of male patients vs. 13.1\%
   of male controls and 38.3\% of female patients vs. 15.0\% of female
   controls (male; P = ns, female; P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: We conclude that RLS patients are much more likely to have
   previously been diagnosed with extrapyramidal disorders, musculoskeletal
   disorders, depression, and painful conditions such as joint and back
   disorders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work evaluates the efficacy of the spray-drying technique to

   entrapped model antigen (bovine albumin, BSA). The presence of a
   stabiliser was found to be an important parameter when preparing PCL
   microparticles containing a hydrophilic antigen. The effect of various
   technological parameters (concentration of the polymer and protein
   solutions, organic/aqueous phases ratio, nature of solvents and emulsion
   parameters such as duration and speed of agitation) on microparticle
   morphology and size, BSA entrapment and encapsulation efficiency was
   studied. Microparticles were characterized by a mean size from 9.56 +/-
   0.25 to 24.31 +/- 2.87 mu m and a BSA entrapment from 0.80 +/- 0.02 to
   24.21 +/- 0.23\% (w/w). SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and isoelectric
   focusing (IEF) confirmed the conservation of the physicochemical
   characteristics of the BSA entrapped within PCL microparticles produced
   by spray-drying. Together, these results showed that spray-drying is an
   efficient technique to overcome the key obstacle that represents the
   scaling-up of the manufacturing process to produce sufficient quantities

Journal = {{KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{58}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background. Mature podocytes ale growth-arrested because of the
   expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Under pathological
   conditions, podocytes may undergo mitosis, but nut cell division.
   Exceptions to this rule are collapsing glomerulopathies (CGs), including
   HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) and idiopathic CG, where podocytes
   undergo a dysregulation of their differentiated phenotype and
   proliferate,
   Methods. To shed light on the mechanism underlying podocyte
   proliferation in CC, we analyzed the expression of the proliferation
   marker Ki-67, cyclins (A, D1), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p27,
   p57), and podocyte differentiation marker synaptopodin in eight cases of
   HIVAN and two cases of idiopathic CG. Normal fetal and adult kidneys
   served as controls.
   Results. Both HIVAN and idiopathic CG showed a marked reduction in the
   expression of p27, p57. and cyclin D1 (absent in 69, 62, and 80\% of all
   glomeruli, respectively). Cyclin A and Ki-67 were expressed in 11 and
   29\% of all glomeruli. Moreover, there was partial loss of synaptopodin
   and cyclin D1 expression in nonaffected glomeruli.
   Conclusions. The loss of p27 and p57 leading to expression of cyclin A
   may account for the activation of podocyte proliferation in CG.
   Furthermore, the loss of cyclin D1 from histologically normal glomeruli
   suggests a possible role of cyclin DI in mediating the dysregulation of
   the podocyte cell cycle in CG. These novel findings offer insight into
   the molecular regulation of mature podocyte differentiation. Podocyte
   proliferation in CG provides evidence in support of a previously
   underestimated plasticity of mature podocytes.}},

Abstract = {{The development of radio networks has brought the problem of security
   specifically related to mobility of terminals sharply into focus, and
   has created the need for radio network operators to implement new
   security functionalities. The security level of the analog radio mobile
   systems (the so-called ``first generation{''} systems) was very low, and
   these systems were often exposed to massive fraud. The development of
   digital radio mobile systems (the so-called ``second generation{''}
   systems: GSM, DECT,...) allowed the systematic introduction of
   cryptology based protection mechanisms. Hence, for GSM networks for
   instance, the main fraud and confidentiality problems were taken into
   account at the design stage and a security architecture was implemented
   to provide security services to users and network operators. The third
   generation mobile telecommunication systems belonging to the IMT-2000
   family (which are still under specification within standardisation
   bodies in particular within the 3GPP worldwide third generation
   partnership project) will, in the forthcoming years, provide a wide
   variety of services on a single terminal in a multi-environment
   (domestic, public, business), multi-operator, and multi-service provide
   context. Security will be based on second generation systems security
   functions that have proved to be needed and reliable, and shall be
   adapted and improved to resolve security threats underlying to new
   services supplied by third generation radio systems. This document
   presents examples of security solutions currently implemented for
   protecting second generation radio mobile systems against frauds and
   attacks and gives an overview of potential solutions for protecting
   future third generation radio mobile telecommunication systems.}},

Abstract = {{The murine class I H-2K(b) molecule achieves high level surface
   expression in tapasin-deficient 721.220 human cells. Compared with their
   behavior in wild-type cells, K-b molecules expressed on 721.220 cells
   are more receptive to exogenous peptide, undergo more rapid surface
   decay, and fail to form macromolecular peptide loading complexes, As a
   result, they are rapidly transported to the cell surface, reflecting a
   failure of endoplasmic reticulum retention mechanisms in the absence of
   loading complex formation. Despite the failure of K-b molecules to
   colocalize to the TAP and their rapid egress to the fell surface, K-b is
   still capable of presenting TAP-dependent peptides in the absence of
   tapasin. Furthermore, pool sequencing of peptides eluted from these
   molecules revealed strict conservation of their canonical
   H-2K(b)-binding moth, There was a reduction in the total recovery of
   peptides associated with K-b molecules purified from the surface of
   tapasin-deficient cells. Comparison of the peptides bound to K-b in the
   presence and absence of tapasin revealed considerable overlap in peptide
   repertoire, These results indicate that in the absence of an interaction
   with tapasin, K-b molecules fail to assemble with calreticulin and TAP,
   yet they are still capable of acquiring a diverse array of peptides,
   However, a significant proportion of these peptides appear to be
   suboptimal, resulting in reduced cell surface stability of K-b
   complexes. Taken together, the findings indicate that tapasin plays an
   essential role in the formation of the class I loading complex, which
   retains class I heterodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum until optimal
   ligand selection is completed.}},

Abstract = {{Ratios of chlorophyll fluorescence induced by ultraviolet (UV) and
   bluegreen (BG) radiation {[}F(UV)/F(BG)] were determined with a Xe-PAM
   fluorometer to test the utility of this technique as a means of
   non-intrusively assessing changes in the pigmentation and optical
   properties of leaves exposed to varying UV exposures under laboratory
   and field conditions. For plants of Vicia faba and Brassica campestris,
   grown under controlled-environmental conditions, F(UV-B)/F(BG) was
   negatively correlated with whole-leaf UV-B-absorbing pigment
   concentrations. Fluorescence ratios of V. faba were similar to, and
   positively correlated with (r(2) = 0.77 {[}UV-B]; 0.85 {[}UV-A]), direct
   measurements of epidermal transmittance made with an integrating sphere.
   Leaves of 2 of 4 cultivars of field-grown Glycine max exposed to
   near-ambient solar UV-B at a mid-latitude site (Buenos Aires, Argentina,
   34 degrees S) showed significantly lower abaxial F(UV-B)/F(BG) values
   (i.e., lower UV-B epidermal transmittance) than those exposed to
   attenuated UV-B, but solar UV-B reduction had a minimal effect on
   F(UV-B)/F(BG) in plants growing at a high-latitude site (Tierra del
   Fuego, Argentina, 55 degrees S). Similarly, the exotic Taraxacum
   officinal did not show significant changes in F(UV-B)/F(BG) when exposed
   to very high supplemental UV-B (biologically effective UV-B = 14-15 kJ
   m(-2) day(-1)) in the field in Tierra del Fuego, whereas a native
   species, Gunnera magellanica, showed significant increases in
   F(UV-B)/F(BG) relative to those receiving ambient UV-B. These anomalous
   fluorescence changes were associated with increases in BG-absorbing
   pigments (anthocyanins), but not UV-B-absorbing pigments. These results
   indicate that non-invasive estimates of epidermal transmittance of UV
   radiation using chlorophyll fluorescence can detect changes in
   pigmentation and leaf optical properties induced by UV-B radiation under
   both field and laboratory conditions. However, this technique may be of
   limited utility in cold environments where UV and low temperatures can
   stimulate the production of BG-absorbing pigments that interfere with
   these indirect measurements of UV-transmittance.}},

Abstract = {{For the discrete memoryless quantum channel, me show the equivalence of
   two different notions of quantum channel capacity: that which uses the

   that which uses the minimum fidelity of pure states in a subspace of the
   input Hilbert space as its criterion. As a corollary, arty source with
   entropy rate less than the capacity may be transmitted with high
   entanglement fidelity. We also show that a restricted class of encodings
   is sufficient to transmit any quantum source which may be transmitted on
   a given channel. This enables us to simplify a known upper bound for the
   channel capacity It also enables us to show that the availability of an
   auxiliary classical channel from encoder to decoder does not increase
   the quantum capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: New York State instituted a statewide trauma system
   beginning in 1990. By 1993, that system included uniform emergency
   medical system triage guidelines, designated trauma centers, transfer
   agreements between trauma centers and noncenters, and a trauma registry
   containing data on seriously injured patients in each region and the
   state as a whole. We reviewed the first 4 years of registry data for the
   Finger Lakes Region to determine what effects the institution of a
   trauma system has had on the outcome of trauma care in this region.
   Design: Retrospective review of a regional trauma database.
   Methods: An qualifying injured patients in the region were entered into
   the registry beginning in 1993, Data from 1993 through 1996 for patients
   with blunt injuries were analyzed by both Trauma and Injury Severity
   Score (TRISS) methodology and logistic regression analysis, For
   comparison, two time periods were defined: 1993-1994 and 1995-1996.
   Outcomes for the two time periods were stratified by Revised Trauma
   Score and the presence or absence of head and/or cervical spine injury,
   and then compared by hospital type (regional trauma center, area trauma
   center, and noncenters).
   Results: In the later time period, there was a statistically significant
   decrease in the region-wide mortality rate. This was associated with a
   marked improvement in performance of the noncenters and with an increase
   in the proportion of patients who received definitive care at a trauma
   center.
   Conclusions: Improved outcomes for patients with blunt trauma can occur
   early in the implementation of a trauma system. This improvement may be
   attributable in part to changes in field triage and early transport to
   trauma centers.}},

Abstract = {{A retrospective clinical study was carried out over four years on 85
   cases of fractures treated by means of paracortical fixation. There were
   22 cats and 60 dogs, and three of them had several fractured members.
   The fractures corresponded to the different types of fractures that are
   enumerated in literature. The assemblies used for fracture fragment
   realignment and stabilisation comprised a paracortical fixator with 2 to
   5 coaptors that was combined in some cases with additional means of
   fixation. Several assemblies were made with a minimum opening of the
   fracture site or a closed fracture so that the requirements for
   biological osteosynthesis could be complied with. In assessing the
   difficulty of this technique compared to other possible techniques for
   the same types of fractures, it was discovered that in 72\% of the cases
   it was easy, in 16\% of the cases it was similar and in 12\% of the
   cases it proved to be difficult In 90\% of the cases the functional
   results were good or very good, and average or poor in 8.2\% of the
   cases. In all cases fracture cicatrisation was achieved by the formation
   of a periosteal type callus. In the majority of cases the callus is
   homogeneous and not very large. What the study illustrates is that
   paracortical fixation may be used as a means of biological
   osteosynthesis that rapidly produces the formation of a periosteal
   callus ton average, ablation of the osteosynthesis material on day 57).
   The indications apply to different types and sub-types of diaphyseal
   fractures of radial bones. In certain cases an additional means of
   fixation improves the mechanical properties of the assembly.
   Contraindications apply to fractures that must have rigid fixation,
   perfect anatomical reduction or fractures for which paracortical
   fixation does not ensure adequate stability, such as articular
   fractures, lower epiphyseal or metaphyseal fractures, osteomyelitis and
   pseudoarthrosis.}},

Abstract = {{This essay considers discourses around nature and landscape in the
   Soviet art criticism of the Stalin period. Rather than being a genre
   that was neglected or in some way subordinated to the themes of
   industrial construction and socialist transformation, the depiction of
   nature was a major preoccupation of Socialist Realism. Indeed, it
   because progressively stronger as the Stalinist period developed from
   the 1930s to the early 1950s. There was a common belief thar the most
   important Soviet political and social values could be conveyed through
   the imagery of the natural landscape, and there was much discussion in
   the literature as to how the ideological messages could best be
   articulated. An examination of mis discourse reveals, however, that the
   semantic potentials of landscape art ran in very different directions.
   Thus while Stalinist art was eminently successful in `politicizing' the
   representation of the natural world, it was manifestly unable to remove
   the ambiguous and even contradictory nature of the messages that
   resulted.}},

Abstract = {{The use of graft materials in rhinoplasty presents many challenges for
   the surgeon. There are a wide variety of alloplastic materials available
   for nasal augmentation but the graft material of choice remains
   autologous cartilage. It has considerable advantages over alloplasts. It
   does not induce an immune response and has a very much lower rate of
   infection or extrusion. It is also easily harvested and sculpted and is
   available in plentiful supply. We present a retrospective review of 103
   patients who underwent augmentation rhinoplasty using autologous
   cartilage grafts with a mean follow-up time of three years six months.
   The revision rate over the follow-up period was 15.5 per cent (n = 16).
   The same surgeon's revision rate for rhinoplasty without graft over the
   same period was four per cent in 311 cases. We conclude that while
   autologous cartilage remains the best graft material available there is
   a significantly higher revision rate than when no graft is required.
   This is primarily due to the unpredictable scarring associated with the
   graft in the medium term and the asymmetric nature of conchal cartilage.}},

Abstract = {{A remote sensor incorporating UV and IR spectrometers in conjunction
   with an innovative optical design is described. The instrument was used
   to noninvasively measure over 20 pollutants in the exhaust of 19 in-use
   Vehicles powered by a range of fuels-reformulated Phase II gasoline,
   diesel, compressed natural gas, and methanol blended with 15\% gasoline.
   CO2, CO, aldehydes and aliphatic and speciated aromatic hydrocarbons
   were identified along with NO, determined as the sum of NO, NO2; N2O and
   HONO were also measured, although their levels were typically below the
   instrument's detection limit. NH3 levels in vehicle exhaust are reported
   for the first time on a car-by-car basis. The exhaust from gasoline- and
   methanol-powered cars was found to contain elevated levels of NH3, in
   some cases over 1000 ppm, despite near stoichiometric air-to-fuel
   ratios, and were often significantly higher than corresponding NO
   levels. Catalyst efficiency is discussed as a function of NH3 and NO
   concentrations in the exhaust of vehicles operating ``cold{''} and
   ``hot{''}, in some of the tested vehicles, the three-way catalysts
   showed high reduction activity but poor selectivity resulting in the
   formation of NH3 and possibly other nitrogen-containing products other
   than N-2 These observations could have significant implications on the
   formation of ammonium nitrate aerosol and on the acid-neutralizing
   capacity of urban air masses.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of ATM networks will depend on switch performance and
   architecture. In this paper a set of 11 questions is presented in order
   to be able to study performance. It is necessary to clearly identify the
   main characteristics of switch architecture and traffic which are
   considered so as to be able to derive relevant comparisons. The
   questions concern the level of study, the placement of the memory, the
   monopath or multipath architecture, the uniformity of input stream, the
   destination hypotheses, the routing rules inside the switch, the
   eventual resequencing, etc. In case of cell level study and output
   buffers, the answers to the six main questions lead to a tree including
   14 realistic switch and traffic types. A survey of the modelling method
   for these cases is then presented. In order to illustrate the
   methodology, few results are given in some of the realistic cases and
   some general conclusions appear to be pertinent: importance of traffic
   asymmetry, best performance for multipath switches, use of path
   reservations inside the switch. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases
   in 13 to 14 years old children in Kuwait.
   Design: Supervised self-administered written and video questionnaires of
   the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood (ISAAC).
   Subjects: Students at third and fourth years from 40 intermediate level
   schools chosen randomly from across Kuwait.
   Results: 3,110 students were surveyed. The prevalence rates (95\% CI) in
   the written questionnaire for wheeze ever, current wheeze (within the
   last 12 months), and physician diagnosis of asthma are 25.9\% (24.5 to
   27.4), 16.1\% (15.8 to 17.4), and 16.8\% (15.5 to 18.1)respectively. The
   prevalence rates (95\% CI) for symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) ever,
   current symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR), and diagnosis of AR are
   43.9\% (42.2 to 45.6), 30.7\% (29.1 to 32.4) and 17.1\% (14.8 to 18.4)
   respectively. The prevalence rates (95\% CI) for itchy rash ever,
   current itchy rash, and diagnosis of eczema are 17.5\% (16.2 to 18.8),
   12.6\% (11.4 to 13.8), and 11.3\% (10.2 to 12.4) respectively. The
   prevalence of wheeze ever, wheeze during the last year, and physician
   diagnosis of asthma are higher in males compared with females, P < .01.
   In multiple logistic regression: male gender (OR 1.6, 95\% CI, 1.3 to
   2.0) and diagnosis of AR (OR 1.7, 95\% CI, 1.4 to 2.2) were associated
   with the physician diagnosis of asthma even after controlling for
   symptoms of asthma.
   Conclusion: This is the first study on the prevalence of allergic
   diseases in Kuwait and it shows that children in Kuwait have a moderate
   prevalence of asthma, AR, and eczema compared with other countries where
   the ISAAC study is done. The prevalence of asthma is higher in boys
   compared with girls.}},

   concentration, a known scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, on the ozonation
   rate was observed. The degradation rate was especially fast at pH 10 in
   the absence of hydroxyl radical scavengers. The rate constants of the
   reactions NaDBS-ozone and NaDBS-hydroxyl radical were found to be 3.68
   and 1.16 x 10(10) M-1.s(-1), respectively. Organic matter in wastewater
   competes with NaDBS for both dissolved ozone and hydroxyl radical,
   resulting in a decrease in the overall removal rate of the surfactant.
   COD and TOC were not completely removed from the wastewater due to an
   ozone-resistant fraction which remained after the treatment.
   Nevertheless, the ability of ozone to cause alteration in the molecular
   structures of dissolved compounds resulted in an increase of the
   wastewater biodegradability, demonstrated by the increase of the
   BOD5/COD ratio. The contributions of the direct and free radical
   reactions to the oxidation of NaDBS were evaluated in percentages of

Abstract = {{A batch-activated sludge process (AS) has been applied to eliminate
   sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (NaDBS), a linear alkylbenzenesulfonate
   (LAS) compound, from synthetic and real domestic wastewater. The
   kinetics of surfactant biodegradation was best described by first-order
   kinetics with rate constants of 1.28 and 1.15 L.(g VSS.day)(-1) for
   synthetic and real domestic wastewater, respectively. The effect of
   preozonation on the overall surfactant and COD removal rates was also
   studied. The results indicated that treatment by combined ozone-AS leads
   to negligible foam ability and low residual surfactant concentration and
   COD in the treated effluent. Acclimation of a mixed culture to ozonated
   products was beneficial to highly improve biodegradation rates after
   preozonation. Thus, when applying ozone at a dose of 100 mg.L-1, the
   first-order surfactant biodegradation rate constant increased up to 1.79
   and 3.09 L (g VSS day)(-1) for synthetic and real wastewater,

Abstract = {{The present work is a study of oxidative degradation of the organic

   biologically pretreated washing waters. In the ozonation process, a
   second-order kinetic reaction with respect to ozone and COD or
   aromaticity has been deduced. The kinetic rate constants were correlated
   as a function of temperature by Arrhenius-type equations. In the aerobic
   biological treatment, a kinetic study was performed using the Contois
   model, giving a value of 4.8 10(-2) h(-1) for the kinetic bioreaction
   constant. Likewise, a cell yield coefficient of 0.30 g VSSg COD-1 and a
   kinetic constant for the endogenous metabolisme of 1.2 10(-2) h(-1) were
   deduced. Finally, in the ozonation of biologically pretreated
   wash-waters, the deduced kinetic rate constants for COD and aromaticity
   were, respectively, 4.5 and 2.4 times higher that those corresponding to
   the ozonation of wash-waters without biological pretreatment. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Purpose: To study the effect of acute hyperglycemia on the erythrocyte
   flow in specific retinal capillary paths. Methods: A technique for
   fluorescent labeling of a known fraction of the erythrocyte moiety of
   systemic blood was combined with fluorescence viewing of the retinal
   capillary network in live cats, This technique was developed to enable
   visualization of the erythrocyte flow in the retinal capillary network
   and used to acquire video recording of the retinal capillary erythrocyte
   flow in normal feline eyes. The pattern of capillary erythrocyte flow
   under normal blood glucose levels and normal systemic blood pressure
   served as baseline. Acute hyperglycemia was induced by intravenous
   injection of glucose while monitoring the systemic blood pressure. Two
   subsets of functional capillary pathways previously defined as S
   (simple) and C (complex) were identified in the recorded data. The
   relationship between erythrocyte flux in random selections of these two
   pathways and the level of hyperglycemia and systemic blood pressure was
   determined. Results: Induction of acute hyperglycemia led to acute
   elevation of the systemic blood pressure that returned to baseline
   levels within few minutes, while blood glucose remained high. The
   capillary erythrocyte flux in S paths was significantly higher than in C
   paths at all values of systemic blood pressure. The capillary
   erythrocyte flux in the S paths was directly proportional to the
   systemic blood pressure whereas the flux in C paths was minimally
   affected by acute hyperglycemia for the systemic blood pressure range
   between 110 and 160 mm Hg. Conclusions: The erythrocyte flux in S paths
   is affected by the changes of the systemic blood pressure and these
   paths act as `shunt vessels' when acute elevation of the systemic blood
   pressure occurs. C paths maintain stable perfusion under changing
   conditions, most probably in an effort to minimally alter the basic
   metabolic needs of the retinal tissue. Hyperglycemia per se was not
   responsible for changes of the cell flux in these capillary paths.

   or to groups that received a ``low{''} (10(2) CCID50), ``middle{''}
   (10(4) CCID50), or ``high{''} (10(6) CCID50) dose of an intramuscular
   challenge of the NADC-8 PRRSV strain.
   Results: The number of infected litters in all dosage groups was
   significantly higher (P<.001) among CHAL females compared to VACC-CHAL
   females. Dead fetuses and viremia were observed in all litters in the
   low- and middle-dose groups, and in three of four litters in the
   high-dose group in the CHAL females; and in no low-dose litters, one
   oft-we middle-dose litters, and one of four high-dose litters in the
   VACC-CHAL females. No fetal death or viremia was identified in control
   groups. Among infected litters, no significant difference in the
   percentage of infected fetuses per litter was observed regardless of
   vaccination status or challenge virus dose. The number of litters with
   fetal death and infection was significantly lower in the low-dose
   VACC-CHAL group when compared to the low-dose CHAL group (P<.01), but no
   significant difference was demonstrated between the two medium or two
   high dose groups.
   Implications: Vaccine-induced protective immunity appeared to protect
   eight of 10 litters from reproductive failure, but may be overcome with
   increased (greater than or equal to 10(4) CCID50) doses of challenge
   virus. The lowest PRRSV exposure dose (102 CCID50) tested in this study
   caused reproductive failure in naive, unvaccinated animals. The
   percentage of infected fetuses per litter observed suggests that
   multiple fetuses/weakborn pigs should be sampled to ensure that infected
   animals are represented. Sampling dead or autolyzed fetuses is generally
   diagnostically unrewarding for PRRSV infection.}},

Abstract = {{Thin CaF2(111) films (60-130 Angstrom) have been grown in ultra-high
   vacuum by vapor deposition on Si(111)-(7 X 7) surfaces. Damage by
   low-energy (50 eV) electrons and the subsequent adsorption of small
   molecules (O-2, CO2, N-2, C2H6, and C2H4) have been examined using
   photoemission and electron energy loss spectroscopies. The damaged
   surface is highly reactive with O-2 and CO2. The initial rapid uptake of
   O saturates at exposures of less than or equal to 10 Langmuirs (L),
   leading to the attenuation of a damage-induced defect peak at 1.8 eV in
   the energy loss spectrum and the appearance of a feature indicating Ca-O
   banding in the surface-sensitive Ca 3p photoemission spectrum. The O Is
   and valence-band photoemission data indicate two distinct states of
   chemisorbed O differing in valence charge density. No chemisorption on
   the damaged surface is seen for less than or equal to 10(3) L of N-2, or
   less than or equal to 300 L of C2H6. For C2H4, deposition of C is shown

Abstract = {{Sulfonic acids of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) are converted into the
   corresponding sodium salts to produce the most widely used anionic
   surfactant worldwide, linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS). Used in many
   industrial applications and consumer products, the physical and
   mechanical properties of the sulfonates are strongly dependent on the
   LAB manufacturing process. Until recently, commercial alkylation of
   benzene has employed aluminum chloride or hydrogen fluoride catalysts,
   but a new fixed-bed alkylation process (DETAL) has been developed with
   improved 2-phenyl isomer selectivity and low tetralin concentration. In
   order to better understand the rheology of LAS in aqueous media, a
   comprehensive comparative evaluation of sulfonic acids and sodium
   sulfonates of the three LAB process derivatives has been done using
   dynamic mechanical rheometry, steady shear viscometry, and X-ray
   diffraction for phase identification. LAB sulfonic acids are Newtonian
   fluids in the temperature range of 20-60 degrees C. The neat AlCl3, HF,
   and DETAL sulfonic acids are Newtonian fluids within the temperature
   range of 20-60 degrees C. At 30 wt\%, all three sulfonates are Newtonian
   at 20-60 degrees C, and the 40 wt\% AlCl3 sodium sulfonate remains in
   the Newtonian regime within this temperature range. Lamellar liquid
   crystalline phases have been identified for the sulfonates in the
   concentration range of 40-60 wt\% in water at 20-60 degrees C, and a
   hexagonal lattice phase also has been identified for DETAL sodium
   alkylbenzene sulfonate at 40 wt\%, 60 degrees C. The presence of
   anisotropic phases results in non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior with
   time-dependent viscosity functions.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes Mellitus is approaching pandemic proportions across the globe.
   It is a disproportionately expensive condition. accounting for 5-9\% of
   annual NHS expenditure. Family practices often play a huge role in the
   care of diabetic patients. Many GPs elect to play a larger role in
   diabetes care, but the increasing burden on the multidisciplinary
   secondary care team means that some of the burden has to fall to family
   practitioners. In order to provide a high standard of care, the
   practitioner requires access to continuing education regarding diabetes
   care. The value of patient education is undisputed. In light of this
   situation a computer-aided learning (CAL) system is being developed for
   the education of both patients and practitioners concerning diabetes and
   its care. The proposed system takes a two pronged approach, being aimed
   at both patient and practitioner. This interactive system employs
   multimedia technology to teach practical skills and promote and
   consolidate theoretical understanding. It is hoped this system will
   improve patient self-care, and in the long-term reduce the incidence of
   diabetic complications and their associated costs. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The signal transmission during short-term acclimation in Brassica rapa
   plants confronted with low root zone temperatures was explored by using
   signal blockers in root medium with (or without) low temperatures, and
   examining changes in root hydraulic conductivity. EGTA, lanthanum, and
   verapamil did not block this root response suggesting that Ca2+
   exchanges with the apoplast on the plasmalemma were not strictly
   required for signal transfer In contrast, treatments with lithium ions
   or neomycin blocked the reestablishment of root hydraulic conductivity
   during cold acclimation. This result is consistent with the involvement
   of IP3 signaling in the response, and suggests the role of Ca2+ ions
   from internal stores as secondary messenger. The effect of t-BHQ
   (modulator of Ca2+ exchange between internal stores and protoplast )
   reinforces this hypothesis of IP3 intervention in delivering Ca2+ ions
   on the endomembrane system. The target of the Ca2+ ions would be enzymes
   (such as protein kinases) rather than calmodulin itself.}},

   A one-dimensional model of a composite beam is presented, where the

   described by means of a strain energy density function defined
   throughout the beam axis. The problem of small vibrations of the system
   is formulated and solved through an analytical procedure where a
   coupling between longitudinal and transversal motions, due to the
   presence of the connection, takes place. The analytical model is used
   with a view to interpreting a series of dynamic tests performed on
   composite beams whose connections have different linear densities.
   Experimental results proved consistent with theoretical estimates and
   allowed the identification of some important physical parameters of the
   system and the characterization of the connection.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to present and discuss a new model of
   practical skill performance in nursing. The model is conceptualized as
   having five components: substance and sequence; accuracy; fluency;
   integration; and caring conduct.
   The model challenges the truism of `simple' nursing procedures. It is
   argued that performance of practical skills in nursing is characterized
   by complexity on many levels.
   Complexity lies within and between the components of the performance
   model and in the interaction between the nurse and the clinical context
   where practical nursing actions are performed.
   These complexities are described. Examples that illustrate the complex
   and reciprocal nature of these components are drawn from an empirical
   study of graduate nurses' development of practical skill in surgical
   hospital units.
   Implications of the model for education, practice and research are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In Russia and elsewhere, proponents of rapid, mass privatization of
   state-owned enterprises (ourselves among them) hoped that the profit
   incentives unleashed by privatization would soon revive faltering,
   centrally planned economies. In Russia, the revival didn't happen. We
   offer here some partial explanations. First, mass privatization is
   likely to lead to massive self-dealing by managers and controlling
   shareholders unless (implausibly in the initial transition from central
   planning to markets) a country has a good infrastructure for controlling
   self-dealing Russia accelerated the self-dealing process by selling
   control of its largest enterprises cheaply to crooks, who transferred
   their skimming talents to the enterprises they acquired, and used their
   wealth to further corrupt the government and block reforms that might
   constrain their actions. Second profit incentives to restructure
   privatized businesses and create new ones can be swamped by the burden
   on business imposed by a combination of (among other things) a punitive
   tax system, official corruption, organized crime, and an unfriendly
   bureaucracy. Third, while self-dealing will still occur (though perhaps
   to a lesser extent) if state enterprises aren't privatized. since
   self-dealing accompanies privatization, it politically discredits
   privatization as a reform strategy and can undercut longer-term reforms.
   A principal lesson: developing the institutions to control self-dealing
   is central to successful privatization of large firms.}},

   industries to find alternatives to antibiotics where they are used
   routinely in animal production. The current use of antibiotics in animal
   production systems is discussed and alternatives to antibiotic use
   considered. It is concluded that good disease prevention measures and

Abstract = {{Systematic analysis of the Arabidopsis genome provides a basis for
   detailed studies of genome structure and evolution. Members of multigene
   families were mapped, and random sequence alignment was used to identify
   regions of extended similarity in the Arabidopsis genome. Detailed
   analysis showed that the number, order, and orientation of genes were
   conserved over large regions of the genome, revealing extensive
   duplication covering the majority of the known genomic sequence. Fine
   mapping analysis showed much rearrangement, resulting in a patchwork of
   duplicated regions that indicated deletion, insertion, tandem
   duplication, inversion, and reciprocal translocation. The implications
   of these observations for evolution of the Arabidopsis genome as well as
   their usefulness for analysis and annotation of the genomic sequence and
   in comparative genomics are discussed.}},

   paid to two and three dimensions. In particular, it is found that
   scaling properties of the modified dispersion moments are directly
   related with the presence of empty bins in the corresponding
   distributions. As to the high-energy experiments, those expressions can
   be applied to the data presently available, e.g. from LEP, as well as to

Abstract = {{Following injury to central nervous tissues, damaged neurons are unable
   to regenerate their axons spontaneously. Implantation of peripheral
   nerves into the CNS, however, does result in axonal regeneration into
   these transplants and is one of the most powerful strategies to promote
   CNS regeneration. In the present study implantation of peripheral nerve
   bridges following dorsal hemisection is combined with ex vivo gene
   transfer with adenoviral vectors encoding neurotrophin-3 (Ad-NT-3) to
   examine whether this would stimulate regeneration of one of the long
   descending tracts of the spinal cord, the corticospinal tract (CST),
   into and beyond the peripheral nerve implant. We chose to use an
   adenoviral vector encoding NT-3 because CST axons are sensitive to this
   neurotrophin and Schwann cells in peripheral nerve implants do not
   express this neurotrophin. At 16 weeks postimplantation of
   Ad-NT-3-transduced intercostal nerves, approximately three- to fourfold
   more of the anterogradely traced corticospinal tract fibers had regrown
   their axons through gray matter below the lesion. site when compared to
   control animals. Regrowth of CST fibers occurred over more than 8 mm
   distal to the lesion site. No regenerating CST fibers were, however,
   observed into the transduced peripheral implant. Animals with a
   peripheral nerve transduced with Ad-NT-3 also exhibited improved
   function of the hindlimbs when compared to control animals treated with
   an adenoviral vector encoding LacZ. Thus, transient overexpression of
   NT-3 in peripheral nerve tissue bridges is apparently sufficient to
   stimulate regrowth of CST fibers and to promote recovery of hindlimb
   function, but does not result in regeneration of CST fibers into such
   transplants. Taken together, combining an established
   neurotransplantation approach with viral vector-gene transfer promotes
   the regrowth of injured CST fibers through gray matter and improves the
   recovery of hindlimb function. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a reparable system with a finite state space, evolving in
   time according to a semi-Markov process. The system is stopped for it to
   be preventively maintained at random times for a random duration. Our
   aim is to find the preventive maintenance policy that optimizes the
   stationary availability, whenever it exists. The computation of the
   stationary availability is based on the fact that the above maintained
   system evolves according to a semi-regenerative process. As for the
   optimization, we observe on numerical examples that it is possible to
   limit the study to the maintenance actions that begin at deterministic
   times. We demonstrate this result in a particular case and we study the
   deterministic maintenance policies in that case. Tn particular, we show
   that, if the initial system has an increasing failure rate, the
   maintenance actions improve the stationary availability if and only if
   they are not too long on the average, compared to the repairs ( a bound
   for the mean duration of the maintenance actions is provided). On the
   contrary, if the initial system has a decreasing failure rate, the
   maintenance policy lowers the stationary availability. A few other cases
   are studied. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons; Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A number of new photosensitive copolyacrylates of different composition
   were obtained by the copolymerization of chiral photochromic
   benzilidene-p-menthane-3-one acrylic monomers with a smectogenic monomer
   containing a hexyloxyphenylbenzoate mesogenic group. The chiral,
   photochromic monomers differ by the length of the aliphatic spacer and
   the aromatic fragment. It was found that the introduction of a small
   number of chiral units into the copolymers (5 mol\%) leads to the
   ``degeneration{''} of the smectic C phase, which characterizes the
   hexyloxyphenylbenzoate homopolymer, and to the formation of the smectic
   A phase. An unusual effect of chiral nematic phase induction was
   observed for copolymers containing chiral side groups with two ring
   aromatic fragments. It should be pointed out that the chiral nematic
   phase does not occur in the case of the homopolymers of both initial
   comonomers. An explanation of this effect, based on the consideration of
   the chemical structure of the chiral and hexyloxyphenylbenzoate units,
   was suggested. The optical properties of cholesteric copolymers were
   investigated; the helical twisting power of the chiral groups of
   different structures was calculated. The possibility of using such

Abstract = {{Fire fighting is an old, familiar way of doing business, especially when
   developing new products and ramping up manufacturing. But fire fighting
   consumes an organization's resources and damages productivity. People
   rush from task to task, rarely completing one job before being
   interrupted by another. And serious problem solving degenerates into
   quick-and-dirty patching. Managers must perform a juggling act, deciding
   where to allocate overworked people and which crises to ignore for the
   moment.
   What factors underly this destructive pattern? Fire fighting isn't an
   irrational response to high-pressure management situations. Rather, it
   derives from what seems like a reasonable set of rules investigate all
   problems, for example, or assign the most difficult problems to your
   best troubleshooter. Ultimately, however, fire-fighting organizations
   fail to solve problems adequately and forgo so many opportunities that
   overall performance plummets.
   Some companies never fight fires, even though they have just as much
   work and just as many resource constraints as other companies do. They
   have strong problem-solving cultures. They perform triage. They set
   realistic deadlines. They don't tackle a problem unless they're
   committed to understanding its root cause and finding a valid solution.
   And they don't reward fire-fighting behavior.
   Transforming a fire-fighting organization into a problem-solving one is
   not easy. But them are tactical, strategic, and cultural methods for
   pulling your company out of fire-fighting mode.}},

Abstract = {{A skull representing a new genus and species of Late Triassic
   temnospondyl, Rileymillerus cosgriffi, is described from the Cooper
   Canyon Formation, upper Dockum Group of Garza County, Texas.
   Rileymillerus resembles Latiscopus disjunctus in size and proportions,
   but the very poorly preserved unique type specimen of L. disjunctus
   indicates that the taxon should be considered a nomen dubium. Characters
   of R. cosgriffi include its small size combined with skull, lack of
   lateral line canals, lateral exposure of the palatine on the skull
   surface, and lack of otic notch/quadrate angle. No postcranial material
   can be definitely associated, although we describe a partial vertrebral
   column that might pertain to R. cosgriffi. Relationships of R cosgriffi
   are uncertain. The possibilities of a close relationship Almsauridae,
   Tuplika are explicitly examined, but for the present we consider have
   been converted to the tripartite (part, feature, state) as a
   125-character data matrix in the Appendix.}},
