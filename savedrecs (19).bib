Abstract = {{The main objective of the present study was to determine the effects of
   longer loading-unloading times on the per cent recoveries (R) and the
   non-recoverable compliances (J(nr)) of bitumens modified with
   polyethylene (PE), polyphosphoric acid (PPA) and both additives
   (PE+PPA). These effects were quantified by means of ratios of R values
   and J(nr) values at one test condition to another test condition, and
   the best formulations were reported. The base bitumen is graded as PG
   64-xx and the modified bitumens have the same high PG grade (PG 76-xx).
   All the materials showed lower R values and higher J(nr) values with
   increasing creep and recovery times from 1/9s to 2/18s, which indicates
   that they are more susceptible to permanent deformation when both times
   are longer. These higher J(nr) values at 2/18s and the high PG grade can
   be mainly attributed to the increase in the viscous portion of the
   viscoelastic response of the bitumen.}},

Abstract = {{This article analyses factors influencing rural households' decisions to
   remain in collectives or separate from them during Russia's
   post-socialist privatisation period in the 1990s. It argues that
   although decisions to remain in or separate from a collective were
   influenced by a number of factors, the dominant one was the households'
   abilities to cope with independent production. These abilities were
   predetermined by the extent to which production was intensified in each
   collective. In Siberia less labour and capital intensive husbandry based
   on native herding that is well - adapted to the local environment,
   offered better chances of establishing viable economies, and thus
   greater incentives to split from a collective.}},

Title = {{Influence of low- and high-elevation plant genomes on the regulation of
   autumn cold acclimation in Abies sachalinensis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Boreal coniferous species with wide geographic distributions show
   substantial variation in autumn cold acclimation among populations. To
   determine how this variation is inherited across generations, we
   conducted a progeny test and examined the development of cold hardening
   in open-pollinated second-generation (F-2) progeny of Abies
   sachalinensis. The F1 parents had different genetic backgrounds
   resulting from reciprocal interpopulational crosses between low
   elevation (L) and high elevation (H) populations: L x L, L x H, H x L,
   and H x H. Paternity analysis of the F-2 progeny using molecular genetic
   markers showed that 91.3\% of the fathers were located in surrounding
   stands of the F-1 planting site (i.e., not in the F1 test population).
   The remaining fathers were assigned to F-1 parents of the L x L
   cross-type. This indicates that the high-elevation genome in the F-1
   parents was not inherited by the F-2 population via pollen flow. The
   timing of autumn cold acclimation in the F-2 progeny depended on the
   cross type of the F1 mother. The progeny of H x H mothers showed less
   damage in freezing tests than the progeny of other cross-types.
   Statistical modeling supported a linear effect of genome origin. In the
   best model, variation in freezing damage was explained by the proportion
   of maternally inherited high-elevation genome. These results suggest
   that autumn cold acclimation was partly explained by the additive effect
   of the responsible maternal genome. Thus, the offspring that inherited a
   greater proportion of the high-elevation genome developed cold hardiness
   earlier. Genome-based variation in the regulation of autumn cold
   acclimation matched the local climatic conditions, which may be a key
   factor in elevation dependent adaptation.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{We have after half a century of coordinated scientific drilling gained
   insight into Earth's largest microbial habitat, the subseafloor igneous
   crust, but still lack substantial understanding regarding its abundance,
   diversity and ecology. Here we describe a fossilized microbial
   consortium of prokaryotes and fungi at the basalt-zeolite interface of
   fractured subseafloor basalts from a depth of 240 m below seafloor
   (mbsf). The microbial consortium and its relationship with the
   surrounding physical environment are revealed by synchrotron-based X-ray
   tomographic microscopy (SRXTM), environmental scanning electron
   microscopy (ESEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The base of the consortium is
   represented by micro-stromatolites- remains of bacterial communities
   that oxidized reduced iron directly from the basalt. The
   microstromatolites and the surrounding basalt were overlaid by fungal
   cells and hyphae. The consortium was overgrown by hydrothermally formed
   zeolites but remained alive and active during this event. After its
   formation, fungal hyphae bored in the zeolite, producing millimetre-long
   tunnels through the mineral substrate. The dissolution could either
   serve to extract metals like Ca, Na and K essential for fungal growth
   and metabolism, or be a response to environmental stress owing to the
   mineral overgrowth. Our results show how microbial life may be
   maintained in a nutrient-poor and extreme environment by close
   ecological interplay and reveal an effective strategy for nutrient
   extraction from minerals. The prokaryotic portion of the consortium
   served as a carbon source for the eukaryotic portion. Such an approach
   may be a prerequisite for prokaryotic-eukaryotic colonisation of, and
   persistence in, subseafloor igneous crust.}},

Abstract = {{In this article I discuss how the experience of boredom becomes a vital
   part of the narratives and practices of a group of young greasers in a
   peri-urban community in Sweden. The ethnographic material originates
   from fieldwork carried out among the local Volvo greasers', aged between
   15 and 19 years, at the local youth centre and the car park in a
   peri-urban community in Sweden in 2010. The aim of the article is to
   understand how place, personhood and social relations are intertwined in
   the greaser culture by introducing the concept of spatial boredom, which
   strives to illuminate the greasers' active engagement and negotiation
   with the experience of boredom. In light of this, the semantics of
   spatial boredom - the community's geographical placement as boring,
   reactive rather than active, static rather than dynamic - a symbolic
   link to femininity, domesticity, safety, routine and hence immanence is
   established. The orientation towards a dangerous', masculine-coded
   public space is reinforcing a split between both the feminine and the
   masculine and the public and the private.}},

Title = {{Helicobacter pylori modulates host cell survival regulation through the
   serine-threonine kinase, 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1)}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection affects cell
   survival signaling pathways including cell apoptosis and proliferation,
   which are considered risk factors for the development of gastric cancer
   when unregulated. In the present study, we investigated the effect of H.
   pylori infection on the phosphorylation state of
   3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), a master kinase that
   regulates phosphorylation of Akt (also known as protein kinase B, PKB)
   and cell survival.
   Methods: The activity of PDK-1 was examined in human gastric epithelial
   cells incubated in the presence or absence of different H. pylori
   strains. In addition, the role of H. pylori type IV secretion system and
   the mechanism of H. pylori effect on PDK-1 activity was examined.
   Results: In the presence of H. pylori, phosphorylation of the activation
   loop (serine 241) PDK-1 was rapidly lost suggesting that
   dephosphorylation of PDK-1 is a target for H. pylori to modulate cell
   survival. The extent of dephosphorylation was strain dependent with H.
   pylori 60190 being the most effective. H. pylori infection of gastric
   epithelial cells resulted in altered phosphorylation and degradation of
   Akt, suggesting that PDK-1 dephosphorylation affects cell survival
   pathways and thereby may contribute to disease pathogenesis.
   Conclusion: We propose that dephosphorylation of PDK-1 and the resulting
   changes to Akt phosphorylation is one of the mechanisms by which
   infection with H. pylori alter the balance between apoptosis and cell
   proliferation and identify a host molecular mechanism regulated by H.
   pylori that ultimately contributes to carcinogenesis. Our studies
   therefore provide insights into one of the mechanisms by which H. pylori
   infection contributes to gastric cancer by regulating the activity of a
   cell survival signaling pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors has spread across sub-Saharan
   Africa. Alternative tools and molecules are urgently needed for
   effective vector control. One of the most promising strategies to
   prevent or delay the development of resistance is to use at least two
   molecules having unrelated modes of action in combination in the same
   bed net. We evaluated in experimental huts in Cote d'Ivoire, a new
   polyethylene long-lasting insecticidal net (LN) product, Olyset (R) Duo,
   incorporating permethrin (PER) and pyriproxyfen (PPF), an insect growth
   regulator (IGR). PPF alone or in combination with permethrin had a
   significant impact on fertility (7-12\% reduction relative to control)
   and no effect on fecundity of wild multi-resistant An. gambiae s.s.
   These results triggered crucial research questions on the behaviour of
   targeted mosquitoes around the LN. To maximize the sterilizing effect of
   PPF in the combination, there would be a need for a trade-off between
   the necessary contact time of the insect with PPF and the surface
   content of the pyrethroid insecticide that is bioavailable and induces
   excito-repellency.}},

Abstract = {{Although power conversion efficiency (PCE) of state-of-the-art
   perovskite solar cells has already exceeded 20\%, photo- and/or moisture
   instability of organolead halide perovskite have prevented further
   commercialization. In particular, the underlying weak interaction of
   organic cations with surrounding iodides due to eight equivalent
   orientations of the organic cation along the body diagonals in unit cell
   and chemically non-inertness of organic cation result in photo- and
   moisture instability of organometal halide perovskite. Here, a
   perovskite light absorber incorporating organic-inorganic hybrid cation
   in the A-site of 3D APbI(3) structure with enhanced photo- and moisture
   stability is reported. A partial substitution of Cs+ for HC(NH2)(2)(+)
   in HC(NH2)(2)PbI3 perovskite is found to substantially improve photo-
   and moisture stability along with photovoltaic performance. When 10\% of
   HC(NH2)(2)(+) is replaced by Cs+, photo- and moisture stability of
   perovskite film are significantly improved, which is attributed to the
   enhanced interaction between HC(NH2)(2)(+) and iodide due to contraction
   of cubo-octahedral volume. Moreover, trap density is reduced by one
   order of magnitude upon incorporation of Cs+, which is responsible for
   the increased open-circuit voltage and fill factor, eventually leading
   to enhancement of average PCE from 14.9\% to 16.5\%.}},

Title = {{Ablation of CD8 alpha(+) dendritic cell mediated cross-presentation does
   not impact atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mice}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Clinical complications of atherosclerosis are almost exclusively linked
   to destabilization of the atherosclerotic plaque. Batf3-dependent
   dendritic cells specialize in cross-presentation of necrotic
   tissue-derived epitopes to directly activate cytolytic CD8 Tcells. The
   mature plaque (necrotic, containing dendritic cells and CD8 Tcells)
   could offer the ideal environment for cross-presentation, resulting in
   cytotoxic immunity and plaque destabilization. Ldlr(-/-) mice were
   transplanted with batf3(-/-) or wt bone marrow and put on a western type
   diet. Hematopoietic batf3 deficiency sharply decreased CD8 alpha(+) DC
   numbers in spleen and lymph nodes (>80\%; P < 0,001). Concordantly,
   batf3(-/-) chimeras had a 75\% reduction in OT-I cross-priming capacity
   in vivo. Batf3(-/-) chimeric mice did not show lower Tcell or other
   leukocyte subset numbers. Despite dampened cross-presentation capacity,
   batf3(-/-) chimeras had equal atherosclerosis burden in aortic arch and
   root. Likewise, batf3(-/-) chimeras and wt mice revealed no differences
   in parameters of plaque stability: plaque Tcell infiltration, cell
   death, collagen composition, and macrophage and vascular smooth muscle
   cell content were unchanged. These results show that CD8 alpha(+) DC
   loss in hyperlipidemic mice profoundly reduces cross-priming ability,
   nevertheless it does not influence lesion development. Taken together,
   we clearly demonstrate that CD8 alpha(+) DC-mediated cross-presentation
   does not significantly contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation
   and stability.}},

Abstract = {{We present a perturbation technique to study the linear and nonlinear
   output characteristics of coherent photon transport in a parity-time
   (PT)-symmetric double-microcavity system where one passive cavity
   contains a single quantum emitter. It is found that (i) for the linear
   transmission of a low-power input probe field, the output spectra of the
   proposed PT -symmetric system exhibit a single transparent resonance dip
   and two symmetric, strongly amplifying sidebands, i.e., an inverted
   dipole-induced transparency; and (ii) for the nonlinear transmission of
   the input probe field, giant optical third-order nonlinearities with
   high linear transmission rate and vanishing nonlinear absorption can be
   achieved efficiently when the system parameters are tuned properly so
   that a PT - symmetry phase transition occurs. The obtained results can
   be useful for quantum information processing, quantum nondemolition
   measurements of photons, and optical signal processing.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Quantum coherence and entanglement, which are essential resources for
   quantum information, are often degraded and lost due to decoherence.
   Here, we report a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of high
   fidelity entanglement distribution over decoherence channels via qubit
   transduction. By unitarily switching the initial qubit encoding to
   another, which is insensitive to particular forms of decoherence, we
   have demonstrated that it is possible to avoid the effect of decoherence
   completely. In particular, we demonstrate high-fidelity distribution of
   photonic polarization entanglement over quantum channels with two types
   of decoherence, amplitude damping and polarization-mode dispersion, via
   qubit transduction between polarization qubits and dual-rail qubits.
   These results represent a significant breakthrough in quantum
   communication over decoherence channels as the protocol is input-state
   independent, requires no ancillary photons and symmetries, and has
   near-unity success probability.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Caves are nutrient-limited and dark subterranean ecosystems. To date,
   attention has been focused on geological research of caves in China,
   whilst indigenous microbial diversity has been insufficiently
   characterized. Here, we report the fungal diversity in the pristine,
   oligotrophic, karst Heshang Cave, central China, using a
   culture-dependent method coupled with the analysis of the fungal
   rRNA-ITS gene sequences. A total of 194 isolates were obtained with six
   different media from 14 sampling sites of sediments, weathered rocks,
   and bat guanos. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the 194 sequenced
   isolates into 33 genera within 15 orders of three phyla, Ascomycota,
   Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota, indicating a high degree of fungal
   diversity in the Heshang Cave. Notably, 16 out of the 36 fungal genera
   were also frequently observed in solution caves around the world and 23
   genera were previously found in carbonate cave, indicating potential
   similarities among fungal communities in cave ecosystems. However, 10
   genera in this study were not reported previously in any solution caves,
   thus expanding our knowledge about fungal diversity in cave ecosystems.
   Moreover, culturable fungal diversity varied from one habitat to another
   within the cave, being the highest in sediments, followed by weathered
   rocks and bat guanos as indicated by alpha-diversity indexes. At the
   genus level, Penicillium accounted for 40, 54, and 52\% in three
   habitats of sediments, weathered rocks, and bat guanos, respectively.
   Trichoderma, Paecilomyces, and Aspergillus accounted for 9, 22, and 37\%
   in the above habitats, correspondingly. Despite of the dominance of
   Penicillium in all samples, beta-diversity index indicated significant
   differences between each two fungal communities in the three habitats in
   view of both the composition and abundance. Our study is the first
   report on fungal communities in a natural pristine solution cave system
   in central China and sheds light on fungal diversity and functions in
   cave ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of
   chronic liver disease in the industrialized world. The prevalence of
   NAFLD is increasing, becoming a substantial public health burden. NAFLD
   includes a broad spectrum of disorders, from simple conditions such as
   steatosis to severe manifestations such as fibrosis and cirrhosis. The
   relationship of NAFLD with metabolic alterations such as type 2 diabetes
   is well described and related to insulin resistance, with NAFLD being
   recognized as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. However,
   NAFLD may also coincide with endocrine diseases such as polycystic ovary
   syndrome, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency or hypercortisolism.
   It is therefore essential to remember, when discovering altered liver
   enzymes or hepatic steatosis on radiological exams, that endocrine
   diseases can cause NAFLD. Indeed, the overall prognosis of NAFLD may be
   modified by treatment of the underlying endocrine pathology. In this
   review, we will discuss endocrine diseases that can cause NALFD.
   Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms will be presented and specific
   treatments will be reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Computerized automation is likely to play an increasingly
   important role in radiotherapy. The objective of this study was to
   report the results of the first part of a program to implement a model
   for economical evaluation based on micro-costing method. To test the
   efficacy of the model, the financial impact of the introduction of an
   automation tool was estimated. A single- and multi-center validation of
   the model by a prospective collection of data is planned as the second
   step of the program.Material and methods. The model was implemented by
   using an interactive spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel, 2010). The variables
   to be included were identified across three components: productivity,
   staff, and equipment. To calculate staff requirements, the workflow of
   Gemelli ART center was mapped out and relevant workload measures were
   defined. Profit and loss, productivity and staffing were identified as
   significant outcomes. Results were presented in terms of earnings before
   interest and taxes (EBIT). Three different scenarios were hypothesized:
   baseline situation at Gemelli ART (scenario 1); reduction by 2 minutes
   of the average duration of treatment fractions (scenario 2); and
   increased incidence of advanced treatment modalities (scenario 3). By
   using the model, predicted EBIT values for each scenario were calculated
   across a period of eight years (from 2015 to 2022).Results. For both
   scenarios 2 and 3 costs are expected to slightly increase as compared to
   baseline situation that is particularly due to a little increase in
   clinical personnel costs. However, in both cases EBIT values are more
   favorable than baseline situation (EBIT values: scenario 1, 27\%,
   scenario 2, 30\%, scenario 3, 28\% of revenues).Conclusion. A model
   based on a micro-costing method was able to estimate the financial
   consequences of the introduction of an automation tool in our
   radiotherapy department. A prospective collection of data at Gemelli ART
   and in a consortium of centers is currently under way to prospectively
   validate the model.}},

Abstract = {{There is currently no clinically effective vaccine against leishmaniasis
   because of poor understanding of the antigens that elicit dominant T
   cell immunity. Using proteomics and cellular immunology, we identified a
   dominant naturally processed peptide (PEPCK335-351) derived from
   Leishmania glycosomal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). PEPCK
   was conserved in all pathogenic Leishmania, expressed in glycosomes of
   promastigotes and amastigotes, and elicited strong CD4(+) T cell
   responses in infected mice and humans. I-A(b)-PEPCK335-351 tetramer
   identified protective Leishmania-specific CD4(+) T cells at a clonal
   level, which comprised similar to 20\% of all Leishmania-reactive CD4(+)
   T cells at the peak of infection. PEPCK335-351-specific CD4(+) T cells
   were oligoclonal in their T cell receptor usage, produced polyfunctional
   cytokines (interleukin-2, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor),
   and underwent expansion, effector activities, contraction, and stable
   maintenance after lesion resolution. Vaccination with PEPCK peptide, DNA
   expressing full-length PEPCK, or rPEPCK induced strong durable
   cross-species protection in both resistant and susceptible mice. The
   effectiveness and durability of protection in vaccinated mice support
   the development of a broadly cross-species protective vaccine against
   different forms of leishmaniasis by targeting PEPCK.}},

Abstract = {{How humans integrate information to form beliefs about reality is a
   question that has engaged scientists for centuries, yet the biological
   system supporting this process is not well understood. One of the most
   salient attributes of information is valence. Whether a piece of news is
   good or bad is critical in determining whether it will alter our
   beliefs. Here, we reveal a frontal-subcortical circuit in the left
   hemisphere that is simultaneously associated with enhanced integration
   of favorable information into beliefs and impaired integration of
   unfavorable information. Specifically, for favorable information,
   stronger white matter connectivity within this system, particularly
   between the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left subcortical
   regions (including the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, putamen, and
   pallidum), as well as insular cortex, is associated with greater change
   in belief. However, for unfavorable information, stronger connectivity
   within this system, particularly between the left IFG and left pallidum,
   putamen, and insular cortex, is associated with reduced change in
   beliefs. These novel results are consistent with models suggesting that
   partially separable processes govern learning from favorable and
   unfavorable information.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{The S = 1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice is
   studied using the density-matrix renormalization-group method. To
   identify the ground state, we take four kinds of clusters into account;
   periodic, cylindrical, and two open ones. The hexagonal-singlet solid
   (HSS) and triangular valence-bond solid (TVBS) states are artificially
   generated by modulating edge shapes of the open clusters. We find that
   the energy per site of the HSS state is e(0) = E-0/(NJ) = -1.410 95,
   which is readily lower than that of the TVBS state (e(0) = -1.3912 +/-
   0.0025). This agrees well with those of the cylindrical (e(0) = -1.4122)
   and periodic (e(0) = -1.4111) clusters where no assumption as to the
   ordering is posed. We further calculate the dimer-dimer correlation
   functions as well as the entanglement entropy of cylindrical clusters
   and conclude that a non-symmetry-breaking state is the ground state of
   the S = 1 kagome Heisenberg model. Finally, we estimate the
   singlet-triplet energy gap: The HSS state has Delta/J = 0.178 +/- 0.005,
   whereas the higher TVBS state has a larger one Delta/J = 0.280.}},

Title = {{Pangenome analysis of Bifidobacterium longum and site-directed
   mutagenesis through by-pass of restriction-modification systems}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bifidobacterial genome analysis has provided insights as to
   how these gut commensals adapt to and persist in the human GIT, while
   also revealing genetic diversity among members of a given
   bifidobacterial (sub) species. Bifidobacteria are notoriously
   recalcitrant to genetic modification, which prevents exploration of
   their genomic functions, including those that convey (human) health
   benefits.
   Methods: PacBio SMRT sequencing was used to determine the whole genome
   seqeunces of two B. longum subsp. longum strains. The B. longum
   pan-genome was computed using PGAP v1.2 and the core B. longum
   phylogenetic tree was constructed using a maximum-likelihood based
   approach in PhyML v3.0. M. blmNCII was cloned in E. coli and an internal
   fragment if arfBarfB was cloned into pORI19 for insertion mutagenesis.
   Results: In this study we present the complete genome sequences of two
   Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum strains. Comparative analysis with
   thirty one publicly available B. longum genomes allowed the definition
   of the B. longum core and dispensable genomes. This analysis also
   highlighted differences in particular metabolic abilities between
   members of the B. longum subspecies infantis, longum and suis.
   Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the B. longum core genome
   indicated the existence of a novel subspecies. Methylome data, coupled
   to the analysis of restriction-modification systems, allowed us to
   substantially increase the genetic accessibility of B. longum subsp.
   longum NCIMB 8809 to a level that was shown to permit site-directed
   mutagenesis.
   Conclusions: Comparative genomic analysis of thirty three B. longum
   representatives revealed a closed pan-genome for this bifidobacterial
   species. Phylogenetic analysis of the B. longum core genome also
   provides evidence for a novel fifth B. longum subspecies. Finally, we
   improved genetic accessibility for the strain B. longum subsp. longum
   NCIMB 8809, which allowed the generation of a mutant of this strain.}},

Title = {{On the nature of the molecular ordering of water in aqueous DMSO
   mixtures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Computer simulation studies of aqueous dimethyl sulfoxyde (DMSO)
   mixtures show micro-heterogeneous structures, just like aqueous alcohol
   mixtures. However, there is a marked difference in the aggregate
   structure of water between the two types of systems. While water
   molecules form multiconnected globular clusters in alcohols, we report
   herein that the typical water aggregates in aqueous DMSO mixtures are
   linear, favouring a 2 hydrogen bond structure per water molecule, and
   for all DMSO mole fractions ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. This
   linear-aggregate structure produces a particular signature in the water
   site-site structure factors, in the form of a pre-peak at k approximate
   to 0.2-0.8 angstrom(-1), depending on DMSO concentration. This pre-peak
   is either absent in other aqueous mixtures, such as aqueous methanol
   mixtures, or very difficult to see through computer simulations, such as
   in aqueous-t-butanol mixtures. This difference in the topology of the
   aggregates explains why the Kirkwood-Buff integrals of aqueous-DMSO
   mixture look nearly ideal, in contrast with those of aqueous alcohol
   mixtures, suggesting a connection between the shape of the water
   aggregates, its fluctuations, and the concentration fluctuations. In
   order to further study this discrepancy between aqueous DMSO and aqueous
   alcohol mixture, two models of pseudo-DMSO are introduced, where the
   size of the sulfur atom is increased by a factor 1.6 and 1.7,
   respectively, hence increasing the hydrophobicity of the molecule. The
   study shows that these mixtures become closer to the emulsion type seen
   in aqueous alcohol mixtures, with more globular clustering of the water
   molecules, long range domain oscillations in the water-water
   correlations and increased water-water Kirkwood-Buff integrals. It
   demonstrates that the local ordering of the water molecules is
   influenced by the nature of the solute molecules, with very different
   consequences for structural properties and related thermodynamic
   quantities. This study illustrates the unique plasticity of water in
   presence of different types of solutes. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Impact of guidance documents on translational large animal studies of

Abstract = {{Promising therapies for cartilage repair are translated through large
   animal models toward human application. To guide this work, regulatory
   agencies publish recommendations ({''}guidance documents{''}) to direct
   pivotal large animal studies. These are meant to aid in study design,
   outline metrics for judging efficacy, and facilitate comparisons between
   studies. To determine the penetrance of these documents in the field, we
   synthesized the recommendations of the American Society for Testing and
   Materials, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and European Medicines
   Agency into a scoring system and performed a systematic review of the
   past 20 years of preclinical cartilage repair studies. Our hypothesis
   was that the guidance documents would have a significant impact on how
   large animal cartilage repair studies were performed. A total of 114
   publications meeting our inclusion criteria were reviewed for adherence
   to 24 categories extracted from the guidance documents, including 11
   related to study design and description and 13 related to study
   outcomes. Overall, a weak positive trend was observed over time (P =
   0.004, R-2 = 0.07, slope = 0.63\%/year), with overall adherence (the sum
   of study descriptors and outcomes) ranging from 32 +/- 16\% to 58 +/-
   14\% in any individual year. There was no impact of the publication of
   the guidance documents on adherence (P = 0.264 to 0.50). Given that
   improved adherence would expedite translation, we discuss the reasons
   for poor adherence and outline approaches to increase and promote their
   more widespread adoption.}},

Abstract = {{With the discovery of the Higgs boson the Standard Model has become a
   complete and comprehensive theory, which has been verified with
   unparalleled precision and in principle might be valid at all scales.
   However, several reasons remain why we firmly believe that there should
   be physics beyond the Standard Model. Experiments such as the LHC, new B
   factories, and earth-and space-based astro-particle experiments provide
   us with unique opportunities to discover a coherent framework for many
   of the long-standing puzzles of our field. Here we explore several
   significant interconnections between the physics of the Higgs boson, the
   physics of flavour, and the experimental clues we have about dark
   matter.}},

Abstract = {{Ukraine has long been considered as a bone of contention between the EU

   the Ukrainian revolution and Russian-Ukrainian war. To address the
   deadlock in understanding the mixed dynamics of the situation in
   Ukraine, the article argues that the relations in the EU-Ukraine-Russia
   triangle are affected by the combination of choices that the Ukrainian
   political class, business elites and broader society make in four major
   dimensions: internal political practices; economic dimension; a
   dimension of international politics; and an ideological dimension.}},

Title = {{Relationships between dose to the gastro-intestinal tract and

Abstract = {{Background. Gastrointestinal (GI) morbidity after radiotherapy (RT) for
   prostate cancer is typically addressed by studying specific single
   symptoms. The aim of this study was to explore the interplay between
   domains of patient- reported outcomes (PROs) on GI morbidity, and to
   what extent these are explained by RT dose to the GI tract.Material and
   methods. The study included men from two Scandinavian studies (N =
   211/277) who had undergone primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for
   localized prostate cancer to 70-78 Gy (2 Gy/fraction). Factor analysis
   was applied to previously identified PRO-based symptom domains from two
   study-specific questionnaires. Number of questions: 43; median time to
   follow-up: 3.6-6.4 years) and dose-response outcome variables were
   defined from these domains. Dose/volume parameters of the anal sphincter
   (AS) or the rectum were tested as predictors for each outcome variable
   using logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation. Performance was
   assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
   (A(z)) and model frequency.Results. Outcome variables from Defecation
   urgency (number of symptoms: 2-3), Fecal leakage (4-6), Mucous (4), and
   Pain (3-6) were defined. In both cohorts, intermediate rectal doses
   predicted Defecation urgency (mean A(z): 0.53-0.54; Frequency: 70-75\%),
   and near minimum and low AS doses predicted Fecal leakage (mean A(z):
   0.63-0.67; Frequency: 83-99\%). In one cohort, high AS doses predicted
   Mucous (mean A(z): 0.54; Frequency: 96\%), whereas in the other, low AS
   doses and intermediate rectal doses predicted Pain (mean A(z): 0.69;
   Frequency: 28-82\%).Conclusion. We have demonstrated that Defecation
   urgency, Fecal leakage, Mucous, and Pain following primary EBRT for
   localized prostate cancer primarily are predicted by intermediate rectal
   doses, low AS doses, high AS doses, or a combination of low AS and
   intermediate rectal doses, respectively. This suggests that there is a
   domain-specific dose-response for the GI tract. To reduce risk of GI
   morbidity, dose distributions of both the AS region and the rectum
   should, therefore, be considered when prescribing prostate cancer RT.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the association of plasma levels of interleukin
   (IL)-6 and -8 with Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1)specific immune responses and
   clinical outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
   (PDA) treated with dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with three types of
   major histocompatibility complex class I and II-restricted WT1 peptides
   combined with chemotherapy.
   METHODS: During the entire treatment period, plasma levels of IL-6 and
   -8 were analyzed by ELISA. The induction of WT1-specific immune
   responses was assessed using the WT1 peptide-specific delayed-type
   hypersensitivity (DTH) test.
   RESULTS: Three of 7 patients displayed strong WT1-DTH reactions
   throughout long-term vaccination with significantly decreased levels of
   IL-6/-8 after vaccinations compared with the levels prior to treatment.
   Moreover, overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in PDA patients
   with low plasma IL-6 levels (< 2 pg/mL) after 5 vaccinations than in
   patients with high plasma IL-6 levels (>= 2 pg/mL) (P = 0.025). After
   disease progression, WT1-DTH reactions decreased severely and were
   ultimately negative at the terminal stage of cancer. The decreased
   levels of IL-6/-8 observed throughout long-term vaccination were
   associated with WT1-specific DTH reactions and long-term OS.
   CONCLUSION: Prolonged low levels of plasma IL-6/-8 in PDA patients may
   be a prognostic marker for the clinical outcomes of chemoimmunotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the effect of contextual predictability on the
   prosodic realisation of focussed expressions in American English and
   Paraguayan Guarani. Pairs of native speakers played an interactive game
   to elicit utterances that varied in the location of focus in the NP and
   whether this location was predictable from visual context. The English
   results confirmed that focussed expressions had more rising pitch
   accents, longer durations, and higher f0 than non-focussed expressions.
   Differences between focussed and non-focussed expressions were enhanced
   when the location of focus was not predictable from context. The Guarani
   results confirmed that focussed expressions had distinctive pitch accent
   and duration patterns relative to non-focussed expressions. Overall
   prosodic prominence was enhanced when the location of focus was not
   predictable from context. These results, which are discussed within
   information-based theories of language production, suggest contextual
   predictability affects the prosodic realisation of focus, and that this
   predictability-dependence varies across languages.}},

Title = {{The Influence of Malnutrition and Micronutrient Status on Anemic Risk in
   Children under 3 Years Old in Poor Areas in China}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Malnutrition and anemia affect large numbers of young children living in
   poor areas of China. Multi-micronutrient deficiencies may be related to
   the prevalence of anemia in different populations, and identifying the
   risk factors that render children susceptible to anemia is the first
   step in combating anemia effectively.
   Methods
   In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1370 children under 3 years
   old were selected based on probability proportional to size sampling
   principles from poor counties of China. Basic characteristics data were
   collected by questionnaire; then anthropometrics and hemoglobin were
   measured in the field and anemia prevalence evaluated. Venous blood was
   drawn from children aged 12-35 months (N = 553) to evaluate
   micronutrient status. Logistic regression was used to identify the risk
   factors for children's anemia.
   Results
   Among children aged 0-35 months, the prevalence of stunting, low body
   weight and wasting was 17.5\%, 8.6\% and 5.1\%, respectively, and 25.6\%
   of the children were affected by anemia, with more anemic infants and
   younger children than older children (P < 0.01). There were 26.5\%,
   12.8\%, 14.1\% and 20.0\% of the children aged 12-35 months affected by
   iron deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, folic acid deficiency and vitamin
   B-12 deficiency, respectively. For children aged 0-11 months who were
   breastfed, the mothers' anemic status was the only factor associated
   with the child's anemia (OR = 2.6; 95\% CI: 1.2-5.4, P < 0.05). For
   children aged 12-35 months, multivariate logistic regression indicated
   that anemia was significantly associated with iron and vitamin B-12
   deficiency (OR = 5.3; 95\% CI: 1.9-14.5, P < 0.01) and monotonous diet
   (OR = 2.3; 95\% CI: 1.1-4.7, P < 0.05) after adjusting for age and
   gender.
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of anemia was higher in children under 2 years old and
   requires urgent intervention. An effective intervention strategy should
   include iron and vitamin B12 supplements, improving dietary diversity
   and controlling breastfeeding mothers' anemia.}},

   composed of three covalently linked
   1,6,7,12-tetra(phenoxy)perylene-3,4:9,10-bis- (dicarboximide) (EDT)
   units. The rigid triangular architecture reduces the electronic coupling
   between the PDIs, so ultrafast symmetry-breaking charge separation is
   kinetically favored over intramolecular excimer formation, as revealed
   by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Photoexcitation of the
   PDI triangle dissolved in CH2Cl2 gives PDI+center dot-PDI-center dot in
   tau(CS) = 12.0 +/- 0.2 ps. Fast subsequent intramolecular electron/hole
   hopping can equilibrate the six possible energetically degenerate
   ion-pair states, as suggested by electron paramagnetic
   resonance/electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy, which shows
   that one-electron reduction of the EDT triangle results in complete
   electron sharing among the three PDIs. Charge recombination of
   PDI+center dot PDI-center dot to the ground state occurs in tau(CR) =
   1.12 +/- 0.01 ns with no evidence of triplet excited state formation.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a survey for intervening HI 21-cm absorbers at
   intermediate and low redshift (0 < z < 1.2). For our total sample of 24
   systems, we obtained high-quality data for 17 systems, the other seven
   being severely affected by radio frequency interference (RFI). Five of
   our targets are low-redshift (z < 0.17) optical galaxies with small
   impact parameters (< 20 kpc) towards radio-bright background sources.
   Two of these were detected in 21-cm absorption, showing narrow, high
   optical depth absorption profiles, the narrowest having a velocity
   dispersion of only 1.5 km s(-1), which puts an upper limit on the
   kinetic temperature of T-k < 270 K. Combining our observations with
   results from the literature, we measure a weak anticorrelation between
   impact parameter and integral optical depth in local (z < 0.5) 21-cm
   absorbers. Of 11 Ca II and Mg II systems searched, two were detected in
   21-cm absorption, and six were affected by RFI to a level that precludes
   a detection. For these two systems at z similar to 0.6, we measure spin
   temperatures of T-s = (65 +/- 17) K and T-s > 180 K. A subset of our
   systems was also searched for OH absorption, but no detections were
   made.}},

Title = {{ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF SYNCHROTRON X-RAY RIMS IN TYCHO'S SUPERNOVA REMNANT}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{812}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Several young supernova remnants (SNRs) exhibit thin X-ray bright rims
   of synchrotron radiation at their forward shocks. Thin rims require
   strong magnetic field amplification beyond simple shock compression if
   rim widths are only limited by electron energy losses. But, magnetic
   field damping behind the shock could produce similarly thin rims with
   less extreme field amplification. Variation of rim width with energy may
   thus discriminate between competing influences on rim widths. We
   measured rim widths around Tycho's SNR in five energy bands using an
   archival 750 ks Chandra observation. Rims narrow with increasing energy
   and are well described by either loss-limited or damped scenarios, so
   X-ray rim width-energy dependence does not uniquely specify a model.
   But, radio counterparts to thin rims are not loss-limited and better
   reflect magnetic field structure. Joint radio and X-ray modeling favors
   magnetic damping in Tycho's SNR with damping lengths similar to 1\%-5\%
   of remnant radius and magnetic field strengths similar to 50-400 mu G
   assuming Bohm diffusion. X-ray rim widths are similar to 1\% of remnant
   radius, somewhat smaller than inferred damping lengths. Electron energy
   losses are important in all models of X-ray rims, suggesting that the
   distinction between loss-limited and damped models is blurred in soft
   X-rays. All loss-limited and damping models require magnetic fields
   greater than or similar to 20 mu G, affirming the necessity of magnetic
   field amplification beyond simple compression.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Prior to 1985,+/- 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was readily
   used as a psychotherapeutic adjunct. As MDMA became popular in treating
   various psychiatric illnesses by mental health professionals, the public
   started to abuse the MDMA-containing recreational drug ecstasy. This
   alarmed the DEA, which led to emergency scheduling of MDMA as a Schedule
   I drug. Due to its scheduling in 1985, human research and clinical use
   has been limited. The majority of research on MDMA has been focused on
   the drug's potential harmful effects rather than its possible
   therapeutic effects. The limitations on retrospective human studies and
   preclinical animal models of MDMA neurotoxicity are examined in this
   analysis. New research has shown that MDMA, used as a catalyst in
   psychotherapy, is effective in treating posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD). This review also examines the psychopharmacological basis for
   the efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Specifically, the brain
   regions involved with both PTSD and those activated by MDMA (i.e.,
   amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus) are examined.
   Also, the possible neurochemical mechanisms involved in MDMA's efficacy
   in treating PTSD are reviewed.}},

   probability of J/psi and. using sudden approximation. Our results show
   that quarkonium decay may be significant even when temperature of

   Diversity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{The present work describes the construction and validation of a human
   scFv library with a novel design approach to synthetic complementarity
   determining region (CDR) diversification. The advantage of synthetic
   antibody libraries includes the possibility of exerting fine control
   over factors like framework sequences, amino acid and codon usage, and
   CDR diversity. However, random combinatorial synthesis of
   oligonucleotides for CDR sequence diversity also produces many clones
   with unnatural sequences and/or undesirable modification motifs. To
   alleviate these issues, we designed and constructed a novel
   semi-synthetic human scFv library with non-combinatorial, pre-designed
   CDR diversity and a single native human framework each for heavy, kappa,
   and lambda chain variable domains. Next-generation sequencing analysis
   indicated that the library consists of antibody clones with highly
   nature-like CDR sequences and the occurrence of the post-translational
   modification motifs is minimized. Multiple unique clones with nanomolar
   affinity could be isolated from the library against a number of target
   antigens, validating the library design strategy. The results
   demonstrate that it is possible to construct a functional antibody
   library using low, non-combinatorial synthetic CDR diversity, and
   provides a new strategy for the design of antibody libraries suitable
   for demanding applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on current European employment policy, promoting the
   individual's responsibility for remaining employable. Within this
   supply-oriented framework, general political responsibilities of both
   increasing the demand for labour and facilitating the development of
   human capital through training and education opportunities are less
   emphasized than the individual's own responsibility to remain attractive
   for employers. In an analysis of perceived opportunities among European
   employees, we argue that the concept of `employment security' can lift
   the individualized perspective on employability skills and attributes to
   a more structural and institutional perspective. To enhance individuals'
   chances of finding a job, educational and lifelong learning policies and
   active labour market measures are believed to be important factors,
   besides general demand in the labour market. Through multi-level
   modelling, we analyse the significance of individual and contextual
   factors on employees' perception of their chances in the labour market.
   The data used are from the European Social Survey (2010), including data
   from 21 countries. Our results indicate that employability cannot solely
   be regarded as an individual phenomenon relying on individual
   characteristics. We also need to focus on the institutional context
   enabling the individual to remain in employment in the existing mobile
   and risky labour market.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined associations between the violence of a loss and the
   suddenness of a loss and symptom levels of prolonged grief disorder
   (PGD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after the death of a
   loved one. A further aim was to investigate whether peritraumatic
   distress (i.e., fear, helplessness, and horror) and peritraumatic
   dissociation mediate the emotional impact of violent losses and
   unexpected losses. We obtained self-reported data from 265 individuals
   bereaved in the previous 3 years by losses due to violent causes (17\%)
   or illness (83\%). Outcomes showed that participants who experienced
   violent losses (due to homicide, suicide, or accident) reported more PGD
   symptoms and PTSD symptoms compared to those confronted with illness
   loss. In this latter group, greater perceived unexpectedness was
   positively associated with PGD severity and PTSD severity. Multiple
   mediation analyses showed that the impact of violent loss and
   unexpectedness of the loss on PGD severity and PTSD severity was fully
   mediated by peritraumatic distress and dissociation; peritraumatic
   helplessness and peritraumatic dissociation (but not peritraumatic fear
   and horror) emerged as unique mediators. Findings suggest that both
   violent and unexpected losses exacerbate postloss psychopathology, which
   is at least partially because of such losses yielding more intense acute
   helplessness and dissociative responses.}},

   the effect of the hole density was calculated, as a result, it
   significantly affects the mechanical properties of the MPUE. In
   addition,based on the same hole number, the corresponding hole density
   also affects the mechanical properties of the MPUE. The results indicate
   that the hole density is important in affecting the mechanical
   properties of the MPUE. When the hole density is less than 0.4, the
   stress increases linearly with the increase of the hole density; while
   when it is greater than 0.5, the stress increases nonlinearly with the
   increase of the hole density and the toughening effect of the holes are
   more obvious. In addition, the fluctuation of the hole size makes an
   increase of the stress, while reducing the variance of the hole size can
   improve the stability of the mechanical properties of MPUE.}},

Abstract = {{(HMGB1) in the seizure-induced P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression and
   the underlying mechanism. Kainic acid (KA)-induced mouse seizure model
   was used for in vivo experiments. Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into
   four groups: normal saline control (NS) group, KA-induced epileptic
   seizure (EP) group, and EP group pretreated with HMGB1 (EP+HMGB1 group)
   or BoxA (HMGB1 antagonist, EP+BoxA group). Compared to the NS group,
   increased levels of HMGB1 and P-gp in the brain were observed in the EP
   group. Injection of HMGB1 before the induction of KA further increased
   the expression of P-gp while pre-treatment with BoxA abolished this
   up-regulation. Next, the regulatory role of HMGB1 and its potential
   involved signal pathways were investigated in mouse microvascular
   endothelial bEnd. 3 cells in vitro. Cells were treated with HMGB1, HMGB1
   plus lipopolysaccharide from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS)
   {[}toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist], HMGB1 plus FPS-ZM1
   {[}receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) inhibitor], HMGB1
   plus SN50 {[}nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) inhibitor], or vehicle.
   Treatment with HMGB1 increased the expression levels of P-gp, TLR4, RAGE
   and the activation of NF-kappa B in bEnd. 3 cells. These effects were
   inhibited by the pre-treatment with either LPS-RS or FPS-ZM1, and were
   abolished by the pre-treatment of SN50 or a combination treatment of
   both LPS-RS and FPS-ZM1. Luciferase reporter assays showed that
   exogenous expression of NF-kappa B p65 increased the promoter activity
   of multidrug resistance 1a (P-gp-encoding gene) in endothelial cells.
   These data indicate that HMGB1 contributes to the overexpression of P-gp
   in mouse epileptic brain tissues via activation of TLR4/RAGE receptors
   and the downstream transcription factor NF-kappa B in brain
   microvascular endothelial cells.}},

Abstract = {{Soybean is one of the most economically important crops in Argentina and

   FGSC from soybean as compared to other crops of large-scale growing such
   as wheat and maize. A phylogenetic recognition of the Fusarium

   and Brazil was performed in order to identify species responsible for
   trichothecene production. Sequences of genes encoding for the partial
   translation elongation factor, the 3-O-acetyltransferase and a putative
   reductase were analysed by the Maximum Parsimony method. Although the
   present study has focused on a limited number of isolates, this is the
   first report that provides evidence of the presence of at least four
   species within the FGSC associated with soybean in Argentina: F.
   graminearum sensu stricto, F. cortaderiae, F. meridionale and F.
   boothii. In addition, F. graminearum sensu stricto was detected for the
   first time among Brazilian isolates from soybean.}},

Title = {{t-Darpp overexpression in HER2-positive breast cancer confers a survival
   advantage in lapatinib}},

Abstract = {{Drug resistance is a major barrier to successful cancer treatment. For
   patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who initially respond to
   therapy, the majority develop resistance within one year of treatment.
   Patient outcomes could improve significantly if we can find and exploit
   common mechanisms of acquired resistance to different targeted
   therapies. Overexpression of t-Darpp, a truncated form of the dual
   kinase/phosphatase inhibitor Darpp-32, has been linked to acquired
   resistance to trastuzumab, a front-line therapy for HER2-positive breast
   cancer. Darpp-32 reverses t-Darpp's effect on trastuzumab resistance. In
   this study, we examined whether t-Darpp could be involved in resistance
   to lapatinib, another HER2-targeted therapeutic. Lapatinib-resistant
   SKBR3 cells (SK/LapR) showed a marked change in the Darpp-32: t-Darpp
   ratio toward a predominance of t-Darpp. Overexpression of t-Darpp alone
   was not sufficient to confer lapatinib resistance, but cells that
   overexpress t-Darpp partially mimicked the molecular resistance
   phenotype observed in SK/LapR cells exposed to lapatinib. SK/LapR cells
   failed to down-regulate Survivin and failed to induce BIM accumulation
   in response to lapatinib; cells overexpressing t-Darpp exhibited only
   the failed BIM accumulation. t-Darpp knock-down reversed this phenotype.
   Using a fluorescence-based co-culture system, we found that cells
   overexpressing t-Darpp formed colonies in lapatinib within 3-4 weeks,
   whereas parental cells in the same co-culture did not. Overall, t-Darpp
   appears to mediate a survival advantage in lapatinib, possibly linked to
   failed lapatinib-induced BIM accumulation. t-Darpp might also be
   relevant to acquired resistance to other cancer drugs that rely on BIM
   accumulation to induce apoptosis.}},

Abstract = {{We apply the Ricardian approach to analyse the economic impact of
   climate change on agriculture using the 2007 World Bank Tajikistan
   Living Standards Survey. The study analyses data of 2557 farm households
   in 166 villages across the 10 agro-ecological country zones. In general,
   the results indicated that increasing temperature and precipitation will
   both be damaging to Tajikistan agriculture and consequently to the net
   revenue (NR) of farmers in the medium and long term. Regressing NR on
   climate parameters, household and soil variables showed that these
   variables have a significant impact on the farmers' NR per hectare. We
   examined the impact of the current climate on farmers' NR per hectare,
   and how that is affected by future climate scenarios: one +2.9 degrees C
   warming and one 4.6 degrees C warming scenarios. Although the analysis
   did not incorporate variables such as the carbon fertilization effect,
   the role of technology or the change in prices in the future,
   significant information for policy-making can be extracted. Tajikistan
   has very diverse regions in terms of geography, population density and
   socio-economic situation; our results will help policy-makers to
   anticipate the adaptation effort needed in different locations of the

Abstract = {{We introduce here MATtrack, an open source MATLAB-based computational
   platform developed to process multi-Tiff files produced by a
   photo-conversion time lapse protocol for live cell fluorescent
   microscopy. MATtrack automatically performs a series of steps required
   for image processing, including extraction and import of numerical
   values from Multi-Tiff files, red/green image classification using
   gating parameters, noise filtering, background extraction, contrast
   stretching and temporal smoothing. MATtrack also integrates a series of
   algorithms for quantitative image analysis enabling the construction of
   mean and standard deviation images, clustering and classification of
   subcellular regions and injection point approximation. In addition,
   MATtrack features a simple user interface, which enables monitoring of
   Fluorescent Signal Intensity in multiple Regions of Interest, over time.
   The latter encapsulates a region growing method to automatically
   delineate the contours of Regions of Interest selected by the user, and
   performs background and regional Average Fluorescence Tracking, and
   automatic plotting. Finally, MATtrack computes convenient visualization
   and exploration tools including a migration map, which provides an
   overview of the protein intracellular trajectories and accumulation
   areas. In conclusion, MATtrack is an open source MATLAB-based software
   package tailored to facilitate the analysis and visualization of large
   data files derived from real-time live cell fluorescent microscopy using
   photoconvertible proteins. It is flexible, user friendly, compatible
   with Windows, Mac, and Linux, and a wide range of data acquisition
   software. MATtrack is freely available for download at

   per variable) was performed using PRISM (Parameter-elevation
   Relationships on Independent Slopes Model). Surface stations available
   for analysis numbered only 4,000 for dew point and 3,500 for vapor
   pressure deficit, compared to 16,000 for previously-developed grids of
   1981-2010 long-term mean monthly minimum and maximum temperature.
   Therefore, a form of Climatologically-Aided Interpolation (CAI) was
   used, in which the 1981-2010 temperature grids were used as predictor
   grids. For each grid cell, PRISM calculated a local regression function
   between the interpolated climate variable and the predictor grid. Nearby
   stations entering the regression were assigned weights based on the
   physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell that included
   the effects of distance, elevation, coastal proximity, vertical
   atmospheric layer, and topographic position. Interpolation uncertainties
   were estimated using cross-validation exercises. Given that CAI
   interpolation was used, a new method was developed to allow
   uncertainties in predictor grids to be accounted for in estimating the
   total interpolation error. Local land use/land cover properties had
   noticeable effects on the spatial patterns of atmospheric moisture
   content and deficit. An example of this was relatively high dew points
   and low vapor pressure deficits at stations located in or near irrigated
   fields. The new grids, in combination with existing temperature grids,
   enable the user to derive a full suite of atmospheric moisture
   variables, such as minimum and maximum relative humidity, vapor
   pressure, and dew point depression, with accompanying assumptions. All
   of these grids are available online at http://prism.oregonstate.edu, and
   include 800-m and 4-km resolution data, images, metadata, pedigree
   information, and station inventory files.}},

Abstract = {{An elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) was fused to D-amino acid oxidases

   DAAO, and its enzymatic activity is about 1.6 times that of DAAO. The
   stability of the proteins was investigated by interacting with urea at
   various concentrations. The circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra
   were measured. The results demonstrated that that ELP-DAAO exhibited a
   much better stability than DAAO, and ELP-DAAO has retained the a-helix
   content with a high percentage even at a high urea concentration. The
   results of this work have demonstrated that the ELP tag can be utilized
   to purify DAAO, in the meantime the solubility and stability of the
   enzyme are improved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a systematic study of the unexpected enhancement of
   some hydrocarbon impurities towards formic acid oxidation (FAO) at Pt
   nanoparticles modified GC electrode, for the first time. That is, the
   oxidation current peak observed at ca. 0.25 V (assigned for the direct
   FAO to CO2,Ip(d)) increases in the presence of a minute amount (similar
   to ppm range) of Acetonitrile > Acrylonitrile > Acetamide > Pyridine
   vinyl acetate > Pyrrole > Methyl Acrylate > toluene with a concurrent
   decrease of the second oxidation peak current (assigned for the indirect
   oxidation of FA, I-p(ind)) observed at ca. 0.65 V. Moreover, the onset
   potential of FAO is favored by shifted towards the negative potentials
   together with a noticeable increase of the stability of the current
   transients measured during FAO in the presence of impurities. The
   enhanced activity is believed to originate from interrupting the
   contiguity of Pt sites by the pre-adsorption of the respective impurity
   at nano-Pt surface thus impedes/weakens the adsorption of the poisoning

Title = {{Transcriptome analysis of wheat inoculated with Fusarium graminearum}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Plants are frequently exposed to microorganisms like fungi, bacteria,
   and viruses that cause biotic stresses. Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an
   economically risky wheat disease, which occurs upon Fusarium graminearum
   (Fg) infection. Moderately susceptible (cv. ``Mizrak 98{''}) and
   susceptible (cv. ``Gun 91{''}) winter type bread wheat cultivars were
   subjected to transcriptional profiling after exposure to Fg infection.
   To examine the early response to the pathogen in wheat, we measured gene
   expression alterations in mock and pathogen inoculated root crown of
   moderately susceptible (MS) and susceptible cultivars at 12 hours after
   inoculation (hai) using 12X135K microarray chip. The transcriptome
   analyses revealed that out of 39,179 transcripts, 3668 genes in
   microarray were significantly regulated at least in one time comparison.
   The majority of differentially regulated transcripts were associated
   with disease response and the gene expression mechanism. When the
   cultivars were compared, a number of transcripts and expression
   alterations varied within the cultivars. Especially membrane related
   transcripts were detected as differentially expressed. Moreover, diverse
   transcription factors showed significant fold change values among the
   cultivars. This study presented new insights to understand the early
   response of selected cultivars to the Fg at 12 hai. Through the KEGG
   analysis, we observed that the most altered transcripts were associated
   with starch and sucrose metabolism and gluconeogenesis pathways.}},

Title = {{Faecal corticosterone metabolite concentrations are not a good predictor
   of habitat suitability for common gartersnakes}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Measuring habitat suitability is important in conservation and in
   wildlife management. Measuring the abundance or presence-absence of a
   species in various habitats is not sufficient to measure habitat
   suitability because these metrics can be poor predictors of population
   success. Therefore, having some measure of population success is
   essential in assessing habitat suitability, but estimating population
   success is difficult. Identifying suitable proxies for population
   success could thus be beneficial. We examined whether faecal
   corticosterone metabolite (fCM) concentrations could be used as a proxy
   for habitat suitability in common gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis). We
   conducted a validation study and confirmed that fCM concentrations
   indeed reflect circulating corticosterone concentrations. We estimated
   abundance, reproductive output and growth rate of gartersnakes in field
   and in forest habitat and we also measured fCM concentrations of
   gartersnakes from these same habitats. Common gartersnakes were more
   abundant and had higher reproductive outputs and higher growth rates in
   field habitat than in forest habitat, but fCM concentrations did not
   differ between the same two habitats. Our results suggest either that
   fCM concentrations are not a useful metric of habitat suitability in
   common gartersnakes or that the difference in suitability between the
   two habitats was too small to induce changes in fCM concentrations.
   Incorporating fitness metrics in estimates of habitat suitability is
   important, but these metrics of fitness have to be sensitive enough to
   vary between habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Ewing Sarcoma (ES) is the second most common primary malignant bone
   tumor in children and adolescents. microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in
   cancer as tumor suppressors or oncogenes.
   We studied the involvement of miRNAs located on chromosomes 11q and 22q
   that participate in the most common translocation in ES. Of these, we
   focused on 3 that belong to the let-7 family. We studied the expression
   levels of let-7a, and let-7b and detected a significant correlation
   between low expression of let-7b and increased risk of relapse. let-7 is
   known to be a negative regulator of the RAS oncogene. Indeed, we
   detected an inverse association between the expression of let-7 and RAS
   protein levels and its downstream target p-ERK, following transfection
   of let-7 mimics and inhibitors. Furthermore, we identified let-7 as a
   negative regulator of HIF-1 alpha and EWS-FLI-1. Moreover, we were able
   to show that HIF-1 alpha directly binds to the EWS-FLI-1 promoter.
   Salirasib treatment in-vitro resulted in the reduction of cell
   viability, migration ability, and in the decrease of cells in S-phase. A
   significant reduction in tumor burden and in the expression levels of
   both HIF-1 alpha and EWS-FLI-1 proteins were observed in mice after
   treatment.
   Our results support the hypothesis that let-7 is a tumor suppressor that
   negatively regulates RAS, also in ES, and that HIF-1 alpha may
   contribute to the aggressive metastatic behavior of ES. Moreover, the
   reduction in the tumor burden in a mouse model of ES following Salirasib
   treatment, suggests therapeutic potential for this RAS inhibitor in ES.}},

Abstract = {{A continuous supersonic flow reactor has been used to measure rate
   constants for the C(P-3) + NH3 reaction over the temperature range
   50-296 K. C(P-3) atoms were created by the pulsed laser photolysis of
   CBr4. The kinetics of the title reaction were followed directly by
   vacuum ultra-violet laser induced fluorescence of C(P-3) loss and
   through H(S-2) formation. The experiments show unambiguously that the
   reaction is rapid at 296 K, becoming faster at lower temperatures,
   reaching a value of (1.8 +/- 0.2) x 10(-10) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at
   50 K. As this reaction is not currently included in astrochemical
   networks, its influence on interstellar nitrogen hydride abundances is
   tested through a dense cloud model including gas-grain interactions. In
   particular, the effect of the ortho-to-para ratio of H-2, which plays a
   crucial role in interstellar NH3 synthesis, is examined.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs),
   controlled substances due to their role in stratospheric ozone loss,
   also occur as dissolved contaminants in groundwaters. Stable carbon
   isotopic signatures may provide valuable new information on the fate of
   these compounds as has been seen for other priority hydrocarbon
   contaminants, but to date no method for extraction and isotopic analysis
   of dissolved CFCs from groundwaters has been developed. Here we describe
   a cryogenic purge and trap system coupled to continuous flow
   compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis mass spectrometry for
   concentrations as low as 35 mu g/L. The method is validated by comparing
   isotopic signatures from water extracted CFCs against a new suite of
   isotopic CFC standards. Fractionation of CFCs in volatilization
   experiments from pure-phase CFC-11 and CFC-113 resulted in enrichment
   factors (epsilon) of +1.7 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and +1.1 +/- 0.1
   parts per thousand, respectively, indicating that such volatile loss, if
   significant, would produce a more C-13 depleted signature in the
   remaining CFCs. Importantly, no significant fractionation was observed
   during volatile extraction of dissolved CFCs from aqueous solutions.
   delta C-13 values for groundwaters from a CFC-contaminated site were, on
   average, more enriched than delta C-13 values for pure compounds. Such
   enriched delta C-13 values have been seen in other hydrocarbon
   contaminants such as chlorinated ethenes and ethanes due to in situ
   degradation, but definitive interpretation of such enriched signatures
   in field samples requires additional experiments to characterize
   fractionation of CFCs during biodegradation. The establishment of a
   robust and sensitive method of extraction and analysis, as described
   here, provides the foundation for such future directions.}},

   Twenty-two tutors received training in content knowledge and the other
   twenty-five tutors in tutoring skills. Tutors formulated written
   feedback immediately after the training. Tutees first interpreted the
   tutor feedback and then used it to revise their research questions. The
   results showed that tutors trained in tutoring skills formulated more
   effective feedback than tutors trained in content knowledge. In
   addition, tutees helped by tutoring-skills tutors found the feedback
   more motivating than those helped by content-knowledge tutors. However,

Abstract = {{PEGylated chitosans with different degrees of grafting were synthesized,
   and the application potential of microspheres based on PEGylated
   chitosan as mucoadhesive drug-delivery carriers for puerarin was

   swelling capacity, and the amount of water uptake increased as the
   content of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether in the microspheres
   increased. PCMs showed obviously improved mucoadhesive behavior on a
   mucosa-like surface. Puerarin was incorporated into the microspheres,
   and the release experiments in vitro showed that the PEGylation of
   chitosan accelerated puerarin release from the particles and decreased
   the retention of the drug. The abilities of all of the tested
   microspheres to open tight junctions and improve the permeability of
   puerarin were demonstrated with a Caco-2 cell monolayer as an in vitro
   model. The amount of puerarin permeating across the Caco-2 cell
   monolayer was significantly increased by the incorporation of puerarin

Abstract = {{Background: Genetic factors are the main cause of early miscarriage.
   This study aimed to investigate aneuploidy in spontaneous abortion by
   fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes for 13, 16, 18,
   21, 22, X and Y chromosomes. Methods: A total of 840 chorionic samples
   from spontaneous abortion were collected and examined by FISH. We
   analyzed the incidence and type of abnormal cases and sex ratio in the
   samples. We also analyzed the relationship between the rate of
   aneuploidy and parental age, the rate of aneuploidy between recurrent
   abortion and sporadic abortion, the difference in incidence of
   aneuploidy between samples from previous artificial abortion and those
   from no previous induced abortion. Results: A total of 832 samples were
   finally analyzed. 368 (44.23\%) were abnormal, in which 84.24\%
   (310/368) were aneuploidies and 15.76\% (58/368) were polyploidies. The
   first was trisomy16 (121/310), followed by trisomy 22, and X monosomy.
   There was no significant difference in the rate of aneuploidy in the
   advanced maternal age group (>= 35 years old) and young maternal age
   group (< 35 years old). However, the rate of trisomy 22 and the total
   rate of trisomies 21, 13, and 18 (the number of trisomy 21 plus trisomy
   13 and trisomy 18 together) showed significantly different in two
   groups. We found no skewed sex ratio. There was no significant
   difference in the rate of aneuploidy between recurrent miscarriage and
   sporadic abortion or between the samples from previous artificial
   abortion and those from no previous artificial abortion. Conclusions:
   Aneuploidy is a principal factor of miscarriage and total parental age
   is a risk factor. There is no skewed sex ratio in spontaneous abortion.
   There is also no difference in the rate of aneuploidy between recurrent
   abortion and sporadic abortion or between previous artificial abortion
   and no previous induced abortion.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined whether a demonstrative (visual aid) could increase
   the ability of opposing expert testimony to sensitize jurors to
   variations in the validity of scientific evidence. Undergraduates (N =

   eyewitness identification as the key evidence. Both the validity of the
   defense expert's study on eyewitness identification and the type of
   opposing expert testimony varied. Although participants were sensitive
   to the scientific quality of the defense expert's testimony when an
   opposing expert addressed the defense expert's study, regardless of the
   presence of a demonstrative, jurors' verdicts were sensitive only when
   the opposing expert used a demonstrative to communicate about validity
   issues. Thus, an opposing expert who addresses a defense expert's study
   with or without a demonstrative may be sufficient to improve jurors'
   understanding of scientific evidence, but the addition of a
   demonstrative is necessary to translate this knowledge into verdict
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The volatility of the compounds comprising organic aerosol (OA)
   determines their distribution between the gas and particle phases.
   However, there is a disconnect between volatility distributions as
   typically derived from secondary OA (SOA) growth experiments and the
   effective particle volatility as probed in evaporation experiments.
   Specifically, the evaporation experiments indicate an overall much less
   volatile SOA. This raises questions regarding the use of traditional
   volatility distributions in the simulation and prediction of atmospheric
   SOA concentrations. Here, we present results from measurements of
   thermally induced evaporation of SOA for nine different SOA types (i.e.,
   distinct volatile organic compound and oxidant pairs) encompassing both
   anthropogenic and biogenic compounds and 03 and OH to examine the extent
   to which the low effective volatility of SOA is a general phenomenon or
   specific to a subset of SOA types. The observed extents of evaporation
   with temperature were similar for all the SOA types and indicative of a
   low effective volatility. Furthermore, minimal variations in the
   composition of all the SOA types upon heating-induced evaporation were
   observed. These results suggest that oligomer decomposition likely plays
   a major role in controlling SOA evaporation, and since the SOA formation
   time scale in these measurements was less than a minute, the
   oligomer-forming reactions must be similarly rapid. Overall, these
   results emphasize the importance of accounting for the role of condensed
   phase reactions in altering the composition of SOA when assessing
   particle volatility.}},

   nodosa sulphated polysaccharide (CNSP) on lipase activity in vitro and

   leads to lipid regulation shown by the decrease of total cholesterol
   (T-Ch), triglycerides (TG) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol
   (LDL-C) and an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
   levels in HFD-rats. Additionally, CNSP administration to HFD-rats
   induces anti-oxidant activity observed by the increase of superoxide
   dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)

Abstract = {{In this paper, the high-energy magnetic excitations in cuprate
   superconductors are studied based on the kinetic energy driven
   superconducting mechanism. The spin self-energy is evaluated explicitly
   in terms of the collective charge carrier modes in the particle-hole and
   particle-particle channels, and employed to calculate the dynamical spin
   structure factor. Our results show the existence of damped but
   well-defined dispersive spin excitations in the whole doping phase
   diagram. In particular, the charge carrier doping has a more modest
   effect on the high-energy spin excitations, and then the high-energy
   magnetic excitations retain roughly constant energy as a function of
   doping, with spectral weights and dispersion relations comparable to
   those found in the parent compound.}},

   networks. There is only one transmittal delay in the delayed coupling.
   The fact is that in the signal transmission process, the time delay
   affects only the variable that is being transmitted from one system to
   another, so assume that there is only one single time-varying delay
   coupling is more consistent with the reality. At the same time, the
   internal delay and coupling delay are time-varying and different. Based
   on the Lyapunov stability theory, a feedback controller is designed for
   achieving synchronization between two coupled networks with time-varying
   delays in finite time. Finally, simulation examples are given to
   illustrate the theoretical analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The application of detailed in-situ neutron diffraction studies on
   lithium ion batteries has been limited in part due to the requirement of
   expensive deuterated carbonate-based electrolyte. This work presents an
   in-situ neutron diffraction study of the structural evolution of the
   Li-x (Ni0.4Mn0.4Co0.2)O-2 (NMC442) positive electrode material using a
   recently-developed low-cost deuterated ethyl acetate-based electrolyte.
   Rietveld analysis show that the NMC442 c lattice parameter gradually
   increases until x = 0.47 (4.03 V) and then decreases during the first
   charge. The decreasing trend of the c lattice parameter with time during
   the hold at 4.7 V and 4.9 V agrees very well with the change of current.
   Overall the structural changes appear highly reversible When 4.7 V is
   used as an upper cutoff voltage, even following a 10 h hold at 4.7 V.
   However, the electrode/electrolyte changes dramatically when charged and
   held at 4.9 V. There is a significant drop in background attributed to
   electrolyte decomposition and an unexpected increase in the a lattice
   parameter is noted after the 4.9 V hold. Therefore, the electrolyte
   system used is both beneficial for in-situ neutron diffraction studies
   and battery performance until 4.7 V, but appears to degrade in
   combination with the electrode at 4.9 V. By comparison to
   Li(Ni0.8Mn0.1Co0.1)O-2 (NMC811), the contraction of the c lattice with
   increasing voltage and decreasing lithium content of the NMC442 is less
   rapid. The transition metal composition significantly affects the c
   lattice contraction above 4.0 V. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{African American patients of colorectal cancer (CRC) were found to have
   a worse prognosis than Caucasians, but it has not been fully understood
   about the survival difference among Chinese and these two races above.
   In this study, we used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results
   database to analyze the survival difference among these three
   race/ethnicities in the United States. Adenocarcinoma patients of
   colorectal cancer with a race/ethnicity of Caucasian, Chinese and
   African American were enrolled for study. Patients were excluded if they
   had more than one primary cancer but the CRC was not the first one, had
   unknown cause of death or unknown survival months. The 5-year cause
   specific survival (CSS) was our primary endpoint. Totally, there were
   585,670 eligible patients for analysis. Chinese patients had the best
   and African American patients had the worst 5-year CSS (66.7\% vs
   55.9\%), P < 0.001. The 5-year CSS for Caucasian patients was 62.9\%.
   Race/ethnicity was an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate
   analysis, P < 0.001. The comparison of clinicopathologic factors among
   these three race/ethnicities showed that the insurance coverage rate,
   income, percentage that completing high school and percentage of urban
   residence was lowest in the African American patients. Chinese patients
   had the highest percentage of married, while African American patients
   ranked lowest. More African American patients were diagnosed as stage IV
   and had high percentage of signet ring cell and mucinous adenocarcinoma.
   It is likely that biological differences as well as socioeconomic status
   both contribute to the survival disparity among the different
   race/ethnicities.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic properties of flare ribbons and the often associated
   filament eruptions can provide crucial information on the flaring
   coronal magnetic field. This Letter analyzes the GOES-class X1.0 flare
   on 2014 March 29 (SOL2014-03-29T17: 48), in which we found an asymmetric
   eruption of a sigmoidal filament and an ensuing circular flare ribbon.
   Initially both EUV images and a preflare nonlinear force-free field
   model show that the filament is embedded in magnetic fields with a
   fan-spine-like structure. In the first phase, which is defined by a weak
   but still increasing X-ray emission, the western portion of the
   sigmoidal filament arches upward and then remains quasi-static for about
   five minutes. The western fan-like and the outer spine-like fields
   display an ascending motion, and several associated ribbons begin to
   brighten. Also found is a bright EUV flow that streams down along the
   eastern fan-like field. In the second phase that includes the main peak
   of hard X-ray (HXR) emission, the filament erupts, leaving behind two
   major HXR sources formed around its central dip portion and a circular
   ribbon brightened sequentially. The expanding western fan-like field
   interacts intensively with the outer spine-like field, as clearly seen
   in running difference EUV images. We discuss these observations in favor
   of a scenario where the asymmetric eruption of the sigmoidal filament is
   initiated due to an MHD instability and further facilitated by
   reconnection at a quasi-null in corona; the latter is in turn enhanced
   by the filament eruption and subsequently produces the circular flare
   ribbon.}},

Abstract = {{Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been found to be persistent in the
   environment and possibly harmful. Many buildings are characterized with
   high PCB concentrations. Knowledge about partitioning between primary
   sources and building materials is critical for exposure assessment and
   practical remediation of PCB contamination. This study develops a
   C-depth method to determine diffusion coefficient (D) and partition
   coefficient (K), two key parameters governing the partitioning process.
   For concrete, a primary material studied here, relative standard
   deviations of results among five data sets are 5\%-22\% for K and
   42-66\% for D. Compared with existing methods, C-depth method overcomes
   the inability to obtain unique estimation for nonlinear regression and
   does not require assumed correlations for D and K among congeners.
   Comparison with a more sophisticated two-term approach implies
   significant uncertainty for D, and smaller uncertainty for K. However,
   considering uncertainties associated with sampling and chemical
   analysis, and impact of environmental factors, the results are
   acceptable for engineering applications. This was supported by good
   agreement between model prediction and measurement. Sensitivity analysis
   indicated that effective diffusion distance, contacting time of
   materials with primary sources, and depth of measured concentrations are
   critical for determining D, and PCB concentration in primary sources is
   critical for K.}},

Title = {{Physical total energy based objective function model for sparse
   reconstruction}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Image reconstruction from sparse data is one of the key technologies in
   physical imaging, and it can often be mathematically described as an
   underdetermined linear inverse problem. Mathematical models for sparse
   reconstruction often choose the sparseness constraints or data fidelity
   term directly as objective functions. However, physics concepts and laws
   for these modeling or solving processes have never been explored. In
   this paper, sparse reconstruction is investigated for the first time
   from the perspective of physical motion. Firstly, a physical model is
   created to describe a particle motion in viscous medium, in which the
   particle gravity potential energy function is the norm of l(2)-l(1)
   after the relaxation transformation. In discrete calculations, the
   particle displacement is determined by the corresponding iterative
   result, and its velocity can be described as the change between two
   adjacent iterations. Then, a new mathematical model based on the
   physical motion model is studied for sparse reconstruction, in which the
   total energy of particle is chosen as a new objective function and
   nonnegative displacements as constraints. This new model preserves
   sparse constrains and fidelity term of original l(2)-l(1) model, and
   adds the constrains of deviations between two adjacent iterations so as
   to avoid oscillations caused by large deviations. Furthermore, a
   targeted gradient projection technique is adopted to solve such a
   reconstruction model, and its convergence is discussed as well.
   Especially in this algorithm, the gradient of this new objective
   function contains the iterative step of previous iteration, and such
   iterative steps play the role of physical inertia property in iterative
   process, which can effectively enlarge the iterative steps to accelerate
   the convergence and avoid local optima. Finally, two sets of
   experimental results are presented, including natural grayscale image
   reconstruction and micro focus X-ray defect detection in precision
   electronic package. The results demonstrate that the proposed method
   outperforms its competitors distinctly in time efficiency on the basis
   of guaranteeing the reconstruction quality. Additionally, on detecting
   internal defects in solder joint of integrated circuit, the proposed
   method is well performed in retaining edge details of the reconstructed
   micro focus X-ray images. Therefore, the proposed method can identify
   the solder joint internal defects more accurately and is more suitable
   to rapid and precise micro focus X-ray defect detection in industry.}},

Title = {{Improved and sustained triage skills in firemen after a short training
   intervention}},
Journal = {{SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION \& EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: A previous study has shown no measurable improvement in
   triage accuracy among physicians attending the Advanced Trauma Life
   Support (ATLS) course and suggests a curriculum revision regarding
   triage. Other studies have indicated that cooperative learning helps
   students acquire knowledge.
   Objective: The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness
   of trauma cards in triage training for firemen.
   Methods: Eighty-six firemen were randomly assigned into two groups: the
   trauma card group and the direct instruction group. Both groups received
   the same 30-min PowerPoint lecture on how to perform triage according to
   the Sort Assess Lifesaving interventions Treatment and transport (SALT)
   Mass Casualty Triage Algorithm. In the trauma card group, the
   participants were divided into groups of 3-5 and instructed to triage 10
   trauma victims according to the descriptions on the trauma cards. In the
   direct instruction group, written forms about the same 10 victims were
   used and discussed as a continuation of the PowerPoint lecture. Total
   training time was 60 min for both groups. A test was distributed before
   and after the educational intervention to measure the individual triage
   skills. The same test was applied again 6 months later.
   Results: There was a significant improvement in triage skills directly
   after the intervention and this was sustained 6 months later. No
   significant difference in triage skills was seen between the trauma card
   group and the direct instruction group. Previous experience of
   multi-casualty incidents, years in service, level of education or age
   did not have any measurable effects on triage accuracy.
   Conclusions: One hour of triage training with the SALT Mass Casualty
   Triage Algorithm was enough to significantly improve triage accuracy in
   both groups of firemen with sustained skills 6 months later. Further
   studies on the first assessment on scene versus patient outcome are
   necessary to provide evidence that this training can improve casualty
   outcome. The efficacy and validity of trauma cards for disaster
   management training need to be tested in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{North America lags behind in the use of outcome-based indicators such as
   material deprivation to study child poverty. Instead, income indicators
   dominate research and policy making. A large body of international
   research concludes that income poverty and material deprivation are
   complementary indicators because each measures specific but related
   aspects of material well-being. For children this distinction is even
   more pertinent because children have specific needs and their material
   circumstances affect both their current and future well-being. This
   research uses data from Ontario to investigate whether material
   deprivation also contributes to a better understanding of child poverty
   in North America. It shows that the choice of poverty indicator affects
   estimates of the level of child poverty, its correlates, and the success
   of policy interventions in reaching poor children.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption of cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes (cVMS) to organic
   matter has a strong influence on their fate in the aquatic environment.
   We report new measurements of the partition ratios between freshwater
   sediment organic carbon and water (K-OC) and between Aldrich humic acid
   dissolved organic carbon and water (K-DOC) for three cVMS, and for three
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that were used as reference chemicals.
   Our measurements were made using a purge-and-trap method that employs
   benchmark chemicals to calibrate mass transfer at the air/water
   interface in a fugacity-based multimedia model. The measured log K-OC of
   octamethylcydotetrasiloxane (D-4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D-5),
   and dodecamethylcydohexasiloxane (D-6) were 5.06, 6.12, and 7.07, and
   log K-DOC were 5.05, 6.13, and 6.79. To our knowledge, our measurements
   for K-OC of D-6 and K-DOC of D-4 and D-6 are the first reported.
   Polyparameter linear free energy relationships (PP-LFERs) derived from
   training sets of empirical data that did not include cVMS generally did
   not predict our measured partition ratios of cVMS accurately
   (root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for logK(OC) 0.76 and for logK(DOC)
   0.73). We constructed new PP-LFERs that accurately describe partition
   ratios for the cVMS as well as for other chemicals by including our new
   measurements in the existing training sets (logK(OC) RMSEcVMS: 0.09,
   logk(DOC) RMSEcVMS: 0.12). The PP-LFERs we have developed here should be
   further evaluated and perhaps recalibrated when experimental data for
   other siloxanes become available.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},

Abstract = {{Rubber is an essential polymer widely used in the auto-industry. We
   report a method for the synthesis of zinc phtalocyanine (ZP),
   chloroalumino phthalocyanine (CP), and their hybrid fillers obtained by
   the synthesis of the two phtalocyanines in the presence of halloysite
   nanotubes (HNTs). The hybrid fillers were characterized by means of
   microscopic, thermal, and particle size measurement analysis. The effect
   of these fillers on the properties of diene rubbers were assessed in
   comparison with a physical mixture of halloysite and ZP or CP pigment.
   The dispersion degree of hybrid fillers inside an elastomeric matrix
   (rubber) was assessed with the atomic force microscopy. The influence of
   the hybrid fillers on the thermal and mechanical properties and
   flammability of butadiene-acrylonitrile (NBR) and butadiene-styrene
   (SBR) rubbers was assessed by analyzing the measurement results obtained
   by means of thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning
   calorimetry, Zwick Tensile testing, FAA micro-calorimeter, and oxygen
   index determination. We found that regardless of the spatial network
   structure of NBR and SBR rubbers, the incorporation of hybrid fillers
   into the matrix of the elastomers showed an improvement in their thermal
   and mechanical properties as well as a significant reduction in
   flammability. The improvement is attributed to the smaller size and much
   better dispersion of HZ and HC in relation to the particles of
   phthalocyanine. The colored composites of NBR rubber, containing hybrid
   filler (HZ or HC), showed an increase in the heat capacity compared to
   the uncolored samples, which can increase safety by facilitating the
   processes of self-extinguishing. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Abstract = {{This article examines neutral Switzerland's recognition policy towards
   the divided states of Korea and Vietnam. Drawing comparisons with other
   neutrals, notably Austria and Sweden, allows us to assess the
   credibility of neutrality in the Global Cold War. All three neutrals
   explicitly or implicitly aimed to reinforce their neutrality through the
   principle of universality, which entailed the recognition of all
   regimes, no matter their political couleur. Yet this principle was not
   applied consistently, but rather pragmatically. Until the beginning of
   the 1970s, Switzerland, as well as Austria and Sweden, favoured the
   Western-oriented over the Communist halves of Korea and Vietnam.
   Thereby, this article argues, they undermined the credibility of
   neutrality. They were, however, willing to take that risk, because they
   feared that the recognition of North Korea and North Vietnam could
   irritate the United States, and provoke East German claims for
   recognition, which was undesirable due to the Hallstein doctrine and
   West Germany's economic weight. It was only with the rise of the Third
   World as a political force, and the softening of the US position that
   the neutrals, which saw themselves in competition with each other for
   status and influence, eventually recognised North Korea and North
   Vietnam.}},

Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Despite knowledge that EGDT improves outcomes in septic patients, staff
   education on EGDT and compliance with the CPOE order set has been
   variable. Based on results of a resident survey to identify barriers to
   decrease severe sepsis/septic shock mortality in the medical intensive
   care unit (MICU), multifaceted interventions such as educational
   interventions to improve awareness to the importance of early
   goal-directed therapy (EGDT), and the use of the Computerized Physician
   Order Entry (CPOE) order set, were implemented in July 2013. CPOE order
   set was established to improve compliance with the EGDT resuscitation
   bundle elements. Orders were reviewed and compared for patients admitted
   to the MICU with severe sepsis/septic shock in July and August 2013
   (controls) and 2014 (following the intervention). Similarly, educational
   slide sets were used as interventions for residents before the start of
   their ICU rotations in July and August 2013. While CPOE order set
   compliance did not significantly improve (78\% vs. 76\%, p = 0.74),
   overall EGDT adherence improved from 43\% to 68\% (p = 0.0295). Although
   there was a trend toward improved mortality, this did not reach
   statistical significance. This study shows that education interventions
   can be used to increase awareness of severe sepsis/septic shock and
   improve overall EGDT adherence.}},

Abstract = {{Interstellar dust (ISD) in the solar system was detected in. situ for
   the first time in 1993 by the Ulysses dust detector. The study of ISD is
   important for understanding its role in star and solar system formation.
   The goal of this paper is to understand the variability in the ISD
   observations from the Ulysses mission by using a Monte Carlo simulation
   of ISD trajectories, with the final aim to constrain the ISD particle
   properties from simulations and the data. The paper is part of a series
   of three: Strub et al. describe. the. variations. of. the ISD flow from
   the Ulysses data set, and Kruger et al. focus. on. its. ISD. mass
   distribution. We describe and interpret the simulations of the ISD flow
   at Ulysses orbit for a wide range of particle properties and discuss
   four open issues in ISD research: the existence of very big ISD
   particles, the lack of smaller ISD particles, the shift in dust flow
   direction in 2005, and particle properties. We conclude that the shift
   in the dust flow direction in 2005 can best be explained by Lorentz
   force in the inner heliosphere, but that an extra filtering mechanism is
   needed to fit the fluxes. A time-dependent filtering in the outer
   regions of the heliosphere is proposed for this. Also, the high
   charge-to-mass ratio values found for the heavier particles after 2003
   indicate that these particles are lower in density than previously
   assumed. This method gives new insights into the ISD properties and
   paves the way toward getting a complete view on the ISD from the local
   interstellar cloud. We conclude that in combination with the data and
   simulations, also impact ionization experiments are necessary using
   low-density dust, in order to constrain the density of the particles.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the phenomenon of clients who present their
   concerns in the medicalised discourse of the Diagnostic and Statistical
   Manual of Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition (DSM-5). We contextualise
   this phenomenon, highlighting how a diagnose-and-treat' logic
   increasingly pervades everyday understandings and informs people's
   efforts to make sense of their concerns. We relate these cultural ways
   of sense-making to discursive counselling practice, noting possibilities
   for circumventing discursive capture' through reflective and generative
   dialogues. We then turn to two common ways in which clients present
   their concerns in counselling: (1) arriving self-diagnosed or diagnosed
   by another professional and (2) as a family in which parents present a
   child as having a mental disorder. We suggest ways of moving beyond
   medicalised discourse via resourceful and critically reflective
   conversations with clients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Glioblastomas (GBM) are often characterized by an elevated
   expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor variant III
   (EGFRvIII). We used GBM cell lines with native EGFRvIII expression to
   determine whether this EGFR variant affects radiosensitivity with or
   without EGFR targeting.
   Methods: Experiments were performed with GBM cell lines lacking (LN229,
   U87MG, U251, CAS-1) or endogenously expressing EGFRvIII (BS153, DKMG).
   The two latter cell lines were also used to establish sublines with a
   low (-) or a high proportion (+) of cells expressing EGFRvIII. EGFR
   signaling and the cell cycle were analyzed using Western blot and flow
   cytometry; cell survival was assessed by colony forming assay and
   double-strand break repair capacity by immunofluorescence.
   Results: DKMG and BS153 parental cells with heterogeneous EGFRvIII
   expression were clearly more radiosensitive compared to other GBM cell
   lines without EGFRvIII expression. However, no significant difference
   was observed in cell proliferation, clonogenicity or radiosensitivity
   between the EGFRvIII- and + sublines derived from DKMG and BS153
   parental cells. Expression of EGFRvIII was associated with decreased DSB
   repair capacity for BS153 but not for DKMG cells. The effects of EGFR
   targeting by gefitinib alone or in combination with irradiation were
   also found not to depend on EGFRvIII expression. Gefitinib was only
   observed to influence the proliferation of EGFRvIII-BS153 cells.
   Conclusion: The data indicate that EGFRvIII does not alter
   radiosensitivity with or without anti-EGFR treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum teleportation is an essential quantum operation by which we can
   transfer an unknown quantum state to a remote location with the help of
   quantum entanglement and classical communication. Since the first
   experimental demonstrations using photonic qubits and continuous
   variables, the distance of photonic quantum teleportation over
   free-space channels has continued to increase and has reached > 100 km.
   On the other hand, quantum teleportation over optical fiber has been
   challenging, mainly because the multifold photon detection that
   inevitably accompanies quantum teleportation experiments has been very
   inefficient due to the relatively low detection efficiencies of typical
   telecom-band single-photon detectors. Here, we report on quantum
   teleportation over optical fiber using four high-detection-efficiency
   superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). These SNSPDs
   make it possible to perform highly efficient multifold photon
   measurements, allowing us to confirm that the quantum states of input
   photons were successfully teleported over 100 km of fiber with an
   average fidelity of 83.7 +/- 2.0\%. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{180}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the
   kinetics of the tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) ion transfer across the
   water/1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) interface supported at the tip of a
   thick-wall microcapillary at various temperatures. EIS measurements were
   carried out at the equilibrium Galvani potential difference, which was
   controlled by the partition of TEA(+) present in both the aqueous and
   DCE phase. The apparent standard rate constant k(0) of the TEA+ ion
   transfer and the diffusion coefficient Dw of TEA(+) in the aqueous phase
   were determined at five temperature values in the range 15-35 degrees C.
   The values k(0) = 0.47 +/- 0.12 at 20 degrees C and k(0) = 0.52 +/- 0.17
   cm s(-1) at 25 degrees C agree well with those obtained by EIS and noise
   analysis under the same or similar experimental conditions in our
   previous studies. Comparable effects of temperature on k(0) and D-w, as
   indicated by nearly equal slopes of the plots of log k(0) and log D-w
   vs. the reciprocal absolute temperature, point to the absence of an
   energy barrier for the ion to overcome in the interfacial region. On the
   other hand, the experimental values of k(0) are significantly smaller
   than the upper limit of k(0) for the diffusion-type process (ca. 100 cm
   s(-1)). The deceleration of the ion motion in the interfacial region
   could be ascribed to the slow relaxation of the interface, the favorable
   deformation of which is likely to control the interfacial ion transfer.
   The effect of temperature on the capacitance of the electric double
   layer at the water/DCE interface was found to be negligible, in an
   agreement with the prediction based on the simple Verwey-Niessen model
   of the back-to-back space charge (diffuse) layers. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Research supports the existence of a dissociative subtype of

   current study investigated perceived causal relationships between
   posttraumatic symptoms associated with NWC-distress and TRASC on the one
   hand and interpersonal and occupational functioning on the other.
   Although both TRASC and NWC-distress independently accounted for
   variance in self-reported interpersonal and occupational problems,
   perceived causal relationship results showed that individuals tended to
   attribute their social and work-related problems more strongly to
   NWC-distress than to TRASC. Future research directions are discussed.}},

   excitation patterns with antiferromagnetic interaction and the third one
   is band gap excitation spectrum with ferromagnetic nature. The specific
   heat capacity of sub-lattice spin system presents complex

Abstract = {{A quantum proxy group signature (QPGS) scheme based on controlled
   teleportation is presented, by using the entangled five-qubit quantum
   state functions as quantum channel. The scheme uses the physical
   characteristics of quantum mechanics to implement delegation, signature
   and verification. The security of the scheme is guaranteed by the
   entanglement correlations of the entangled five-qubit state, the secret
   keys based on the quantum key distribution (QKD) and the one-time pad
   algorithm, all of which have been proven to be unconditionally secure
   and the signature anonymity.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to detect hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) near mitochondrial
   DNA (mtDNA) because mtDNA is more prone to oxidative attack than nuclear
   DNA (nDNA). In this study, a mitochondria-targeted fluorescence probe,
   pep3-NP1, has been designed and synthesized. The probe contains a
   DNA-binding peptide, a H2O2 fluorescence reporter, and a positively
   charged red emissive styryl dye to facilitate accumulation in
   mitochondria. Due to groove binding of the peptide with DNA, the styryl
   dye of pep3-NP1 intercalated into the bases of DNA, leading to an
   increase in red fluorescence intensity (centered at 646 nm) and quantum
   yield. In this case, pep3-NP1 was a turn-on probe for labeling DNA.
   Subcellular locations of pep3-NP1 and MitoTracker suggested that pep3NP1
   mostly accumulated in the mitochondria of live cells. Namely, as an
   intracellular DNA marker, pep3-NP1 bound to mtDNA. In the presence of
   H2O2, pep3-NP1 emitted green fluorescence (centered at 555 nm). Thus,
   the ratio of green with red fluorescence of pep3-NP1 was suitable to
   reflect the change of the H2O2 level near mtDNA in living cells. The
   detecting limit for H2O2 was estimated at 2.9 and 5.0 mu M in vitro and
   in cultured cells, respectively. The development of pep3-NP1 could help
   in studies to protect mtDNA from oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{The eugenic legislation was a defining aspect in the development of the
   Nordic welfare state. While sterilization is a widely recognized method
   of restricting reproduction, another part of the legislation was the
   castration of male sex offenders for criminal-therapeutic purposes. This
   article discusses the conflicts arising from the castration of male
   criminals. Especially targeted were male criminals whose crimes could be
   traced back to a conflicted sexuality, including homosexuality and such
   vaguely termed conditions as hypersexuality and an abnormal sex drive.
   This article highlights the exclusive connection of sexual violence to
   male violence in the context of Nordic castration legislation. It is
   further argued that the decriminalization of homosexuality did not lead
   to sexual liberation but rather to much more harshly restricted
   sexuality through medicalization. The medicalization of homosexuality
   and the castration of men labelled as sexual offenders show how the
   conformity of the Nordic welfare state has tended to restrict sexuality
   with the help of the concept of heteronormativity.}},

Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},

Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{The effective modulus of transversely isotropic compound material
   containing aligned ellipsoidal inhomogeneity is derived using the method
   of sphere-equivalency of effective scattering. Based on this approach,
   we derive the integral solution of the Eshelby tensor for the
   anisotropic medium, allowing for numerically evaluating the effects of
   anisotropy for the solution. The numerical results show that the
   effective modulus of the medium decreases monotonically with increasing
   the concentration of the inhomogeneties. The anisotropy increases if the
   inhomogeneity alignment direction is perpendicular to the TI symmetry
   axis of the background medium. By reducing the numbers of matrix elastic
   modulus from 5 to 2, we calculate the slowness surfaces for the three
   modes of propagation in an isotropic medium containing aligned
   ellipsoidal inhomogeneity. The results are the same as the existing
   ones, which validates the exactness of our theory. The modeling results
   can be used to evaluate elastic property of an anisotropic medium with
   aligned inclusions, such as earth formation shale rocks containing
   aligned cracks.}},

Abstract = {{Spinel LiMn2O4 has been prepared by a facile hydrothermal procedure and

   LiMn2O4 as the positive electrode and nitrogen-doped graphene/porous
   carbon composite as the negative electrode in a Li2SO4 aqueous
   electrolyte. The optimized ASC delivers a high specific energy of up to
   44.3 Wh kg(-1) at a specific power of 595 W kg(-1) with an output
   voltage of 1.8 V based on the total weight of the active electrode
   materials. This novel strategy provides a promising route to design

Abstract = {{PARP1 is the main sensor of single-and double-strand breaks in DNA and,
   in building chains of poly(ADP-ribose), promotes the recruitment of many
   downstream signaling and effector proteins involved in the DNA damage
   response (DDR). We show a robust physical interaction between PARP1 and
   the replication fork protein TIMELESS, distinct from the known
   TIMELESS-TIPIN complex, which activates the intra-S phase checkpoint.
   TIMELESS recruitment to laser-induced sites of DNA damage is dependent
   on its binding to PARP1, but not PARP1 activity. We also find that the
   PARP1-TIMELESS complex contains a number of established PARP1
   substrates, and TIMELESS mutants unable to bind PARP1 are impaired in
   their ability to bind PARP1 substrates. Further, PARP1 binding to
   certain substrates and their recruitment to DNA damage lesions is
   impaired by TIMELESS knockdown, and TIMELESS silencing significantly
   impairs DNA double-strand break repair. We hypothesize that TIMELESS
   cooperates in the PARP1-mediated DDR.}},

Abstract = {{Thermostable fusion peptide partners are valuable in engineering
   thermostability in proteins. We evaluated the Arabidopsis counterpart
   (AtRAce) and an acidified derivative (mRAce) of the conserved carboxyl
   extension (RAce) of plant Rubisco activase (RCA) for their
   thermostabilizing properties in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae using a protein fusion strategy. We used AtRAce and mRAce as
   fusion tails for the thermolabile protein RCA2 from Arabidopsis thaliana
   and Nicotiana tabacum. The homologous fusion of AtRAce with Arabidopsis
   RCA2 and the heterologous fusion of AtRAce with tobacco RCA2 increased
   the thermostability of both proteins. The acidified derivative mRAce
   conferred greater thermostability upon both proteins as compared with
   AtRAce. Moreover, mRAce enhanced the thermostability of other two
   thermolabile proteins from Jatropha curcas: the cytosolic ascorbate
   peroxidase 1 (JcAPX1) and the TATA-box binding protein isoform 1
   (JcTBP1). We further report - for the first time - that JcTBP1 mediates
   heat tolerance in vivo in yeast. Thus, our study identifies a C-terminal
   acidic mini-peptide - the acidified derivative mRAce - with potential
   uses in improving the thermostability of heat-labile proteins and their
   associated heat tolerance in host organisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   were investigated, and the activation energy was calculated using the
   Kissinger equation. Two-parameter autocatalytic equations of
   Sestak-Berggren model were constructed to describe the curing reaction
   rate quantitatively. The reaction orders, pre-exponential factor A and
   kinetic model f(alpha) were determined by curve fitting, and the
   calculated curves described the observed reaction rate well. TGA and DMA
   were used to measure the thermal properties of the composites. Adding
   ILs increased the storage modulus of composites, but decreased the
   thermal stability. Fracture surfaces of CNTs/EP and CNTs/Ils/EP
   composites were observed by SEM. CNTs showed better dispersion state in
   CNTs/lLs/EP composites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},

Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Control and stabilization of viscous fingering of immiscible fluids
   impacts a wide variety of pressure-driven multiphase flows. We report
   theoretical and experimental results on a time-dependent control
   strategy by manipulating the gap thickness b(t) in a lifting Hele-Shaw
   cell in the power-law form b(t) = b(1)t(1/7). Experimental results show
   good quantitative agreement with the predictions of linear stability
   analysis. By choosing the value of a single time-independent control
   parameter, we can either totally suppress the viscous fingering
   instability or maintain a series of nonsplitting viscous fingers during
   the fluid displacement process. In addition to the gap thickness of a
   Hele-Shaw cell, time-dependent control strategies can, in principle,
   also be placed on the injection rate, viscosity of the displaced fluid,
   and interfacial tension between the two fluids.}},

Abstract = {{We present a magnetic resonance elastography approach for tissue
   characterization that is inspired by seismic noise correlation and time
   reversal. The idea consists of extracting the elasticity from the
   natural shear waves in living tissues that are caused by cardiacmotion,
   blood pulsatility, and any muscle activity. In contrast to other
   magnetic resonance elastography techniques, this noise-based approach
   is, thus, passive and broadband and does not need any synchronization
   with sources. The experimental demonstration is conducted in a
   calibrated phantom and in vivo in the brain of two healthy volunteers.
   Potential applications of this ``brain palpation{''} approach for
   characterizing brain anomalies and diseases are foreseen.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the dynamical characteristics of the phase space

   a good indicator of chaos that can easily determine whether a given
   trajectory is regular or chaotic regardless of the dimensionality of the
   system, and can also provide a wealth of dynamical information when
   conveniently implemented. In two-dimensional (2D) systems SALI maps are
   computed as 2D phase space representations, where the SALI asymptotic
   values are represented in color scale. We show here how these maps
   provide full information on the dynamical phase space structure of the
   LiNC-LiCN system, even quantifying numerically the volume of the
   different zones of chaos and regularity as a function of the molecule
   excitation energy.}},

Abstract = {{A perspective projection model for prism-based stereovision was
   presented in this paper. The prism was considered as a single optical
   lens. By analyzing each plane individually and then combining them
   together, an affine transformation matrix which can express the
   relationship between an object point and its image was derived. Next,
   the perspective projection model between object point and its image was
   established. The methods for model parameter calibration, distortion
   correction and 3D reconstruction were also provided. The proposed method
   was based on optical geometry and could be used in a multi-ocular prism.
   Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the reliability and
   accuracy of our method which could be used in morphological measurement
   with high precision. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sidemodes have been observed in a coupled optoelectronic
   oscillator (COEO) when the contained actively mode-locked fiber ring
   laser employs erbium-doped fiber (EDF). We propose that such sidemodes
   can be suppressed significantly by an optical pulse power feedforward
   scheme, through which the mode-locked optical pulse is reversely
   intensity-modulated by itself, resulting in a fast power limiting.
   Experimentally we show that sidemodes are suppressed as much as 40 dB in
   a 10-GHz COEO. The additional noise induced by the power feedforward
   technique is analyzed numerically. We show that for a COEO with a
   typical cavity length, the feedforward contribution to final single-side
   band (SSB) noise is minor and neglectable. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Addition of 4 equiv of Li(N=(CBu2)-Bu-t) to VCl3 in THF, followed by
   addition of 0.5 equiv of 12, generates the homoleptic V(IV) ketimide
   complex, V(N=(CBu2)-Bu-t)(4) (1), in 42\% yield. Similarly, reaction of
   4 equiv of Li(N=(CBu2)-Bu-t) with NbCl4(THF)(2) in THF affords the
   homoleptic Nb(IV) ketimide complex, Nb(N=(CBu2)-Bu-t)(4) (2), in 55\%
   yield. Seeking to extend the series to the tantalum congener, a new
   Ta(IV) starting material, TaCl4(TMEDA) (3), was prepared via reduction
   of TaCl5 with Et3SiH, followed by addition of TMEDA. Reaction of 3 with
   4 equiv of Li(N=(CBu2)-Bu-t) in THF results in the isolation of a Ta(V)
   ketimide complex, Ta(Cl)(N=(CBu2)-Bu-t)(4) (5), which can be isolated in
   32\% yield. Reaction of 5 with Tl(OTf) yields Ta(OTf) (N=(CBu2)-Bu-t)(4)
   (6) in 44\% yield. Subsequent reduction of 6 with Cp{*}Co-2 in toluene
   generates the homoleptic Ta(IV) congener Ta(N=(CBu2)-Bu-t)(4) (7),
   although the yields are poor. All three homoleptic group 5 ketimide
   complexes exhibit squashed tetrahedral geometries in the solid state, as
   determined by X-ray crystallography. This geometry leads to a
   d(x2-y2)(1) (B-2(1) in D-2d) ground state, as supported by DFT
   calculations. EPR spectroscopic analysis of 1 and 2, performed at X- and
   Qband frequencies (similar to 9 and 35 GHz, respectively), further
   supports the B-2(1) ground-state assignment, whereas comparison of 1, 2,
   and 7 with related group 5 tetra(ary1), tetra(amido), and tetra(alkoxo)
   complexes shows a higher M-L covalency in the ketimide-metal
   interaction. In addition, a ligand field analysis of 1 and 2
   demonstrates that the ketimide ligand is both a strong a-donor and
   strong a-acceptor, an unusual combination found in very few
   organometallic ligands.}},

Title = {{Facility Delivery, Postnatal Care and Neonatal Deaths in India:
   Nationally-Representative Case-Control Studies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Clinical studies demonstrate the efficacy of interventions to reduce
   neonatal deaths, but there are fewer studies of their real-life
   effectiveness. In India, women often seek facility delivery after
   complications arise, rather than to avoid complications. Our objective
   was to quantify the association of facility delivery and postnatal
   checkups with neonatal mortality while examining the ``reverse
   causality{''} in which the mothers deliver at a health facility due to
   adverse perinatal events.
   Methods
   We conducted nationally representative case-control studies of about
   300,000 live births and 4,000 neonatal deaths to examine the effect of,
   place of delivery and postnatal checkup on neonatal mortality. We
   compared neonatal deaths to all live births and to a subset of live
   births reporting excessive bleeding or obstructed labour that were more
   comparable to cases in seeking care.
   Findings
   In the larger study of 2004-8 births, facility delivery without
   postnatal checkup was associated with an increased odds of neonatal
   death (Odds ratio = 2.5; 99\% CI 2.2-2.9), especially for early versus
   late neonatal deaths. However, use of more comparable controls showed
   marked attenuation (Odds ratio = 0.5; 0.4-0.5). Facility delivery with
   postnatal checkup was associated with reduced odds of neonatal death.
   Excess risks were attenuated in the earlier study of 2001-4 births.
   Conclusion
   The combined effect of facility deliveries with postnatal checks ups is
   substantially higher than just facility delivery alone. Evaluation of
   the real-life effectiveness of interventions to reduce child and
   maternal deaths need to consider reverse causality. If these
   associations are causal, facility delivery with postnatal check up could
   avoid about 1/3 of all neonatal deaths in India (similar to
   100,000/year).}},

Abstract = {{The electronic transport and spincaloric properties of epitaxial
   magnetic tunnel junctions with half-metallic Co2MnSi Heusler electrodes,
   MgO tunneling barriers, and different interface terminations are
   investigated by using first-principles calculations. An approach to
   spincaloric properties is presented that circumvents the linear response
   approximation inherent in the Seebeck coefficient and compared to the
   method of Sivan and Imry. This approach supports two different
   temperatures in the two electrodes and provides the exact current and/or
   voltage response of the system. Moreover, it accounts for
   temperature-dependent chemical potentials in the electrodes and
   finite-bias effects. We find that especially the former are important
   for obtaining qualitatively correct results, even if the variations of
   the chemical potentials are small. It is shown how the spincaloric
   properties can be tailored by the choice of the growth conditions. We
   find a large effective and spin-dependent Seebeck coefficient of -65 mu
   V/K at room temperature for the purely Co-terminated interface. We
   suggest to use such interfaces in thermally operated magnetoresistive
   random access memory modules, which exploit the magneto-Seebeck effect,
   to maximize the thermally induced readout voltage.}},

Title = {{Biological effectiveness of accelerated protons for chromosome exchanges}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{We have investigated chromosome exchanges induced in human cells by
   seven different energies of protons (5-2500 MeV) with LET values ranging
   from 0.2 to 8 keV/mu m. Human lymphocytes were irradiated in vitro and
   chromosome damage was assessed using three-color fluorescence in situ
   hybridization chromosome painting in chemically condensed chromosomes
   collected during the first cell division post irradiation. The relative
   biological effectiveness (RBE) was calculated from the initial slope of
   the dose-response curve for chromosome exchanges with respect to low
   dose and low dose-rate gamma-rays (denoted as RBEmax), and relative to
   acute doses of gamma-rays (denoted as RBE gamma Acute). The linear
   dose-response term was similar for all energies of protons, suggesting
   that the decrease in LET with increasing proton energy was balanced by
   the increase in dose from the production of nuclear secondaries.
   Secondary particles increase slowly above energies of a few hundred
   megaelectronvolts. Additional studies of 50 g/cm(2) aluminum shielded
   high-energy proton beams showed minor differences compared to the
   unshielded protons and lower RBE values found for shielded in comparison
   to unshielded beams of 2 or 2.5 GeV. All energies of protons produced a
   much higher percentage of complex-type chromosome exchanges when
   compared to acute doses of gamma-rays. The implications of these results
   for space radiation protection and proton therapy are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, the improved lasing performance of the III-nitride based
   vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) has been demonstrated by
   replacing the bulk AlGaN electron blocking layer (EBL) in the
   conventional VCSEL structure with an AlGaN/GaN multiple quantum barrier
   (MQB) EBL. The output power can be enhanced up to three times from 0.3
   mW to 0.9 mW. In addition, the threshold current density of the
   fabricated device with the MQB-EBL was reduced from 12 kA/cm(2) (9.5 mA)
   to 10.6 kA/cm(2) (8.5 mA) compared with the use of the bulk AlGaN EBL.
   Theoretical calculation results suggest that the improved carrier
   injection efficiency can be mainly attributed to the partial release of
   the strain and the effect of quantum interference by using the MQB
   structure, hence increasing the effective barrier height of the
   conduction band. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

   high-mobility organic semiconductors}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Fundamental understanding of photocarrier generation, transport and
   recombination under a steady-state photoexcitation has been an important
   goal of organic electronics and photonics, since these processes govern
   such electronic properties of organic semiconductors as, for instance,
   photoconductivity. Here, we discovered that photoconductivity of a
   highly ordered organic semiconductor rubrene exhibits several distinct
   regimes, in which photocurrent as a function of cw (continuous wave)
   excitation intensity is described by a power law with exponents
   sequentially taking values 1, 1/3 and 1/4. We show that in pristine
   crystals this photocurrent is generated at the very surface of the
   crystals, while the bulk photocurrent is drastically smaller and follows
   a different sequence of exponents, 1 and 1/2. We describe a simple
   experimental procedure, based on an application of ``gauge effect{''} in
   high vacuum, that allows to disentangle the surface and bulk
   contributions to photoconductivity. A model based on singlet exciton
   fission, triplet fusion and triplet-charge quenching that can describe
   these non-trivial effects in photoconductivity of highly ordered organic
   semiconductors is proposed. Observation of these effects in
   photoconductivity and modeling of the underlying microscopic mechanisms
   described in this work represent a significant step forward in our
   understanding of electronic properties of organic semiconductors.}},

Title = {{A straightforward method to compute average stochastic oscillations from
   data samples}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many biological systems exhibit sustained stochastic
   oscillations in their steady state. Assessing these oscillations is
   usually a challenging task due to the potential variability of the
   amplitude and frequency of the oscillations over time. As a result of
   this variability, when several stochastic replications are averaged, the
   oscillations are flattened and can be overlooked. This can easily lead
   to the erroneous conclusion that the system reaches a constant steady
   state.
   Results: This paper proposes a straightforward method to detect and
   asses stochastic oscillations. The basis of the method is in the use of
   polar coordinates for systems with two species, and cylindrical
   coordinates for systems with more than two species. By slightly
   modifying these coordinate systems, it is possible to compute the total
   angular distance run by the system and the average Euclidean distance to
   a reference point. This allows us to compute confidence intervals, both
   for the average angular speed and for the distance to a reference point,
   from a set of replications.
   Conclusions: The use of polar (or cylindrical) coordinates provides a
   new perspective of the system dynamics. The mean trajectory that can be
   obtained by averaging the usual cartesian coordinates of the samples
   informs about the trajectory of the center of mass of the replications.
   In contrast to such a mean cartesian trajectory, the mean polar
   trajectory can be used to compute the average circular motion of those
   replications, and therefore, can yield evidence about sustained steady
   state oscillations. Both, the coordinate transformation and the
   computation of confidence intervals, can be carried out efficiently.
   This results in an efficient method to evaluate stochastic oscillations.}},

   CO-functionalized tip displays dramatically enhanced resolution wherein
   covalent bonds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can be imaged.
   Employing real-space pseudopotential first-principles calculations, we
   examine the role of CO in functionalizing the nc-AFM tip. Our
   calculations allow us to simulate full AFM images and ascertain the
   enhancement mechanism of the CO molecule. We consider two approaches:
   one with an explicit inclusion of the CO molecule and one without. By
   comparing our simulations to existing experimental images, we ascribe
   the enhanced resolution of the CO functionalized tip to the special
   orbital characteristics of the CO molecule. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This review addresses the progress in cartilage repair technology over
   the decades with an emphasis on cartilage regeneration with cell
   therapy. The most abundant cartilage is the hyaline cartilage that
   covers the surface of our joints and, due to avascularity, this tissue
   is unable to repair itself. The cartilage degeneration seen in
   osteoarthritis causes patient suffering and is a huge burden to society.
   The surgical approach to cartilage repair was non-existing until the
   1950s when new surgical techniques emerged. The use of cultured cells
   for cell therapy started as experimental studies in the 1970s that
   developed over the years to a clinical application in 1994 with the
   introduction of the autologous chondrocyte transplantation technique
   (ACT). The technology is now spread worldwide and has been further
   refined by combining arthroscopic techniques with cells cultured on
   matrix (MACI technology). The non-regenerating hypothesis of cartilage
   has been revisited and we are now able to demonstrate cell divisions and
   presence of stem-cell niches in the joint. Furthermore, cartilage
   derived from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem
   cells could be the base for new broader cell treatments for cartilage
   injuries and the future technology base for prevention and cure of
   osteoarthritis.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) discriminates lesions in sections by
   assessing the speed of sound (SOS) or attenuation of sound (AOS) through
   tissues within a few minutes without staining; however, its clinical use
   in cytological diagnosis is unknown. We applied a thin layer preparation
   method to observe benign and malignant effusions using SAM. Although SAM
   is inferior in detecting nuclear features than light microscopy, it can
   differentiate malignant from benign cells using the higher SOS and AOS
   values and large irregular cell clusters that are typical features of
   carcinomas. Moreover, each single malignant cell exhibits characteristic
   cytoplasmic features such as a large size, irregular borders and
   secretory or cytoskeletal content. By adjusting the observation range,
   malignant cells are differentiated from benign cells easily using SAM.
   Subtle changes in the functional and structural heterogeneity of tumour
   cells were pursuable with a different digital data of SAM. SAM can be a
   useful tool for screening malignant cells in effusions before light
   microscopic observation. Higher AOS values in malignant cells compared
   with those of benign cells support the feasibility of a novel
   sonodynamic therapy for malignant effusions.}},

Title = {{Impact of proton pump inhibitor treatment on gastrointestinal bleeding
   associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among
   post-myocardial infarction patients taking antithrombotics: nationwide
   study}},
Journal = {{BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{351}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{STUDY QUESTION
   What is the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the risk of
   gastrointestinal bleeding in post-myocardial infarction patients taking
   antithrombotics and treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
   (NSAIDs)?
   METHODS
   This was a nationwide cohort study based on linked administrative
   registry data from all hospitals in Denmark between 1997 and 2011. The
   study included patients aged 30 years and over admitted with a first
   myocardial infarction who survived at least 30 days after discharge. The
   association between PPIs and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding according
   to NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy was estimated using adjusted time
   dependent Cox regression models.
   STUDY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS
   The use of PPIs was independently associated with decreased risk of
   gastrointestinal bleeding in post-myocardial infarction patients taking
   antithrombotics and treated with NSAIDs. Of 82 955 post-myocardial
   infarction patients (mean age 67.4 years, 64\% (n=53 070) men), all of
   whom were taking single or dual antithrombotic therapy, 42.5\% (n=35
   233) filled at least one prescription for NSAIDs and 45.5\% (n=37 771)
   received PPIs. Over a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, 3229 gastrointestinal
   bleeds occurred. The crude incidence rates of bleeding (events/100
   person years) on NSAID plus antithrombotic therapy were 1.8 for patients
   taking PPIs and 2.1 for those not taking PPIs. The adjusted risk of
   bleeding was lower with PPI use (hazard ratio 0.72, 95\% confidence
   interval 0.54 to 0.95) regardless of antithrombotic treatment regimen,
   type of NSAID, and type of PPI used. The main limitation of the study is
   its observational non-randomised design. The results suggest that PPI
   treatment probably has a beneficial effect regardless of underlying
   gastrointestinal risk and that when NSAIDs cannot be avoided in
   post-myocardial infarction patients, physicians might prescribe a PPI as
   well. The study does not clarify whether PPIs might be safely omitted in
   specific subgroups of patients with a low risk of gastrointestinal
   bleeding.
   WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
   In post-myocardial infarction patients, bleeding complications have been
   associated with both antithrombotic and NSAID treatment. Concurrent use
   of PPIs was independently associated with a decreased risk of
   gastrointestinal bleeding in post-myocardial infarction patients taking
   antithrombotics and NSAID, regardless of antithrombotic treatment
   regimen, type of NSAID, and type of PPI used.}},

Abstract = {{Although central nervous system-resident microglia are believed to be
   ineffective at phagocytosing and clearing amyloid-beta (A beta), a major
   pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it has been suggested
   that peripheral myeloid cells constitute a heterogeneous cell population
   with greater A beta-clearing capabilities. Here, we demonstrate that the
   conditional ablation of resident microglia in CD11b-HSVTK (TK) mice is
   followed by a rapid repopulation of the brain by peripherally derived
   myeloid cells. We used this system to directly assess the ability of
   peripheral macrophages to reduce A beta plaque pathology and therefore
   depleted and replaced the pool of resident microglia with peripherally
   derived myeloid cells in A beta-carrying APPPS1 mice crossed to TK mice
   (APPPS1; TK). Despite a nearly complete exchange of resident microglia
   with peripheral myeloid cells, there was no significant change in A beta
   burden or APP processing in APPPS1; TK mice. Importantly, however, newly
   recruited peripheral myeloid cells failed to cluster around A beta
   deposits. Even additional anti-A beta antibody treatment aimed at
   engaging myeloid cells with amyloid plaques neither directed
   peripherally derived myeloid cells to amyloid plaques nor altered A beta
   burden. These data demonstrate that mere recruitment of peripheral
   myeloid cells to the brain is insufficient in substantially clearing A
   beta burden and suggest that specific additional triggers appear to be
   required to exploit the full potential of myeloid cell-based therapies
   for AD.}},

Abstract = {{Metal nanoparticle arrays have proved useful for different applications
   due to their ability to enhance electromagnetic fields within a few tens
   of nanometers. This field enhancement results from the excitation of
   various plasmonic modes at certain resonance frequencies. In this
   article, we have studied an array of metallic nanocylinders placed on a
   thin metallic film. A simple analytical model is proposed to explain the
   existence of the different types of modes that can be excited in such a
   structure. Owing to the cylinder array, the structure can support
   localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes. The LSP mode couples to the
   propagating surface plasmon (PSP) mode of the thin film to give rise to
   the hybrid lattice plasmon (HLP) mode and anti-crossing phenomenon. Due
   to the periodicity of the array, the Bragg modes (BM) are also excited
   in the structure. We have calculated analytically the resonance
   frequencies of the BM, LSP and the corresponding HLP, and have verified
   the calculations by rigorous numerical methods. Experimental results
   obtained in the Kretschmann configuration also validate the proposed
   analytical model. The dependency of the resonance frequencies of these
   modes on the structural parameters such as cylinder diameter, height and
   the periodicity of the array is shown. Such a detailed study can offer
   insights on the physical phenomenon that governs the excitation of
   various plasmonic modes in the system. It is also useful to optimize the
   structure as per required for the different applications, where such
   types of structures are used. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Persistent free-running circannual (approximately year-long) rhythms
   have evolved in animals to regulate hormone cycles, drive metabolic
   rhythms (including hibernation), and time annual reproduction. Recent
   studies have defined the photoperiodic input to this rhythm, wherein
   melatonin acts on thyrotroph cells of the pituitary pars tuberalis (PT),
   leading to seasonal changes in the control of thyroid hormone metabolism
   in the hypothalamus. However, seasonal rhythms persist in constant
   conditions in many species in the absence of a changing photoperiod
   signal, leading to the generation of circannual cycles. It is not known
   which cells, tissues, and pathways generate these remarkable long-term
   rhythmic processes. We show that individual PT thyrotrophs can be in one
   of two binary states reflecting either a long (EYA3(+)) or short
   (CHGA(+)) photoperiod, with the relative proportion in each state
   defining the phase of the circannual cycle. We also show that a
   morphogenic cycle driven by the PT leads to extensive re-modeling of the
   PT and hypothalamus over the circannual cycle. We propose that the PT
   may employ a recapitulated developmental pathway to drive changes in
   morphology of tissues and cells. Our data are consistent with the
   hypothesis that the circannual timer may reside within the PT thyrotroph
   and is encoded by a binary switch timing mechanism, which may regulate
   the generation of circannual neuroendocrine rhythms, leading to dynamic
   re-modeling of the hypothalamic interface. In summary, the PT-ventral
   hypothalamus now appears to be a prime structure involved in long-term
   rhythm generation.}},

Abstract = {{Liver toxicity is a severe problem associated with Traditional Chinese
   Medicine (TCM). Fructus Meliae Toosendan (FMT) is a known hepatotoxic
   TCM, however, the toxicological mechanisms of liver injury caused by FMT
   treatment still remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to
   reveal possible mechanisms of FMT water extract-induced liver injury
   using a systemic approach. After three consecutive daily dosing of FMT
   water extract, significant increases of alanine transaminase, aspartate
   transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase activities, along with elevated
   total bilirubin and total cholesterol levels and a decrease of
   triglyceride level, were detected in mice serum. Moreover, hydropic
   degeneration was observed in hepatocytes, suggesting the presence of
   FMT-induced liver injury. mRNA and microRNA expression profiles of liver
   samples from injured mice were analyzed and revealed 8 miRNAs and 1,723
   mRNAs were significantly changed after FMT water extract treatment. For
   the eight differentially expressed miRNAs, their predicted target genes
   were collected and a final set of 125 genes and 4 miRNAs (miR-139-5p,
   miR-199a-5p, miR-2861, and miR-3960) was selected to investigate
   important processes involved in FMT hepatotoxicity. Our results
   demonstrated several cellular functions were disordered after FMT
   treatment, such as cellular growth and proliferation, gene expression
   and cellular development. We hypothesized that liver cell necrosis was
   the main liver toxicity of FMT water extract, which was possibly caused
   by oxidative stress responses.}},

Abstract = {{The ideal goal of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment should be
   suppression of emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma through the
   disappearance of hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg) rather than the control
   of serum hepatitis B virus-DNA level. For this purpose, various types of
   combination therapies using nucleoside analogs (NAs) and interferon
   (IFN) have been conducted. The therapeutic effects of combination of two
   different kinds of agents are better than those of the monotherapy using
   NAs or IFN alone, probably because different pharmaceutical properties
   might act in a coordinated manner. Recently, combination therapies with
   NAs and IFN and sequential therapies with NAs administration followed by
   IFN therapy have been routinely employed. We previously reported that
   combination therapy using entecavir (ETV) and pegylated (PEG)-IFN showed
   antiviral effects in 71\% of CHB patients; the effect of this
   combination was better than that using lamivudine (LAM) and PEG-IFN.
   This is partially explained by the better antiviral effects of ETV than
   those of LAM. In our analysis, the cohort of CHB consisted of the
   patients who showed a flare-up of hepatitis before antiviral therapy,
   and their baseline HBsAg levels were relatively low. Therefore, in
   addition to the combination of the agents, the appropriate selection of
   patients is critical to achieve a good viral response.}},

Journal = {{CELL CYCLE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{3292-3305}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Although glutamine (Gln) is not an essential amino acid, it is
   considered a critical substrate in many key metabolic processes that
   control a variety of physiological functions and are involved in
   regulating early embryonic development. Thus, we investigated the effect
   of Gln on regulation of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) self-renewal
   and related signaling pathways. Gln deprivation decreased Oct4
   expression as well as expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins.
   However, Gln treatment retained the expression of cell cycle regulatory
   proteins and the Oct4 in mESCs, which were blocked by compound 968 (a
   glutaminase inhibitor). In addition, Gln stimulated PI3K/Akt pathway,
   which subsequently elicited PKCE translocation to membrane without an
   influx of intracellular Ca2+. Inhibition of Akt and PKC blocked
   Gln-induced Oct4 expression and proliferation. Gln also stimulated mTOR
   phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, which abolished by PKC
   inhibition. Furthermore, Gln increased the cellular population of both
   Oct4 and bromodeoxyuridine positive cells, suggesting that Gln regulates
   self-renewal ability of mESCs. Gln induced a decrease in HDAC1, but not
   in HDAC2, which were blocked by PKC inhibitors. Gln treatment resulted
   in an increase in global histone acetylation and methylation. In
   addition, Gln significantly reduced methylation of the Oct4 promoter
   region through decrease in DNMT1 and DNMT3a expression, which were
   blocked by PKC and HDAC inhibitors. In conclusion, Gln stimulates mESC
   proliferation and maintains mESC undifferentiation status through
   transcription regulation via the Akt, PKCE, and mTOR signaling pathways.}},

   this work was to analyse the relationship between the essential oils

   essential oils were analysed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Hierarchical cluster
   analysis and principal component analysis statistical methods were used
   to cluster biotypes according to the essential oils chemical
   composition. The essential oil yield ranged from 0.8 to 2.3 (v/w). In
   total 82 compounds have been identified, these represent 96.7-99.9\% of
   the essential oil. The most represented compounds in the essential oils
   were 1.8-cineole, linalool, alpha-terpineol, verbenone, alpha-pinene,
   limonene, bornyl acetate and terpinolene. The results show that the
   essential oil yield of the 10 biotypes is affected by the environmental
   characteristics of the sampling sites while the chemical composition is
   linked to the genetic characteristics of different biotypes.}},

Title = {{Localized hypoxia within the subgranular zone determines the early
   survival of newborn hippocampal granule cells}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{The majority of adult hippocampal newborn cells die during early
   differentiation from intermediate progenitors (IPCs) to immature
   neurons. Neural stem cells in vivo are located in a relative hypoxic
   environment, and hypoxia enhances their survival, proliferation and
   stemness in vitro. Thus, we hypothesized that migration of IPCs away
   from hypoxic zones within the SGZ might result in oxidative damage, thus
   triggering cell death. Hypoxic niches were observed along the SGZ,
   composed of adult NSCs and early IPCs, and oxidative byproducts were
   present in adjacent late IPCs and neuroblasts. Stabilizing hypoxia
   inducible factor-1 alpha with dimethyloxallyl glycine increased early
   survival, but not proliferation or differentiation, in neurospheres in
   vitro and in newly born SGZ cells in vivo. Rescue experiments in
   Bax(fl/fl) mutants supported these results. We propose that localized
   hypoxia within the SGZ contributes to the neurogenic microenvironment
   and determines the early, activity-independent survival of adult
   hippocampal newborn cells.}},

   inequalities, in a discussion of burning issues in tackling health
   inequalities}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{On 20 March 2015, Professor Johan Mackenbach of the Erasmus University
   Medical Centre was awarded a doctorate honoris causa by the Catholic
   University (Universite Catholique) of Louvain, Belgium, for his
   outstanding contribution to the analysis of health inequalities in
   Europe and to the development of policies intended to address them. In
   this context, a debate took place between Professor Mackenbach,
   Professor Maniquet, a well-being economist, and a representative of the
   Federal Health Ministry (Mr. Brieuc Vandamme). They were asked to debate
   on three topics. (1) socio-economic inequalities in health are not
   smaller in countries with universal welfare policies; (2) Policies needs
   to target either absolute inequalities or relative inequalities; (3) The
   focus of policies should either address the social determinants of
   health or concentrate on access to health care. The results of the
   debate by the three speakers highlighted the fact that welfare systems
   have not been able to tackle diseases of affluence. Targets for health
   policies should be set according to opportunity cost: health care is
   increasingly costly and a focus on health inequalities above all other
   inequalities runs the risk of taking a dogmatic approach to well-being.
   Health is only one dimension of well-being and policies to address
   inequality need to balance preferences between several dimensions of
   well-being. Finally, policymakers may not have that much choice when it
   comes to reducing inequality: all effective policies should be
   implemented. For example, Belgium and other European countries should
   not leave aside health protection policies that are evidence-based, in
   particular taxes on tobacco and alcohol. In his final contribution,
   Professor Mackenbach reminded the audience that politics is medicine on
   a larger scale and stated that policymakers should make more use of
   research into public health.}},

Title = {{A simplified hard output sphere decoder for large MIMO systems with the

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},

Abstract = {{Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) with a spatial multiplexing (SKI)
   scheme is a topic of high interest for the next generation of wireless
   communications systems. At the receiver, neighborhood studies (NS) and
   lattice reduction (LR)-aided techniques are common solutions in the
   literature to approach the optimal and computationally complex maximum
   likelihood (ML) detection. However, the NS and LR solutions might not
   offer optimal performance for large dimensional systems, such as large
   number of antennas, and high order constellations when they are
   considered separately. In this paper, we propose a novel equivalent
   metric dealing with the association of these solutions by introducing a
   reduced domain neighborhood study. We show that the proposed metric
   presents a relevant complexity reduction while maintaining near ML
   performance. Moreover, the corresponding computational complexity is
   shown to be independent of the constellation size, but it is quadratic
   in the number of transmit antennas. For instance, for a 4 x 4 MIMO
   system with 16-QAM modulation on each layer, the proposed solution is
   simultaneously near ML with perfect and real channel estimation and ten
   times less complex than the classical neighborhood based K-best
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{Congenital hepatic fibrosis is part of many different malformation
   syndromes, of which oculo-encephalohepato-renal syndrome is the most
   common. These syndromes largely overlap, and so accurate classification
   of individual patients may be difficult. We present herein three
   syndromic siblings who were products of a consanguineous marriage. We
   investigated in detail at least six organ systems in these patients,
   namely the liver, brain, eye, kidneys, skeleton, and gonads. The common
   features observed in these three cases were congenital hepatic fibrosis,
   retinitis pigmentosa, truncal obesity, rotatory nystagmus, mental
   retardation, advanced myopia, and high-arched palate. The clinical
   dysmorphology in these patients was distinct and lacked the major
   features of the known syndromes associated with congenital hepatic
   fibrosis. Although some features of these presented cases are similar to
   those found in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), the absence of some major
   criteria of BBS (polydactyly, renal abnormality, and hypogonadism)
   suggests that this may be a new syndrome. All three patients remain
   under follow-up in the departments of Gastroenterology, Ophthalmology,
   and Neurology at Hacettepe University.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the skill of predictions of September Arctic sea ice extent
   from dynamical models participating in the Sea Ice Outlook (SIO).
   Forecasts submitted in August, at roughly 2month lead times, are
   skillful. However, skill is lower in forecasts submitted to SIO, which
   began in 2008, than in hindcasts (retrospective forecasts) of the last
   few decades. The multimodel mean SIO predictions offer slightly higher
   skill than the single-model SIO predictions, but neither beats a damped
   persistence forecast at longer than 2 month lead times. The models are
   largely unsuccessful at predicting each other, indicating a large
   difference in model physics and/or initial conditions. Motivated by
   this, we perform an initial condition sensitivity experiment with four
   SIO models, applying a fixed -1m perturbation to the initial sea ice
   thickness. The significant range of the response among the models
   suggests that different model physics make a significant contribution to
   forecast uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Binary homopolymer blends of two hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene (PS-OH)
   and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA-OH) homopolymers (Mn similar to 16000 g
   mol(-1)) were grafted on SiO2 substrates by high-temperature (T > 150
   degrees C), short-time (t < 600 s) thermal treatments. The resulting
   brush layer was tested to screen preferential interactions of the SiO2
   substrate with the different symmetric and asymmetric PS-b-PMMA block
   copolymers deposited on top of the grafted molecules. By properly
   adjusting the blend composition and the processing parameters, an
   efficient surface neutralization path was identified, enabling the
   formation, in the block copolymer film, of homogeneous textures of
   lamellae or cylinders perpendicularly oriented with respect to the
   substrate. A critical interplay between the phase segregation of the
   homopolymer blends and their grafting process on the SiO2 was observed.
   In fact, the polar SiO2 is preferential for the PMMA-rich phase that
   forms a homogeneous layer on the substrate, while the PS-rich phase is
   located at the polymer-air interface. During the thermal treatment,
   phase segregation and grafting proceed simultaneously. Complete wetting
   of the PS rich phase on the PMMA rich phase leads to the formation of a
   PS/PMMA bilayer. In this case, the progressive diffusion of PS chains
   toward the polymer-SiO2 interface during the thermal treatment allows
   tuning of the brush layer composition.}},

Abstract = {{An organic-inorganic hybrid monolithic column was prepared within the
   confines of a capillary via a single-step in situ sol-gel approach using
   zirconium tetrabutoxide as a precursor to compose the inorganic backbone
   and 3-triethoxysilylpropyl carbamoylated derivative of erythromycin
   (TEOSPC-ERY) as a co-precursor to introduce the organic chiral selector
   moiety in the zirconia backbone. The resulting carbamoylated
   ERY-zirconia hybrid monolith (ERY-ZHM) showed homogeneous morphology
   with well-defined through pores and was tightly connected with the inner
   wall of the capillary. The column was employed for capillary
   electrochromatographic enantioseparation of six basic chiral drugs in
   mobile phases (MPs) consisting of acetonitrile (ACN) and
   triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) buffer. The effects of composition of MP
   and applied voltage on chiral separation were investigated by using
   propranolol as a representative analyte. The highest resolution (R-s =
   3.33) was obtained with a MP consisting of 10/90 (v/v) ACN/TEAA buffer
   (10 mM, pH 7), 10 kV applied voltage and 25 degrees C capillary
   temperature. The relative standard deviations for resolution values
   regarding run to run, day to day, column to column and batch to batch
   repeatability were 0,41\%, 0.89\%, 1.80\% and 2.26\% (for n = 3),
   respectively, indicating satisfactory stability of columns and
   reproducibility of column preparation process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Epidemiological associations between hyperuricemia and cardiometabolic
   risk factors: a comprehensive study from Chinese community}},
Journal = {{BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed to assess the associations of serum uric
   acid (SUA) levels and hyperuricemia with cardiometabolic risk factors in
   a Chinese community-dwelling population.
   Methods: A large cohort of 4706 residents was enrolled in this study.
   Physical examinations and laboratory tests were performed following a
   standardized protocol. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses
   were conducted with adjustment of cardiometabolic risk factors including
   age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), triglyceride (TG),
   high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels
   using SPSS version 17 software.
   Results: The prevalence of hyperuricemia was 7.6 \%. There were
   significant differences in age, BMI, BP, TG, HDL-c, LDL-c and FBG levels
   and the proportion of men between participants with and without
   hyperuricemia. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that SUA
   levels were positively associated with age, sex, BMI, BP, TG and LDL-c
   levels, but negatively associated with HDL-c and FBG levels. Multiple
   logistic regression analysis showed that per unit increase in age was
   associated with a 1.014 times higher odds of the presence of
   hyperuricemia. Men had a 1.858 times higher odds of the presence of
   hyperuricemia compared with women. Per unit increases in BMI, BP, TG and
   LDL-c levels were associated with 1.103, 1.016, 1.173 and 1.200 times
   higher odds of the presence of hyperuricemia, respectively. Per unit
   increases in HDL-c and FBG levels were associated with 0.616 and 0.900
   times lower odds of the presence of hyperuricemia, respectively.
   Conclusions: In a Chinese community-dwelling population, age, sex, BMI,
   BP, TG, HDL-c, LDL-c and FBG levels are cardiometabolic risk factors
   that are significantly associated with SUA levels, as well as the
   presence of hyperuricemia.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate a growth mechanism which allows for the fabrication of
   catalyst-free InAs nanowires on Si (111) substrates by chemical beam
   epitaxy. Our growth protocol consists of successive low-temperature (LT)
   nucleation and high-temperature growth steps. This method produces
   non-tapered InAs nanowires with controllable length and diameter. We
   show that InAs nanowires evolve from the islands formed during the LT
   nucleation step and grow truly catalyst-free, without any indium
   droplets at the tip. The impact of different growth parameters on the
   nanowire morphology is presented. In particular, good control over
   nanowire aspect ratio is demonstrated. A better understanding of the
   growth process is obtained through the development of a theoretical
   model combining the diffusion-induced growth scenario with some specific
   features of the catalyst-free growth mechanism, along with the analysis
   of the V/III flow ratio influencing material incorporation. As a result,
   we perform a full mapping of the nanowire morphology versus growth
   parameters which provides useful general guidelines on the self-induced
   formation of III-V nanowires on silicon.}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple chemical definition to demark the edge of the
   mesospheric polar vortices. Because this vortex definition does not rely
   on the wind field, it is useful in the mesosphere where wind
   observations are sparse and reanalysis winds are unreliable. The
   chemical definition is also insensitive to double jets that complicate
   vortex identification in the mesosphere. The algorithm is based on
   horizontal gradients of carbon monoxide (CO) and mirrors the widely used
   vortex edge definition in the stratosphere based on potential vorticity
   (PV) gradients. Here the approach is used to identify the Arctic vortex
   in the mesosphere during a 10 year (2004-2014) record of Microwave Limb
   Sounder data. Vortex size and shape comparisons are made where the CO
   and PV methods overlap in the upper stratosphere. A case study is
   presented during the NH 2008-2009 winter that demonstrates the fidelity
   of the CO gradient method on individual days and emphasizes the impact
   of double jets on methods to identify the polar vortex. We recommend
   transitioning from a PV or stream function-based vortex definition in
   the stratosphere to using a CO gradient definition above 0.1 hPa
   (similar to 60 km). The CO gradient method identifies a coherent region
   of high CO at 80 km that is confined to mid-to-high latitudes 99.8\% of
   the time during Arctic winter. Taking advantage of the CO gradient
   method to identify the polar vortex adds similar to 20 km of reliable
   vortex information (from 60 to 80 km) in a region of the atmosphere
   where reanalyses are most suspect.}},

Abstract = {{C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are an emerging family of pattern
   recognition receptors that recognizes pathogens or damaged tissue to
   trigger innate immune responses. However, endogenous ligands for CLRs
   are not fully understood. In this study, we sought to identify an
   endogenous ligand(s) for human macrophage-inducible C-type lectin
   (hMincle). A particular fraction of lipid extracts from liver
   selectively activated reporter cells expressing hMincle. MS analysis
   determined the chemical structure of the active component as
   cholesterol. Purified cholesterol in plate-coated and crystalized forms
   activates reporter cells expressing hMincle but not murine Mincle
   (mMincle). Cholesterol crystals are known to activate immune cells and
   induce inflammatory responses through lysosomal damage. However, direct
   innate immune receptors for cholesterol crystals have not been
   identified. Murine macrophages transfected with hMincle responded to
   cholesterol crystals by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Human
   dendritic cells expressed a set of inflammatory genes in response to
   cholesterol crystals, and this was inhibited by anti-human Mincle.
   Importantly, other related CLRs did not bind cholesterol crystals,
   whereas other steroids were not recognized by hMincle. These results
   suggest that cholesterol crystals are an endogenous ligand for hMincle
   and that they activate innate immune responses.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial colonies are experimental model systems for studying the
   colonization of new territory by biological species through range
   expansion. We study a generalization of the two-species Eden model,
   which incorporates local frequency-dependent selection, in order to
   analyze how social interactions between two species influence surface
   roughness of growing microbial colonies. The model includes several
   classical scenarios from game theory. We then concentrate on an
   expanding public goods game, where either cooperators or defectors take
   over the front depending on the system parameters. We analyze in detail
   the critical behavior of the nonequilibrium phase transition between
   global cooperation and defection and thereby identify a new universality
   class of phase transitions dealing with absorbing states. At the
   transition, the number of boundaries separating sectors decays with a
   novel power law in time and their superdiffusive motion crosses over
   from Eden scaling to a nearly ballistic regime. In parallel, the width
   of the front initially obeys Eden roughening and, at later times, passes
   over to selective roughening.}},

Title = {{Radiation hybrid maps of the D-genome of Aegilops tauschii and their
   application in sequence assembly of large and complex plant genomes}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The large and complex genome of bread wheat (Triticum
   aestivum L., similar to 17 Gb) requires high resolution genome maps with
   saturated marker scaffolds to anchor and orient BAC contigs/sequence
   scaffolds for whole genome assembly. Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping has
   proven to be an excellent tool for the development of such maps for it
   offers much higher and more uniform marker resolution across the length
   of the chromosome compared to genetic mapping and does not require
   marker polymorphism per se, as it is based on presence (retention) vs.
   absence (deletion) marker assay.
   Methods: In this study, a 178 line RH panel was genotyped with SSRs and
   DArT markers to develop the first high resolution RH maps of the entire
   D-genome of Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78. To confirm map order
   accuracy, the AL8/78-RH maps were compared with: 1) a DArT consensus
   genetic map constructed using more than 100 biparental populations, 2) a
   RH map of the D-genome of reference hexaploid wheat `Chinese Spring',
   and 3) two SNP-based genetic maps, one with anchored D-genome BAC
   contigs and another with anchored D-genome sequence scaffolds. Using
   marker sequences, the RH maps were also anchored with a BAC contig based
   physical map and draft sequence of the D-genome of Ae. tauschii.
   Results: A total of 609 markers were mapped to 503 unique positions on
   the seven D-genome chromosomes, with a total map length of 14,706.7 cR.
   The average distance between any two marker loci was 29.2 cR which
   corresponds to 2.1 cM or 9.8 Mb. The average mapping resolution across
   the D-genome was estimated to be 0.34 Mb (Mb/cR) or 0.07 cM (cM/cR). The
   RH maps showed almost perfect agreement with several published maps with
   regard to chromosome assignments of markers. The mean rank correlations
   between the position of markers on AL8/78 maps and the four published
   maps, ranged from 0.75 to 0.92, suggesting a good agreement in marker
   order. With 609 mapped markers, a total of 2481 deletions for the whole
   D-genome were detected with an average deletion size of 42.0 Mb. A total
   of 520 markers were anchored to 216 Ae. tauschii sequence scaffolds, 116
   of which were not anchored earlier to the D-genome.
   Conclusion: This study reports the development of first high resolution
   RH maps for the D-genome of Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78, which were
   then used for the anchoring of unassigned sequence scaffolds. This study
   demonstrates how RH mapping, which offered high and uniform resolution
   across the length of the chromosome, can facilitate the complete
   sequence assembly of the large and complex plant genomes.}},

Title = {{Dynamic manipulation of particles via transformative optofluidic
   waveguides}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Optofluidics is one of the most remarkable areas in the field of
   microfluidic research. Particle manipulation with optofluidic platforms
   has become central to optical chromatography, biotechnology, and
   mu-total analysis systems. Optical manipulation of particles depends on
   their sizes and refractive indices (n), which occasionally leads to
   undesirable separation consequences when their optical mobilities are
   identical. Here, we demonstrate rapid and dynamic particle manipulation
   according to n, regardless of size. Integrated
   liquid-core/solid-cladding (LS) and liquidcore/liquid-cladding (L-2)
   waveguides were fabricated and their characteristics were experimentally
   and theoretically determined. The high and low n particles showed the
   opposite behaviors by controlling the contrast of their n values to
   those of the working fluids. The LS waveguide was found to successfully
   manipulate particles according to n, and the L2 waveguide was found to
   provide additional system stability and flexibility, compared to the LS
   system.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive methane cracking reaction pathway was investigated by
   performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition to
   the sequential dissociation reaction, i.e. CH4 -> CHx +(4 - x)H -> C +
   2H(2), a more sophisticated surface reaction network was studied, i.e.
   CHx + C -> CHx-1 + CH. The results show that CHx dehydrogenation is
   promoted with a low energy barrier through bimolecular reaction and
   provide an alternative kinetic favorable route for methane cracking.
   This study also demonstrates that the production of gas phase C-2
   hydrocarbon species, e.g. C2H2 and C2H4, in methane cracking reaction is
   unlikely due to the high barrier energy of C2H3 formation and their
   strong adsorption energy on Ni (1 1 1). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The facultative intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila, the
   causative agent of Legionnaires disease, infects and replicates within
   human alveolar macrophages. L. pneumophila delivers almost 300 effector
   proteins into the besieged host cell that alter signaling cascades and
   create conditions that favor intracellular bacterial survival. In order
   for the effectors to accomplish their intracellular mission, their
   activity needs to be specifically directed toward the correct host cell
   protein or target organelle. Here, we show that the L. pneumophila
   effector GobX possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is mediated by
   a central region homologous to mammalian U-box domains. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that GobX exploits host cell S-palmitoylation to
   specifically localize to Golgi membranes. The hydrophobic palmitate
   moiety is covalently attached to a cysteine residue at position 175,
   which is part of an amphipathic alpha-helix within the C-terminal region
   of GobX. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine 175 or residues on the
   hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix strongly attenuated
   palmitoylation and Golgi localization of GobX. Together, our study
   provides evidence that the L. pneumophila effector GobX exploits two
   post-translational modification pathways of host cells, ubiquitination
   and S-palmitoylation.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{460}},
Pages = {{117-124}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Recently we introduced a norm-preserving wavefunction interpolation
   (NPI) method which allows the accurate and efficient integration of the
   time-dependent Schrodinger equation in regions of rapidly varying
   time-derivative coupling (TDC), e.g. near conical intersections (CIs)
   and effectively (N-1)-dimensional trivial unavoided crossings (TUCs).
   Herein we report the implementation of the NPI scheme into the ab initio
   multiple spawning (AIMS) method and investigate its behavior in two test
   systems: one which exhibits a CI and another which exhibits a TUC. In
   the CI case, AIMS-NPI predicts transfer probabilities that agree to
   within 0.6\% of simulations based on the analytical evaluation of the
   nonadiabatic couplings, without the need for computationally expensive
   adaptive integration. In the TUC case, AIMS-NPI results in less than
   0.08\% error in the population transfer probability when a 0.12 fs time
   step is used, while simulations based on the analytical approach exhibit
   catastrophic errors for all finite time steps. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Ex-Vivo Uterine Environment (EVE) Therapy Induced Limited Fetal
   Inflammation in a Premature Lamb Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Ex-vivo uterine environment (EVE) therapy uses an artificial placenta to
   provide gas exchange and nutrient delivery to a fetus submerged in an
   amniotic fluid bath. Development of EVE may allow us to treat very
   premature neonates without mechanical ventilation. Meanwhile, elevations
   in fetal inflammation are associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. In
   the present study, we analysed fetal survival, inflammation and
   pulmonary maturation in preterm lambs maintained on EVE therapy using a
   parallelised umbilical circuit system with a low priming volume.
   Methods
   Ewes underwent surgical delivery at 115 days of gestation (term is 150
   days), and fetuses were transferred to EVE therapy (EVE group; n = 5).
   Physiological parameters were continuously monitored; fetal blood
   samples were intermittently obtained to assess wellbeing and targeted to
   reference range values for 2 days. Age-matched animals (Control group; n
   = 6) were surgically delivered at 117 days of gestation. Fetal blood and
   tissue samples were analysed and compared between the two groups.
   Results
   Fetal survival time in the EVE group was 27.0 +/- 15.5 (group mean +/-
   SD) hours. Only one fetus completed the pre-determined study period with
   optimal physiological parameters, while the other 4 animals demonstrated
   physiological deterioration or death prior to the predetermined study
   end point. Significant elevations (p< 0.05) in: i) inflammatory proteins
   in fetal plasma; ii) selected cytokine/chemokine mRNA expression levels
   in fetal tissues; and iii) histological inflammatory score in fetal
   lung, were observed in the EVE group compared to the Control group.
   There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in surfactant protein mRNA
   expression level between the two groups.
   Conclusion
   In this study, we achieved limited fetal survival using EVE therapy.
   Despite this, EVE therapy only induced a modest fetal inflammatory
   response and did not promote lung maturation. These data provide
   additional insight into markers of treatment efficacy for the assessment
   of future studies.}},

   Wukipolyomavirus in Wild Rodents}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Two novel polyomaviruses (PyVs) were identified in kidney and chest-
   cavity fluid samples of wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and common
   voles (Microtus arvalis) collected in Germany. All cloned and sequenced
   genomes had the typical PyV genome organization, including putative open
   reading frames for early regulatory proteins large T antigen and small T
   antigen on one strand and for structural late proteins (VP1, VP2 and
   VP3) on the other strand. Virus- like particles (VLPs) were generated by
   yeast expression of the VP1 protein of both PyVs. VLP- based ELISA and
   large T- antigen sequence- targeted polymerasechain reaction
   investigations demonstrated signs of infection of these novel PyVs in
   about 42\% of bank voles and 18\% of common voles. In most cases only
   viral DNA, but not VP1specific antibodies were detected. In additional
   animals exclusively VP1- specific antibodies, but no viral DNA was
   detected, indicative for virus clearance. Phylogenetic and clustering
   analysis including all known PyV genomes placed novel bank vole and
   common vole PyVs amongst members of the tentative Wukipolymavirus genus.
   The other known four rodent PyVs, Murine PyV and Hamster PyV, and Murine
   pneumotropic virus and Mastomys PyV belong to different phylogenetic
   clades, tentatively named Orthopolyomavirus I and Orthopolyomavirus II,
   respectively. In conclusion, the finding of novel vole- borne PyVs may
   suggest an evolutionary origin of ancient wukipolyomaviruses in rodents
   and may offer the possibility to develop a vole- based animal model for
   human wukipolyomaviruses.}},

Abstract = {{During the Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation/Atmospheric
   Radiation Measurement Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) Investigation
   Experiment field experiment in the Indian Ocean, the National Center for
   Atmospheric Research dual-polarimetric S-and Ka-band radar (S-PolKa)
   radar observed three active Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events.
   These events were separated by suppressed periods characterized by
   shallower, more isolated convection and relatively little rainfall. The
   sensitivity of S-PolKa allowed investigation of the initiation and
   organization of both nonprecipitating and precipitating clouds. Early in
   the suppressed periods, shallow nonprecipitating clouds occurred in
   shear-parallel lines along apparent boundary layer rolls during early
   morning. Once some of the clouds began to precipitate, small cold pools
   formed below the showers. By afternoon, the lines all but disappeared
   with nonprecipitating clouds instead forming along the edges of cold
   pools. All such convection was limited in depth early in suppressed
   periods. As the suppressed environment gained moisture, the
   nonprecipitating clouds were able to grow to larger size, with the
   deepest precipitating clouds occurring in clusters at intersections of
   cold pool boundaries by afternoon. Upscale growth into mesoscale
   convective systems was observed as the suppressed periods transitioned
   into active MJO phases, contributing to overnight precipitation during
   the later part of the suppressed period. This study demonstrates the
   need for models to accurately represent the organization and evolution
   of nonprecipitating clouds in association with boundary layer dynamics
   under suppressed conditions of the MJO, prior to the occurrence of
   precipitating clouds and their cold pools.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Over 350 000 patients are treated in German hospitals for
   sepsis or pneumonia each year. The rate of antibiotic use in hospitals
   is high. The growing problem of drug resistance necessitates a
   reconsideration of antibiotic treatment strategies.
   Methods: Antibiotics were given liberally in the years 2010 and 2011 in
   a German 312-bed hospital. Special training, standardized algorithms to
   prevent unnecessary drug orders, and uniform recommendations were used
   in 2012 and 2013 to lessen antibiotic use. We retrospectively studied
   the hospital's mortality figures and microbiological findings to analyze
   how well these measures worked.
   Results: Antibiotic consumption fell from 67.1 to 51.0 defined daily
   doses (DDD) per 100 patient days (p <0.001) from the period 2010-2011 to
   the period 2012-2013. The mortality of patients with a main diagnosis of
   sepsis fell from 31\% (95/305) to 19\% (63/327; p = 0.001), while that
   of patients with a main diagnosis of pneumonia fell from 12\% (22/178)
   to 6\% (15/235; p = 0.038). The overall mortality fell from 3.0\%
   (623/20 954) to 2.5\% (576/22 719; p = 0.005). In patients with
   nosocomial urinary tract infections with Gram-negative pathogens (not
   necessarily exhibiting three-or fourfold drug resistance), the rate of
   resistance to three or four of the antibiotics tested fell from 11\% to
   5\%.
   Conclusion: Reducing in-hospital antibiotic use is an achievable goal
   and was associated in this study with lower mortality and less drug
   resistance. The findings of this single-center, retrospective study
   encourage a more limited and focused approach to the administration of
   antibiotics.}},

   The advent of nanotechnology has facilitated the introduction of

   the production of this particular filtration medium. In this work,
   antibacterial polypropylene filter medium containing clay particles and
   nano-TiO2 were made using melt electro-spun technology. Antibacterial
   performance of polypropylene nano-filters was evaluated using E. coli
   bacteria. Additionally, filtration efficiency of the samples in terms
   fiber diameter, filter porosity, and fiber distribution using image
   processing technique was determined. Air permeability and dust aerosol
   tests were conducted to establish the suitability of the samples as a
   filter medium. It was concluded that as far as antibacterial property is
   concerned, nanofibers filter media containing clay particles are
   preferential to similar media containing TiO2 nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian cardiomyocytes actively proliferate during embryonic stages,
   following which they exit their cell cycle after birth, and the exit is
   maintained. Previously, we showed that two inhibitory systems (the
   G1-phase inhibitory system: repression of cyclin D1 expression; the
   M-phase inhibitory system: inhibition of CDK1 activation) maintain the
   cell cycle exit of mouse adult cardiomyocytes. We also showed that two
   CDK inhibitors (CKIs), p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1), regulate the cell cycle
   exit in a portion of postnatal cardiomyocytes. It remains unknown
   whether the two inhibitory systems are involved in the cell cycle exit
   of postnatal cardiomyocytes and whether p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) also
   inhibit entry to M-phase. Here, we showed that more than 40\% of
   cardiomyocytes entered an additional cell cycle by induction of cyclin
   D1 expression at postnatal stages, but M-phase entry was inhibited in
   the majority of cardiomyocytes. Marked cell cycle progression and
   endoreplication were observed in cardiomyocytes of p21(Cip1) knockout
   mice at 4 weeks of age. In addition, tri- and tetranucleated
   cardiomyocytes increased significantly in p21(Cip1) knockout mice. These
   data showed that the G1-phase inhibitory system and two CKIs (p21(Cip1)
   and p27(Kip1)) inhibit entry to an additional cell cycle in postnatal
   cardiomyocytes, and that the M-phase inhibitory system and p21(Cip1)
   inhibit M-phase entry of cardiomyocytes which have entered the
   additional cell cycle. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Light scattering in quantum liquid helium-3 may involve a unique
   mechanism - the creation and annihilation of atom excitations across the
   Fermi level. The density of states of particle-hole excitations in the
   low-energy limit is strongly enhanced as compared to that of collective
   excitations of phonons in helium3. This makes possible to directly
   observe Fermi excitations in the resonant Raman scattering (RRS) by He-3
   droplets doped by impurity molecules. The RRS spectra essentially depend
   on the excitation frequency. In case of excitation in the anti-Stokes
   side of absorption the first order RRS is directly determined by the
   particle-hole excitations in the vicinity of the impurity molecule and
   the contribution of phonons mainly given by the localized spherical
   vibration. The calculations are made for a He-3 droplet doped by a
   glyoxal molecule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{When a layer of sand is vertically shaken, the surface spontaneously
   breaks up in a landscape of small conical ``Faraday heaps,{''} which
   merge into larger ones on an ever increasing time scale. We propose a
   model for the heap dynamics and show analytically that the mean lifetime
   of the transient state with N heaps scales as N (2). When there is an
   abundance of sand, such that the vibrating plate always remains
   completely covered, this means that the average diameter of the heaps
   grows as t(1/2). Otherwise, when the sand is less plentiful and parts of
   the plate get depleted during the coarsening process, the average
   diameter of the heaps grows more slowly, namely as t(1/3). This result
   compares well with experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafine ruthenium nanoparticles (NPs) within the mesopores of the
   SBA-15 have been successfully prepared by using a ``double solvents{''}
   method, in which n-hexane is used as a hydrophobic solvent and RuCl3
   aqueous solution is used as a hydrophilic solvent. After the
   impregnation and reduction processes, the samples were characterized by
   XRD, TEM, EDX, XPS, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and ICP techniques. The
   TEM images show that small sized Ru NPs with an average size of 3.0 +/-
   0.8 nm are uniformly dispersed in the mesopores of SBA-15. The
   as-synthesized Ru@SBA-15 nanocomposites (NCs) display exceptional
   catalytic activity for hydrogen generation by the hydrolysis of ammonia
   borane (NH3BH3, AB) and hydrazine borane (N2H4BH3, HB) at room
   temperature with the turnover frequency (TOF) value of 316 and 706 mol
   H-2 (mol Ru min) (1), respectively, relatively high values reported so
   far for the same reaction. The activation energies (Ea) for the
   hydrolysis of AB and HB catalyzed by Ru@SBA-15 NCs are measured to be
   34.8 +/- 2 and 41.3 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Moreover, Ru@SBA-15
   NCs also show satisfied durable stability for the hydrolytic
   dehydrogenation of AB and HB, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the conventional cancer treatment such as radiotherapy,
   chemotherapy and surgical management, nanomedicine-based approaches have
   attracted widespread attention in recent years. In this paper, a
   promising nanocarrier, magnetic nanoparticle clusters (MNCs) as porous
   materials which provided enough room on the surface, was developed for
   loading chemotherapeutic agent of doxorubicin (DOX). Moreover, MNCs are
   a good near-infrared (NIR) photothermal mediator. Thus, MNCs have great
   potential both in photothermal therapy (PTT) and drug delivery for
   chemo-photothermal therapy of cancer. We firstly explored the
   destruction of prostate cancer in vitro by the combination of PTT and
   chemotherapy using DOX@MNCs. Upon NIR irradiation at 808 nm, more cancer
   cells were killed when PC3 cells incubated with DOX@MNCs, owing to both
   MNCs-mediated photothermal ablation and cytotoxicity of light-triggered
   DOX release. Compared with PTT or chemotherapy alone, the
   chemo-photothermal therapy by DOX@MNCs showed a synergistically higher
   therapeutic efficacy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Development of genome-wide InDel markers and their integration with SSR,
   DArT and SNP markers in single barley map}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Development of molecular markers such as SSR (simple
   sequence repeat), DArT (diversity arrays technology) and SNP (single
   nucleotide polymorphism) is fundamental for linkage map construction and
   QTL mapping. However, DArT and SNP genotyping require special tools, and
   detection of SSR polymorphisms requires time-consuming polyacrylamide
   electrophoresis. Furthermore, many markers have been mapped in different
   populations such that their genetic positions are inconsistent.
   Recently, InDel (insertion and deletion) markers have become popular in
   genetic map construction and map-based cloning.
   Results: Aligning genomic DNA sequences in two barley cultivars (Morex
   and Barke) identified 436,640 InDels. We designed 1140 InDel markers
   across the barley genome with an average genetic distance of 1 cM, each
   having a unique location in the barley genome. High-resolution melting
   (HRM) technology was used to genotype 55 InDel markers; those PCR
   amplicons with melting temperature differences >0.3 degrees C were ideal
   for HRM genotyping. The 1140 InDel markers together with 383 SSRs, 3909
   gene-based SNPs and 1544 DArT markers were integrated into single barley
   genetic map according to their physical map positions.
   Conclusions: High-density InDel markers with specific genome locations
   were developed, with 6976 molecular markers (SSRs, DArTs, SNPs and
   InDels) integrated into single barley genetic map. HRM genotyping of the
   InDel markers each with single PCR band will facilitate quick map
   construction and gene fine-mapping.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastomais the most common form of primary brain tumor in adults and
   is essentially incurable. Despite aggressive treatment regimens centered
   on radiotherapy, tumor recurrence is inevitable and is thought to be
   driven by glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSC) that are highly
   radioresistant. DNA damage response pathways are key determinants of
   radiosensitivity but the extent to which these overlapping and parallel
   signaling components contribute to GSC radioresistance is unclear. Using
   a panel of primary patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines, we confirmed
   by clonogenic survival assays that GSCs were significantly more
   radioresistant than paired tumor bulk populations. DNA damage response
   targets ATM, ATR, CHK1, and PARP1 were upregulated in GSCs, and CHK1 was
   preferentially activated following irradiation. Consequently, GSCs
   exhibit rapid G(2)-M cell-cycle checkpoint activation and enhanced DNA
   repair. Inhibition of CHK1 or ATR successfully abrogated G(2)-M
   checkpoint function, leading to increased mitotic catastrophe and a
   modest increase in radiation sensitivity. Inhibition of ATM had dual
   effectsoncell-cycle checkpoint regulation and DNA repair that were
   associated with greater radiosensitizing effects on GSCs than inhibition
   of CHK1, ATR, or PARP alone. Combined inhibition of PARP and ATR
   resulted in a profound radiosensitization of GSCs, which was of greater
   magnitude than in bulk populations and also exceeded the effect of ATM
   inhibition. These data demonstrate that multiple, parallel DNA damage
   signaling pathways contribute to GSC radioresistance and that combined
   inhibition of cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA repair targets provides the
   most effective means to overcome radioresistance of GSC. Cancer (C) 2015

Abstract = {{RATIONALE: Surface-Activated Chemical Ionization/Electrospray Ionization
   mass spectrometry (SACI/ESI-MS) is a technique with high sensitivity and
   low noise that allows accurate biomarker discovery studies. We developed
   a dedicated SACI/ESI software, named SANIST, for both biomarker
   fingerprint data acquisition and as a diagnostic tool, using prostate
   cancer (PCa) as the disease of interest.
   METHODS: Liquid chromatography (LC)/SACI/ESI-MS technology was employed
   to detect a potential biomarker panel for PCa disease prediction. Serum
   from patients with histologically confirmed or negative prostate
   biopsies for PCa was employed. The biomarker data (m/z or Thompson
   value, retention time and extraction mass chromatogram peak area) were
   stored in an ascii database. SANIST software allowed identification of
   potential biomarkers. A Bayesian scoring algorithm developed in house
   allowed sample separation based on comparison with samples in the
   database.
   RESULTS: Biomarker candidates from the carnitine family were detected at
   significantly lower levels in patients showing histologically confirmed
   PCa. Using these biomarkers, the SANIST scoring algorithm allowed
   separation of patients with PCa from biopsy negative subjects with high
   accuracy and sensitivity.
   CONCLUSIONS: SANIST was able to rapidly identify and perform a
   preliminary evaluation of the potential diagnostic efficiency of
   potential biomarkers for PCa. (c) 2015 The Authors. Rapid Communications

Abstract = {{The upwelling at Punta Gallinas in the Guajira Peninsula (Colombian
   Caribbean) was studied from the point of view of the Mathematical
   Morphology using 10 years of monthly composite MODIS-SST imagery. Among
   all the morphological operators, the skeleton is widely used to compute
   the axis of the of the SST fields for the observed upwelling events. The
   skeleton is characterized by means of the Geometrical Theory of
   Measurement using the fractal dimension. The upwelling in the area is
   driven by the dynamic of the ITCZ (InterTropical Convergence Zone) and
   the relationship between the area and the East-West component of the
   trade winds has a lag of about 4 months. It has been found that the
   fractal dimension of the skeleton and the area of the upwelling are
   related. Some relationship was found between the fractal dimension of
   the skeleton (its complexity) and the Southern Oscillation Index by
   means of linear regression and cross-spectral analysis finding coherent
   energy at 1 year, 6 months and in the low frequency band. Finally, a
   sensitivity analysis between fractal dimension and threshold. SST points
   out to take an extreme care at the time of fixing the last one. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Vasopressin (VP) stimulates a signaling cascade that results in
   phosphorylation and apical membrane accumulation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2),
   leading to water reabsorption by kidney collecting ducts. However, the
   roles of most C-terminal phosphorylation events in stimulated and
   constitutive AQP2 recycling are incompletely understood. Here, we
   generated LLC-PK1 cells containing point mutations of all potential
   phosphorylation sites in the AQP2 C terminus: S226, S229, T244, S256,
   S261, S264, and S269, to determine their impact on AQP2 trafficking. We
   produced an All Null AQP2 construct in which these serine (S) or
   threonine (T) residues were mutated to alanine (A) or glycine (G), and
   we then reintroduced the phosphorylation mimic aspartic acid (D)
   individually to each site in the All Null mutant. As expected, the All
   Null mutant does not accumulate at the plasma membrane in response to VP
   but still undergoes constitutive recycling, as shown by its membrane
   accumulation when endocytosis is blocked by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M
   beta CD), and accumulation in a perinuclear patch at low temperature (20
   degrees C). Single phosphorylation mimics S226D, S229D, T244D, S261D,
   S264D, and S269D were insufficient to cause membrane accumulation of
   AQP2 alone or after VP treatment. However, AQP2 S256 reintroduced into
   the All Null mutant maintains its trafficking response to VP. We
   conclude that 1) constitutive recycling of AQP2 does not require
   phosphorylation at any C-terminal sites; 2) forced ``phosphorylation{''}
   of sites in the AQP2 C terminus is insufficient to stimulate membrane
   accumulation in the absence of S256 phosphorylation; and 3)
   phosphorylation of S256 alone is necessary and sufficient to cause
   membrane accumulation of AQP2.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{Construction and maintenance of roads require a large volume of
   aggregates for use in base, sub-base and surface layers. At the same
   time, the expansion of asphalt roadways results in the production of a
   large amount of asphalt road waste, known as reclaimed asphalt pavement
   (RAP). This paper aims to investigate the feasibility of the use of
   copper slag and recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) as substitutes for
   virgin aggregates in modifying the gradation of cold recycled mixes made
   with RAP material. In addition, the effects of three types of additives
   including Portland cement, fly ash, and rice husk ash on the properties
   of recycled mixtures were investigated. Marshall, Indirect tensile
   strength, resilient modulus, moisture susceptibility, and dynamic creep
   tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of the mixes.
   Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure was used to assess the
   environmental impacts of copper slag. The use of copper slag had better
   results than limestone and RCA probably due to better interlocking and
   superior physical and mechanical properties. With regard to the effects
   of additives, Portland cement was found to be the most effective
   additive. The difference between fly ash and rice husk ash was found to
   be statistically insignificant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An automated exploration of datapath for power-delay tradeoff in high
   level synthesis (HLS) driven by bacterial foraging optimization
   algorithm (BFOA) is proposed in this paper. The proposed exploration
   approach is simulated to operate in the feasible temperature range of an
   actual Escherichin coil (E. coli) bacterium in order to mimic its
   biological lifecycle. The proposed work transforms a regular BFOA into
   an adaptive DSE framework that is capable to explore power-performance
   tradeoffs during HLS. The key sub-contributions of the proposed
   methodology are as follows: (a) Novel chemotaxis driven exploration
   drift algorithm; (b) Novel multidimensional bacterium encoding scheme to
   handle the DSE problem; (c) A novel replication algorithm customized to
   the DSE problem for manipulating the position of the bacterium by
   keeping the resource information constant (useful for inducing
   exploitative ability in the algorithm): (d) A novel
   elimination-dispersal (ED) algorithm to introduce diversity during the
   exploration process; (e) Adaptive mechanisms such as resource clamping
   and step size clamping to handle boundary outreach problem during
   exploration. Finally, results indicated an average improvement in QoR of
   35\% and reduction in runtime of 4\% compared to recent approaches. (C)

Abstract = {{A comprehensive thermodynamic model based on electrolyte non-random
   two-liquid (eNRTL) equation is developed for aqueous Na+-K+-Cl--SO42-
   quaternary system. To account for the composition dependence of the
   solution nonideality, the eNRTL model requires two binary interaction
   parameters for each of the four electrolyte-water and four
   electrolyte-electrolyte pairs. We obtain the eNRTL binary parameters for
   (K+SO42-):H2O pair, (K+SO42-):(Ne+SO42-) pair and (K+ Cl-):(K+ SO42-)
   pair by regressing literature data. The eNRTL binary parameters for the
   other electrolyte-water and electrolyte-electrolyte pairs are retrieved
   from the literature. To account for the temperature dependence, each of
   the eNRTL binary parameter is correlated with a Gibbs-Helmholtz type
   expression with up to three temperature coefficients. The eNRTL model
   accurately represents various thermodynamic properties of the aqueous
   quaternary system and its subsystems with temperatures up to 473.15 K
   and electrolyte concentrations up to saturation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The spinel oxide Co2.25Fe0.75O4 has been prepared by co-precipitation
   route. The as prepared material has been annealed at 800 degrees C under
   vacuum. Properties of the samples annealed under vacuum have been
   compared with the sample annealed in air. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction,
   Raman spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy
   have been used for structural phase characterization. The cubic spinel
   structure in air annealed sample has been splitted into Co and Fe rich
   phases. The Co rich spinel phase has transformed into Cobalt monoxide
   (CoO) after vacuum annealing. This has resulted an increase of Fe: Co
   ratio in the Fe rich spinel phase. Raman spectra indicated a
   transformation of the distribution of Co and Fe ions from normal spinel
   like structure for the sample annealed in air to mixed spinel structure
   for the samples annealed under vacuum. The existence tetravalent Fe4+
   ion has been confirmed in all the samples and it is new information for
   Co doped spinel ferrite system. All the samples exhibited ferrimagnetic
   behavior and exchange bias effect. The focus point is that vacuum
   annealing has been used as an effective route of material processing to
   control the structural phase and also, enhancement of magnetic
   properties in Co rich ferrite. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The ubiquity of resilience-the process of patterned adjustments adopted
   by a society or an individual in the face of endogenous or exogenous
   shocks-across the broad social sciences spectrum is undisputable. Yet,
   migration scholars have been relatively absent from this vibrant
   discussion. The present article suggests a theorisation of the link
   between migration, resilience and security by examining ways in which
   resilience precedes a socially constructed understanding of
   international migration as a security issue. The article explores how
   the surge in worldwide refugee numbers and associated mass migration
   phenomena were not only interpreted as a shock in post-Cold War France,
   but also instrumentalised by dominant discourses to underscore the
   necessity of adopting a particular pattern of adjustments to uphold the
   status quo against changes provoked by these migratory events. The
   social construction of refugee movements and mass migration as a
   significant disturbance requiring France to opt for a resilient strategy
   has led, ultimately, to the securitisation of migration. In a broader
   sense, the article presents a new lens through which to analyse
   situations and conditions in which resilience has led to and induced the
   securitisation of migration.}},

Abstract = {{The development of the mammalian brain requires the generation,
   migration, and differentiation of neurons, cellular processes that are
   dependent on a dynamic microtubule cytoskeleton. Mutations in tubulin
   genes, which encode for the structural subunits of microtubules, cause
   detrimental neurological disorders known as the tubulinopathies. The
   disease spectra associated with different tubulin genes are overlapping
   but distinct, an observation believed to reflect functional
   specification of this multigene family. Perturbation of the -tubulin
   TUBB2B is known to cause polymicrogyria, pachygyria, microcephaly, and
   axon guidance defects. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the
   expression pattern of its murine homolog Tubb2b. The generation and
   characterization of BAC-transgenic eGFP reporter mouse lines has
   revealed that it is highly expressed in progenitors and postmitotic
   neurons during cortical development. This contrasts with the 8-week-old
   cortex, in which Tubb2b expression is restricted to macroglia, and
   expression is almost completely absent in mature neurons. This
   developmental transition in neurons is mirrored in the adult hippocampus
   and the cerebellum but is not a universal feature of Tubb2b; its
   expression persists in a population of postmitotic neurons in the
   8-week-old retina. We propose that the dynamic spatial and temporal
   expression of Tubb2b reflects specific functional requirements of the
   microtubule cytoskeleton. J. Comp. Neurol. 523:2161-2186, 2015. (c) 2015

   Improving the accuracy of model predictions of structural parameter}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates a more accurate method for calculating structural
   parameter (S) of asymmetric osmotic membranes using experimental data
   and a theoretical flux model which encapsulates all significant boundary
   layer phenomena. External boundary layer effects on the porous side of
   the membrane have been neglected in many current models. In these
   models, external concentration polarization (ECP) effects get combined
   with internal concentration polarization (ICP), resulting in inflated S
   values. In this study, we proposed a mathematical flux model in which
   ECP effects are accounted for, so that S can be more accurately
   measured. This model considered the in-series resistances for solute
   transport based on intrinsic properties of the membrane, as well as
   boundary layers at membrane surfaces and within the support layer. We
   therefore introduced new equations to define total resistance to solute
   transport and reflection coefficient of membranes in FO. The results
   indicate that ICP is less severe than previously predicted and that
   cross-flow velocity, temperature and concentration of the draw and the
   feed solutions impact both external and internal concentration
   polarization. Our calculations surprisingly show that changes in
   cross-flow velocity impact internal concentration polarization due to
   induced mixing within the support layer. Also, we suggest that it is
   critical to consider the ``residence time{''} of solutes in the vicinity
   of the selective layer when determining the membrane selectivity. (C)

Abstract = {{Acoculco is a geothermal prospective area hosted by a volcanic caldera
   complex in the eastern Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Surface
   manifestations are scarce and consist of gas discharges (CO2-rich) and
   acid-sulfate springs of low temperature, whereas hydrothermal explosive
   activity is profusely manifested by meter-scale craters and mounds of
   hydrothermal debris and breccias. Silicic alteration extends for several
   square kilometers around the zone with gas manifestations and explosive
   features, affecting surficial volcanic rocks, primarily tuffs and
   breccias. In the subsurface, an argillic alteration zone (ammonium
   illite) extends down to a depth of similar to 600 m, and underneath it a
   propylitic zone (epidote-calcite-chlorite) occurs down to similar to
   1000 m.
   Thermal logs from an exploratory borehole (EAC-1, drilled in 1995 down
   to 1810 m) showed a conductive heat transfer regime under high
   geothermal gradient (similar to 140 degrees C/1000 m). In contrast, the
   thermal profile established from temperatures of homogenization of fluid
   inclusions measured on core samples from the same drill hole-suggests
   that convection occurred in the past through the upper similar to 1400 m
   of the geothermal system. A drop in permeability due to the
   precipitation of alteration minerals would have triggered the cessation
   of the convective heat transfer regime to give place to a conductive
   one. With the purpose of determining when the transition of heat
   transfer regime occurred, we developed a 1D model that simulates the
   time-depth distribution of temperature. According to our numerical
   simulations, this transition happened ca. 7000 years ago; this date is
   very recent compared to the lifespan of the geothermal system. In
   addition, radiocarbon chronology indicates that the hydrothermal
   explosive activity postdates the end of the convective heat transfer
   regime, having dated at least three explosive events, at 4867-5295,
   1049-1417 and 543-709 y cal. BP. Therefore, hydrothermal explosions
   arise from the self-sealing of the Acoculco geothermal system, involving
   a natural hazard that could affect future geothermal-power
   infrastructure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cu(In, Al)Se-2 (CIAS) thin films were synthesized by selenization of
   stacked metallic precursors for different times ranging from 5 to 30
   min. Compositional study demonstrates that the Se content in the CIAS
   thin films is significantly dependent on the selenization time. Both
   X-ray diffraction and Raman analysis reveal that the selenization time
   drives structural phase transition from coexisting phases of CuInSe2 and
   CIAS to single CIAS phase. The insufficient selenization time during the
   grain growth process would induce the formation of impurity phase and
   structural defects in CIAS films. Morphological studies further indicate
   a gradual transition from the coarse surface containing scattered
   micron-sized particles to the relatively smooth and compact morphology
   as the selenization time increases. The solar cell device with the CIAS
   absorber selenized for 20 min achieves the highest open circuit voltage
   of 487 mV. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The peripartal period in Holstein dairy cows is critical, due to the
   transition from pregnancy to lactation. We have studied the dynamics of
   biochemical parameters from day 5 before to day 60 after calving. The
   study included 10 multiparous Holstein cows, examined at days -5, 5, 10,
   30 and 60 relative to calving. Blood samples were taken from vena
   jugularis. Analyzed biochemical parameters were glucose, triglycerides,
   total cholesterol, total bilirubin, albumin, total protein, urea, NEFA
   and BHBA. Milk production and body condition score were also estimated.
   Obtained results showed that cows were exposed to mild to marked
   metabolic distress. Energy status was changed due to increased values of
   NEFA and BHBA and decreased value of glucose after calving. Protein
   concentrations were increased at day 10 after calving, despite the
   decrease of the level of albumin. Urea concentrations before and after
   calving were within physiological range indicating an optimal protein
   diet. Increased values of total bilirubin at day 5 after calving
   indicated liver increased activity. Lipid status presented by
   triglycerides and total cholesterol revealed no differences in blood
   concentrations. Milk production was highest at day 30 after calving. BCS
   were highest in dry cows, thereafter they declined and recovered at day
   60 after calving.
   In conclusion, biochemical parameters can be used as relevant indicators
   of metabolic distress in cows around calving with milk and BCS recording
   as aside parameters. Changes in some biochemical parameters indicate
   liver increased activity and metabolic stress, that could lead to
   decreased milk production, impaired reproductive performance and,
   finally, to illness.}},

Title = {{Separation of CO2 from humidified ternary gas mixtures using thermally
   rearranged polymeric membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{492}},
Pages = {{257-262}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The recently developed thermally rearranged (TR) polymeric membranes
   displayed superior gas separation properties over conventional polymeric
   membranes, owing to the presence of micro-pores appropriately tuned in
   cavities size and distribution, thus offering great advantages in gas
   separation applications, especially in CO2 capture from post-combustion
   flue gas streams.
   In this work, the transport properties (flux, permeance and selectivity)
   of TR polymeric hollow fiber membranes were evaluated with both single
   gases (CO2, N-2, O-2) and ternary gas mixture (CO2:N-2: O-2=15:80:5) at
   different temperatures (25, 50, 75 degrees C) and trans-membrane
   pressure differences (2-5 bar). The results revealed that the CO2
   permeance measured under the mixed-gas condition remained the same as
   the single gas CO2 permeance, while the permeances of other gases
   decreased, thus leading to a favored increase in selectivity.
   The effect of water vapor in a ternary gas mixture was studied for the
   first time, considering that most of the streams of interest contain
   large amount of water. The presence of water vapor induced a significant
   permeance decrease for all the three components and a negligible
   reduction in selectivity. Globally the membranes showed good performance
   in the whole range of operating conditions investigated. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Smad proteins are important intracellular mediators of TGF-beta
   signalling, which transmit signals directly from cell surface receptors
   to the nucleus. The MH1 domain of Smad plays a key role in DNA
   recognition. Two types of DNA sequence were identified as Smad binding
   motifs: the Smad binding element (SBE) and the GC-rich sequence. Here we
   report the first crystal structure of the Smad5 MH1 domain in complex
   with the GC-rich sequence. Compared with the Smad5-MH1/SBE complex
   structure, the Smad5 MH1 domain contacts the GC-rich site with the same
   beta-hairpin, but the detailed interaction modes are different.
   Conserved beta-hairpin residues make base specific contacts with the
   minimal GC-rich site, 5'-GGC-3'. The assembly of Smad5-MH1 on the
   GC-rich DNA also results in distinct DNA conformational changes.
   Moreover, the crystal structure of Smad5-MH1 in complex with a composite
   DNA sequence demonstrates that the MH1 domain is targeted to each
   binding site (GC-rich or SBE) with modular binding modes, and the length
   of the DNA spacer affects the MH1 assembly. In conclusion, our work
   provides the structural basis for the recognition and binding
   specificity of the Smad MH1 domain with the DNA targets.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine prevalence and clinical
   implications of subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD) detected by
   coronary artery calcium score (CACS) testing in patients with atrial
   fibrillation (AF). CACS was assessed in patients without history of CAD
   undergoing catheter ablation of AF. Age- and gender-matched patients
   with. normal sinus rhythm (NSR) presenting with chest pain served as
   controls. Predicted arterial age using the Multi-Ethnic Study of
   Atherosclerosis registry was also compared to the chronologic age. A
   total of 860 patients (430 AF and 430 NSR, age 63 +/- 10 years, 65\%
   men) were included. Subclinical CAD prevalence (CACS >0) was 74\% (319
   of 430) in the AF group. Compared to the patients with NSR, patients
   with AF had higher prevalence of Subclinical CAD (74\% vs 63\%; p
   <0.001). In multivariate analysis, AF was independently associated with
   Subclinical CAD (hazard ratio 1.60; p = 0.002) but only with persistent
   AF (hazard ratio 2.28; p <0.001). Predicted arterial age was greater
   than chronologic age in patients with AF (69 +/- 12 vs 64 +/- 9 years).
   CACS-diagnosed subclinical CAD identified new potential candidates for
   statin therapy (12\%; 33 of 267) and for oral anticoagulation (19\%; 40
   of 206) by addition of subclinical CAD to the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores.
   In conclusion, in patients without known history of CAD, prevalence of
   subclinical CAD was significantly. higher in those with persistent AF
   than those with NSR. AF was associated with subclinical CAD
   independently and complimentarily to clinical risk factors. Identifying
   subclinical CAD has potential clinical indications for prevention of CAD
   progression and stroke. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a version of directed bond percolation on the honeycomb

Title = {{Oleanolic acid attenuates obstructive cholestasis in bile duct-ligated

Abstract = {{Obstructive cholestasis is characterized by impairment of hepatic
   canalicular bile efflux and there are no clinically effective drugs to
   cure except surgeries. Previously we revealed that oleanolic acid (OA)
   protected against lithocholic acid (LCA)-induced intrahepatic
   cholestasis in mice. Cholestasis caused by LCA is characterized by
   segmental bile duct obstruction, whether OA possesses the beneficial
   effect on completed obstructive cholestasis induced by bile duct
   ligation (BDL) remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that
   BDL-induced mice liver pathological change, and increase in serum levels
   of ALT, AST and ALP were all significantly reduced by OA (20 mg/kg,
   i.p.). Meanwhile, OA also lowered total bilirubin and total bile acids
   levels in serum, as well as total bile acids level in liver, in
   contrast, urinary total bile acids output was remarkably up-regulated by
   OA. Gene expression analysis showed that OA caused significant increased
   mRNA expression of MRP3 and MRP4 located at hepatic basolateral
   membrane, and restoration of MRP2 and BSEP located at hepatic
   cannalicular membrane. Furthermore, significant NRF2 protein
   accumulation in nucleus was also observed in OA treated mice. In mice
   primary cultured hepatocytes, the effects of OA on MRP2, MRP3 and MRP4
   expression were directly proved to be mediated via NRF2 activation, and
   BSEP downregulation induced by OA was in part due to FXR antagonism.
   Luciferase assay performed in Hep G2 cells also illustrated that OA was
   a partial FXR antagonist. Taken together, we conclude that OA attenuates
   obstructive cholestasis in BDL mice, possibly via activation of
   NRF2-MRPs and FXR antagonism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The anti-angiogenic action of 2-deoxyglucose involves attenuation of
   VEGFR2 signaling and MMP-2 expression in HUVECs}},
Journal = {{LIFE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{52-61}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Aims: 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) is a glucose analogue and has been shown to
   inhibit angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
   (HUVECs) through interference with N-linked glycosylation. However, the
   anti-angiogenic mechanisms of 2-DG are not fully elucidated.
   Main methods: We first employed an ex vivo rat aortic ring model to
   substantiate the anti-angiogenic action of 2-DG and then used HUVECs to
   investigate the molecular mechanism underlying such an action.
   Key findings: Results reveal that 2-DG (0.05-1.0 mM) significantly
   inhibited tube formation in both rat aortic rings and HUVECs. 2-DG
   (0.1-1.0 mM) also significantly inhibited cell invasion and migration,
   as well as the activity and mRNA and protein expression of matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in HUVECs. In addition, 2-DG (1.0 mM)
   significantly inhibited mRNA and protein expression of vascular
   endothelial growth receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in a time-dependent manner. 2-DG
   also significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of the focal adhesion
   kinase (FAK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38), the downstream
   molecules of VEGFR2. The effects of 2-DG on tube formation, MMP-2
   activity, and VEGFR2 protein expression in HUVECs were reversed by
   mannose, an N-linked glycosylation precursor. Mannose also reversed
   2-DG-induced accumulation of VEGFR2 in the endoplasmic reticulum.
   Significance: This ex vivo and in vitro study demonstrates that 2-DG
   inhibits angiogenesis with an action involving attenuation of VEGFR2
   signaling and MMP-2 expression, possibly resulting from interference
   with N-linked glycosylation of VEGFR2. Further studies are needed to
   show that 2-DG inhibits VEGF-mediated angiogenesis or that the actual
   status of N-glycosylation of VEGFR2 is affected by the treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{Perovskite Pb1-xLax(Zr0.9Ti0.1)(1-x)/O-4(3) dense ceramics (relative
   density of 93-97\%) with compositions across the

   0.032, 0.033, 0.035, 0.380, 0.040 mol.) were prepared by solid state
   reaction. The effect of La3+ content on the structural, microstructural
   characteristics and room temperature functional properties
   (piezoelectric and dielectric properties) of the PLZT ceramics was
   studied. The increasing of La3+ doping amount result in a slight
   decrease of ceramic grain size from 5 m to 1 m, for the same calcination
   and sintering parameters. The structural study evidences the formation
   of perovskite single-phase with rhombohedral to orthorhombic symmetry
   across the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric boundary. A superposition of
   both symmetries in the compositional range of (0.025-0.033) is
   demonstrated by the evolution of relative intensities I(11 - 1)/I(111)
   and I(0 01)/I(10 0) splitted peaks, characteristic to rhombohedral and
   orthorhombic symmetries, respectively. The room temperature permittivity
   has a maximum for x = 0.03, while the piezoelectric constants show
   anomalies in the range of compositions x = (0.03, 0.035). These
   anomalies may be related to the phase superposition range. Polarisation
   vs. electric field dependence as well as the structural calculations
   demonstrate that these compositions transit from ferroelectric to
   antiferroelectric phases, with a stabilisation of the antiferroelectric
   phase at higher La3+ content. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Asthma is a common inflammatory disease of airways that is often
   associated with type 2 responses triggered by allergens, such as house
   dust mites (HDMs). IL-25 is a key mucosal cytokine that may be produced
   by stressed epithelial cells; it rapidly activates type 2 innate
   lymphoid cells to produce IL-13 and IL-5. When administered directly
   into lungs, IL-25 induces acute inflammation. However, the mechanisms
   underlying IL-25-initiated inflammation and the roles of this cytokine
   in the context of HDM-induced allergic inflammation are not fully
   understood. We show in this article that lung-resident conventional
   dendritic cells were direct targets of IL-25. IL-25-stimulated dendritic
   cells rapidly induced mediators, such as the chemokine CCL17, which, in
   turn, attracted IL-9-producing T cells. Importantly, these mechanisms
   also operated during HDM-induced allergic lung inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium caseinate-based edible/biodegradable films containing lysozyme
   were prepared directly by extrusion processes to obtain antimicrobial
   films. Thermoplastic pellets containing I\% (w/w) lysozyme were blown by
   an industrial-like blown-film-extruder to obtain thermoplastic thin
   films. Lysozyme stability depended mainly on processing temperature and
   glycerol content. A correct choice of these parameters allowed obtaining
   pellets and films with 40.8 +/- 0.5\% and 26.4 +/- 0.6\% lysozyme
   residual activity, respectively. Whatever the storage temperature (-20
   degrees C or room temperature), lysozyme activity of pellets remained
   constant for at least 5 weeks of storage. Antimicrobial activity against
   Micrococcus luteus was assayed in Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB): no
   bacterial growth was observed for 25 h at 37 degrees C in the presence
   of 0.05 g.L-1 pellets, while a 2.4 log increase of bacterial population
   was observed in the presence of control pellets without lysozyme.
   Traditional properties of films such as their water sorption and
   mechanical properties were also investigated and proved that addition of
   lysozyme at a 1\% concentration did not affect these properties as well
   as their ultimate aerobic biodegradability. The application potential of
   such edible antimicrobial films is discussed in relation with these
   properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Muscleblind-like 1 is required for normal heart valve development in
   vivo}},
Journal = {{BMC DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Development of the valves and septa of the heart depends on
   the formation and remodeling of the endocardial cushions in the
   atrioventricular canal and outflow tract. These cushions are populated
   by mesenchyme produced from the endocardium by epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT). The endocardial cushions are remodeled into the valves
   at post-EMT stages via differentiation of the mesenchyme and changes in
   the extracellular matrix (ECM). Transforming growth factor beta (TGF
   beta) signaling has been implicated in both the induction of EMT in the
   endocardial cushions and the remodeling of the valves at post-EMT
   stages. We previously identified the RNA binding protein
   muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) as a negative regulator of TGF beta signaling
   and EMT in chicken endocardial cushions ex vivo. Here, we investigate
   the role of MBNL1 in endocardial cushion development and valvulogenesis
   in Mbnl1(Delta E3/Delta E3) mice, which are null for MBNL1 protein.
   Methods: Collagen gel invasion assays, histology, immunohistochemistry,
   real-time RT-PCR, optical coherence tomography, and echocardiography
   were used to evaluate EMT and TGF beta signaling in the endocardial
   cushions, and morphogenesis, ECM composition, and function of the heart
   valves.
   Results: As in chicken, the loss of MBNL1 promotes precocious TGF beta
   signaling and EMT in the endocardial cushions. Surprisingly, this does
   not lead to the production of excess mesenchyme, but later valve
   morphogenesis is aberrant. Adult Mbnl1(Delta E3/Delta E3) mice exhibit
   valve dysmorphia with elevated TGF beta signaling, changes in ECM
   composition, and increased pigmentation. This is accompanied by a high
   incidence of regurgitation across both inflow and outflow valves.
   Mbnl1(Delta E3/Delta E3) mice also have a high incidence of ostium
   secundum septal defects accompanied by atrial communication, but do not
   develop overt cardiomyopathy.
   Conclusions: Together, these data indicate that MBNL1 plays a conserved
   role in negatively regulating TGF beta signaling, and is required for
   normal valve morphogenesis and homeostasis in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Epibrassinolide (EBR), a steroid-derived plant growth regulator, has
   been recently suggested as an apoptotic inducer in different cancer
   cells. In this experimental study, we investigated the potential
   apoptotic effect of EBR on stress-related and survival signaling
   molecules in colon carcinoma cells. EBR decreased cell viability and
   colony formation in HCT 116 and HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. The
   inactivation of PI3K/AKT by EBR treatment led to upregulation of Foxo3a,
   which in turn induced apoptosis in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells. In addition,
   the upstream non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase Src was found elevated
   allowing to the upregulation of p38, stress-activated protein kinase/Jun
   amino-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and
   their target genes c-jun, c-fos and c-myc in a time-dependent manner in
   HCT 116 cells within 48 h. The alterations in PA metabolism caused
   intracellular PA pool decrease. The upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bak,
   Bax, Puma and Bim were accompanied with the decrease in Mcl-1 in HCT 116
   and Bcl-x(L), expression profiles in HT-29 following 48 h EBR treatment.
   We suggest that the upregulation of Bim expression levels might be
   related with one of the PI3K/AKT target transcription factor Foxo3a,
   which was dephosphorylated by EBR treatment in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells.

Abstract = {{The effect of culinary treatments on the fatty acid profile, mercury
   (Hg), and methylmercury (MeHg) levels of salmon was studied. The
   bioaccessibility of fatty acids, Hg, and MeHg in raw and grilled salmon
   was determined. The most intense thermal treatment (grilling) did not
   alter the relative fatty acid (FA) profile. There were bioaccessibility
   differences between FAs. To the authors' knowledge, for the first time,
   higher bioaccessibility of the long-chain FAs than the short- and
   medium-chain FM was measured. Chemical interaction phenomena seemed to
   play a role. On the other hand, higher levels of unsaturation decreased
   bioaccessibility. Two main alternative hypotheses were put forward,
   either lower polarity led to higher incorporation of FAs with longer
   hydrophobic aliphatic chain and lower number of double bonds in the
   emulsion present in the bioaccessible fraction or enzymatic selectivity
   preferentially hydrolyzed some FAs on the basis of their structure or
   position in the triacylglycerol molecule. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Pharmacological synergism has been used to obtain a higher efficacy
   using drug concentrations at which side effects are minimal. In this
   study, the pharmacological antinociceptive interaction between
   N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and tramadol was investigated. The
   individual concentration-response curves for PEA (0.1-56.2 mu g/paw) and
   tramadol (1-56.2 mu g/paw) were evaluated in mice in which nociception
   was induced by an intraplantar injection of 2\% formalin. Isobolographic
   analysis was used to evaluate the pharmacological interaction between
   PEA (EC50=23.7 +/- 1.6 mu g/paw) and tramadol (EC50 = 26.02 +/- 2.96 mu
   g/paw) using the EC50 and a fixed 1:1 ratio combination. The isobologram
   demonstrated that the combinations investigated in this study produced a
   synergistic interaction; the experimental values (Z(exp)=9.5 +/- 0.2 mu
   g/paw) were significantly smaller than those calculated theoretically
   (Z(add) = 24.8 +/- 0.2 mu g/paw). The antinociceptive mechanisms of the
   PEA and tramadol combination involved the opioid receptor, transient
   receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), and
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). The
   sedative effect of the combination of PEA and tramadol was less than
   that generated by individual treatments. These findings suggest that the
   PEA and tramadol combination produced enhanced antinociceptive efficacy
   at concentrations at which side effects are minimal. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   include 4-nitrophenol I, 4-nitrobenzoic acid II, benzene-1,3-diol III,
   and 2,4-dinitrophenol IV were synthesized to follow the factors
   influencing the formation of polar crystals. New solids were
   characterized by melting points and absorption spectra, while their
   structures were proven by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Adducts
   differ by the components' ratio and position of the acidic hydrogen
   atom, thus giving examples of four new cocrystals and one salt. The
   single crystal X-ray analysis revealed the acentric packing for two
   compounds, 1 (I) and 3(3) (III) that crystallize in the Pca2(1) and P1
   space groups. The melting point data and the cut-off wavelength from
   absorption spectra show that these materials are stable till relatively
   high temperatures and transparent in a wide range of spectrum. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Null mutations of the Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) gene cause NPC
   disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by cholesterol
   accumulation in late endosomes (LE) and lysosomes (Ly). Nascent
   ormutated NPC1 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but
   how NPC1 degradation is regulated remains currently unknown. In the
   present study, we demonstrated a link between NPC1 degradation and the
   Akt (protein kinase B)/mTOR {[}mammalian (or mechanistic) target of
   rapamycin] signalling pathway in cervical cancer cell lines. We provided
   evidence that activated Akt/mTOR pathway increased NPC1 degradation by
   similar to 50\% in C33A cells when compared with SiHa or HeLa cells.
   NPC1 degradation in C33A cells was reversed when Akt/mTOR activation was
   blocked by specific inhibitors or when mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) was
   disrupted by regulatory associated protein of mTOR ( Raptor) knockdown.
   Importantly, inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway led to decreased NPC1
   ubiquitination in C33A cells, pointing to a role of Akt/mTOR in the
   proteasomal degradation of NPC1. Moreover, we found that NPC1 depletion
   in several cancer cell lines inhibited cell proliferation and migration.
   Our results uncover Akt as a key regulator of NPC1 degradation and link
   NPC1 to cancer cell proliferation and migration.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, we report on the structure and optical properties
   of non-annealed nickel oxides (NiO) nanocrystalline semiconductor thin

   extracted from the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) spectra and shows that
   the as-deposited films crystallize in the form of cubic NaCl structure
   with average lattice constant equal to 4.1797 angstrom and average
   lattice volume 73.018 (angstrom)(3). In addition, the crystallite size
   (D) is found to increase from 15 nm to 24 nm with increasing film
   thickness from 151 nm to 343 nm. In a wide wavelength range, the optical
   parameters (absorption coefficient, refractive index and refractive
   index dispersion) of the nanocrystalline NiO thin films have been
   calculated from transmission and reflection spectra. The variation of
   the factors (alpha h nu)(2) and (alpha h nu)(0.5) as a function of
   photon energy identifying the optical transitions as direct transition
   with energy E-g(dir) approximate to 3.849 eV and indirect transition
   with energy E-g(indir) approximate to 2.924 eV and phonon energy of

   of the refractive index show normal dispersion behavior with single
   oscillator model E-o and E-d parameters obtained as 3.082 eV and 10.47
   eV, respectively. The coordination number of the NiO nanocrystalline

Abstract = {{We derive approximate expressions for the average number of diffusive
   impacts/hits of nanoparticles on microdisc and microwire electrodes for
   the case where the impact leads to the loss of the nanoparticles from
   solution either via irreversible adsorption or complete
   electro-dissolution. The theory can also be applied to sub-micrometre
   size electrodes (nano-electrodes). The resulting equations can be
   utilised to analyse the number of impacts and its variance in the
   `nano-impact' experiment We also provide analytical expressions for the
   first passage time of an impact for dilute nanoparticle solutions in the
   continuum limit of Fickian diffusion. The expressions for the first
   passage times are used to estimate the lower limit of detection in
   ultra-dilute nanoparticle solutions for typical nano-impact experiments,
   and show the advantage of using microwire electrodes in ultra-dilute
   solutions or solutions containing larger nano-particles. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Germanium (Ge) and Silicon (Si) exhibit similar geochemical behavior in
   marine environments but are variably enriched in seafloor hydrothermal
   fluids relative to seawater. In this study, Ge isotope and Ge/Si ratio
   systematics were investigated in low temperature hydrothermal vents from
   Loihi Seamount (Pacific Ocean, 18 degrees 54'N, 155 degrees 15'W) and
   results were compared to high-temperature vents from the East Pacific
   Rise (EPR) at 9 degrees 50 ` N. Loihi offers the opportunity to
   understand contrasting Ge and Si behavior in low temperature seafloor
   hydrothermal systems characterized by abundant Fe oxyhydroxide
   deposition at the seafloor. The results show that both Ge/Si and delta
   Ge-74/70 in hydrothermal fluids are fractionated relative to the
   basaltic host rocks. The enrichment in Ge vs. Si relative to fresh
   basalts, together with Ge isotope fractionation (Delta
   Ge-74/70(fluid-basalt) up to 1.15 parts per thousand at EPR 9 degrees
   50'N and 1.64 parts per thousand at Loihi) are best explained by the
   precipitation of minerals (e.g. quartz and Fe-sulfides) during higher
   temperature seawater-rock reactions in the subsurface. The study of
   Fe-rich hydrothermal deposits at Loihi, largely composed of
   Fe-oxyhydroxides, shows that Ge isotopes are also fractionated upon
   mineral precipitation at the seafloor. We obtained an average Ge isotope
   fractionation factor between Fe-oxyhydroxide (ferrihydrite) and
   dissolved Ge in the fluid of -2.0 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand (2sd), and
   a maximum value of -3.6 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand (2sd), which is
   consistent with recent theoretical and experimental studies. The study
   of a hydrothermal chimney at Bio 9 vent at EPR 9 degrees 50'N also
   demonstrates that Ge isotopes are fractionated by approximately -5.6 +/-
   0.6 parts per thousand (2sd) during precipitation of metal sulfides
   under hydrothermal conditions. Using combined Ge/Si and estimated Ge
   isotope signatures of Ge sinks and sources in seawater, we propose a
   preliminary oceanic budget of Ge which reveals that an important sink,
   referred as the ``missing Ge sink{''}, may correspond to Ge
   sequestration into authigenic Fe-oxyhydroxides in marine sediments. This
   study shows that combining Ge/Si and delta(74/70) Ge systematics
   provides a useful tool to trace hydrothermal Ge and Si sources in marine
   environments and to understand formation processes of seafloor
   hydrothermal deposits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The residential sector represents some 30\% of global electricity
   consumption but the underlying composition and drivers are still only
   poorly understood. The drivers are many, varied, and complex, including
   local climate, household demographics, household behaviour, building
   stock and the type and number of appliances. There is considerable
   variation across households and, until recently, often a lack of good
   data. This study draws upon a detailed household dataset from the
   Australian Smart Grid Smart City project to build a household
   electricity consumption model. A statistical linear regression model for
   household energy demand was established and tested for both individual
   households and regional aggregations of households. The model showed
   only reasonable performance in forecasting the consumption of individual
   households - highlighting the influence of factors beyond those surveyed
   - but good performance for aggregated household consumption. Models such
   as this would seem highly useful for a range of stakeholders including
   individual households trying to understand the potential implications of
   different choices, utilities looking to better forecast the impact of
   different possible residential trends and policy makers seeking to
   assist households in improving their energy efficiency through targeted
   policies and programs. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) device for the analysis of
   free Cd(II) species, based on Cd(II) ion-imprinted sorbent (IIS) as the
   binding agents and commercial polyethersulfone membrane (PES) as
   diffusion layer, was developed (PES/IIS-DGT). DGT time-series
   experiments showed that the mass of free Cd(II) species accumulated by
   PES/IIS-DGT was linear vs. time (R-2 = 0.9953) and the concentration of
   free Cd(II) species by PES/IIS-DGT was in good agreement with the total
   dissolved concentrations of free Cd(II) species in simple synthetic
   solutions where free ionic species dominated. PES/IIS-DGT performance
   was independent in the range of pH 4.5-7.5 and ionic strength range from
   1.0 x 10(-3) to 0.7 mol L-1. The measurement of free Cd(II) species in
   synthetic solution containing different concentrations of ligands by
   PES/IIS-DGT showed an excellent agreement with the value measured by
   Cd(II) ion selective electrodes (Cd-ISE), indicating that PES/IIS-DGT
   method is more suitable than Cd-ISE for the measurement of low
   concentration of free Cd(II) species due to the enrichment of IIS for
   the analytes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the emergence and diffusion of extreme opinions becomes
   important to our globalized society. In this study, we propose a social
   judgment based opinion (SJBO) dynamics model, which incorporates both
   the compromise between similar opinions and the repulsion between
   discrepant opinions, to study the occurrence and spread of extremism in
   two different scenarios. The first concerns a situation in which
   individuals interact with each other through their inner opinions, while
   the second involves a case that each individual updates his inner
   opinion and choice via observing his neighbor's choice. The simulation
   results show that, in the first scenario, a critical uncertainty level
   is present, at which the size of extremists can be maximized. Increasing
   or decreasing the uncertainty level from the critical value can diminish
   or even eliminate the extremists. In the second scenario, high
   uncertainty level tends to promote the development of extremists.
   However, the extremism can be contained or even avoided if the influence
   scope of silencers is large enough. In both scenarios, a large level of
   tolerance can help to reduce extremists as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{High pressure metal-silicate partitioning of Ni, Co, V, Cr, Si, and O}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of major and minor elements in Earth's core and mantle
   were primarily established by high pressure, high temperature
   metal-silicate partitioning during core segregation. The partitioning
   behaviors of moderately siderophile elements can be used to constrain
   the pressure-temperature conditions of core formation and the core's
   composition. We performed experiments to study the partitioning of Ni,
   Co, V, Cr, Si, and O between silicate melt and Fe-rich metallic melt in
   a multianvil press and diamond anvil cell, up to 100 GPa and 5700 K.
   Combining our new results with data from 18 previous studies, we
   parameterized the effects of pressure, temperature, and metallic melt
   composition on partitioning. Ni and Co partitioning are insensitive to
   composition. At low pressures, these elements become less siderophile
   with increasing temperature, with this trend reversing above similar to
   45 GPa. V and Cr partitioning are much more sensitive to metallic melt
   composition and less sensitive to pressure. Partitioning of Si and O are
   insensitive to pressure, but with strong and moderate temperature
   dependences, respectively. Our new parameterizations of Ni and Co
   partitioning suggest that the Earth's distributions of these elements
   can be matched by single-stage core-mantle equilibration at 54 +/- 5 GPa
   and 3300-3400 K. These conditions would result in 8.5 +/- 1.4 wt\% Si
   and 1.6 +/- 0.3 wt\% O in the core, compatible with the core's measured
   density. However, this single-stage model matches the Earth's V and Cr
   distributions less well. We also incorporated our parameterizations into
   models of multi-stage core formation over evolving
   pressure-temperature-oxygen fugacity conditions, reproducing the Earth's
   Ni and Co distributions while simultaneously producing a core whose
   light element composition is consistent with its density. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Background. Completion rates for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) are low. We investigated the adherence
   and safety of coformulated emtricitabine (FTC), rilpivirine (RPV), and
   tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as a 3-drug, single-tablet regimen
   for PEP in men who have sex with men (MSM).
   Methods. In an open-label, single-arm study at 2 public sexual health
   clinics and 2 hospital emergency departments in urban Australia, 100
   HIV-uninfected MSM requiring 3-drug PEP received single-tablet
   FTC-RPV-TDF once daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint was premature
   PEP cessation or primary HIV infection through week 12. Additional
   endpoints were adherence (by self-report of doses missed or not ingested
   with a meal, by pill count, and by plasma concentrations of tenofovir
   and FTC at week 4); and safety (clinical and laboratory adverse events
   {[}AEs]).
   Results. PEP completion was 92\% (95\% confidence interval, 85\%-96\%);
   premature cessation resulted from loss to follow-up (6\%), AEs (1\%), or
   study burden (1\%). No participant was found to acquire HIV through week
   12. Adherence was 98.6\% (standard deviation {[}SD], 2.4) by pill count
   and 98.5\% (SD, 2.7) by self-report; 86\% reported taking all doses with
   food, and 88\% of the subset tested had plasma tenofovir levels
   suggesting full adherence (>40 ng/mL). Eighty-eight participants
   experienced at least 1 clinical AE; 4 had grade 3 AEs or higher,
   possibly attributable to study drug. Fifty-six participants experienced
   at least 1 laboratory AE; 4 had AEs of grade 3 or higher, possibly
   attributable to study drug.
   Conclusions. A single-tablet regimen of FTC-RPV-TDF was well tolerated
   as once-daily PEP, with high levels of adherence and completion.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present investigation was to delineate cytokine-induced
   signaling and death using the EndoC-beta H1 cells as a model for primary
   human beta-cells. The cytokines IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma induced a rapid
   and transient activation of NF-kappa B, STAT-1, ERK, JNK and eIF-2 alpha
   signaling. The EndoC-beta H1 cells died rapidly when exposed to IL-1
   beta + IFN-gamma, and this occurred also in the presence of the
   actinomycin D. Inhibition of NF-kappa B and STAT-1 did not protect
   against cell death, nor did the cytokines activate iNOS expression.
   Instead, cytokines promoted a rapid decrease in EndoC-beta H1 cell
   respiration and ATP levels, and we observed protection by the AMPK
   activator AICAR against cytokine-induced cell death. It is concluded
   that EndoC-beta H1 cell death can be prevented by AMPK activation, which
   suggests a role for ATP depletion in cytokine-induced human beta-cell
   death. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{From June 2014 to January 2015, the slumped price of crude oil mainly be
   caused by the increasing shale gas in the U.S. The market of crude oil
   was altered by the variation of natural gas trade patterns. It implies
   that the international fossil energy trade is a multilayer structure,
   and each layer is a complex system with numerous countries and
   complicated relations. In this paper, we build the international fossil
   energy trade multilayer network (ETMN), and study the evolutionary
   characteristics of networks during 2002-2013. The generalization of
   several important indicators, including degree distribution, community,
   stability of communities and the time-varying evolution of main
   countries' importance were discussed. Our conclusions suggest that:
   Firstly, the ETMN and three energy-specific networks including coal,
   oil, and natural gas display the scale-free characteristic in
   un-weighted and weighted networks. However, it shows that even if a few
   countries have major trading partners, there are not always a few
   countries that play critical roles in trade intensity. Secondly, the
   natural gas network has the largest number of communities and stability
   compared with networks of coal and oil, and the volatility of stability
   lagged one year than the other two networks for the specific form of
   pipeline transportation. Thirdly, studying on the stability of networks
   shows that geopolitical environment is the most important influenced
   factor, but the status of renewable and new energy increases with its
   development obviously. Fourthly, the evolutionary characteristics of
   three major countries' importance, including United States, China and
   Japan, are analyzed in detail. At last, some policy suggestions were
   pointed out according to the results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The diffusion of olefins through 8-ring solid acid microporous zeolites
   is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations techniques and
   using a newly developed flexible force field. Within the context of the
   methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process and the observed product distribution,
   knowledge of the diffusion paths is essential to obtain molecular level
   control over the process conditions. Eight-ring zeotype materials are
   favorably used for the MTO process as they give a selective product
   distribution toward low-carbon olefins. To investigate how composition,
   acidity, and flexibility influence the diffusion paths of ethene and
   propene, a series of isostructural aluminosilicates (zeolites) and
   silicoaluminophosphates (AlPOs and SAPOs) are investigated with and
   without randomly distributed acidic sites. Distinct variations in
   diffusion of ethene are observed in terms of temperature, composition,
   acidity, and topology (AEI, CHA, AFX). In general, diffusion of ethene
   is an activated process for which free energy barriers for individual
   rings may be determined. We observe ring-dependent diffusion behavior
   which cannot be described solely in terms of the composition and
   topology of the rings. A new descriptor had to be introduced, namely,
   the accessible window area (AWA), inspired by implicit solvation models
   of proteins and small molecules. The AWA may be determined throughout
   the molecular dynamics trajectories and correlates well with the number
   of ring crossings at the molecular level and the free energy barriers
   for ring crossings from one cage to the other. The overall observed
   diffusivity is determined by molecular characteristics of individual
   rings for which AWA is a proper descriptor. Temperature-induced changes
   in framework dynamics and diffusivity may be captured by following the
   new descriptor throughout the simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Kraft lignin (KL) and acetylated Kraft lignin (AKL) were used as filler
   for the elaboration of composites with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) in
   different concentrations (0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 20\%) by extrusion method at
   200 degrees C. Characterization of both lignins has been performed using
   HPLC, FT-IR, GPC, DSC and TGA. KL presented only 0.3\% of ash content
   and molecular weight around 2000 g/mol. The esterification increased the
   molecular weight and decreases the polydispersity of the lignin (AKL).
   Also, AKL had lower T-g and higher thermal stability than unmodified
   Kraft lignin. Lignin content increased the thermal stability of PLA,
   with the addition of both types of lignins. Contact angle was measured
   to assess the change in the hydrophobicity of PLA with the addition of
   lignins. Mechanical properties of different materials were also
   investigated in order to know the effect of lignin addition in PLA.
   Maximum strength was not severely affected at low concentrations of both
   lignins, but it decreased dramatically, especially in composites with 10
   and 20\% of KL Elongation at break increased with the addition of low
   contents of AKL, at high content of both lignins the material becomes
   quite brittle. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Open annular defects compromise the ability of the annulus fibrosus to
   contain nuclear tissue in the disc space, and therefore lead to disc
   herniation with subsequent degenerative changes to the entire
   intervertebral disc. This study reports the use of riboflavin
   crosslinked high-density collagen gel for the repair of annular defects
   in a needle-punctured rat-tail model. High-density collagen has
   increased stiffness and greater hydraulic permeability than conventional
   low-density gels; riboflavin crosslinking further increases these
   properties. This study found that treating annular defects with
   crosslinked high-density collagen inhibited the progression of disc
   degeneration over 18 weeks compared to untreated control discs.
   Histological sections of FITC-labeled collagen gel revealed an early
   tight attachment to host annular tissue. The gel was subsequently
   infiltrated by host fibroblasts which remodeled it into a fibrous cap
   that bridged the outer disrupted annular fibers and partially repaired
   the defect. This repair tissue enhanced retention of nucleus pulposus
   tissue, maintained physiological disc hydration, and preserved hydraulic
   permeability, according to MRI, histological, and mechanical
   assessments. Degenerative changes were partially reversed in treated
   discs, as indicated by an increase in nucleus pulposus size and
   hydration between weeks 5 and 18. The collagen gel appeared to work as
   an instant sealant and by enhancing the intrinsic healing capabilities
   of the host tissue. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of

Title = {{Structure and Properties of Silica Glass Densified in Cold Compression
   and Hot Compression}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Silica glass has been shown in numerous studies to possess significant
   capacity for permanent densification under pressure at different
   temperatures to form high density amorphous (HDA) silica. However, it is
   unknown to what extent the processes leading to irreversible
   densification of silica glass in cold-compression at room temperature
   and in hot-compression (e.g., near glass transition temperature) are
   common in nature. In this work, a hot-compression technique was used to
   quench silica glass from high temperature (1100 degrees C) and high
   pressure (up to 8 GPa) conditions, which leads to density increase of
   similar to 25\% and Young's modulus increase of similar to 71\% relative
   to that of pristine silica glass at ambient conditions. Our experiments
   and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide solid evidences that the
   intermediate-range order of the hot-compressed HDA silica is distinct
   from that of the counterpart cold-compressed at room temperature. This
   explains the much higher thermal and mechanical stability of the former
   than the latter upon heating and compression as revealed in our in-situ
   Brillouin light scattering (BLS) experiments. Our studies demonstrate
   the limitation of the resulting density as a structural indicator of
   polyamorphism, and point out the importance of temperature during
   compression in order to fundamentally understand HDA silica.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular enzymes that have
   been implicated in the pathophysiology of blood-brain barrier (BBB)
   breakdown, contusion expansion, and vasogenic edema after traumatic
   brain injury (TBI). Specifically, in focal injury models, increased
   MMP-9 expression has been observed in pericontusional brain, and MMP-9
   inhibitors reduce brain swelling and final lesion volume. The aim of
   this study was to examine whether there is a similarly localized
   increase of MMP concentrations in patients with contusional TBI. Paired
   microdialysis catheters were inserted into 12 patients with contusional
   TBI (with or without associated mass lesion) targeting pericontusional
   and radiologically normal brain defined on admission computed tomography
   scan. Microdialysate was pooled every 8h and analyzed for MMP-1, -2, -7,
   -9, and -10 using a multiplex immunoassay. Concentrations of MMP-1, -2,
   and -10 were similar at both monitoring sites and did not show
   discernible temporal trends. Overall, there was a gradual increase in
   MMP-7 concentrations in both normal and injured brain over the
   monitoring period, although this was not consistent in every patient.
   MMP-9 concentrations were elevated in pericontusional, compared to
   normal, brain, with the maximal difference at the earliest monitoring
   times (i.e., <24h postinjury). Repeated-measures analysis of variance
   showed that MMP-9 concentrations were significantly higher in
   pericontusional brain (p=0.03) and within the first 72h of injury,
   compared with later in the monitoring period (p=0.04). No significant
   differences were found for the other MMPs assayed. MMP-9 concentrations
   are increased in pericontusional brain early post-TBI and may represent
   a potential therapeutic target to reduce hemorrhagic progression and
   vasogenic edema.}},

Abstract = {{For patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and being in
   a shockable rhythm, the coarseness of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal
   is an indicator of the state of the patient. In the current work, we
   show how mixed effects stochastic differential equations (SDE) models,
   commonly used in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling, can be
   used to model the relationship between CPR quality measurements and ECG
   coarseness. This is a novel application of mixed effects SDE models to a
   setting quite different from previous applications of such models and
   where using such models nicely solves many of the challenges involved in
   analysing the available data. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Timing and nature of the penultimate deglaciation in a high alpine

Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{264-275}},

Abstract = {{The timing and nature of the penultimate deglaciation, also known as
   Termination II (T-II), is subject of controversial discussions due to
   the scarcity of precisely-dated palaeoclimate records. Here we present a
   new precisely-dated and highly-resolved multi-proxy stalagmite record
   covering T-II from the high alpine Schafsloch Cave in Switzerland, an
   area where climate is governed by the North Atlantic. The inception of
   stalagmite growth at 137.4+/-1.4 kyr before present (BP) indicates the
   presence of drip water and cave air temperatures of above 0 degrees C,
   and is related to a climate-induced change in the thermal state (from
   cold-to warm-based) of the glacier above the cave. The cessation of
   stalagmite growth between 133.1+/-0.7 and 131.9+/-0.6 kyr BP is most
   likely related to distinct drop in temperature associated with Heinrich
   stadial 11. The resumption of stalagmite growth at 131.9+/-0.6 kyr BP is
   accompanied by an abrupt increase in temperature and precipitation as
   indicated by distinct shifts in the oxygen and carbon isotopic
   composition as well as in trace element concentrations. The mid-point of
   T-II is around 131.8+/-0.6 kyr BP in the Schafsloch Cave record is
   significantly earlier compared to the age of 129.1+/-0.1 kyr BP in the
   Sanbao Cave record from China. The different ages between both records
   can be best explained by the competing effects of insolation and glacial
   boundary forcing on seasonality and snow cover extent in Eurasia. (C)

Abstract = {{Nicotine dependence is influenced by chromosome 15q25.1 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including the missense SNP rs16969968
   that alters function of the alpha 5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
   (CHRNA5) and noncoding SNPs that regulate CHRNA5 mRNA expression. We
   tested for cis-methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-meQTLs) using
   SNP genotypes and DNA methylation levels measured across the
   IREB2-HYKK-PSMA4-CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 genes on chromosome 15q25.1 in the
   BrainCloud and Brain QTL cohorts {[}total N = 175 European-Americans and
   65 African-Americans (AAs)]. We identified eight SNPs that were
   significantly associated with CHRNA5 methylation in prefrontal cortex: P
   ranging from 6.0 x 10(-10) to 5.6 x 10(-5). These SNP-methylation
   associations were also significant in frontal cortex, temporal cortex
   and pons: P ranging from 4.8 x 10(-12) to 3.4 x 10(-3). Of the eight
   cis-meQTL SNPs, only the intronic CHRNB4 SNP rs11636753 was associated
   with CHRNA5 methylation independently of the known SNP effects in
   prefrontal cortex, and it was the most significantly associated SNP with
   nicotine dependence across five independent cohorts (total N = 7858
   European ancestry and 3238 AA participants): P = 6.7 x 10(-4), odds
   ratio (OR) {[}95\% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.11 (1.05-1.18). The
   rs11636753 major allele (G) was associated with lower CHRNA5 DNA
   methylation, lower CHRNA5 mRNA expression and increased nicotine
   dependence risk. Haplotype analyses showed that rs11636753-G and the
   functional rs16969968-A alleles together increased risk of nicotine
   dependence more than each variant alone: P = 3.1 x 10(-12), OR (95\% CI)
   = 1.32 (1.22-1.43). Our findings identify a novel regulatory SNP
   association with nicotine dependence and connect, for the first time,
   previously observed differences in CHRNA5 mRNA expression and nicotine
   dependence risk to underlying DNA methylation differences.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements on laminar flame speeds and ignition delay times of
   methane/air mixtures at elevated pressures and temperatures were carried
   out in a constant volume bomb and shock tube. The performances of GRI
   Mech 3.0, USC Mech II, and Aramco Mech 1.3 mechanisms were also
   evaluated from the data obtained. Results showed that the measured
   laminar flame speeds from the constant volume bomb by the linear method
   are slightly higher than those from the counter flow flame at rich
   mixtures and lower at lean mixtures. At rich mixtures, the laminar flame
   speeds with linear method are higher than that with non-linear method.
   The available mechanisms give slight overprediction to the constant
   volume bomb data at lean mixtures, and large underprediction at rich
   mixtures at elevated temperatures and pressures. Overall reaction order
   decreases and then increases with the rising of pressure from 0.1 to
   10.0 MPa because of the chain reaction mechanism. For the ignition delay
   times, the three mechanisms are in good accordance with the experimental
   data of lean and stoichiometric mixtures at atmospheric pressure, while
   the discrepancy between calculation and measurement is increased at
   elevated pressures. These mechanisms seem to lack good sensitivity to
   the rich mixtures, especially at elevated pressures. Correlations for
   laminar burning velocities and ignition delay time of methane-air
   mixtures are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the source of Pb within Bohai Bay, Pb concentrations and
   Pb isotopic compositions (Pb-204, (206)pb, Pb-207, and Pb-208) of
   surface sediments in this area were determined. The Pb concentration in
   this bay varied widely from 6.9 to 39.2 mu g/g (average: 21.8 +/- 7.8 mu
   g/g), and the Pb isotopic compositions ranged from 0.8338 to 0.8864
   (average: 2.0997 +/- 0.0180) for Pb-208/Pb-208 and from 2.0797 to 2.1531
   (average: 0.8477 +/- 0.0135) for Pb-207/Pb-206, presenting in three
   distinct clusters. The Pb isotopic ratios of sediments from the
   northeastern (NE zone) and northwestern (NW zone) coastal areas were
   significantly influenced by anthropogenic sources such as coal
   combustion and automobile emission. In sediments from the central and
   southern Bohai Bay (C-S zone); however, Pb mainly originated from the
   Yellow River catchment, as a result of lithogenic sediment (from rock
   weathering) accumulation. The Pb isotopic ratios further indicate that,
   apart from riverine inputs, the neighboring large-scale ports and
   aerosols significantly contributed to the anthropogenic Pb contained in
   these sediments. Pb contamination in the Haihe and Luanhe river mouths
   as well as in the regions near ports is also suggested from
   anthropogenic enrichment factors. As cities and ports continue to
   develop around Bohai Bay, a long-term extensive sewage monitoring
   program is highly recommended. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Volume = {{426}},

Abstract = {{In this study, tribological behavior of a Zr53Al16CO23.25Ag7.75 bulk
   metallic glass (BMG) in air and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution
   was investigated and compared with biomedical alloy Ti-6Al-4V. It is
   found that wear resistance of the Zr-Al-Co-Ag BMG sliding in air is
   superior to that of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Under dry friction condition, wear
   deterioration of Zr-based BMG is controlled by oxidation and adhesive
   wear whereas Ti-6Al-4V alloy is jointly dominated by abrasive and
   adhesive wear. However, Zr-based BMG presents decreased wear resistance
   under lubricated friction condition in comparison with dry friction
   condition. In contrast, Ti-6Al-4V alloy shows improved wear resistance
   sliding in PBS. This is probably associated with the inferior pitting
   corrosion resistance of Zr-Al-Co-Ag BMG in the medium containing
   chloride ions, which may cause tribocorrosion controlled by synergistic
   effects of abrasive and corrosive wear. The possible mechanism for
   corrosion accelerating wear is discussed based on the tribological
   behavior of this Zr-based BMG. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Influence of phase shift on the responses of woven laminated composites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{143-154}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper focuses on understanding the influence of phase shift on the
   responses of woven laminates under uniaxial compression, uniaxial
   tension, biaxial compression, biaxial tension, and in-plane shear.
   Laminates in this paper have the same constituent microstructures in
   each layer of lamina. Fiber tows are modeled as transversely isotropic
   materials. Matrix is modeled as isotropic material before yielding and
   modeled as perfectly plastic material after yielding. All simulations
   are subject to periodic boundary conditions in the x and y direction
   whereas z direction, the through-thickness direction, is not subject to
   periodic boundary conditions. The results show that phase shift has
   significant influence on the homogenized tangential stiffness and the
   failure strength particularly under uniaxial compression. Under uniaxial
   compression, the laminate without phase shift has the lowest maximum
   strength and tangential stiffness and the laminates with 4 mm phase
   shift has the highest maximum strength and the highest tangential
   strength. Under biaxial compression, the laminate with 4 mm phase shift
   also has the highest maximum strength but the laminate with 2 mm phase
   shift has the lowest maximum strength. However, the tangential modulus
   do not change during the deformation under biaxial compression. The
   results show that by optimally arranging phase shift, the maximum
   strength for a laminate under uniaxial compression and biaxial
   compression can be reached. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The concept of global monsoon applied to the last glacial maximum: A

Abstract = {{The last glacial maximum (LGM, ca. 21,000 years ago) has been
   extensively investigated for better understanding of past glacial
   climates. Global-scale monsoon changes, however, have not yet been
   determined. In this study, we examine global monsoon area (GMA) and
   precipitation (GMP) as well as GMP intensity (GMPI) at the LGM using the
   experiments of 17 climate models chosen from the Paleoclimate Modelling
   Intercomparison Project (PMIP) according to their ability to reproduce
   the present global monsoon climate. Compared to the reference period
   (referring to the present day, ca. 1985, for three atmospheric plus two
   atm-slab ocean models and the pre-industrial period, ca. 1750, for 12
   fully coupled atmosphere ocean or atmosphere ocean vegetation models),
   the LGM monsoon area increased over land and decreased over the oceans.
   The boreal land monsoon areas generally shifted southward, while the
   northern boundary of land monsoon areas retreated southward over
   southern Africa and South America. Both the LGM GMP and GMPI decreased
   in most of the models. The GMP decrease mainly resulted from the reduced
   monsoon precipitation over the oceans, while the GMPI decrease was
   derived from the weakened intensity of monsoon precipitation over land
   and the boreal ocean. Quantitatively, the LGM GMP deficit was due to,
   first, the GMA reduction and, second, the GMPI weakening. In response to
   the LGM large ice sheets and lower greenhouse gas concentrations in the
   atmosphere, the global surface and tropospheric temperatures cooled, the
   boreal summer meridional temperature gradient increased, and the summer
   land sea thermal contrast at 40 degrees S - 70 degrees N decreased.
   These are the underlying dynamic mechanisms for the LGM monsoon changes.
   Qualitatively, simulations agree with reconstructions in all land
   monsoon areas except in the western part of northern Australia where
   disagreements occur and in South America and the southern part of
   southern Africa where there is uncertainty in reconstructions.
   Simulations do not support an inter-hemispheric anti-phasing of monsoon
   intensity change as suggested by proxy data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In order to improve the performance of least mean square (LMS)-based
   adaptive filtering for identifying block-sparse systems, a new adaptive
   algorithm called block-sparse LMS (BS-LMS) is proposed in this paper.
   The basis of the proposed algorithm is to insert a penalty of
   block-sparsity, which is a mixed norm of adaptive tap-weights with equal
   group partition sizes, into the cost function of traditional LMS
   algorithm. To describe a block-sparse system response, we first propose
   a Markov-Gaussian model, which can generate a kind of system responses
   of arbitrary average sparsity and arbitrary average block length using
   given parameters. Then we present theoretical expressions of the
   steady-state misadjustment and transient convergence behavior of BS-LMS
   with an appropriate group partition size for white Gaussian input data.
   Based on the above results, we theoretically demonstrate that BS-LMS has
   much better convergence behavior than l(0)-LMS with the same small level
   of misadjustment. Finally, numerical experiments verify that all of the
   theoretical analysis agrees well with simulation results in a large
   range of parameters.}},

Title = {{Stream macroinvertebrate communities across a gradient of natural gas
   development in the Fayetteville Shale}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{530}},
Pages = {{323-332}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Oil and gas extraction in shale plays expanded rapidly in the U.S. and
   is projected to expand globally in the coming decades. Arkansas has
   doubled the number of gas wells in the state since 2005 mostly by
   extracting gas from the Fayetteville Shale with activity concentrated in
   mixed pasture-deciduous forests. Concentrated well pads in close
   proximity to streams could have adverse effects on stream water quality
   and biota if sedimentation associated with developing infrastructure or
   contamination from fracturing fluid and waste occurs. Cumulative effects
   of gas activity and local habitat conditions on macroinvertebrate
   communities were investigated across a gradient of gas well activity
   (0.2-3.6 wells per km(2)) in ten stream catchments in spring 2010 and
   2011. In 2010, macroinvertebrate density was positively related to well
   pad inverse flowpath distance from streams (r = 0.84, p < 0.001).
   Relatively tolerant mayflies Baetis and Caenis (r = 0.64, p = 0.04),
   filtering hydropsychid caddisflies (r = 0.73, p = 0.01), and chironomid
   midge densities (r = 0.79, p = 0.008) also increased in streams where
   more well pads were closer to stream channels. Macroinvertebrate trophic
   structure reflected environmental conditions with greater sediment and
   primary production in streams with more gas activity close to streams.
   However, stream water turbidity (r = 0.69, p = 0.02) and chlorophyll a
   (r = 0.89, p < 0.001) were the only in-stream variables correlated with
   gas well activities. In 2011, a year with record spring flooding, a
   different pattern emerged where mayfly density (p = 0.74, p = 0.01) and
   mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly richness (r = 0.78, p = 0.008) increased
   in streams with greater well density and less silt cover. Hydrology and
   well pad placement in a catchment may interact to result in different
   relationships between biota and catchment activity between the two
   sample years. Our data show evidence of different macroinvertebrate
   communities expressed in catchments with different levels of gas
   activity that reinforce the need for more quantitative analyses of
   cumulative freshwater-effects from oil and gas development. (C) 2015

Volume = {{492}},
Pages = {{271-280}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The layer-by-layer method is an attractive technique for preparing
   ultrathin nanostructured polyelectrolyte multilayer membranes (PEMMs)
   with tailored composition and tunable properties. This paper
   investigates the optimization of the membrane preparation to render it
   more feasible from a practical view point. PEMMs were prepared with
   minimal number of bilayers and rinsing steps for two polyion
   combinations: poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) with poly
   (vinylsullonic acid sodium salt) and the same cation with poly(sodium
   4-styrenesulfonate). Three bilayers proved optimal for SRINIE
   applications. The commonly applied rinsing process turned out to be non
   essential, In addition, two minutes dipping time per deposition step
   already proved sufficient for defect free SRNE membrane preparation.
   Thus, the build-up protocol for PEMMs was overall reduced to a 6-step
   coating procedure taking 12 min without compromising the SRNE
   properties, in contrast to the previously reported 20-80 steps which
   required upto 7 h. Therefore, the `up scaling' potential of this type of
   membrane is significantly increased and potential production costs
   reduced. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{753-763}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Single char particles with a diameter of 8 mm were produced in situ from
   pellets of raw and torrefied pine shell, olive stones and straw. The
   single char particles were then gasified at 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C
   in two or three CO2 concentrations at each temperature. In the
   experiments, CO concentrations were measured from the product gases.
   From the measured CO concentrations, the char conversions versus time
   were determined. The reactivity of the char from the torrefied olive
   stones was lower than the reactivity of the char from the raw olive
   stones, while the reactivity of the char from the torrefied straw was
   higher than the reactivity of the char from raw straw. For the raw and
   torrefied pine shell the char reactivities were similar. At 900 degrees
   C the influence of torrefaction on char gasification rates was minor,
   however, since the conversion occurred under Regime II conditions, i.e.,
   the conversion rate is partly limited by mass transfer. A detailed
   single particle model, taking into consideration mass transfer effects,
   was used to extract kinetic parameters from the experimentally
   determined char conversions. For the six chars, activation energies of
   the adsorption step were in the range 175 and 285 kJ/mol, while
   activation energies of the desorption step were in the range 145 and 195
   kJ/mol. In the study it was also tested whether the char conversion
   could be computed with unified activation energies for all the chars.
   The results show that by using unified activation energies - 240 kJ/mol
   for the adsorption step and 168 kJ/mol for the desorption step - the
   computed char conversions were in good agreement to the experimental
   char conversions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Changes to hydroxylapatite mineral structure, composition, and lattice
   configuration must occur during the transformation of fresh bone to
   fossil bioapatite mineral phases. A paucity of analytical methods to
   characterize atomic-level lattice composition and bonding arrangements
   in modern and fossil bone has resulted in limited knowledge of how
   depositional environments, and thus diagenetic conditions, may influence
   fossilization processes. Synchrotron-based analyses can provide insight
   into bone fossilization, specifically X-ray absorption near edge
   structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the P and Ca K-edges. To aid in the
   interpretation of XANES spectral data from modern bones, and from Late
   Neogene and Late Cretaceous fossil bones, we applied other established
   techniques used to characterize bone mineralogy and composition,
   including X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
   electron microprobe analysis, and thermal analysis. Specific bone
   depositional origins and ages likely influenced the varying elemental
   chemistry, preservation of organic matter, and mineral content.
   Fossilized bones, ranging from an almost pure fluorapatite to carbonated
   fluorapatite mineral phases, had less preserved organic material than
   modern bone. The atomic-level P and Ca lattice structures of fossilized
   bones differed from modern bones, specifically having shifted and
   shortened Ca-O bonds due to Ca2+ substitution by ionic phases, such as
   iron or rare earth elements, and carbonate substitution for phosphate.
   The modified lattice structure, regardless of bulk mineral chemistry,
   provides thermodynamic stability in geochemically dynamic depositional
   environments that may dictate bioapatite preservation over geologic
   time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is well-known for inducing
   vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease after vaccination of young children
   with formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) in alum formulation. Here, we
   investigated alum adjuvant effects on protection and disease after
   FI-RSV immunization with or without alum in comparison with live RSV
   reinfections. Despite viral clearance, live RSV reinfections caused
   weight loss and substantial pulmonary inflammation probably due to high
   levels of RSV specific IFN-gamma(+) IL4(-), IFN-gamma-TNF-alpha(+),
   IFN-gamma(+) TNF-a-effector CD4 and CD8 T cells. Alum adjuvant
   significantly improved protection as evidenced by effective viral
   clearance compared to unadjuvanted FI-RSV. However, in contrast to
   unadjuvanted FI-RSV, alum-adjuvanted FI-RSV (FI-RSV-A) induced severe
   vaccine-enhanced RSV disease including weight loss, eosinophilia, and
   lung histopathology. Alum adjuvant in the FI-RSV-A was found to be
   mainly responsible for inducing high levels of RSV-specific
   IFN-gamma-IL4(+), IFN-gamma-TNF-alpha(+) CD4(+) T cells, and
   proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-4 as well as B220(+) plasmacytoid
   and CD4(+) dendritic cells, and inhibiting the induction of IFN-gamma(+)
   CD8 T cells. This study suggests that alum adjuvant in FI-RSV vaccines
   increases immunogenicity and viral clearance but also induces atypical T
   helper CD4(+) T cells and multiple inflammatory dendritic cell subsets
   responsible for vaccine-enhanced severe RSV disease.}},

Title = {{Bond strength prediction for deformed steel rebar embedded in recycled
   coarse aggregate concrete}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{257-269}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the results of an experimental investigation into
   the bond behavior between recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) and deformed
   steel rebars, with the main variables being the recycled coarse
   aggregate replacement ratio (RCAr) and water-to-cement ratio of the
   concrete mixture. The investigation into splitting cracking strength
   indicates that the degradation of the bond splitting tensile stress of
   the cover concrete was affected by not only the roundness of the coarse
   aggregate particles but also the weak interfacial transition zone (ITZ)
   between the cement paste and the RCA that has a more porous structure in
   the ITZ than normal concrete. In this study, a linear relationship
   between the bond strength and the density of the RCA was found, but the
   high compressive strength reduced the effects of the parameters. To
   predict the bond strength of RAC using the main parameters, a
   multivariable model was developed using nonlinear regression analysis.
   It can be inferred from this study that the degradation characteristic
   of the bond strength of RAC can be predicted well, whereas other
   empirical equations and code provisions are very conservative. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The crystal structures of highly-ordered Mg-Zn-Y long-period
   stacking-ordered (LPSO) phases with the 18R-, 14H- and 10H-type stacking
   sequences, which are constructed by stacking structural blocks composed
   of six, seven and five close-packed atomic layers, respectively, have
   been investigated by atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron
   microscopy (STEM) and transmission electron microscopy. The in-plane
   order characterized by the periodic arrangement of Zn6Y8 atomic clusters
   on the lattice points of a 2 root 3a(mg) x 2 root 3a(mg) two-dimensional
   primitive hexagonal lattice (a(mg): the lattice constant of Mg) is
   developed in the central four consecutive atomic layers in each of the
   structural blocks for the 18R-, 14H- and 10H-type Mg-Zn-Y LPSO phases.
   The random occupation of the central site of each Zn6Y8 atomic cluster
   with Mg, Zn, Y or vacancy is suggested through the analysis of the
   ultra-high resolution annular-bright field STEM images. The space groups

Abstract = {{The Wiener index W(G) of a connected graph G is defined to be the sum
   Sigma(u, v)d(u, v) of distances between all unordered pairs of vertices
   in G. Similarly, the edge-Wiener index W-e(G) of G is defined to be the
   sum Sigma(e,f)d(e,f) of distances between all unordered pairs of edges
   in G, or equivalently, the Wiener index of the line graph L(G). Wu
   (2010) showed that W-e(G) >= W(G) for graphs of minimum degree 2, where
   equality holds only when G is a cycle. Similarly, in Knor et al. (2014),
   it was shown that W-e(G) >= delta(2)-1/4W(G) where delta denotes the
   minimum degree in G. In this paper, we extend/improve these two results
   by showing that W-e(G) >= delta(2)/4 W(G) with equality satisfied only
   if G is a path on 3 vertices or a cycle. Besides this, we also consider
   the upper bound for W-e(G) as well as the ratio W-e(G)/W(G). We show
   that among graphs Con n vertices attains its minimum for the star. (C)

Abstract = {{The increase in steady-state force after active lengthening in skeletal
   muscle, termed force enhancement (FE), has been observed for nearly one
   century. Although demonstrated experimentally at various structural
   levels, the underlying mechanism(s) remain unknown. We recently showed
   that the Drosophila jump muscle is an ideal model for investigating
   mechanisms behind muscle physiological properties, because its
   mechanical characteristics, tested thus far, duplicate those of fast
   mammalian skeletal muscles, and Drosophila has the advantage that it can
   be more easily genetically modified. To determine if Drosophila would be
   appropriate to investigate FE, we performed classic FE experiments on
   this muscle. Steady-state FE (FESS), following active lengthening,
   increased by 3, 7, and 12\% of maximum isometric force, with increasing
   stretch amplitudes of 5, 10, and 20\% of optimal fiber length (FLOPT),
   yet was similar for stretches across increasing stretch velocities of 4,
   20, and 200\% FLOPT/s. These FESS characteristics of the Drosophila jump
   muscle closely mimic those observed previously. Jump muscles also
   displayed typical transient FE characteristics. The transient force
   relaxation following active stretch was fit with a double exponential,
   yielding two phases of force relaxation: a fast initial relaxation of
   force, followed by a slower recovery toward steady state. Our analyses
   identified a negative correlation between the slow relaxation rate and
   FESS, indicating that there is likely an active component contributing
   to FE, in addition to a passive component. Herein, we have established
   the Drosophila jump muscle as a new and genetically powerful
   experimental model to investigate the underlying mechanism(s) of FE.}},

   emissions}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{149-158}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a new method to predict emissions in internal
   combustion (IC) engines. The method couples a multi-dimensional engine
   modeling program with pre-integrated non-equilibrium chemical kinetics
   reaction results. Prior to engine simulation, detailed chemical kinetics
   reactions of air/fuel mixture at different temperatures, pressures, and
   compositions, are calculated using SENKIN, a subprogram in the
   CHEMKIN-II computer package. The reaction results are decoupled from
   their chemical eigenvalue (order of about 10(-10) s), then integrated
   and saved in physical time scale (order of about 10(-5) s) in a database
   file. In the database reaction results of different initial conditions
   (temperature, pressure, and species composition) are stored in different
   zones; the zones are indexed using their respective reaction conditions.
   Fluid dynamics and thermal dynamics of the movement of piston and
   valves, and spray droplets interaction are simulated by KIVA-3 V.
   Instead of calculating directly the non-equilibrium chemical reactions
   of the air/fuel mixture, reaction results are obtained from the database
   file via an interpolating subroutine, which returns temperature, heat
   release, and species concentrations after reaction to the main program.
   The approach avoids direct time consuming calculation of detailed
   chemical reactions as well as the errors introduced by coupling the
   physical and chemical processes. Emissions are predicted accurately
   since reaction of air/fuel mixture is calculated using the detailed
   chemical kinetics mechanism. The approach is applied to model a
   Caterpillar 3401 direct injection compression ignition (CI) diesel
   engine. In addition we carried out experimental tests on a Toledo 1500
   SI gasoline engine, and those results are compared with the proposed
   computational approach. In all cases the predicted results agree well
   with the experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{406}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{117-128}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Secreted Wnt proteins play pivotal roles in development, including
   regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, progenitor
   maintenance and tissue patterning. The transmembrane protein Wntless
   (Wls) is necessary for secretion of most Wnts and essential for
   effective Wnt signaling. During a mutagenesis screen to identify genes
   important for development of the habenular nuclei in the dorsal
   forebrain, we isolated a mutation in the sole wls gene of zebrafish and
   confirmed its identity with a second, independent allele. Early
   embryonic development appears normal in homozygous wls mutants, but they
   later lack the ventral habenular nuclei, form smaller dorsal habenulae
   and otic vesicles, have truncated jaw and fin cartilages and lack swim
   bladders. Activation of a reporter for beta-catenin-dependent
   transcription is decreased in wls mutants, indicative of impaired
   signaling by the canonical Wnt pathway, and expression of Wnt-responsive
   genes is reduced in the dorsal diencephalon. Wnt signaling was
   previously implicated in patterning of the zebrafish brain and in the
   generation of left-right (L-R) differences between the bilaterally
   paired dorsal habenular nuclei. Outside of the epithalamic region,
   development of the brain is largely normal in wls mutants and, despite
   their reduced size, the dorsal habenulae retain L-R asymmetry. We find
   that homozygous wls mutants show a reduction in two cell populations
   that contribute to the presumptive dorsal habenulae. The results support
   distinct temporal requirements for Wls in habenular development and
   reveal a new role for Wnt signaling in the regulation of dorsal
   habenular progenitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rad6 is a yeast E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme that monoubiquitinates
   histone H2B in conjunction with the E3, Bre1, but can non-specifically
   modify histones on its own. We determined the crystal structure of a
   Rad6 similar to Ub thioester mimic, which revealed a network of
   interactions in the crystal in which the ubiquitin in one conjugate
   contacts Rad6 in another. The region of Rad6 contacted is located on the
   distal face of Rad6 opposite the active site, but differs from the
   canonical E2 backside that mediates free ubiquitin binding and
   polyubiquitination activity in other E2 enzymes. We find that free
   ubiquitin interacts weakly with both non-canonical and canonical
   backside residues of Rad6 and that mutations of non-canonical residues
   have deleterious effects on Rad6 activity comparable to those observed
   to mutations in the canonical E2 backside. The effect of non-canonical
   backside mutations is similar in the presence and absence of Bre1,
   indicating that contacts with non-canonical backside residues govern the
   intrinsic activity of Rad6. Our findings shed light on the determinants
   of intrinsic Rad6 activity and reveal new ways in which contacts with an
   E2 backside can regulate ubiquitin conjugating activity.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: The etiology of schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial
   hypertension (PAH), a major cause of PAH worldwide, is poorly
   understood. Schistosoma mansoni exposure results in prototypical type-2
   inflammation. Furthermore, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta
   signaling is required for experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH)
   caused by Schistosoma exposure.
   Objectives: We hypothesized type-2 inflammation driven by IL-4 and IL-13
   is necessary for Schistosoma-induced TGF-beta-dependent vascular
   remodeling.
   Methods: Wild-type, IL-4(-/-), IL-13(-/-), and IL-4(-/-)IL-13(-/-) mice
   (C57BL6/J background) were intraperitoneally sensitized and
   intravenously challenged with S. mansoni eggs to induce experimental PH.
   Right ventricular catheterization was then performed, followed by
   quantitative analysis of the lung tissue. Lung tissue from patients with
   schistosomiasis-associated and connective tissue disease-associated PAH
   was also systematically analyzed.
   Measurements and Main Results: Mice with experimental
   Schistosoma-induced PH had evidence of increased IL-4 and IL-13
   signaling. IL-4(-/-)IL-13(-/-) mice, but not single knockout IL-4(-/-)
   or IL-13(-/-) mice, were protected from Schistosoma-induced PH, with
   decreased right ventricular pressures, pulmonary vascular remodeling,
   and right ventricular hypertrophy. IL-4(-/-)IL-13(-/-) mice had less
   pulmonary vascular phospho-signal transducer and activator of
   transcription 6 (STAT6) and phospho-Smad2/3 activity, potentially caused
   by decreased TGF-beta activation by macrophages. In vivo treatment with
   a STAT6 inhibitor and IL-4(-/-)IL-13(-/-) bone marrow transplantation
   also protected against Schistosoma-PH. Lung tissue from patients with
   schistosomiasis-associated and connective tissue disease-associated PAH
   had evidence of type-2 inflammation.
   Conclusions: Combined IL-4 and IL-13 deficiency is required for
   protection against TGF-beta-induced pulmonary vascular disease after
   Schistosoma exposure, and targeted inhibition of this pathway is a
   potential novel therapeutic approach for patients with
   schistosomiasis-associated PAH.}},

Abstract = {{Many important signalling cascades operate through specialized
   signalling endosomes, but a corresponding mechanism has as yet not been
   described for hematopoietic cytokine receptors. Based on live-cell
   affinity measurements, we recently proposed that ligand-induced
   interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) complex formation and thus JAK/STAT
   pathway activation requires a local subcellular increase in receptor
   density. Here, we show that this concentration step is provided by the
   internalization of IL-4R subunits through a constitutive, Rac1-, Pak-
   and actin-mediated endocytosis route that causes IL-4R subunits to
   become enriched by about two orders of magnitude within a population of
   cortical endosomes. Consistently, ligand-induced receptor dimers are
   preferentially detected within these endosomes. IL-4 signalling can be
   blocked by pharmacological inhibitors targeting the actin polymerization
   machinery driving receptor internalization, placing endocytosis
   unambigously upstream of receptor activation. Taken together, these
   observations demonstrate a role for endocytosis that is mechanistically
   distinct from the scaffolding function of signalling endosomes in other
   pathways.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Northeastern states of the United States have shown more
   progress in reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality
   rates than Southern states, and this has resulted in considerable
   disparities. This study quantified how the disparities in CRC rates
   between Louisiana (a Southern state) and New Jersey (a Northeastern
   state) would be affected if differences in risk factors, screening, and
   stage-specific CRC relative survival between the states were eliminated.
   METHODS: This study used the Microsimulation Screening Analysis Colon
   microsimulation model to estimate age-adjusted CRC incidence and
   mortality rates in Louisiana from 1995 to 2009 under the assumption that
   1) Louisiana had the same smoking and obesity prevalence observed in New
   Jersey, 2) Louisiana had the same CRC screening uptake observed in New
   Jersey, 3) Louisiana had the same stage-specific CRC relative survival
   observed in New Jersey, or 4) all the preceding were true. RESULTS: In
   2009, the observed CRC incidence and mortality rates in Louisiana were
   141.4 cases and 61.9 deaths per 100,000 individuals, respectively. With
   the same risk factors and screening observed in New Jersey, the CRC
   incidence rate in Louisiana was reduced by 3.5\% and 15.2\%,
   respectively. New Jersey's risk factors, screening, and survival reduced
   the CRC mortality rate in Louisiana by 3.0\%, 10.8\%, and 17.4\%,
   respectively. With all trends combined, the modeled rates per 100,000
   individuals in Louisiana became lower than the observed rates in New
   Jersey for both incidence (116.4 vs 130.0) and mortality (44.7 vs 55.8).
   CONCLUSIONS: The disparities in CRC incidence and mortality rates
   between Louisiana and New Jersey could be eliminated if Louisiana could
   attain New Jersey's levels of risk factors, screening, and survival.
   Priority should be given to enabling Southern states to improve
   screening and survival rates. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.}},

Journal = {{QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS}},

Volume = {{126}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Holocene palaeolimnological records of diatoms and beta carotene (a
   proxy for aquatic production) from four lakes in the low Arctic region
   of south-western Greenland were used to investigate the role of climate
   on lake ontogeny. Two of the lakes are located in the maritime, coastal
   region near Sisimiut and two inland close to the head of Kangerlussuaq
   fjord, where there is a more continental climate. Diatom records from
   the four lakes (AT1, AT4, SS1381, SS8) had similar long-term ontogeny
   trends, independent of climatic setting and the changes are interpreted
   as responses to first order weathering controls on catchment/lake
   chemistry. Short-term excursions from these broad trends occurred in one
   coastal site (AT4) caused by intense erosion of the steep catchment, and
   at inland sites where temporary hydrological closure and lake level
   decline occurred during the mid-Holocene (similar to 8000 - 5000 cal a
   BP). Algal production (as beta carotene) was more closely and
   consistently correlated with climatic changes; it peaked during the
   mid-Holocene, the warmest period of the Holocene, at all sites and there
   were transient increases in production in inland lakes during the
   Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age because of fertilization
   through increased aeolian dust deposition. A synthesis of seven
   palaeolimnological records from this region identified that only the
   mid-Holocene was correlated with diatom stratigraphic zones and there
   was considerable among-site variability in later Holocene lake response
   to climate forcing in this area. Comparable long-term trends in species
   assemblage turnover (DCA/CA axis 1 scores) clearly demonstrate that
   lakes have predictable ontogeny trends in this region, characterised by
   maximum alkalinity and nutrient availability in the first few millennia
   followed by progressive oligotrophication and alkalinity loss. However,
   individual lake and catchment characteristics (lake morphology,
   catchment geomorphology), when modified by climatic change (vegetation
   cover, erosion, weathering rates, aeolian dust deposition, lake level)
   can diverge from this ontogeny template leading to complex ecological
   transitions in lakes from this region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper defines a method to estimate the mean neutral density of the
   thermosphere given many satellites of the same form factor travelling in
   similar regions of space. A priori information to the estimation scheme
   include ranging measurements and a general knowledge of the onboard
   ADACS, although precise measurements are not required for the latter.
   The estimation procedure seeks to utilize order statistics to estimate
   the probability of the minimum drag coefficient achievable, and
   amalgamating all measurements across multiple time periods allows
   estimation of the probability density of the ballistic factor itself.
   The model does not depend on prior models of the atmosphere; instead we
   require estimation of the minimum achievable drag coefficient which is
   based upon physics models of simple shapes in free molecular flow. From
   the statistics of the minimum, error statistics on the estimated
   atmospheric density can be calculated. Barring measurement errors from
   the ranging procedure itself, it is shown that with a constellation of
   10 satellites, we can achieve a standard deviation of roughly 4\% on the
   estimated mean neutral density. As more satellites are added to the
   constellation, the result converges towards the lower limit of the
   achievable drag coefficient, and accuracy becomes limited by the quality
   of the ranging measurements and the probability of the accommodation
   coefficient. Comparisons are made to existing atmospheric models such as
   NRLMSISE-00 and JB2006. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of

   2.95\%, 0.03\%, and 82.66\%, respectively, on a dry weight basis.
   Linoleic, oleic, and palmitic were the most predominant fatty acids.
   UFA:SFA and SFA:MUFA:PUFA ratios were 2.6:1 and 1.25:1.34:1,
   respectively. The essential amino acid content from acorn seeds was low
   based on FAO reference values. Acorn seeds were a good source of Fe, Zn,
   and Mn. The contents of vitamins A and E were 1.40 mg RE/100 g and 10.78
   mg/100 g, respectively. Starch extracted from acorn seeds had round,
   triangle, and elliptical morphology with granule size of 3.3-126.2 mu m.
   The ratio between amylose and amylopectin contents was 25.39:72.94.
   Acorn starch had a typical A-type crystal pattern with 23.53\% relative

Abstract = {{The impact of electromagnetic stirring (EMS) upon the microstructure and

   consisted of a partially melted zone, a columnar grain zone, and a
   transition structure. Under the action of EMS, a fine spheroidal grain
   structure formed in the Al/Ti joint and, compared with the traditional
   Al/Ti resistance spot weld, the weld created under the EMS effect
   exhibited a larger bonding diameter, and higher tensile shear force and

Abstract = {{Loss of oligodendrocytes as the result of central nervous system disease
   causes demyelination that impairs axon function. Effective directional
   migration of endogenous or grafted oligodendrocyte precursor cells
   (OPCs) to a lesion is crucial in the neural remyelination process. In
   this study, the migration of OPCs in electric fields (EFs) was
   investigated. We found that OPCs migrated anodally in applied EFs, and
   the directedness and displacement of anodal migration increased
   significantly when the EF strength increased from 50 to 200 mV/mm.
   However, EFs did not significantly affect the cell migration speed. The
   transcriptome of OPCs subjected to EF stimulation (100 and 200 mV/mm)
   was analyzed using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), and results were verified
   by the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A
   Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that
   the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that signals cell migration
   was significantly upregulated in cells treated with an EF of 200 mV/mm
   compared with control cells. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed
   the down-regulation of differentially expressed genes in chemotaxis.
   This study suggests that an applied EF is an effective cue to guiding
   OPC migration in neural regeneration and that transcriptional analysis
   contributes to the understanding of the mechanism of EF-guided cell
   migration.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial resistance to the third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics
   has become a major concern for public health. This study was aimed to
   determine the characteristics and distribution of bla(CTX-M-14), which
   encodes an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, in Escherichia coli
   isolated from Guangdong Province, China. A total of 979 E. coli isolates
   isolated from healthy or diseased food-producing animals including swine
   and avian were examined for bla(CTX-M-14) and then the
   bla(CTX-M-14\_)positive isolates were detected by other resistance
   determinants {[}extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes, plasmid-mediated
   quinolone resistance, rmtB, and floR] and analyzed by phylogenetic
   grouping analysis, PCR-based plasmid replicon typing, multilocus
   sequence typing, and plasmid analysis. The genetic environments of
   bla(CTX-M-14) were also determined by PCR. The results showed that
   fourteen CTX-M-14-producing E. coli were identified, belonging to groups
   A (7/14), B1 (4/14), and D (3/14). The most predominant resistance gene
   was bla(TEM) (n = 8), followed by floR (n = 7), oqxA (n = 3),
   aac(6')-1b-cr (n = 2), and rmtB (n = 1). Plasmids carrying bla(CTX-M-14)
   were classified to IncK, IncHI2, IncHI1, IncN, IncFIB, IncF or Inch,
   ranged from about 30 to 200 kb, and with insertion sequence of ISEcp1,
   IS26, or ORF513 located upstream and IS903 downstream of bla(CTX-M-14).
   The result of multilocus sequence typing showed that 14 isolates had 11
   STs, and the 11 STs belonged to five groups. Many of the identified
   sequence types are reported to be common in E. coli isolates associated
   with extraintestinal infections in humans, suggesting possible
   transmission of bla(CTX-M-14) between animals and humans. The difference
   in the flanking sequences of bla(CTX-M-14) between the 2009 isolates and
   the early ones suggests that the resistance gene context continues to
   evolve in E. coli of food producing animals.}},

Abstract = {{Current extraction methods for in situ C-14 from quartz {[}e.g., Lifton
   et al., (2001), Pigati et al., (2010), Hippe et al., (2013)1 are
   time-consuming and repetitive, making them an attractive target for
   automation. We report on the status of in situ C-14 extraction and
   purification systems originally automated at the University of Arizona
   that have now been reconstructed and upgraded at the Purdue Rare Isotope
   Measurement Laboratory (PRIME Lab). The Purdue in situ C-14 laboratory
   builds on the flow-through extraction system design of Pigati et al.
   (2010), automating most of the procedure by retrofitting existing valves
   with external servo-controlled actuators, regulating the pressure of
   research purity O-2 inside the furnace tube via a PID-based pressure
   controller in concert with an inlet mass flow controller, and installing
   an automated liquid N-2 distribution system, all driven by LabView (R)
   software. A separate system for cryogenic CO2 purification, dilution,
   and splitting is also fully automated, ensuring a highly repeatable
   process regardless of the operator. We present results from procedural
   blanks and an intercomparison material (CRONUS-A), as well as results of
   experiments to increase the amount of material used in extraction, from
   the standard 5 g to 10 g or above. Results thus far are quite promising
   with procedural blanks comparable to previous work and significant
   improvements in reproducibility for CRONUS-A measurements. The latter
   analyses also demonstrate the feasibility of quantitative extraction of
   in situ C-14 from sample masses up to 10 g. Our lab is now analyzing
   unknowns routinely, but lowering overall blank levels is the focus of
   ongoing research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   during solution heat treatment, simulated at the spectrometer. This
   involved designing and incorporating a unique heating system for the
   engine blocks. The results indicated gradual relief in residual strain
   with time due to creep until strain was completely relieved.
   Furthermore, post-treatment cooling led to the development of tensile
   residual strain due to thermo-mechanical mismatch between the gray iron

Abstract = {{A novel magnetic imprinted electrochemical sensor was developed based on
   magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for sensitive
   determination of kanamycin in complicated matrixes. The magnetic
   molecularly imprinted polymers (MMIPs) were prepared based on MWCNT
   decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles using kanamycin as the template molecule
   and methacrylic acid (MAA) as the functional monomer. The performance of
   the imprinted sensor was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
   differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in detail. The sensitivity of the
   magnetic imprinted electrochemical sensor was improved attributing to
   the large specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity of
   the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).
   Under the optimum conditions, the response currents of the magnetic
   imprinted electrochemical sensor exhibited a linear relationship toward
   the negative logarithm of kanamycin concentrations ranged from 1.0 x
   10(-10) mol L-1 to 1.0 x 10(-6) mol L-1 with a detection limit of 2.3 x
   10(-11) mol L-1 (signal to noise ratio is 3). The magnetic imprinted

Abstract = {{Dynamical localization, i.e., the absence of secular spreading of a
   quantum or classical wave packet, is usually associated with
   Hamiltonians by the pure point spectrum, i.e., with a normalizable and
   complete set of eigenstates. Such systems always show quasi-periodic
   dynamics (recurrence). Here, we show, rather counter-intuitively, that
   dynamical localization can be observed in Hamiltonians with an
   absolutely continuous spectrum, where recurrence effects are forbidden.
   An optical realization of such a Hamiltonian is proposed based on beam
   propagation in a self-imaging optical resonator with a phase grating.
   Localization without recurrence in this system is explained in terms of
   pseudoBloch optical oscillations. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Imitating winner or sympathizing loser? Quadratic effects on cooperative

Abstract = {{Cooperation is vital in human societies and therefore is widely
   investigated in the evolutionary game theory. Varieties of mechanisms
   have been proposed to overcome temptation and promote cooperation.
   Existing studies usually believe that agents are rational, but
   irrationalism such as emotions and feelings matters as well. Winner and
   loser are defined by their payoffs. In addition to admiring and
   imitating winners, the mechanism of sympathizing and imitating losers is
   introduced into the model as an alternative action rule, and each one
   plays the prisoners' dilemma game with eight neighbors under the
   influence of both irrationalism and rationalism. Rationalism refers to
   imitating winner to get highest payoff, and irrationalism means that
   people sympathize and adopt the actions of losers. As it is widely
   recognized that temptation reduces cooperation, this study focuses on
   the effect of sympathy on cooperation within a certain group or society.
   If it overcomes temptation that leads to defection, sympathy will be a
   powerful mechanism to promote cooperative behavior. Simulation results
   indicate that sympathy and temptation shares similar quadratic
   relationships with cooperation. Both sympathy and temptation undermine
   cooperation below their thresholds, and they both promote cooperation
   above their thresholds. Temptation not only reduces cooperation but also
   promote it as temptation goes beyond the threshold. Although sympathy is
   a good merit or human nature that is beneficial to society, a crisis or
   collapse of cooperation is inevitable when the sympathy propensity is
   relatively smaller. After cooperation reaches a minimal bottom, it then
   rises increasingly and dramatically, which brings a much brighter future
   of the society. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer can be considered as an open, complex, (bio-thermo)dynamic and

Abstract = {{Ag-21Cu-25Sn alloy ribbon as a promising intermediate temperature alloy
   solder (400-600 degrees C) was prepared by melt spinning technique in
   this paper. Rare earth La was added into Ag-21 Cu-25Sn alloy to refine
   the microstructures and improve the wettabilities of as-prepared alloy
   solders. The phase constitutions, microstructures, melting temperatures
   and wettabilities of selected specimens were respectively tested. The
   results showed that the dominant phase constitutions of Ag-21Cu-25Sn-xLa
   alloy ribbons were Ag3Sn and Cu3Sn. The grain size of Ag-21Cu-25Sn-xLa
   alloy decreased with the addition of La increasing. La addition reduced
   the melting temperatures of Ag-21Cu-25Sn-xLa alloy ribbons, and
   effectively improved the wettabilities of the alloy ribbons. When the
   addition of La was 0.5 wt\%, the wettability of as-prepared alloy solder
   achieved the optimal value of 158 cm(2) g(-1), under brazing temperature
   600 degrees C and dwell time 15 min. In addition, raising brazing
   temperature and prolonging dwell time could improve the wettability of
   Ag-21 Cu-25Sn-xLa alloy ribbon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Kluyveromyces lactis is an established host for the secretory production

   protein (EGFP) in K. lactis mediated by nine secretion signals
   originating from different filamentous fungi - Aspergillus niger,

   Trichoderma reesei were investigated. EGFP was fused to the carboxyl
   terminus of signals and was expressed under the control of the lac4
   promoter. In all the cases, EGFP was secreted into the extracellular
   fluid. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blot analysis of
   the culture supernatant, and fluorescence measurements confirmed the
   efficient secretion of EGFP mediated by the novel secretion sequences.
   In addition, we confirmed that codon optimization and addition of kex2
   protease cleavage site in filamentous fungal signal peptide elevated the
   expression level of recombinant proteins. Efficiency of fungal signal
   peptide in secretion of other heterologous proteins was demonstrated
   through secretion of recombinant human interferon beta. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper explores the differentials in youth development patterns
   determined by the economic condition of the household in India. The
   wealth index is used to glean youth development differentials in the
   different economic categories of the household. The findings suggest
   that youth from the bottom 20 per cent (poorest) of households are
   deprived in education, employment, labour force and are not working
   currently compared to youth from the middle and rich households. The
   states differ in youth development patterns (employment, appropriate
   education, skill development and awareness about health). There are more
   working youth among poor households than among rich households in India.
   Female youth are more disadvantaged compared to male youth and it is the
   same with the rural-urban distribution of youth. This paper concludes
   that the various economic categories/wealth index (poorest, poorer,

Title = {{The Sum of Tumour-to-Brain Ratios Improves the Accuracy of Diagnosing
   Gliomas Using 18F-FET PET}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Gliomas are common brain tumours, but obtaining tissue for definitive
   diagnosis can be difficult. There is, therefore, interest in the use of
   non-invasive methods to diagnose and grade the disease. Although
   positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorethyltyrosine (18F-FET)
   can be used to differentiate between low-grade (LGG) and high-grade
   (HGG) gliomas, the optimal parameters to measure and their cut-points
   have yet to be established. We therefore assessed the value of single
   and dual time-point acquisition of 18F-FET PET parameters to
   differentiate between primary LGGs (n = 22) and HGGs (n = 24). PET
   examination was considered positive for glioma if the metabolic activity
   was 1.6-times higher than that of background (contralateral) brain, and
   maximum tissue-brain ratios (TBRmax) were calculated 10 and 60 min after
   isotope administration with their sums and differences calculated from
   individual time-point values. Using a threshold-based method, the
   overall sensitivity of PET was 97\%. Several analysed parameters were
   significantly different between LGGs and HGGs. However, in a receiver
   operating characteristics analysis, TBR sum had the best diagnostic
   accuracy of 87\% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
   predictive values of 100\%, 72.7\%, 80\%, and 100\%, respectively.
   18F-FET PET is valuable for the non-invasive determination of glioma
   grade, especially when dual time-point metrics are used. TBR sum shows
   the greatest accuracy, sensitivity, and negative predictive value for
   tumour grade differentiation and is a simple method to implement.
   However, the cut-off may differ between institutions and calibration
   strategies would be useful.}},

Abstract = {{Geopolymer concrete reinforced with glass-fibre-reinforced polymer
   (GFRP) bars can provide a construction system with high durability, high
   sustainability, and adequate strength. Few studies deal with the
   combined use of these materials, and this has been the key motivation of
   this undertaking. In this study, the flexural strength and
   serviceability performance of the geopolymer concrete beams reinforced
   with GFRP bars were evaluated under a four-point static bending test.
   The parameters investigated were nominal bar diameter, reinforcement
   ratio, and anchorage system. Based on the experimental results, the bar
   diameter had no significant effect on the flexural performance of the
   beams. Generally, the serviceability performance of a beam is enhanced
   when the reinforcement ratio increases. The mechanical interlock and
   friction forces provided by the sand coating was adequate to secure an
   effective bond between the GFRP bars and the geopolymer concrete.
   Generally, the ACI 4401.R-06 and CSA S806-12 prediction equations
   underestimate the beam strength. The bending-moment capacity of the
   tested beams was higher than that of FRP-reinforced concrete beams from
   the previous studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A simplified procedure for Nonlinear Static analysis of masonry infilled
   RC frames}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{591-608}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Masonry walls are widely used in existing Reinforced Concrete (RC)
   structures, either as external infill or as internal partitions.
   Although their mechanical contribution is usually neglected in
   structural analysis and design, they significantly affect the seismic
   response of RC frames. This paper proposes a simplified procedure based
   on NonLinear Static (NLS) analysis for evaluating the seismic response
   of masonry infilled RC frames. NonLinear Time History (NLTH) analyses
   are firstly carried out for understanding the actual seismic response of
   such frames. To this end, an ``equivalent-strut{''} model available in
   the scientific literature is considered for simulating the nonlinear
   response of masonry walls under the cyclic actions induced by seismic
   shakings. Then, based on the results of such NLTH analyses, the
   aforementioned simplified NLS procedure is formulated by unveiling a
   stable correlation between the observed dynamic response and a simple
   scalar parameter that can be easily determined through two NLS analyses
   carried out on the infilled frame and the corresponding bare one. A
   statistical description of the accuracy and reliability of the proposed
   method is finally proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a hybrid preclinical imaging scanner that optimally supports
   image acquisition in both reflection-mode ultrasonography and
   optoacoustic (OA) tomography modes. The system comprises a
   quasi-full-ring tomographic geometry capable of the simultaneous
   dual-mode imaging through entire cross sections of mice with in-plane
   spatial resolution in the range of 150 and 350 mu m in the respective OA
   and ultrasound (US) imaging modes with an imaging speed of up to 10
   two-dimensional frames per second. Three-dimensional whole-body data is
   subsequently rendered by rapid scanning of the imaged plane. The system
   further incorporates rapid laser wavelength tuning for real-time
   acquisition of multispectral OA data, which enables studies of
   longitudinal dynamics as well as fast kinetics and biodistribution of
   contrast agents. In vivo imaging performance is demonstrated by
   label-free hybrid anatomical scans through living mice, as well as
   real-time visualization of optical contrast agent perfusion. By setting
   new standards for wholebody tomographic imaging performance in both the
   OA and pulse-echo US modes, the developed hybrid imaging approach is
   expected to benefit numerous applications where the availability of
   high-quality structural information provided by the tomographic
   reflection-mode US can ease interpretation of the functional and
   molecular imaging results attained by the OA modality. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab (TM)) technology is an effective way of
   delivering hydrophobic chemotherapeutics. We developed a
   one-pot/one-step formulation of paclitaxel (PTX)-bound albumin
   nanoparticles with embedded tumor necrosis factor-related
   apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/PTX HSA-NP) for the treatment of
   pancreatic cancer. TRAIL/PTX HSA-NPs were fabricated using a
   high-pressure homogenizer at a TRAIL feeding ratio of 0.2\%, 1.0\%, and
   2.0\%. TRAIL/PTX HSA-NPs were spherical and became larger in size
   (170-230 nm) with increasing TRAIL amount (0.2-2.0\%). The loading
   efficiencies of PTX were in the range of similar to 86.4\% and
   significantly low at 2.0\% TRAIL (60.4\%). Specifically, the inhibitory
   concentrations (IC50) of TRAIL (1.0 or 2.0\%)/PTX HSA-NPs were >20-fold
   lower than that of plain PTX-HSA NP (0.032 +/- 0.06, 0.022 +/- 0.005,
   and 0.96 +/- 0.15 ng/ml, respectively) in pancreatic Mia Paca-2 cells.
   Considering TRAIL loading, bioactivity, and particle size,
   TRAIL(1.0\%)/PTX HSA-NPs were determined as the optimal candidate for
   further studies. TRAIL(1.0\%)/PTX HSA-NPs displayed substantially
   greater apoptotic activity than plain PTX HSA-NP in both FACS and TUNEL
   analysis. The loaded PTX and TRAIL were gradually released from the
   TRAIL(1.0\%)/PTX HSA-NPs until similar to 24 h, which is considered to
   be a sufficient time for delivery to the tumor tissue. TRAIL(1.0\%)/PTX
   HSA-NP displayed markedly more antitumor efficacy than plain PTX HSA-NP
   in Mia Paca-2 cell-xenografted mice in terms of tumor volume (size) and
   weight (213.9 mm(3) and 0.18 g vs. 1126.8 mm(3) and 0.80 g,
   respectively). These improved in vitro and in vivo performances were due
   to the combined synergistic effects of PTX and TRAIL. We believe that
   this TRAIL/PTX HSA-NP would have potential as a novel apoptosis-based
   anticancer agent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In March 2011, vast amounts of radionuclides were released into the
   environment due to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (F1NPP)
   accident. However, very little work has been done concerning
   accident-derived long-lived nuclides such as I-129 (T-1/2 = 1.57 x 10(7)
   year) and Cl-36 (T-1/2 = 3.01 x 10(5) year). I-129 and I-131 are both
   produced by U-235 fission in nuclear reactors. Being isotopes of iodine,
   these nuclides are expected to behave similarly in the environment. This
   makes I-129 useful for retrospective reconstruction of I-131
   distribution during the initial stages of the accident. On the other
   hand, Cl-36 is generated during reactor operation via neutron capture
   reaction of Cl-35, an impurity in the coolant or reactor component.
   Resulting Cl-36/Cl ratio within the reactor is thus much higher compared
   to that in environment. Similar to I-129, Cl-36 is expected to have
   leaked out during the accident and it is important to evaluate its
   effects. In this study, I-129 concentrations were determined in several
   surface soil samples collected around F1NPP. Average I-129/I-131 ratio
   was estimated to be 26.1 +/- 5.8 as of March 11, 2011, consistent with
   calculations using ORIGEN2 code and other published data. Cl-36/Cl
   ratios in some of the soil samples were likewise measured and ranged
   from 1.1 x 10(-12) to 2.6 x 10(-11). These are higher compared to ratios
   measured around F1NPP before the accident. A positive correlation
   between Cl-36 and I-129 concentration was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment or the hematopoietic stem cell
   (HSC) niche is normally hypoxic, which maintains HSC quiescence.
   Paradoxically, transplanted HSCs rapidly proliferate in this niche.
   Pretransplant myelosuppression results in a substantial rise in oxygen
   levels in the marrow microenvironment due to reduced cellularity and
   consequent low oxygen consumption. Therefore, it may be construed that
   the rapid proliferation of the engrafted HSCs in the BM niche is
   facilitated by the transiently elevated oxygen tension in this milieu
   during the engraftment window. To determine whether oxygen tension
   dominantly affects the regeneration of hematopoiesis in the BM niche, we
   created an oxygen-independent hypoxic niche by treating BM-derived
   mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) with a hypoxia-mimetic compound,
   cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and cocultured them with BM-derived HSC-enriched
   cells under normoxic conditions (HSCs; CoCl2-cocultures). Cocultures
   with untreated BMSCs incubated under normoxia (control- cocultures) or
   hypoxia (1\% O-2; hypoxic-cocultures) were used as comparators.
   Biochemical analyses showed that though, both CoCl2 and hypoxia evoked
   comparable signals in the BMSCs, the regeneration of hematopoiesis in
   their respective cocultures was radically different. The CoCl2-BMSCs
   supported robust hematopoiesis, while the hypoxic-BMSCs exerted strong
   inhibition. The hematopoiesis-supportive ability of CoCl2-BMSCs was
   abrogated if the CoCl2-cocultures were incubated under hypoxia,
   demonstrating that the prevalent oxygen tension in the milieu dominantly
   affects the outcome of the HSC-BM niche interactions. Our data suggest
   that pharmacologically delaying the reestablishment of hypoxia in the BM
   may boost post-transplant regeneration of hematopoiesis.}},

Abstract = {{Novel nanocomposite membranes were prepared by infiltration of a blend
   of sulfonated PEEK (SPEEK) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), using water as
   solvent, into electrospun nanolibers of SPEEK blended with polyvinyl
   butyral (PVB). The membranes were characterized for their application on
   Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) operating at moderate temperatures
   (>80 degrees C). An important role of the solvent on the crosslinking
   temperature for the SPEEK-PVA system was observed. A mat of hydrated
   SPEEK-30\%PVB nanofibers revealed higher proton conductivity in
   comparison with a dense membrane of similar composition. Incorporation
   of the nanoliber mats to the SPEEK-35\%PVA matrix provided mechanical
   stability, methanol barrier properties and certain proton conductivity
   up to a crosslinking temperature of 120 degrees C. Not remarkable effect
   of the nanofibers was found above that crosslinking temperature. The
   combined effect of the nanofibers and crosslinking temperature on the
   properties of the membranes is discussed. DIV1FC performance experiments
   concluded promising results for this new low-cost type of membranes,
   although further optimization steps are still required. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The germline-specific role of telomeres consists of chromosome end
   elongation and proper chromosome segregation during early developmental
   stages. Despite the crucial role of telomeres in germ cells, little is
   known about telomere biology in the germline. We analyzed telomere
   homeostasis in the Drosophila female germline and early embryos. A novel
   germline-specific function of deadenylase complex Ccr4-Not in the
   telomeric transcript surveillance mechanism is reported. Depletion of
   Ccr4-Not complex components causes strong derepression of the telomeric
   retroelement HeT-A in the germ cells, accompanied by elongation of the
   HeT-A poly(A) tail. Dysfunction of transcription factors Woc and Trf2,
   as well as RNA-binding protein Ars2, also results in the accumulation of
   excessively polyadenylated HeT-A transcripts in ovaries. Germline
   knockdowns of Ccr4-Not components, Woc, Trf2 and Ars2, lead to abnormal
   mitosis in early embryos, characterized by chromosome missegregation,
   centrosome dysfunction and spindle multipolarity. Moreover, the observed
   phenotype is accompanied by the accumulation of HeT-A transcripts around
   the centrosomes in early embryos, suggesting the putative relationship
   between overexpression of telomeric transcripts and mitotic defects. Our
   data demonstrate that Ccr4-Not, Woc, Trf2 and Ars2, components of
   different regulatory pathways, are required for telomere protection in
   the germline in order to guarantee normal development.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate the association between preoperative carriage of
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and the
   development of surgical site infections (SSIs) following tibial plateau
   leveling osteotomy (TPLO) in dogs.
   Design-Prospective multicenter study.
   Animals-549 dogs.
   Procedures-At 7 veterinary hospitals, swab specimens were obtained from
   the pharynx, nares, rectum, and skin of dogs admitted for TPLO.
   Specimens were submitted for culture of MRSP. For each dog, information
   regarding preoperative and postoperative antimicrobial administration,
   comorbidities, contact with other dogs, and whether the dog developed an
   SSI was obtained. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed
   to identify variables associated with preoperative and postoperative
   MRSP colonization and the development of an SSI.
   Results-Of the 549 study dogs, 24 (4.4\%) were identified as MRSP
   carriers before TPLO and 37 (6.7\%) developed an SSI after TPLO.
   Bacteriologic culture was performed on specimens obtained from 32 of the
   37 SSIs, and MRSP was isolated from 11 (34\%). Carriers of MRSP (OR,
   6.72; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 2.12 to 21.4) and Bulldogs (OR,
   11.1; 95\% CI, 2.07 to 59.3) were at risk for development of an SSI
   after TPLO, whereas postoperative administration of antimicrobials (OR,
   0.36; 95\% CI, 0.15 to 0.91) appeared to protect against development of
   an SSI.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that carriage of
   MRSP were a risk factor for development of an SSI after TPLO and
   measures to rapidly identify and treat MRSP carriers are warranted.

Abstract = {{Although impurity doping of nanocrystals is essential in controlling
   their physical properties for various applications, the doping mechanism
   of ultrasmall, colloidal II-VI semiconductor nanocrystals, corresponding
   to the initial stages of growth, is not yet understood. In this study
   the concentrations of Mn2+ ions in the core, on the surface, and as an
   agglomerated separate phase in 2.9 nm cubic ZnS nanocrystals, prepared
   by a surfactant-assisted liquid liquid synthesis within 20 to 20 000 ppm
   nominal impurity concentration range, have been determined by
   quantitative multifrequency electron paramagnetic resonance. The
   unexpected strong decrease in the core doping efficiency with the
   nominal concentration increase, in contrast to the small variation of
   the doping efficiency for the surface-bound Mn2+ ions, and the sizable
   core doping efficiency observed for 1.8 nm nanocrystals were explained
   with the extended lattice defect assisted mechanism of incorporation.
   According to this mechanism, which is not size or shape limited, being
   active from the initial growth stages, the incorporation of Mn2+ ions
   takes place at surface sites with high binding energy on dislocation
   steps formed by the emerging stacking defects. High resolution
   transmission electron microscopy confirms the presence of such stacking
   defects in a large proportion of the investigated cubic ZnS
   nanocrystals, ensuring the operation of the proposed doping mechanism.}},

   low-density foams with complex geometries. Polylactide (PLA) bead
   foaming has been of the great interest of researchers due to its origin
   from renewal resources and biodegradability. However, due to the PLA's
   low melt strength and slow crystallization kinetics, the attempts have
   been limited to the manufacturing methods used for expanded polystyrene
   (EPS). In this study, we developed microcellular PLA bead foams with
   double crystal melting peak structure in a large content using a
   lab-scale autoclave system followed by molding of the beads. PLA bead
   foams were produced with expansion ratios and average cell sizes ranging
   from 6 to 31-fold and 6 to 50 mu m, respectively. The high-melting point
   crystals generated during gas-saturation significantly affected the
   expansion ratio and cell density of the PLA bead foams by enhancing the
   PLA's melt strength and promoting cell nucleation around the crystals.
   The tensile properties of the molded EPLA bead foams showed that EPLA
   bead foams with double crystal melting peak can be a promising
   substitute not only for EPS but also for expanded polypropylene (EPP)
   bead foams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The complexes formed by two polyphenols, trans-Ferulic acid (FA) and
   Gallic acid (GA) with 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD), by
   the spray-drying method, were studied. Encapsulation-efficiencies (EE)
   of the complexes prepared were evaluated by HPLC. In the case of
   co-encapsulation, the EE of GA was lowered, whereas that of FA was
   almost stable, indicating a possible antagonistic relationship between
   the two phenols for the HP beta CD cavity. The physicochemical
   characterization of the complexes was carried out by Fourier Transform
   Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC),
   and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). SEM observations revealed that
   the coencapsulated phenolic complex resulted in a more rounded shape
   outer surfaces of HP beta CD than when encapsulated separately. FT-IR
   and DSC data indicated that the two polyphenols exhibit a possible
   interaction in the coencapsulated complex. The complexes showed no loss
   of their ability to scavenge DPPH radical relatively to the single agent
   at the concentrations used. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Radioisotopes, produced in stars and ejected into the Interstellar
   Medium, are important for constraining stellar and early Solar System
   (ESS) models. In particular, the half-life of the radioisotope, Fe-60,
   can have an impact on calculations for the timing for ESS events, the
   distance to nearby Supernovae, and the brightness of individual,
   non-steady-state Fe gamma ray sources in the Galaxy. A half-life
   measurement has been undertaken at the University of Notre Dame and
   measurements of the Fe-60/Fe-56 concentration of our samples using
   Accelerator Mass Spectrometry has begun. This result will be coupled
   with an activity measurement of the isomeric decay in Co-60, which is
   the decay product of Fe. Preliminary half-life estimates of (2.53 +/-

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the grade of valuable elements and its variation is not
   sufficient for geometallurgy. Minerals define not only the value of the
   deposit, but also the method of extraction and concentration. A number
   of methods for obtaining mineral grades were evaluated with a focus on
   geometallurgical applicability, precision and trueness. For a
   geometallurgical program, the number of samples to be analyzed is large,
   therefore a method for obtaining mineral grades needs to be
   cost-efficient, relatively fast, and reliable. Automated mineralogy
   based on scanning electron microscopy is generally regarded as the most
   reliable method for analyzing mineral grades. However, the method is
   time demanding and expensive. Quantitative X-ray diffraction has a
   relatively high detection limit, 0.5\%, while the method is not suitable
   for some base and precious metal ores, it still provides significant
   details on gangue mineral grades. The application of the
   element-to-mineral conversion has been limited to the simple mineralogy
   because the number of elements analyzed limits the number of calculable
   mineral grades. This study investigates a new method for the estimation
   of mineral grades applicable for geometallurgy by combining both the
   element-to-mineral conversion method and quantitative X-ray diffraction
   with Rietveld refinement. The proposed method not only delivers the
   required turnover for geometallurgy, but also overcomes the shortcomings
   if quantitative X-ray diffraction or element-to-mineral is used alone.

Abstract = {{Delta C-14 values of leaves of a deciduous tree record to those of
   atmospheric CO2 within error and were used to map out Delta C-14
   distribution in Korea. We collected ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba Linnaeus, a
   deciduous tree) leaf samples in mid-June to early July from 2009 to 2013
   in Korea to obtain the regional distribution of Delta C-14. Commonly CO2
   emitted from fossil fuel consumption dilutes atmospheric Delta C-14,
   while operations and accidents at nuclear power plants can increase it.
   The distribution maps of Delta C-14 from 2010 to 2013 in Korea shows
   that Delta C-14 values in the northwestern and southeastern parts of
   Korea are lower than those of the other parts of Korea, which is
   consistent with the population and industry patterns. Decrease rates of
   annually averaged Delta C-14 values in Korea over the study period are
   larger than those of Pt. Barrow, Alaska, USA (71.3 degrees N, 156.5
   degrees W), so the difference between them and those of Pt. Barrow,
   Alaska, USA became larger annually. This may be due to the increase in
   fossil fuel consumption in Korea and China. The decrease rate between
   2010 and 2011 was smaller than in other years. This could be the effect
   of the Fukushima power plant accident which occurred in March 11, 2011,
   but further study is needed to clarify it. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The present study describes the anti-leukemic potential of a novel
   stereo bioactive secondary metabolite,
   (R)-5-hydroxy-2-methylchroman-4-one (HMC) isolated from a novel
   endophytic fungus source (Cryptosporiopsis sp. H2-1, NFCCI-2856),
   associated with Clidemia hirta. HMC inhibited cell proliferation of
   different cancer cell lines with IC50 values in the range of 8-55 mu
   g/ml. The cytotoxicity window of HMC was 6-12 times lower in normal
   cells as compared to susceptible leukemic HL-60, MOLT-4 and K-562 cells.
   It persuades apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in
   above leukemic cell lines, which was evident through Hoechst staining,
   Annexin-V binding, cell cycle analysis, loss of mitochondrial membrane
   potential (Delta psi m), release of cytochrome c, Bax, Bid,
   over-expression of apical death receptors, activation of caspase-3,-8,-9
   and PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) cleavage. HMC induced caspase
   dependent apoptosis and robustly attenuate transcription factor,
   p-STAT-3 in myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells. The mechanism of HMC
   arbitrated inhibition of p-STAT-3 was due to the activation of ubiquitin
   dependent degradation of p-STAT-3. Therefore, our study not only
   describes the anti-leukemic potential of HMC but also provides insights
   into how endophytes can be useful in discovery and development of novel
   anticancer therapeutics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A theory for thermodynamic induction (TI) under isothermal conditions is
   presented. This includes a treatment of the Helmholtz free energy budget
   available for a gate variable to utilize towards aiding another
   variable's approach towards thermodynamic equilibrium. This energy
   budget could be used to help create interesting physical structures and
   examples of order-by-induction. I also show how to treat TI in the
   continuum limit which can be obtained from a variational principle.
   Several important examples of isothermal TI have been discussed,
   including a type of electromigration that may be detectable in
   electrolytes, superfluids and semiconductors. As an example of a
   bottlenecked system exhibiting enhanced TI, manipulation of atoms and
   molecules by STM has been discussed in detail. My considerations provide
   strong support for microscopic bond-breaking mechanisms being governed
   by a general thermodynamic principle. In particular, I show that induced
   entropy trapping can explain the level of control that sliding-type
   manipulations demonstrate. The most reasonable choices for the
   parameters input into the simple formula give a threshold condition for
   srm manipulations that is strikingly close to what is required to match
   results reported in the literature. My continuum model predicts the
   shape of the adsorbate potential well for the STM case and from this I
   predict a level of force detectable by AFM. A final proposal, and
   example of orderby-induction, predict a long tether may be constructed
   between sample and tip that is just one atom thick. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{A material selection approach to evaluate material substitution for

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Abstract = {{Weight reduction is commonly adopted in vehicle design as a means for
   energy and emissions savings. However, selection of lightweight
   materials is often focused on performance characteristics, which may
   lead to sub optimizations of life cycle environmental impact. Therefore
   systematic material selection processes are needed that integrate weight
   optimization and environmental life cycle assessment. This paper
   presents such an approach and its application to design of an automotive
   component. Materials from the metal, hybrid and polymer families were
   assessed, along with a novel self-reinforced composite material that is
   a potential lightweight alternative to non-recyclable composites. It was
   shown that materials offering the highest weight saving potential offer
   limited life cycle environmental benefit due to energy demanding
   manufacturing. Selection of the preferable alternative is not a
   straightforward process since results may be sensitive to critical but
   uncertain aspects of the life cycle. Such aspects need to be evaluated
   to determine the actual benefits of lightweight design and to base
   material selection on more informed choices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{5-HT4 and 5-HT6 serotonergic receptors are located in brain structures
   involved in memory processes. Neurochemical and behavioural studies have
   demonstrated that acute activation of 5-HT4 receptors (5-HT4R) or
   blockade of 5-HT6 receptors (5-HT6R) improves memory. To evaluate the
   potential of these two receptors as targets in the treatment of memory
   disorders encountered in several situations (ageing, Alzheimer's
   disease, schizophrenia, etc.), it is necessary to assess whether their
   beneficial effects occur after chronic administration, and if such
   treatment induces adverse effects. The goal of this study was to assess
   the effects of chronic 5-HT4R or 5-HT6R modulation on recognition
   memory, and to observe the possible manifestation of side effects
   (modification of weight gain, locomotor activity or exploratory
   behaviour, etc.). Mice were treated for 14 days with a 5-HT4R partial
   agonist (RS-67333) or a 5-HT6R antagonist (SB-271046) at increasing
   doses. Memory performances, locomotor activity, and exploration were
   assessed. Both chronic 5-HT4R activation and 5-HT6R blockade extended
   memory traces in an object recognition test, and were not associated
   with any adverse effects in the parameters assessed. Chronic modulation
   of one or both of these receptors thus seems promising as a potential
   strategy for the treatment memory deficits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Aquatic centres are popular recreational facilities in Australia and
   other developed countries. These buildings have experienced exponential
   demand over the past few decades. The growing desire for better indoor
   environmental quality in aquatic centres has resulted in a marked
   increase in energy consumption in this sector. With the existence of
   multiple user groups, achieving thermal comfort has always been
   challenging. Even though several thermal comfort studies are conducted
   in other building types, such studies are very limited with respect to
   aquatic centres. This paper analyses the thermal comfort conditions of
   various user groups in seven aquatic centres in Australia. Comfort
   measurements are performed through monitoring environmental parameters
   and surveying swimmers, staff and spectators. The results revealed the
   variation of air temperatures among the buildings, resulting in high
   level of thermal discomfort for the spectators and staff in some of the
   buildings. The thermal sensation of the staff and spectators had good
   correlation with the indoor temperatures and PMVs. Altering temperature
   settings according to the seasons will help to improve the comfort with
   respect to the adaptation and expectation of the occupants. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Pyrolysis of a pulverized German brown coal was investigated using a new
   high pressurized drop tube reactor. Influence of temperature (600, 700,
   800 degrees C), pressure (25, 60 bar (g)) as well as residence time
   (variation of heated reactor length: 500, 1500, 2500 mm) on pyrolysis
   product yields as well as char and gas composition were evaluated.
   Particle heating and residence times of gas and particle in the heated
   reactor section were calculated based on the obtained data. To trace the
   pyrolysis progress during particle drop in the reactor tube gas sampling
   over reactor height was done. A good reactor performance and reliable
   results for the pyrolysis experiments could be obtained for the new
   reactor equipment. Only a slight pressure influence on product yields,
   char composition, and gas composition was found, which was contrary at
   the different temperatures. This indicates competing reactions taking
   place at the given conditions. Gas species evolution over the reactor
   height is mainly promoted by rising temperatures. The long gas residence
   times in the reactor and the obtained CH4, H-2, and C2 and C3
   hydrocarbon yields are a result of secondary cracking of tar and gaseous
   hydrocarbons at temperatures above 600 degrees C. Furthermore, it was
   found, that heterogeneous gasification reactions take place at higher
   temperatures as well. Comparison between thermogravimetric experiments
   in ``drop-in'' mode and the DTR results show significant differences
   attributed to heat transfer limitations in the particle bulk (TGA) and
   to the long gas residence times (78-368 s) in the drop tube reactor. (C)

Abstract = {{Free volatile compounds in six varieties of citrus juices were analyzed
   by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   Bound fractions were isolated and extracted with methanol and Amberlite
   XAD-2 resin and then hydrolyzed by almond beta-glucosidase. A total of
   43 free and 17 bound volatile compounds were identified in citrus. Free
   volatile contents in sweet orange were the most abundant, followed by
   those in grapefruits and mandarins. Among free volatiles, terpenes were
   the most abundant in citrus juice. Sensory analysis results showed that
   the flavor of the same citrus cultivars was similar, but the flavor of
   different cultivars varied. Among bound volatiles, benzenic compounds
   were the most abundant in these citrus juices. Bound volatiles also
   significantly differed among cultivars. In addition, only
   p-vinylguaiacol were detected in all of the samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An acetal-linked amphiphilic diblock copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)
   methyl ether-acetal-polyisobutene (abbreviated as mPEG-acetal-PIB), was
   synthesized via Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)
   ``Click{''} reaction. The chemical composition and structures of the
   copolymers were characterized by H-1 NMR and FT-IR analysis. The
   molecular weights and molecular weight distributions of the polymers
   were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The critical
   aggregation concentration (CAC), particle size parameters and
   morphologies of micelles self-assembled from mPEG-acetal-PIB in aqueous
   solution were determined by fluorescence probe method, dynamic light
   scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   respectively. The results showed that this amphiphilic diblock copolymer
   mPEG-acetal-PIB could self-assemble into spherical micelles in aqueous
   solution, and the average particle size of micelles was about 100 nm.
   Since the acetal group is unstable in weak acidic medium, it is
   anticipated that the diblock copolymer micelles can be dissociated in
   acidic environment. To verify this, DLS analysis was used to monitor the
   size change of micelles with the increase of degradation time under the
   acidic conditions. The degradation of acetal group in acidic environment
   resulted in the aggregation of PIB, which caused the increase of
   particle size. Subsequently, alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) was added
   into the micellar system to interact with PEG chain via inclusion
   complexation, resulting in the formation of physical-crosslinked
   supramolecular hydrogels. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to
   analyze the inclusion complexation and rheological test was used to
   monitor the gelation kinetics of hydrogels. The materials chosen to
   fabricate wound dressing should have good biocompatibility, thus in
   vitro cytotoxicity tests against L929 cells by MTT assays was carried
   out to study the biocompatibility of the copolymer and hydrogel. The
   results showed that the viability of L929 cells incubated with both the
   copolymer and hydrogel were higher than 80\%, indicating that the
   copolymer and hydrogel displayed low cytotoxicity. This biocompatible
   hydrogel provides a moist and cool environment on the wounds and can be
   degraded in the acidic conditions, reducing the risk of inflammation.
   Therefore, it will possess great potential in the application of wound
   dressing.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced leukocyte recruitment is an inflammatory process that occurs
   during early phases of the vascular dysfunction that characterises
   atherosclerosis. We evaluated the impact of anti-TNF-alpha (adalimumab,
   infliximab and etanercept) and anti-IL-12/23 (ustekinumab) on
   interactions between human leukocytes and endothelial cells in a flow
   chamber that reproduced in vivo conditions. Clinical concentrations of
   anti-TNF-alpha were evaluated on the leukocyte recruitment induced by a
   variety of endothelial (TNF-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, lymphotoxin-alpha
   and angiotensin-II) and leukocyte (PAF, IL-12 and IL-23) stimuli related
   to inflammation and atherosclerosis. Treatment with anti-TNF-alpha, even
   before or after establishing the inflammatory situation induced by
   TNF-alpha, diminished leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions induced by
   this stimuli. Our results also implicated adhesion molecules (ICAM-1,
   VCAM-1 and E-selectin) in the actions of anti-TNF-alpha in terms of
   leukocyte adhesion to endothelium. However, anti-TNF-alpha drugs did not
   influence the actions of interleuldn-1 beta, but prevented those of
   lymphotoxin-alpha and angiotensin-II. However, once established,
   inflammatory response elicited by the latter three stimuli could not be
   reversed. Pre-treatment with anti-TNF-alpha, also prevented leukocyte
   actions induced by IL-23 on PBMC rolling flux and rolling velocity and
   by IL-12 on PMN adhesion. Ustekinumab exhibited a more discreet profile,
   having no effect on leukocyte recruitment induced by any of the
   endothelial stimuli, while blocking the effects of IL-23 on leukocyte
   activation and those of IL-12 on PMN adhesion and PAF on PBMC rolling
   velocity. These findings endorse the idea that biological
   anti-inflammatory drugs, in particular anti-TNF-alpha, have the capacity
   to influence cardiovascular risk accompanying psoriasis and rheumatoid
   arthritis by ameliorating vascular inflammation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{This work is dedicated to the development of MFI-type structure zeolite
   films (single-layer or bilayer) on the internal layer of a specific
   macroporous alumina tubular support for nanofiltration applications. The
   bottom MFI layer was obtained by direct hydrothermal synthesis while a
   secondary growth method was used for the top MFI layer. A complete
   characterization of the obtained MFI membranes (single-layer or bilayer)
   is proposed using various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction,
   scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry and nitrogen sorption
   measurements. Dense and highly crystallized films of MFI-type structure
   zeolite were obtained for both single-layer and bilayer MFI films. The
   total film thickness were around 7.1 +/- 0.5 mu m and 14.5 +/- 1 mu m
   for single-layer and bilayer MFI films respectively. The Si/Al molar
   ratio of the MFI films varied between 185 and 305 for single-layer and
   bilayer MFI films respectively. The hydraulic permeability of the
   tubular MFI membrane was achieved by the filtration of pure water. The
   hydraulic permeability of the single-layer and bilayer MFI membranes
   decreased rapidly at the beginning of the conditioning process, and
   stabilized at 1.08 x 10(-14) m(3) m(-2) and 1.02 x 10(-15) m(3) m(-2)
   after 15 h and the rejection rates of neutral solute (Vb 12) are 10\%

Abstract = {{The dielectric properties of elastomer composites formed by dispersions
   of bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) multiferroic filler particles in
   styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) were studied. The SBR/BiFeO3 films
   (10-100 mu m) were prepared in the presence of electric (E) or magnetic
   fields (H), showing remarkable characteristics in comparison with
   systems obtained in its absence. The dispersed multiferroic fillers form
   clusters of much smaller size when prepared under E or H. The dielectric
   constant, epsilon (measured up to 1 MHz), increases with BiFeO3
   concentration until reaching saturation. The rise of epsilon was
   obtained at concentrations much lower for samples prepared in the
   presence of E or H than in its absence. Saturation is assigned to
   connectivity between filler clusters at the largest concentrations,
   increasing leakage currents and limiting the dielectric behavior. The
   whole dependence of epsilon with BiFeO3 concentration was described
   using a proposed model. The dc resistivities, rho, increase with BiFeO3
   concentration but remain high (rho approximate to 10 G Omega.cm),
   allowing using the films as capacitors with filter action between 100
   kHz and 7 MHz. The films prepared in the presence of H present strong
   dependence of the ferroelectric response with magnetic fields applied
   after preparation; that is, electromagnetic coupling was observed in

Abstract = {{The pharmaceutical industry generates wastewater discharges of varying
   characteristics and contaminant concentrations depending on the nature
   of the production process. The main chemicals present in these effluents
   are solvents, detergents, disinfectants-such as sodium hypochlorite
   (NaClO)-and pharmaceutical products, all of which are potentially
   ecotoxic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the geno- and
   cytotoxicity induced in the common carp Cyprinus carpio by the effluent
   emanating from a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
   (NSAID)-manufacturing plant. Carp were exposed to the lowest observed
   adverse effect level (LOAEL, 0.1173\%) for 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, and
   biomarkers of genotoxicity (comet assay and micronucleus test) and
   cytotoxicity (caspase-3 activity and TUNEL assay) were evaluated. A
   significant increase with respect to the control group (p < 0.05)
   occurred with all biomarkers from 24 h on. Significant positive
   correlations were found between NSAID concentrations and biomarkers of
   geno- and cytotoxicity, as well as among geno- and cytotoxicity
   biomarkers. In conclusion, exposure to this industrial effluent induces
   geno- and cytotoxicity in blood of C. carpio. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is one of method used for Sr-90
   determination. It would enable rapid Sr-90 measurements from
   environmental samples such as water, soil, and milk. However, routine
   analysis of Sr-90 using AMS has not yet been achieved because of
   difficulties associated with isobaric separation and production of
   intense negative ion beams characterized by currents from hundreds of
   nanoamperes to several microamperes. We have developed a rapid procedure
   for preparing samples with optimum compositions for use with AMS, which
   enables production of intense Sr beam currents from an ion source.
   Samples of SrF2 were prepared from a standard Sr solution and
   agricultural soil. The time required to prepare a SrF2 sample from a
   soil sample was 10 h. Negative (SrF3-)-Sr-88 ions were successfully
   extracted at 500 nA from mixed samples of SrF2 and PbF2. In the present
   work, negative ions of Zr-90, included as an impurity, were accelerated
   with a tandem accelerator operated at a terminal voltage of 5 MV. Ions
   characterized by a charge state of 6+ were channeled into a gas counter.
   An atomic ratio of Zr-90/Sr-88 of 3 x 10(-8) was estimated for the soil
   sample. No signal was detected from the assay of PbF2, which was pressed
   in an aluminum cathode, for a mass number of 90. PbF2 revealed good
   performance in the production of negative SrF3- molecular ion beams and
   detection of Sr-90 with a gas counter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Valence Virtual Orbitals: An Unambiguous ab Initio Quantification of the
   LUMO Concept}},

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{Many chemical concepts hinge on the notion of an orbital called the
   lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, or LUMO. This hypothetical orbital
   and the much more concrete highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
   constitute the two ``frontier orbitals{''}, which rationalize a great
   deal of chemistry. A viable LUMO candidate should have a sensible energy
   value, a realistic shape with amplitude on those atoms where electron
   attachment or reduction or excitation processes occur, and often an
   antibonding correspondence to one of the highest occupied MOs.
   Unfortunately, today's quantum chemistry calculations do not yield
   useful empty orbitals. Instead, the empty canonical orbitals form a
   large sea of orbitals, where the interesting valence antibonds are
   scrambled with the basis set's polarization and diffuse augmentations.
   The LUMO is thus lost within a continuum associated with a detached
   electron, as well as many Rydberg excited states. A suitable alternative
   to the canonical orbitals is proposed, namely, the valence virtual
   orbitals. VVOs are found by a simple algorithm based on singular value
   decomposition, which allows for the extraction of all valence-like
   orbitals from the large empty canonical orbital space. VVOs are found to
   be nearly independent of the working basis set. The utility of VVOs is
   demonstrated for construction of qualitative MO diagrams, for prediction
   of valence excited states, and as starting orbitals for more
   sophisticated calculations. This suggests that VVOs are a suitable
   realization of the LUMO, LUMO + 1, ... concept. VVO generation requires
   no expert knowledge, as the number of VVOs sought is found by counting
   s-block atoms as having only a valence s orbital, transition metals as
   having valence s and d, and main group atoms as being valence s and p
   elements. Closed shell, open shell, or multireference wave functions and
   elements up to xenon may be used in the present program.}},

Abstract = {{Tuberculosis in children accounts for a significant proportion of the
   overall burden of disease, and yet for many years research into
   pediatric treatment has been neglected. Recently, there have been major
   developments in our understanding of pediatric tuberculosis, and a large
   number of studies are under way or planned. New drugs and regimens are
   being evaluated, and older drugs are being repurposed. Shorter regimens
   with potentially fewer side effects are being assessed for the treatment
   and prevention of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis.
   It may be possible to tailor treatment so that children with less severe
   disease are given shorter regimens, and weekly dosing is under
   investigation for preventive therapy and for the continuation phase of
   treatment. The interaction with human immunodeficiency virus and the
   management of tuberculosis meningitis are also likely to be better
   understood. Exciting times lie ahead for pediatric tuberculosis, but
   much work remains to be done.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{We derive a set of equations describing the linear response of the
   convergence properties of a geodesic congruence to arbitrary geometry
   variations. It is a combination of equations describing the deviations
   from the standard Raychaudhuri-type equations due to the geodesic shifts
   and an equation describing the geodesic shifts due to the geometry
   variations. In this framework, the geometry variations, which can be
   chosen arbitrarily, serve as probes to investigate the gravitational
   contraction processes from various angles. We apply the obtained
   framework to the case of conformal geometry variations, characterized by
   an arbitrary function f(x), and see that the formulas get simplified to
   a great extent. We investigate the response of the convergence
   properties of geodesics in the latest phase of gravitational
   contractions by restricting the class of conformal geometry variations
   to the one satisfying the strong energy condition. We then find out that
   in the final stage, f and D . Df control the overall contraction
   behavior and that the contraction rate gets larger when f is negative
   and vertical bar f vertical bar is so large as to overwhelm vertical bar
   D . Df vertical bar. (Here D . D is the Laplacian operator on the
   spatial hypersurfaces orthogonal to the geodesic congruence in concern.)
   To get more concrete insights, we also apply the framework to the
   time-reversed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model as the simplest case of
   the singularity formations.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure and tensile properties at temperatures up to 300
   degrees C of an experimental Al-7Si-1Cu-0. 5Mg (wt.\%) cast alloy with
   additions of Ti, V and Zr were assessed and compared with those of the
   commercial A380 grade. The microstructure of both alloys consisted of Al
   dendrites surrounded by Al Si eutectic containing, within its structure,
   the ternary Al-Al2Cu-Si phase. Whereas the Al-15(FeCrMn)(3)Si-2 phases
   were present in the A380 alloy, Ti/Zr/V together with Al and Si phases,
   Al(ZrTiV)Si, were identified in the experimental alloy. As a result of
   chemistry modification the experimental alloy achieved from 20\% to 40\%
   higher strength and from 1.5 to 5 times higher ductility than the A380
   reference grade. The role of chemistry in improving the alloy thermal
   stability is discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

   1 atm, because they consist of monatomic lattices of iodine. At 100 GPa
   the superconducting transition temperature, T-c, of H2I and H4I is
   estimated to be 7.8 and 17.5 K, respectively. The increase in T-c

Abstract = {{Flavor is an essential quality characteristics of soymilk, which
   contains volatile compounds derived from fatty acids via enzymatic and
   thermal reactions. In this study, 67 kinds of soybean cultivars were
   selected, and correlation analysis was conducted between physicochemical
   indexes of these soybean cultivars and flavor characteristic indexes of
   soymilk. With clustering analysis, all the soybean cultivars could be
   classified into three classes, and according to the results of principal
   component analysis for each class of soymilk flavor characteristics, the
   soymilk of second class had relatively heavier beany and non-beany
   flavor, and the third class had weaker flavor. For soybean cultivars of
   which the soymilk characteristics were unknown, two discriminant
   functions could be used to predict flavor characteristics if the
   physicochemical indexes were known. Therefore, screening of soybean
   cultivars suitable for soymilk processing can be targeted for the flavor
   favored by consumers and an evaluation method established. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Adipose tissue secretes adipokines that regulate insulin sensitivity in
   adipocytes and other peripheral tissues critical to glucose metabolism.
   Insulin resistance is associated with severe alterations in adipokines
   characterized by release of increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and
   decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue. The role of
   Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation on adipokines in relation to
   adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance is not completely
   explored. For the first time, we have evaluated the ability of
   Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an endogenous FXR ligand, in restoring the
   disturbance in adipokine secretion and insulin resistance in palmitate
   treated 3T3-L1 cells and adipose tissues of High fat diet (HFD) rats.
   CDCA suppressed several of the tested pro-inflammatory adipokines
   (TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IL-6, Chemerin, PAL RBP4, resistin, vaspin), and
   enhanced the major anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizing adipokines
   (adiponectin, leptin). CDCA suppressed the activation of critical
   inflammatory regulators such as NF-kappa B and IKK beta which are
   activated by palmitate treatment in differentiated cells and HFD in
   rats. We show the altered adipokines in insulin resistance, its
   association with inflammatory regulators, and the role of CDCA in
   amelioration of insulin resistance by modulation of adipokines. (C) 2015

Title = {{Incidental rewarding cues influence eeconomic decisions in people with
   obesity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that obesity is linked to prominent alterations
   in learning and decision-making. This general difference may also
   underlie the preference for immediately consumable, highly palatable but
   unhealthy and high calorie foods. Such poor food-related inter-temporal
   decision-making can explain weight gain; however, it is not yet clear
   whether this deficit can be generalized to other domains of
   inter-temporal decision-making, for example financial decisions.
   Further, little is known about the stability of decision making behavior
   in obesity, especially in the presence of rewarding cues. To answer
   these questions, obese and lean participants (n = 52) completed two
   sessions of a novel priming paradigm including a computerized monetary
   delay discounting task. In the first session, general differences
   between groups in financial delay discounting were measured. In the
   second session, we tested the general stability of discount rates.
   Additionally, participants were primed by affective visual cues of
   different contextual categories before making financial decisions. We
   found that the obese group showed stronger discounting of future
   monetary rewards than the lean group, but groups did not differ in their
   general stability between sessions nor in their sensitivity toward
   changes in reward magnitude. In the obese group, a fast decrease of
   subjective value over time was directly related to a higher tendency for
   opportunistic eating. Obese in contrast to lean people were primed by
   the affective cues, showing a sex specific pattern of priming direction.
   Our findings demonstrate that environments rich of cues, aiming at
   inducing unhealthy consumer decisions, can be highly detrimental for
   obese people. It also underscores that obesity is not merely a medical
   condition but has a strong cognitive component, meaning that current
   dietary and medical treatment strategies may fall too short.}},

Abstract = {{The contamination with microplastic particles and fibres was evaluated
   on beaches along the German Baltic coast. Sediments were sampled near
   the Wamow and Oder/Peene estuaries, on Rtigen island and along the
   Rostock coast to derive possible entry pathways. Seasonal variations
   were monitored along the Rostock coast from March to July 2014. After
   density separation in saline solution, floating particles were found to
   be dominated by sand grains. Water surface tension is shown to be
   sufficient to explain floatation of grains with sizes less than 1.5 mm.
   Selecting intensely coloured particles and fibres, we find lower limits
   of the microplastic concentrations of 0-7 particles/kg and 2-11
   fibres/kg dry sediment. The largest microplastic contaminations are
   measured at the Peene outlet into the Baltic Sea and in the North Sea
   Jade Bay. City discharges, industrial production sites, fishing activity
   and tourism are the most likely sources for the highest microplastic
   concentrations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{D-Serine is an endogenous modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
   receptors. Plasma concentrations of D-serine and the ratio of D-serine

   specific method using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass
   spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of the D- and
   L-isomers of serine in human plasma. Since D- and L-serine are
   endogenous components, phosphate buffered saline was used as the
   surrogate matrix. D- and L-serine in human plasma and PBS were treated
   by cationic exchange solid phase extraction. D-Serine (m/z 106.1 >
   60.0), L-serine (m/z 106.1 > 60.1) and DL-serine-d(3) (m/z 109.1 > 63.0)

   separation of D- and L-serine was successfully achieved without any
   derivatization step using tandemly-arranged and ice-cold CROWNPAK
   CR-I(+) columns with an isocratic mobile phase comprised of 0.3\%

Abstract = {{The bioactivity of nitroimidazole in Tc-99m-labeled 2-nitroimidazole, a
   traditional solid tumor hypoxia-imaging agent for single photon emission
   computed tomography (SPECT), is reduced by the presence of large ligand
   and metallic radionuclide, exhibiting lower tumor-to-nontumor ratios. In
   an effort to solve this general problem, a pretargeting strategy based
   on click chemistry (strain-promoted cyclooctyne-azide cycloaddition) was
   applied. The functional click synthons were synthesized as pretargeting
   components: an azide group linked to 2-nitroimidazole (2NIM-Az) serves
   for tumor hypoxia- targeting and azadibenzocyclooctyne conjugated with
   monoamine monoamide dithiol ligand (AM) functions as radiolabeling and
   binding group to azides in vivo. 2NIM-triazole-MAMA was obtained from in
   vitro click reaction with a reaction rate constant of 0.98 M-1 s(-1). AM
   and 2NIM-triazole-MAMA were radiolabeled with Tc-99m. The
   hypoxia-pretargeting biodistribution was studied in Kunming mice bearing
   S180 tumor; Tc-99m-AM and Tc-99m-triazole-2NIM were used as blank
   control and conventional control. Compared to the control groups, the
   pretargeting experiment exhibits the best radio-uptake and retention in
   tumor, with higher tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-blood ratios (up to 8.55
   and 1.44 at 8 h post-Tc-99m-complex-injection, respectively). To some
   extent, the pretargeting strategy protects the bioactivity of
   nitroimidazole and therefore provides an innovative approach for the
   development of tumor hypoxia-SPECT imaging agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Prostaglandin (PG) D-2 elicits responses through either the DP1 and/or
   DP2 receptor. Experimental evidence suggests that stimulation of the DP1
   receptor contributes to allergic responses, such that antagonists are
   considered to be directed therapies for allergic diseases. In this
   study, we demonstrate the activity of a novel synthetic DP1 receptor
   antagonist termed wasapiprant (S-555739) for the DP1 receptor and other
   receptors in vitro, and assess the efficacy of asapiprant in several
   animal models of allergic diseases. We determined the affinity and
   selectivity of asapiprant for the DP1 receptor in binding assays. In the
   animal models of allergic rhinitis, changes in nasal resistance, nasal
   secretion, and cell infiltration in nasal mucosa were assessed after
   antigen challenge with and without asapiprant Similarly, in the animal
   models of asthma, the effect of antigen challenge with and without
   asapiprant on antigen-induced bronchoconstriction, airway
   hyper-responsiveness, mucin production, and cell infiltration in lung
   were assessed. In binding studies, asapiprant exhibited high affinity
   and selectivity for the DP1 receptor. Significant suppression of
   antigen-induced nasal resistance, nasal secretion, and cell infiltration
   in nasal mucosa was observed with asapiprant treatment. In addition,
   treatment with asapiprant suppressed antigen-induced asthmatic
   responses, airway hyper-responsiveness, and cell infiltration and mucin
   production in lung. These results show that asapiprant is a potent and
   selective DP1 receptor antagonist, and exerts suppressive effects in the
   animal models of allergic diseases. Thus, asapiprant has potential as a
   novel therapy for allergic airway diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of a traditional Chinese medicine,
   Shenzhuo formula, on patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD).
   METHODS: Eighty-eight outpatients with DKD were enrolled. Changes in
   estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine clearance, serum
   creatinine, blood-urea-nitrogen, albuminuria, glycosylated hemoglobin
   (Hb(A1C)), blood pressure, and lipid profile were measured and analyzed
   before and after intervention with Shenzhuo formula for 1, 3, 6, 9, 12,
   and 18 months.
   RESULTS: Compared with the baseline amounts, serum creatinine decreased,
   and eGFR and creatinine clearance increased, significantly after
   intervention for 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months (all P < 0.05). Mean eGFR
   increased by 2.11 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)/y after 18-month treatment.
   Urinary protein at 24 h decreased significantly after 1, 3, 9, and 12
   months (P < 0.05). Hb(A1C) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after 3,
   6, 9, 12, and 18 months, and systolic blood pressure decreased
   significantly (P < 0.05) after 1, 3, and 6 months. Total cholesterol
   decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after 1, 3, 6, and 18 months.
   Triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol decreased
   significantly (P < 0.05) after 1 and 3 months.
   CONCLUSION: Shenzhuo formula can improve eGFR and possibly slow DKD
   progression. Shenzhuo formula can also lower Hb(A1C), lipid levels and
   blood pressure. (C) 2015 JTCM. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Separate zones of sulfate and sulfide release from subducted mafic
   oceanic crust}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{428}},
Pages = {{73-83}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Liberation of fluids during subduction of oceanic crust is thought to
   transfer sulfur into the overlying sub-arc mantle. However, despite the
   importance of sulfur cycling through magmatic arcs to climate change,
   magma oxidation and ore formation, there has been little investigation
   of the metamorphic reactions responsible for sulfur release from
   subducting slabs. Here, we investigate the relative stability of
   anhydrite (CaSO4) and pyrite (FeS2) in subducted basaltic oceanic crust,
   the largest contributor to the subducted sulfur budget, to place
   constraints on the processes controlling sulfur release. Our analysis of
   anhydrite stability at high pressures suggests that this mineral should
   dominantly dissolve into metamorphic fluids released across the
   transition from blueschist to eclogite facies (similar to 450-650
   degrees C), disappearing at lower temperatures on colder geothermal
   trajectories. In contrast, we suggest that sulfur release via conversion
   of pyrite to pyrrhotite occurs at temperatures above 750 degrees C. This
   higher temperature stability is indicated by the preservation of
   pyrite-bornite inclusions in coesite-bearing eclogites from the Sulu
   Belt in China, which reached temperatures of at least 750 degrees C.
   Thus, sulfur may be released from subducting slabs in two separate
   pulses; (1) varying proportions of SO2, HSO4- and H2S are released via
   anhydrite breakdown at the blueschist-eclogite transition, promoting
   oxidation of remaining silicates in some domains, and (2) H2S is
   released via pyrite breakdown well into the eclogite facies, which may
   in some circumstances coincide with slab melting or supercritical liquid
   generation driven by influx of serpentinite-derived fluids. These
   results imply that the metallogenic potential in the sub-arc mantle
   above the subducting slab varies as a function of subduction depth,
   having the greatest potential above the blueschist-eclogite transition
   given the association between oxidised magmas and porphyry Cu(-Au-Mo)
   deposits. We speculate that this zoned sulfur liberation might be one of
   the factors that lead to the apparently redox-influenced zoned
   distribution of ore deposit types in the Andean arc. Furthermore, given
   the lack of sulfate-associated sea floor oxidation prior to the second
   great oxidation event, the pattern of sulfur transfer from the slab to
   the sub-arc mantle likely changed over time, becoming shallower and more
   oxidised from the Neoproterozoic onwards. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Zoster Vaccine and the Risk of Postherpetic Neuralgia in Patients Who
   Developed Herpes Zoster Despite Having Received the Zoster Vaccine}},

Volume = {{212}},

Abstract = {{Background. Although it is evident that zoster vaccination reduces
   postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) risk by reducing herpes zoster (HZ)
   occurrence, it is less clear whether the vaccine protects against PHN
   among patients who develop HZ despite previous vaccination.
   Methods. This cohort study included immunocompetent patients with HZ.
   The vaccinated cohort included 1155 individuals who were vaccinated
   against HZ at age >= 60 years and had an HZ episode after vaccination.
   Vaccinated patients were matched 1: 1 by sex and age with unvaccinated
   patients. Trained medical residents reviewed the full medical record to
   determine the presence of HZ-related pain at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after
   HZ diagnosis. The incidence of PHN was compared between vaccinated and
   unvaccinated -patients.
   Results. Thirty vaccinated women (4.2\%) experienced PHN, compared with
   75 unvaccinated women (10.4\%), with an adjusted relative risk of 0.41
   (95\% confidence interval, .26-.64). PHN occurred in 26 vaccinated men
   (6.0\%) versus 25 unvaccinated men (5.8\%), with an adjusted relative
   risk of 1.06 (.58-1.94). These associations did not differ significantly
   by age.
   Conclusions. Among persons experiencing HZ, prior HZ vaccination is
   associated with a lower risk of PHN in women but not in men. This
   sex-related difference may reflect differences in healthcare-seeking
   patterns and deserve further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to characterize the stress response and the seminal
   parameters obtained with electroejaculation (EE) or transrectal
   ultrasound-guided massage of the accessory sex glands (TUMASG) in two
   captive but nondomestic ruminants, the mouflons and the Iberian ibex
   under general anesthesia. In mouflons, the physiological responses
   (heart and respiratory rate, rectal temperature, cortisol, creatine
   kinase, potassium and glucose concentrations) changed similarly with
   both procedures. The TUMASG procedure was faster than EE in mouflons
   (21.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 12.4 +/- 1.2 minutes, P < 0.01). In ibexes,
   respiratory rate, cortisol and creatine kinase concentration changes
   were greater with EE than with TUMASG (final respiratory rate: 62.7 +/-
   5.5 vs. 38.1 +/- 5.6 breaths/min {[}P < 0.05]; final cortisol: 51.4 +/-
   5.1 vs. 25.3 +/- 5.6 ng/mL {[}P < 0.001]; and final creatine kinase:
   300.9 +/- 99.9 vs. 87.1 +/- 16.9 U/L {[}P < 0.001]). Electroejaculation
   provided better results in some sperm parameters (mouflons: sperm score:
   3.4 +/- 03 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.2 {[}P < 0.01]; total number of sperm
   ejaculated: 982.4 +/- 299 vs. 710.0 +/- 542.2 {[}P < 0.05]; ibexes:
   sperm with progressive motility: 47.7 +/- 6.2 vs. 20.5 +/- 83 {[}P <
   0.05]). The transrectal ultrasound-guided massage of the accessory sex
   glands appears to be an alternative technique to collect sperm from wild
   ruminants, reducing the need for electrical stimuli and thus decreasing
   the undesired responses of EE in the more sensitive species. On the
   other hand, better fresh sperm may be collected with EE. However, TUMASG
   provides practical advantages in animal welfare, firstly in these wild
   species more sensible to stress management and capture myopathy. (C)

Title = {{Support for the slip hypothesis from whisker-related tactile perception
   of rats in a noisy environment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Rodents use active whisker movements to explore their environment. The
   ``slip hypothesis{''} of whisker-related tactile perception entails that
   short-lived kinematic events (abrupt whisker movements, called
   ``slips{''}, due to bioelastic whisker properties that occur during
   active touch of textures) carry the decisive texture information.
   Supporting this hypothesis, previous studies have shown that slip
   amplitude and frequency occur in a texture-dependent way. Further,
   experiments employing passive pulsatile whisker deflections revealed
   that perceptual performance based on pulse kinematics (i.e., signatures
   that resemble slips) is far superior to the one based on time-integrated
   variables like frequency and intensity. So far, pulsatile stimuli were
   employed in a noise free environment. However, the realistic scenario
   involves background noise (e.g., evoked by rubbing across the texture).
   Therefore, if slips are used for tactile perception, the tactile
   neuronal system would need to differentiate slip-evoked spikes from
   those evoked by noise. To test the animals under these more realistic
   conditions, we presented passive whisker-deflections to head-fixed
   trained rats, consisting of ``slip-like{''} events (waveforms mimicking
   slips occurring with touch of real textures) embedded into background
   noise. Varying the (i) shapes (ramp or pulse); (0 kinematics (amplitude,
   velocity, etc.); and (iii) the probabilities of occurrence of slip-like
   events, we observed that rats could readily detect slip-like events of
   different shapes against noisy background. Psychophysical curves
   revealed that the difference of slip event and noise amplitude
   determined perception, while increased probability of occurrence
   (frequency) had barely any effect. These results strongly support the
   notion that encoding of kinematics dominantly determines whisker-related
   tactile perception while the computation of frequency or intensity plays
   a minor role.}},

Abstract = {{From density function theory calculation, the structural, electronic and
   magnetic properties of chi-carbides (Fe,Cr)(5)C-2 are investigated. With
   the increase of Cr content in chi-carbides (Fe,Cr)(5)C-2, the formation
   energy of chi carbide gradually decrease and energy stability of them
   increase. The formation energy of Cr5C2 is -0.354 eV/Lu, and the
   stability of Cr5C2 is higher than other chi carbides (Fe,Cr)(5)C-2,
   Mn5C2 and Fe5C2. There exists charges transfer from metal cation (Fe/Cr)
   to C atoms in chi-carbides, and this reveals an ionic contribution to
   the bonds. The addition of Cr decreases the magnetic moments of chi
   carbide, and the magnetic moments (Ms) of Cr2Cr2FeC2 and Cr5C2 are 0
   mu(B)/f.u., while it expresses opposite magnetic characters of the same
   atom at different sites in the other chi type (Fe,Cr)(5)C-2 carbides.
   The 3d states of metal atoms in the majority states (up) move to above
   the Femi level and some metal atoms (Fe/Cr) in chi type (Fe,Cr)(5)C-2
   are undergone the anti-ferromagnetic transformation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A terpyridine end-functionalized 8-arm poly(ethylene glycol) was
   prepared using the reaction of a 4'-aminopentanoxy substituted
   terpyridine with a p-nitrophenyl chloroformate activated PEG-(OH)(8).
   Supramolecular complexation of the polymer terpyridine moieties by Fe2+
   ions was investigated using NMR, UV-Vis and dynamic light scattering
   experiments. At low concentrations addition of Fe2+ ions to an aqueous
   solution of the polymer conjugate afforded nanogels with a single size
   distribution around 250 nm. At concentrations above 3 wt\%, and at a 1:2
   metal to ligand molar ratio, hydrogels were formed with increasing
   mechanical properties at increasing polymer concentrations. Using bovine
   chondrocytes, the biocompatibility and potential cytotoxicity of the
   polymer conjugate, nanogels and hydrogels were studied. The polymer
   conjugate with free ligands was toxic to the cells likely due to
   depletion of essential metal ions. When the terpyridine groups were
   complexed with Fe2+ ions, both nanogel suspensions and hydrogels showed
   no cytotoxicity in direct contact with chondrocytes. Indirect contact of
   gels with chondrocytes using transwells revealed the absence of toxic
   components by leaching. A Live-Dead assay on chondrocytes encapsulated
   in the hydrogels indicated that the hydrogels are cytocompatible,
   revealing the potential use of these materials for biomedical and
   pharmaceutical applications.
   Statement of Significance
   The binding between transition metal ions and ligands with multiple
   binding sites can be almost as strong as covalent bonds. This metal
   ligand charge transfer (MLCT) complexation was used to crosslink water
   soluble polymers into hydrogels. This approach to novel materials may
   find applications in the biomedical and pharmaceutical fields.
   Transition metal ions are essential trace elements present in tissue but
   up to now no cytotoxicity data of free ligands are available. Data
   presented show that free ligands are toxic to cells likely by depletion
   of trace metal ions, whereas kinetically stable complexes are not
   cytotoxic even when embedded in hydrogels. These results provide
   fundamental issues to be considered in the design of hydrogels
   crosslinked through metal ligand complexation. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{This manuscript focuses on the study of the classical Lotka-Volterra
   competitive reaction diffusion system. Morita and Tachibana (2009)
   {[}19] proved the existence of entire solutions of this system. They
   used traveling front solutions, the lower bound of the proportion
   between two components of which is positive, to construct these entire
   solutions. In order to reasonably explain this positive lower bound, we
   investigate it based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system and
   show some sufficient and necessary conditions. Particularly, if the
   parameters in the system satisfy some conditions, then the positive
   lower bound spontaneously holds. When the ratio is zero, we also
   construct new entire solutions based on the super(sub)-solution method,
   the comparison theorem and a pair of exact traveling front solutions. In
   addition, another kind of entire solutions is revealed by the
   combination of traveling front solutions, their reflects and the
   solutions of the diffusion-free system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a nonlinear reduced-order modelling methodology
   for finite-element models of structures with slender subcomponents and
   inertia represented by lumped masses along main load paths. The
   constructed models have dynamics described by 1-D intrinsic equations of
   motion, which are further written in modal co-ordinates. This yields
   finite-dimensional approximations of the system dynamics with only
   quadratic nonlinearities. Evaluation of the problem coefficients is
   performed from static condensation of the original model on the lumped
   masses. The method exploits the multi-point constraints typically used
   to obtain sectional loads in aircraft aeroelastic analysis. The
   technique is illustrated on simple 3D structural models built using

Title = {{Seismic performance of flexible timber diaphragms: Damping,
   force-displacement and natural period}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{583-590}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Seismic performance of flexible timber diaphragms is examined using
   available test data. Damping-ductility and force-displacement
   relationships are quantified for numerous different types of diaphragm
   constructions. It has been observed that the damping-ductility
   relationship is significantly different than that for other types of
   structures, often exhibiting a decrease or relatively constant damping
   as ductility increases. Additionally, due to their highly inelastic
   behavior, even at low displacement amplitudes, the equivalent damping
   ratio of the diaphragm can be predicted from the hysteresis damping
   component only. This paper also tabulates force-displacement backbone
   curve parameters for both second-order curves and bi-linear models.
   Scaling of the elastic diaphragm stiffness based on theory is considered
   and determined to be reasonably accurate for plywood diaphragms. Natural
   periods calculated using several models, including those utilizing
   Timoshenko (shear) beam theory and ASCE7-10, have been compared to
   natural periods from recorded seismic motions of four prototype
   buildings with masonry shear walls and timber diaphragms. The model
   which achieved the lowest average error corresponds to a shear beam with
   lumped mass at the mid-span equal to half the total mass on the
   diaphragm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an unsupervised method for slight change extraction and
   detection in multitemporal hyperspectral image sequence. To exploit the
   spectral signatures in hyperspectral images, autoregressive integrated
   moving average and fitting models are employed to create a prediction of
   single-band and multiband time series. Minimum mean absolute error index
   is then applied to obtain the preliminary change information image
   (PCII), which contains slight change information. After that, feature
   vectors are created for each pixel in the PCII using block processing
   and locally linear embedding. The final change detection (CD) mask is
   obtained by clustering the extracted feature vectors into changed and
   unchanged classes using k-means clustering algorithm with k = 2.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method extracts the
   slight change information efficiently in the hyperspectral image
   sequence and outperforms the state-of-the-art CD methods quantitatively
   and qualitatively. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{Effect of Mn on microstructure, mechanical property and pitting
   corrosion of 19\% Cr economical duplex stainless steels with solution
   temperatures ranging from 1040 to 1220 degrees C has been investigated.
   The austenite content increases with more Mn addition, but decreases by
   increasing solution temperature, which can be inferred by trend of
   partition coefficient K-Mn with solution temperature. Meanwhile, a
   balanced austenite-ferrite duplex structure of solution-treated
   specimens was obtained with Mn addition. The impact energy at 20 degrees
   C increased with decreasing solution temperature from 1220 degrees C to
   1040 and 1120 degrees C, and improved by more Mn addition due to more
   ductile austenite phase formation. These toughness variations were
   consistent with fracture morphology characteristic changing. The effect
   of more Mn addition and solution treatment of 1120 degrees C on
   decreasing of tensile strength and 0.2\% offset yield strength were
   slight. However, the elongation to fracture (\%) fell greatly with Mn
   addition up to 8.1 wt.\% for as-rolled and solution treated specimens
   due to larger deformation strains of austenite than that of ferrite. The
   decreasing trend of pitting corrosion potential became slower with Mn
   addition from 3:6 to 8.1 wt.\%. The pitting corrosion resistance was
   lowered by increasing solution temperature due to more weakened
   repassivation ferrite phase formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background and aim: Glycated albumin (GA) and the endogenous secretory
   receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (esRAGE) may modulate risk
   related to atherosclerosis. We tested the hypothesis that elevated GA
   and reduced esRAGE in serum are associated with adverse clinical
   outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and stable coronary artery
   disease (CAD).
   Methods: We determined GA and esRAGE serum levels in 576 consecutive
   patients with type 2 diabetes and stable CAD undergoing
   sirolimus-eluting stent (SES)-PCI. The primary endpoint was the
   incidence of major adverse cardio-cerebral events (MACCE) including
   cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke
   during a 2-year follow-up. The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of
   clinically driven repeat revascularization during a 2-year follow-up.
   The prognostic value of GA and esRAGE was determined with the
   Cox-proportional hazard model after adjustment for covariates.
   Results: A total 40 patients (6.9\%) experienced MACCE, and 108 (18.8\%)
   patients underwent repeat coronary revascularization during the
   follow-up. Serum GA (HR = 1.22, 95\% CI 1.16-1.28; HR = 1.15, 95\% CI
   1.11-1.19, respectively; for both p < 0.001) and esRAGE (HR = 0.60, 95\%
   CI 0.40-0.87; HR = 0.75, 95\% CI 0.61-0.92, respectively; for both p <
   0.01) levels remained independent predictors of the primary and
   secondary endpoints after adjustment for possible confounders.
   Conclusions: Serum GA and esRAGE are novel predictors of long-term
   clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and stable CAD.
   Increased serum GA and decreased esRAGE are associated with a poor
   prognosis in such patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aimed at developing new Ni-free Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), a
   series of Ni-free Zr-Al-Fe-Cu glass formers have been developed in this
   work. The compositions are designed by using a combination of clusters
   and mixing entropy. Glass formers in this system are considered to be a
   mixture of Zr-Al, Zr-Fe and Zr-Cu clusters. Their coefficients were
   obtained by the calculation of mixing entropy. Under the guidance of
   this method, a series of compositions with high glass forming ability
   (GFA) were developed. Among the glass formers, the alloy compositions of
   Zr60.32CU22.56Fe9.95Al7.17 and Zr(64.08)Cu(18.78)Fe(10.02)A(17.12)
   possess the highest GFA. Glassy rods can be fabricated at these two
   compositions with critical diameter up to 5 mm, which is superior to
   that reported for the known Zr60Cu25Fe5Al10 BMG under the same

   Inhibitor, ARQ 092}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{As a critical component in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, AKT has become an
   attractive target for therapeutic intervention. ARQ 092 and a next
   generation AKT inhibitor, ARQ 751 are selective, allosteric, pan-AKT and
   AKT1-E17K mutant inhibitors that potently inhibit phosphorylation of
   AKT. Biochemical and cellular analysis showed that ARQ 092 and ARQ 751
   inhibited AKT activation not only by dephosphorylating
   themembrane-associated active form, but also by preventing the inactive
   form from localizing into plasma membrane. In endometrial PDX models
   harboring mutant AKT1-E17K and other tumormodels with an activated AKT
   pathway, both compounds exhibited strong anti-tumor activity.
   Combination studies conducted in in vivo breast tumor models
   demonstrated that ARQ 092 enhanced tumor inhibition of a common
   chemotherapeutic agent (paclitaxel). In a large panel of diverse cancer
   cell lines, ARQ 092 and ARQ 751 inhibited proliferation across multiple
   tumor types but were most potent in leukemia, breast, endometrial, and
   colorectal cancer cell lines. Moreover, inhibition by ARQ 092 and ARQ
   751 was more prevalent in cancer cell lines containing PIK3CA/PIK3R1
   mutations compared to those with wt-PIK3CA/PIK3R1 or PTEN mutations. For
   both ARQ 092 and ARQ 751, PIK3CA/PIK3R1 and AKT1-E17Kmutations can
   potentially be used as predictive biomarkers for patient selection in
   clinical studies.}},

Abstract = {{The human RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-associated factor complex (hPAFc)
   and its individual subunits have been implicated in human diseases,
   including cancer. However, its involvement in breast cancer awaits
   investigation. Using data mining and human breast cancer tissue
   microarrays, we found that Ctr9, the key scaffold subunit in hPAFc, is
   highly expressed in estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ER alpha(+))
   luminal breast cancer, and the high expression of Ctr9 correlates with
   poor prognosis. Knockdown of Ctr9 in ER alpha(+) breast cancer cells
   almost completely erased estrogen-regulated transcriptional response. At
   the molecular level, Ctr9 enhances ER alpha protein stability, promotes
   recruitment of ERa and RNAPII, and stimulates transcription elongation
   and transcription-coupled histone modifications. Knockdown of Ctr9, but
   not other hPAFc subunits, alters the morphology, proliferative capacity,
   and tamoxifen sensitivity of ER alpha(+) breast cancer cells. Together,
   our study reveals that Ctr9, a key subunit of hPAFc, is a central
   regulator of estrogen signaling that drives ER alpha(+) breast
   tumorigenesis, rendering it a potential target for the treatment of ER

   Permeability in Common Wheat}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{The cuticle plays important roles in plant development, growth and
   defense against biotic and abiotic attacks. Crystallized epicuticular
   wax, the outermost layer of cuticle, is visible as white-bluish
   glaucousness. In crops like barley and wheat, glaucousness is trait of
   adaption to the dry and hot cultivation conditions, and
   hentriacontane-14,16-dione (beta-diketone) and its hydroxy derivatives
   are the major and unique components of cuticular wax in the upper parts
   of adult plants. But their biosynthetic pathway and physiological role
   largely remain unknown. In the present research, we identified a novel
   wax mutant in wheat cultivar Bobwhite. The mutation is not allelic to
   the known wax production gene loci W1 and W2, and designated as W3
   accordingly. Genetic analysis localized W3 on chromosome arm 2BS. The w3
   mutation reduced 99\% of beta-diketones, which account for 63.3\% of the
   total wax load of the wild-type. W3 is necessary for beta-diketone
   synthesis, but has a different effect on beta-diketone hydroxylation
   because the hydroxy-beta-diketones to beta-diketone ratio increased
   11-fold in the w3 mutant. Loss of beta-diketones caused failure to form
   glaucousness and significant increase of cuticle permeability in terms
   of water loss and chlorophyll efflux in the w3 mutant. Transcription of
   23 cuticle genes from five functional groups was altered in the w3
   mutant, 19 down-regulated and four up-regulated, suggesting a
   possibility that W3 encodes a transcription regulator coordinating
   expression of cuticle genes. Biosynthesis of beta-diketones in wheat and
   their implications in glaucousness formation and drought and heat
   tolerance were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score and red
   blood cell distribution width (RDW) content can both independently
   predict major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in patients with acute
   coronary syndrome (ACS). We investigated the combined predictive value
   of RDW and GRACE risk score for cardiovascular events in patients with
   ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the first
   time. We enrolled 480 ACS patients. During a median follow-up time of
   37.2 months, 70 (14.58\%) patients experienced MACEs. Patients were
   divided into tertiles according to the baseline RDW content
   (11.30-12.90, 13.00-13.50, 13.60-16.40). GRACE score was positively
   correlated with RDW content. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that both
   GRACE score and RDW content were independent predictors of MACEs (hazard
   ratio 1.039; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.024-1.055; p < 0.001;
   1.699; 1.294-2.232; p < 0.001; respectively). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier
   analysis demonstrated that the risk of MACEs increased with increasing
   RDW content (p < 0.001). For GRACE score alone, the area under the
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for MACEs was 0.749 (95\%
   CI: 0.707-0.787). The area under the ROC curve for MACEs increased to
   0.805 (0.766-0.839, p = 0.034) after adding RDW content. The incremental
   predictive value of combining RDW content and GRACE risk score was
   significantly improved, also shown by the net reclassification
   improvement (NRI = 0.352, p < 0.001) and integrated discrimination
   improvement (IDI = 0.023, p = 0.002). Combining the predictive value of
   RDW and GRACE risk score yielded a more accurate predictive value for
   long-term cardiovascular events in ACS patients who underwent PCI as
   compared to each measure alone.}},

Abstract = {{The bipolar molecule
   N-(4-(9-phenyl-fluoren-9-yl)phenyl)-2,2'-bipydylamine (PFPhDPy) with
   bulky steric hindrance was synthesized successfully by substituting
   9-(4-anilino)-9-phenyl-fluorene with 2-bromopyridine via Ullmann
   reaction, which is expected to possess good thermal stability, stable
   morphology, high triplet energy (E-T), and good bipolar characteristics
   because Of the bulky steric hindrance, excellent bipolar transporting
   characteristics of fluorene, interrupted conjugation,
   andelectron-deficient Pyridine group. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA)
   indicates a decomposition transition temperature of 336 degrees C with
   5\% weight loss. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve reveals
   no crystallization and melting phenomena by heating to 190 degrees C,
   which indicates the high morphological stability of the compound. The
   separation of the highest Occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the
   lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), calculated by density
   functional theory (DFT), indicates that a bipolar molecule was obtained
   and high triplet energy (E-T, 3.0 eV) was calculated from the
   phosphorescence spectrum. The UV-Vis spectrum is independent of solvent
   effects with three absorption peaks at about 276, 298, and 308 nm,
   respectively. The fluorescence emission spectra show blue shift as the
   solvents' polarity increasing with emission peaks from 390 to 363 nm in
   the solvents of dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, ethanol, and
   acetonitrile. In addition, the structure of the compound was
   characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of
   flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS), hydrogen nuclear magnetic
   resonance (H-1 NMR), and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR)
   spectra, respectively.}},

Title = {{Internal curing of mortar with low water to cementitious materials ratio

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{209-216}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{A normal weight porous aggregate (NWPA), with the saturated surface dry
   density of 2.3 g/cm(3), was prepared. Impact of NWPA on performance of
   mortar with water to cementitious materials ratio of 0.3 was presented
   in this paper. The results show that NWPA has smaller pores and higher
   water absorption speed than expanded clay, but lower desorption speed.
   Strength of mortar accompanying NWPA is higher than or close to that of
   a plain one. Mortar containing NWPA expand less than that with expanded
   clay under sealed condition, which suggests the lower internal curing
   efficiency of NWPA. However, still it could diminish the shrinkage of
   low w/c mortar and be used as internal curing agent. Variation of water
   absorption and dynamic modulus from top to bottom of mortar with NWPA is
   similar to that of plain one, and lower than that of expanded clay
   mortar, which certifies that NWPA could promote the uniformity of
   internally cured mortar. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze a quantum force sensor that uses coherent quantum-noise
   cancellation (CQNC) to beat the standard quantum limit. This sensor,
   which allows for the continuous, broadband detection of feeble forces,
   is a hybrid dual-cavity system composed of amesoscopicmechanical
   resonator optically coupled to an ensemble of ultracold atoms. In
   contrast to the stringent constraints on dissipation typically
   associated with purely optical schemes of CQNC, the dissipation rate of
   the mechanical resonator only needs to be matched to the decoherence
   rate of the atomic ensemble-a condition that is experimentally
   achievable even for the technologically relevant regime of low-frequency
   mechanical resonators with large quality factors. The modular nature of
   the system further allows the atomic ensemble to aid in the cooling of
   the mechanical resonator, thereby combining atom-mediated state
   preparation with sensing deep in the quantum regime.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Strain fields, dislocations, and defects may be used to control
   electronic properties of graphene. By using advanced imaging techniques
   with high-resolution transmission electron microscopes, we have measured
   the strain and rotation fields about dislocations in monolayer graphene
   with single-atom sensitivity. These fields differ qualitatively from
   those given by conventional linear elasticity. However, atom positions
   calculated from two-dimensional (2D) discrete elasticity and
   three-dimensional discrete periodized Foppl-von Karman equations
   (dpFvKEs) yield fields close to experiments when determined by geometric
   phase analysis. 2D theories produce symmetric fields whereas those from
   experiments exhibit asymmetries. Numerical solutions of dpFvKEs provide
   strain and rotation fields of dislocation dipoles and pairs that also
   exhibit asymmetries and, compared with experiments, may yield
   information on out-of-plane displacements of atoms. While discrete
   theories need to be solved numerically, analytical formulas for strains
   and rotation about dislocations can be obtained from 2D Mindlin's
   hyperstress theory. These formulas are very useful for fitting
   experimental data and provide a template to ascertain the importance of
   nonlinear and nonplanar effects. Measuring the parameters of this
   theory, we find two characteristic lengths between three and four times
   the lattice spacings that control dilatation and rotation about a
   dislocation. At larger distances from the dislocation core, the elastic
   fields decay to those of conventional elasticity. Our results may be
   relevant for strain engineering in graphene and other 2D materials of
   current interest.}},

Abstract = {{The Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) can be used in conjunction with
   Density Functional Theory (DFT) and its time-dependent extension (TDDFT)
   to simulate the electronic and optical properties of molecules and
   nanoparticles immersed in a dielectric environment, typically liquid
   solvents. In this contribution, we develop a methodology to account for
   solvation effects in real-space (and real-time) (TD) DFT calculations.
   The boundary elements method is used to calculate the solvent reaction
   potential in terms of the apparent charges that spread over the van der
   Waals solute surface. In a real-space representation, this potential may
   exhibit a Coulomb singularity at grid points that are close to the
   cavity surface. We propose a simple approach to regularize such
   singularity by using a set of spherical Gaussian functions to distribute
   the apparent charges. We have implemented the proposed method in the
   OCTOPUS code and present results for the solvation free energies and
   solvatochromic shifts for a representative set of organic molecules in
   water. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Immunogenicity and protective potential of a Plasmodium spp. enolase
   peptide displayed on archaeal gas vesicle nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Plasmodium falciparum enolase has been shown to localize on
   the surface of merozoites and ookinetes. Immunization of mice with
   recombinant Plasmodium enolase (rPfeno) showed partial protection
   against malaria. Anti-rPfeno antibodies inhibited growth of the parasite
   in in vitro cultures and blocked ookinete invasion of mosquito midgut
   epithelium. It is hypothesized that parasite specific moonlighting
   functions (e.g. host cell invasion) may map on to unique structural
   elements of Pfeno. Since enolases are highly conserved between the host
   and the parasite, a parasite-specific epitope of enolase was displayed
   on novel protein nanoparticles produced by a halophilic Archaeon
   Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 and tested their ability to protect mice against
   live challenge.
   Methods: By genetic engineering, a Plasmodium-enolase specific peptide
   sequence (104)EWGWS(108) with protective antigenic potential was
   inserted into the Halobacterium gas vesicle protein GvpC, a protein
   localized on the surface of immunogenic gas vesicle nanoparticles
   (GVNPs). Two groups of mice were immunized with the wild type (WT) and
   the insert containing recombinant (Rec) GVNPs respectively. A third
   group of mice was kept as un-immunized control. Antibody titres were
   measured against three antigens (i.e. WT-GVNPs, Rec-GVNPs and rPfeno)
   using ELISA. The protective potential was determined by measuring
   percentage parasitaemia and survival after challenge with the lethal
   strain Plasmodium yoelii 17XL.
   Results: Rec-GVNP-immunized mice showed higher antibody titres against
   rPfeno and Rec-GVNPs, indicating that the immunized mice had produced
   antibodies against the parasite enolase-specific insert sequence.
   Challenging the un-immunized, WT-GVNP and Rec-GVNP-immunized mice with a
   lethal strain of mice malarial parasite showed significantly lower
   parasitaemia and longer survival in the Rec-GVNP-immunized group as
   compared to control groups. The extent of survival advantage in the
   Rec-GVNP-group showed positive correlation with anti-rPfeno antibody
   titres while the parasitaemia showed a negative correlation. These
   results indicate that the parasite enolase peptide insert displayed on
   Halobacterium GVNPs is a good candidate as a protective antigenic
   epitope.
   Conclusion: The work reported here showed that the parasite-specific
   peptide sequence is a protective antigenic epitope. Although antibody
   response of B-cells to the guest sequence in Rec-GVNPs was mild,
   significant advantage in the control of parasitaemia and survival was
   observed. Future efforts are needed to display multiple antigens with
   protective properties to improve the performance of the GVNP-based
   approach.}},

Title = {{Coherent optical transients observed in rubidium atomic line filtered
   Doppler velocimetry experiments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{We report the first successful results from our novel Rubidium Atomic
   Line Filtered (RALF) Doppler velocimetry apparatus, along with
   unanticipated oscillatory signals due to coherent optical transients
   generated within pure Rb vapor cells. RALF is a high-velocity and
   high-acceleration extension of the well-known Doppler Global Velocimetry
   (DGV) technique for constructing multidimensional flow velocity vector
   maps in aerodynamics experiments {[}H. Komine, U.S. Patent No. 4,919,536
   (24 April 1990)]. RALF exploits the frequency dependence of
   pressure-broadened Rb atom optical absorptions in a heated Rb/N-2 gas
   cell to encode the Doppler shift of reflected nearresonant (lambda(0)
   approximate to 780.24 nm) laser light onto the intensity transmitted by
   the cell. The present RALF apparatus combines fiber optic and free-space
   components and was built to determine suitable operating conditions and
   performance parameters for the Rb/N-2 gas cells. It yields single-spot
   velocities of thin laser-driven-flyer test surfaces and incorporates a
   simultaneous Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) channel {[}Strand et
   al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 77, 083108 (2006)] for validation of the RALF
   results, which we demonstrate here over the v = 0 to 1 km/s range. Both
   RALF and DGV presume the vapor cells to be simple Beer's Law optical
   absorbers, so we were quite surprised to observe oscillatory signals in
   experiments employing low pressure pure Rb vapor cells. We interpret
   these oscillations as interference between the Doppler shifted reflected
   light and the Free Induction Decay (FID) coherent optical transient
   produced within the pure Rb cells at the original laser frequency; this
   is confirmed by direct comparison of the PDV and FID signals. We
   attribute the different behaviors of the Rb/N-2 vs. Rb gas cells to
   efficient dephasing of the atomic/optical coherences by Rb-N-2
   collisions. The minimum necessary N-2 buffer gas density approximate to
   0.3 amagat translates into a smallest useful velocity range of 0 to 2
   km/s, which can readily be extended to cover the 0 to 10 km/s range, and
   beyond. The recognition that coherent optical transients can be produced
   within low pressure vapor cells during velocimetry experiments may offer
   new insights into some quantitative discrepancies reported in earlier
   DGV studies. Future plans include ``line-RALF{''} experiments with
   streak camera detection, and two-dimensional surface velocity mapping
   using pulsed laser illumination and/or gated intensified CCD camera
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Road traffic noise has been associated with hypertension but
   evidence for the long-term effects on hospital admissions and mortality
   is limited. We examined the effects of long-term exposure to road
   traffic noise on hospital admissions and mortality in the general
   population.
   Methods and results The study population consisted of 8.6 million
   inhabitants of London, one of Europe's largest cities. We assessed
   small-area-level associations of day- (7:00-22:59) and nighttime
   (23:00-06:59) road traffic noise with cardiovascular hospital admissions
   and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in all adults (>= 25 years)
   and elderly (>= 75 years) through Poisson regression models. We adjusted
   models for age, sex, area-level socioeconomic deprivation, ethnicity,
   smoking, air pollution, and neighbourhood spatial structure. Median
   daytime exposure to road traffic noise was 55.6 dB. Daytime road traffic
   noise increased the risk of hospital admission for stroke with relative
   risk (RR) 1.05 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.09] in adults,
   and 1.09 (95\% CI:1.04-1.14) in the elderly in areas.60 vs.,55 dB.
   Nighttime noise was associated with stroke admissions only among the
   elderly. Daytime noisewas significantly associated with all-cause
   mortality in adults {[}RR 1.04 (95\% CI:1.00-1.07) in areas.60 vs.,55
   dB]. Positive but non-significant associations were seen with mortality
   for cardiovascular and ischaemic heart disease, and stroke. Results were
   similar for the elderly.
   Conclusions Long-term exposure to road traffic noise was associated with
   small increased risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
   mortality and morbidity in the general population, particularly for
   stroke in the elderly.}},

Title = {{A non-randomized controlled stepped wedge trial to evaluate the
   effectiveness of a multi-level mammography intervention in improving
   appointment adherence in underserved women}},
Journal = {{IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Considerable racial and socio-economic disparities exist in
   breast cancer. In spite of the existence of numerous evidence-based
   interventions (EBIs) aimed at reducing breast cancer screening barriers
   among the underserved, there is a lack of uptake or sub-optimal uptake
   of EBIs in community and clinical settings. This study evaluates a
   theoretically based, systematically designed implementation strategy to
   support adoption and implementation of a patient navigation-based
   intervention, called Peace of Mind Program (PMP), aimed at improving
   breast cancer screening among underserved women.
   Methods/design: The PMP will be offered to federally qualified health
   centers and charity clinics in the Greater Houston area using a
   non-randomized stepped wedge design. Due to practical constraints of
   implementing and adopting in the real-world, randomization of start
   times and blinding will not be used. Any potential confounding or bias
   will be controlled in the analysis. Outcomes such as appointment
   adherence, patient referral to diagnostics, time to diagnostic referral,
   patient referral to treatment, time to treatment referral, and budget
   impact of the intervention will be assessed. Assessment of constructs
   from the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) will
   be assessed during implementation and at the end of the study
   (sustainment) from each participating clinic. Data will be analyzed
   using descriptive statistics (chi-square tests) and generalized
   estimating equations (GEE).
   Discussion: While parallel group randomized controlled trials (RCT) are
   considered the gold standard for evaluating EBI efficacy, withholding an
   effective EBI in practice can be both unethical and/or impractical. The
   stepped wedge design addresses this issue by enabling all clinics to
   eventually receive the EBI during the study and allowing each clinic to
   serve as its own control, while maintaining strong internal validity. We
   expect that the PMP will prove to be a feasible and successful strategy
   for reducing appointment no-shows in underserved women.}},

Title = {{Oxygen vacancies in LiAlO2 crystals}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Singly ionized oxygen vacancies are produced in LiAlO2 crystals by
   direct displacement events during a neutron irradiation. These
   vacancies, with one trapped electron, are referred to as V-O(+) centers.
   They are identified and characterized using electron paramagnetic
   resonance (EPR) and optical absorption. The EPR spectrum from the V-O(+)
   centers is best monitored near 100 K with low microwave power. When the
   magnetic field is along the {[}001] direction, this spectrum has a g
   value of 2.0030 and well-resolved hyperfine interactions of 310 and 240
   MHz with the two Al-27 nuclei that are adjacent to the oxygen vacancy. A
   second EPR spectrum, also showing hyperfine interactions with two Al-27
   nuclei, is attributed to a metastable state of the V-O(+) center. An
   optical absorption band peaking near 238 nm is assigned to V-O(+)
   centers. Bleaching light from a Hg lamp converts a portion of the V-O(+)
   centers to V-O(0) centers (these latter centers are oxygen vacancies
   with two trapped electrons). The V-O(0) centers have an absorption band
   peaking near 272 nm, a photoluminescence band peaking near 416 nm, and a
   photoluminescence excitation band peaking near 277 nm. Besides the
   oxygen-vacancy EPR spectra, a holelike spectrum with a resolved, but
   smaller, hyperfine interaction with one Al-27 nucleus is present in
   LiAlO2 after the neutron irradiation. This spectrum is tentatively
   assigned to doubly ionized aluminum vacancies.}},

Title = {{Molecular difference between WASP and N-WASP critical for chemotaxis of
   T-cells towards SDF-1 alpha}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) integrates cell signaling
   pathways to the actin cytoskeleton, which play a critical role in T-cell
   activation and migration. Hematopoietic cells express both WASP and
   neural-WASP (N-WASP) which share similar domain structure, yet WASP
   deficiency causes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, suggesting that N-WASP
   present in the cells is not able to carry out all the functions of WASP.
   We have identified a unique internal thirty amino acid region (I30) in
   WASP, which regulates its function in chemotaxis of Jurkat T-cells.
   Deletion of the I30 region altered the WASP's closed conformation and
   impaired its ability to rescue the chemotactic defect of WASP-deficient
   (Jurkat(WKD)) T-cells. Expression of N-WASP in Jurkat(WKD) T-cells using
   WASP promoter restored the migration velocity without correcting the
   chemotactic defect. However, insertion of I30 region in N-WASP
   (N-WASP-I30) enabled N-WASP to rescue the chemotactic defect of
   Jurkat(WKD) T-cells. N-WASP-I30-EGFP displayed a punctate localization
   in contrast to the predominant nuclear localization of N-WASP-EGFP.
   Thus, our study has demonstrated that the I30 region of WASP is critical
   for localization and chemotaxis. This suggests that N-WASP's failure to
   compensate for WASP in rescuing chemotaxis could be due to the absence
   of this I30 region.}},

Abstract = {{Composite materials for electromagnetic shielding can be manufactured as
   textiles using conductive yarns and textiles with conductivity obtained
   by various finishing processes on textile surfaces. The EM shielding
   effectiveness of fabrics are improved by lowering its conductivity using
   different methods and materials. An alternative is the usage of new
   light shielding materials in the form of metallized nonwoven fabrics or
   textiles. Their advantages are: a general availability on the market, a
   low price, good mechanical properties (strength, elasticity) and
   resistance to the environmental conditions. The composite anisotropic
   materials with a sandwich structure constituting of materials with
   different spatial orientations of fibers allow one to achieve relatively
   high and constant values of the shielding effectiveness which, together
   with the materials' mechanical properties, leads to a wide range of
   applicability in various disciplines of modern technology. This article
   is devoted to innovative flexible materials shielding electromagnetic

Abstract = {{In this study, we report an efficient
   encapsulation-vitrification-dehydration protocol for cryopreservation of
   Chrysanthemum morifolium shoot tips. Various factors influencing
   cryopreservation such as explant size (1.0-2.0 mm), carbon source
   (0.0-0.9 M sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose), duration of
   pre-culture (0-3 days), duration of treatment with loading solution
   (0-300 min), duration of treatment with plant vitrification solution
   (0-120 min with PVS2 or PVS3), and duration of air-dehydration (0-6 h)
   were investigated. Shoot tips of 1.0 mm size that were encapsulated, and
   pre-cultured for 1 day in medium enriched with 0.6 M sucrose, treated
   with loading solution for 180 min, dehydrated with PVS3 for 60 min, and
   sequentially air dried for 4h (33.0\% water content) in laminar air flow
   cabinet prior to exposure with liquid nitrogen (LN) for 1 h was found to
   be the most suitable regime for cryopreservation of Chrysanthemum shoot
   tips. Under optimal conditions, the highest survival rate of 91.3\%, and
   shoot regrowth rate of 80.3\% was obtained using cultivar `Borami'. The
   method developed was successfully adapted to three more cultivars,
   `Secret pink', `Yellow cap', and `White ND' which showed a survival rate
   of 603-87.3\%, and shoot regrowth rate of 55.3-70.0\%. To our knowledge
   this could be the first report in cryopreservation combining the
   advantage of encapsulation-vitrification and encapsulation-dehydration.
   We believe that the developed protocol will be a tool to conserve
   Chrysanthemum germplasm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The high-spin (S = 1) tetrahedral Ni-II complex
   {[}Ni\{(Pr2P)-Pr-i(Se)NP-(Se)Pr-i(2)\}(2)] was investigated by
   magnetometry, spectroscopic, and quantum chemical methods.
   Angle-resolved magnetometry studies revealed the orientation of the
   magnetization principal axes. The very large zero-field splitting (zfs),
   D = 45.40(2) cm(-1) E = 1.91(2) cm(-1), of the complex was accurately
   determined by far-infrared magnetic spectroscopy, directly observing
   transitions between the spin sublevels of the triplet ground state.
   These are the largest zfs values ever determined directly for a
   high-spin Ni-II complex. Ab initio calculations further probed the
   electronic structure of the system, elucidating the factors controlling
   the sign and magnitude of D. The latter is dominated by spin orbit
   coupling contributions of the Ni ions, whereas the corresponding effects
   of the Se atoms are remarkably smaller.}},

Abstract = {{Nano-scaled mechanical properties have become important for abundant
   submicron and nano electronic or mechanical devices. However, the
   nano-scale mechanical tests have not been developed widely. In this
   study, a new nano-tension test specimen is designed, using the focused
   ion beam (FIB) machining. The dimension of the nano-tension gage section
   can vary from 50 to 1000 nm. The test can be conducted by the widely
   available nano-indentation facility with a flat tip. The downward
   applied load from the flat tip onto the central beam (in compression)
   can be easily transferred to the two-side tension gage sections (in
   tension). Various pure metals such as face-centered cubic Al and Cu and
   hexagonal close-packed Mg, Zr, and Ti are selected for the test run. The
   yield stress and elastic strain are seen to be exceptionally high. The
   extended elastic region is carefully examined by reproducible
   experiments and molecule dynamic simulation. It is not considered to be
   an artifact by FIB machining, but appears to be a common phenomenon for
   metallic materials in the nano scale when the dislocation activity is
   difficult to be fully functioned. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The influence of the martensite volume fraction (V-m) on the damage and
   fracture behavior of dual-phase steels was studied by combining
   experiments and micromechanical modeling. A transition in the dominating
   damage mechanism is observed when varying V-m. Martensite fracture
   dominates the void nucleation process at high V-m, while interface
   decohesion prevails at low V-m. Damage accumulation accelerates when V-m
   increases, resulting in a decrease of the fracture strain. Brittle
   fracture areas are observed in uniaxial tensile specimens for a
   sufficiently high V-m. The damage mechanisms and evolution are
   rationalized using a micromechanical analysis based on periodic finite
   element cell calculations. The results show that V-m is a key factor for
   controlling the balance between strength and fracture resistance. (C)

   catalyst could conveniently be separated via magnetic separation. More
   importantly, the presence of amino and carboxyl groups on the surface
   due to chicken feather, provided sufficient binding sites for Pd NPs,
   and therefore make the synthesized material highly stable. No leaching
   was observed during the reaction as ascertained by ICP-AES analysis.
   Furthermore, the catalytic activity of this supported catalyst did not
   show any significant loss after being used for at least six times. (C)

Abstract = {{Organs are composed of heterotypic cells with patterned architecture
   that enables intercellular interaction to perform specific functions. In
   tissue engineering, the ability to pattern heterotypic cells into
   desired arrangement will allow us to model complex tissues in vitro and
   to create tissue equivalents for regeneration. This study was aimed at
   developing a method for fast heterotypic cell patterning with
   controllable topological manipulation on a glass chip. We found that
   poly(vinyl alcohol)-coated glass showed a biphasic change in adhesivity
   to cells in vitro: low adhesivity in the first 24 h and higher
   adhesivity at later hours due to increased serum protein adsorption.
   Combining programmable CO2 laser ablation to remove poly(vinyl alcohol)
   and glass, we were able to create arrays of adhesive microwells of
   adjustable patterns. We tested whether controllable patterns of
   epithelial-mesenchymal interaction could be created. When skin dermal
   papilla cells and fibroblasts were seeded respectively 24 h apart, we
   were able to pattern these two cells into aggregates of dermal papilla
   cells in arrays of microwells in a background of fibroblasts sheet.
   Seeded later, keratinocytes attached to these mesenchymal cells.
   Keratinocytes contacting dermal papilla cells started to differentiate
   toward a hair follicle fate, demonstrating pattemable
   epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. This method allows fast adjustable
   heterotypic cell patterning and surface topology control and can be
   applied to the investigation of heterotypic cellular interaction and
   creation of tissue equivalent in vitro.}},

Title = {{The candidate oncogene (MCRS1) promotes the growth of human lung cancer
   cells via the miR-155-Rb1 pathway}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL \& CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microspherule protein 1 (MCRS1) is a candidate oncogene and
   participates in various cellular processes, including growth, migration,
   senescence and transformation. MCRS1 is overexpressed in non-small cell
   lung cancer (NSCLC) and promotes the growth of cancer cells. However,
   the mechanisms driving these processes are not fully understood.
   Methods: Retrovirus-mediated RNA interference was employed to knockdown
   MCRS1 expression in cell lines. Cell proliferation assays and animal
   experiments were respectively performed to evaluate the growth of NSCLC
   cells in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis was carried out for mRNA
   profiling. Luciferase reporter assay and microRNA (miRNA) transfection
   were used to investigate the interaction between miRNA and gene.
   Results: Stably knocking down MCRS1 expression inhibited the
   proliferation of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. By comparing the mRNA
   expression profiles of NSCLC cells with or without MCRS1 silencing, we
   found that MCRS1 regulated expressions of various genes related to cell
   proliferation, including Rb1, TP53, cell cycle-related genes, MYC, E2F2,
   PCNA, and Ki67. However, MCRS1 did not directly bind to these
   differentially expressed genes. Here, we confirmed that Rb1, an
   important tumor suppression gene (TSG), is a direct target of miR-155
   which is directly up-regulated by MCRS1. Furthermore, the level of Rb1
   expression in NSCLC tissues was inversely correlated with those of
   miR-155 and MCRS1, and MCRS1 regulated expression of Rb1 via miR-155.
   Additionally, we found that the DNA copy number of the MCRS1 gene played
   a role in MCRS1 overexpression in NSCLCs.
   Conclusion: MCRS1 overexpression induced NSCLC proliferation through the
   miR-155-Rb1 pathway and DNA copynumber amplification is one of the
   mechanisms underlying MCRS1 overexpression in NSCLC. Moreover, we put
   forward the hypothesis that there are regulatory relationships between
   oncogenes and TSGs apart from the functional synergy of both; the
   oncogene-miRNA-TSG networks are one of mechanisms among the regulatory
   relationships; the regulatory relationships and the networks might play
   active roles in the development and progression of cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Caspase proteases are responsible for the regulated disassembly of the
   cell into apoptotic bodies during mammalian apoptosis. Structural
   homologues of the caspase family (called metacaspases) are involved in
   programmed cell death in single-cell eukaryotes, yet the molecular
   mechanisms that contribute to death are currently undefined. Recent
   evidence revealed that a programmed cell death process is induced by
   acetic acid (AA-PCD) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae both in the presence
   and absence of metacaspase encoding gene YCA1. Here, we report an
   unexpected role for the yeast metacaspase in protein quality and
   metabolite control. By using an ``omics{''} approach, we focused our
   attention on proteins and metabolites differentially modulated en route
   to AA-PCD either in wild type or YCA1-lacking cells. Quantitative
   proteomic and metabolomic analyses of wild type and Delta yca1 cells
   identified significant alterations in carbohydrate catabolism, lipid
   metabolism, proteolysis and stress-response, highlighting the main roles
   of metacaspase in AA-PCD. Finally, deletion of YCA1 led to AA-PCD
   pathway through the activation of ceramides, whereas in the presence of
   the gene yeast cells underwent an AA-PCD pathway characterized by the
   shift of the main glycolytic pathway to the pentose phosphate pathway
   and a proteolytic mechanism to cope with oxidative stress.
   Significance: The yeast metacaspase regulates both proteolytic
   activities through the ubiquitin-proteasome system and ceramide
   metabolism as revealed by proteome and metabolome profiling of
   YCA/-knock-out cells during acetic-acid induced programmed cell death.

Abstract = {{Introduction: The World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa
   (WHO AFRO) introduces a step wise incremental accreditation approach to
   improving quality of laboratory and it is a new initiative in Ethiopia
   and activities are performed for implementation of accreditation
   program. Methods: Descriptive cross sectional study was conducted in 30
   laboratory facilities including 6 laboratory sections to determine their
   status towards of accreditation using WHO AFRO accreditation checklist
   and 213 laboratory professionals were interviewed to assess their
   knowledge on quality system essentials and accreditation in Addis Ababa
   Ethiopia. Results: Out of 30 laboratory facilities 1 private laboratory
   scored 156 (62\%) points, which is the minimum required point for WHO
   accreditation and the least score was 32 (12.8\%) points from government
   laboratory. The assessment finding from each section indicate that 2
   Clinical chemistry (55.2\% \& 62.8\%), 2 Hematology (55.2\% \& 62.8\%),
   2 Serology (55.2\% \& 62.8\%), 2 Microbiology (55.2 \% \& 62.4\%), 1
   Parasitology (62.8\%) \& 1 Urinalysis (61.6\%) sections scored the
   minimum required point for WHO accreditation. The average score for
   government laboratories was 78.2 (31.2\%) points, of these 6
   laboratories were under accreditation process with 106.2 (42.5\%)
   average score, while the private laboratories had 71.2 (28.5\%) average
   score. Of 213 respondents 197 (92.5\%) professionals had a knowledge on
   quality system essentials whereas 155 (72.8\%) respondents on
   accreditation. Conclusion: Although majority of the laboratory
   professionals had knowledge on quality system and accreditation,
   laboratories professionals were not able to practice the quality system
   properly and most of the laboratories had poor status towards the WHO
   accreditation process. Thus government as well as stakeholders should
   integrate accreditation program into planning and health policy.}},

Abstract = {{We have achieved significant improvements for the oxygen reduction
   reaction activity and durability with new SnO2-nanoislands/Pt3Co/C
   catalysts in 0.1 M HClO4, which were regulated by a strategic
   fabrication using a new selective electrochemical Sn deposition method.
   The nano-SnO2/Pt3Co/C catalysts with Pt/Sn = 4/1, 9/1, 11/1, and 15/1
   were characterized by STEM-EDS, XRD, XRF, XPS, in situ XAFS, and
   electrochemical measurements to have a Pt3Co core/Pt skeleton-skin
   structure decorated with SnO2 nanoislands at the compressive Pt surface
   with the defects and dislocations. The high performances of
   nano-SnO2/Pt3Co/C originate from efficient electronic modification of
   the Pt skin surface (site 1) by both the Co of the Pt3Co core and
   surface nano-SnO2 and and more from the unique property of the periphery
   sites of the SnO2 nanoislands at the compressive Pt skeleton-skin
   surface (more active site 2), which were much more active than expected
   from the d-band center values. The white line peak intensity of the
   nano-SnO2/Pt3Co/C revealed no hysteresis in the potential up down
   operations between 0.4 and 1.0 V versus RHE, unlike the cases of Pt/C
   and Pt3Co/C, resulting in the high ORR performance. Here we report
   development of a new class of cathode catalysts with two different
   active sites for next-generation polymer electrolyte fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{The water vapor barrier properties of low-temperature atomic layer
   deposited (ALD) AlOx thin-films are observed to be unstable if exposed
   directly to high or even ambient relative humidities. Upon exposure to
   humid atmospheres, their apparent barrier breaks down and their water
   vapor transmission rates (WVTR), measured by electrical calcium tests,
   deteriorate by several orders of magnitude. These changes are
   accompanied by surface roughening beyond the original thickness,
   observed by atomic force microscopy. X-ray reflectivity investigations
   show a strong decrease in density caused by only 5 min storage in a 38
   degrees C, 90\% relative humidity climate. We show that barrier
   stabilities required for device applications can be achieved by
   protection layers which prevent the direct contact of water condensing
   on the surface, i.e., the sensitive ALD barrier. Nine different
   protection layers of either AID materials or polymers are tested on the
   barriers. Although ALD materials prove to be ineffective, applied
   polymers seem to provide good protection independent of thickness,
   surface free energy, and deposition technique. A glued-on PET foil
   stands out as a low-cost, easily processed, and especially stable
   solution. This way, 20 nm single layer ALD barriers for organic
   electronics are measured. They yield reliable WVTRs down to 2 X 10(-5)
   g(H2O) m(-2) day(-1) at 38 degrees C and 90\% relative humidity,
   highlighting the great potential of ALD encapsulation.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging virus causing epidemic acute
   hepatitis in developing countries as well as sporadic cases in
   industrialized countries. The life cycle of HEV is still poorly
   understood and the lack of efficient cell culture systems and animal
   models are the principal limitations for a detailed study of the viral
   replication cycle. Here we exhaustively examine all possible intraviral
   protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of HEV by systematic Yeast
   two-hybrid (Y2H) and LuMPIS screens, providing a basis for studying the
   function of these proteins in the viral replication cycle. Key PPIs
   correlate with the already published HEV 3D structure. Furthermore, we
   report 20 novel PPIs including the homodimerization of the RNA dependent
   RNA polymerase (RdRp), the self-interaction of the papain like protease,
   and ORF3 interactions with the papain-like protease and putative
   replicase components: RdRp, methylase and helicase. Furthermore, we
   determined the dissociation constant (K-d) of ORF3 interactions with the
   viral helicase, papain-like protease and methylase, which suggest a
   regulatory function for ORF3 in orchestrating the formation of the
   replicase complex. These interactions may represent new targets for
   antiviral drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in lightweight, flexible, and conformal electronic devices
   depend on materials that exhibit high electrical conductivity coupled
   with high mechanical strength. Defect-free graphene is one such material
   that satisfies both these requirements and which offers a range of
   attractive and tunable electrical, optoelectronic, and plasmonic
   characteristics for devices that operate at microwave, terahertz,
   infrared, or optical frequencies. Essential to the future success of
   such devices is therefore the ability to control the frequency-dependent
   conductivity of graphene. Looking to accelerate the development of
   high-frequency applications of graphene, here we demonstrate how readily
   accessible and processable organic and organometallic molecules can
   efficiently dope graphene to carrier densities in excess of 10(13)
   cm(-2) with conductivities at gigahertz frequencies in excess of 60 mS.
   In using the molecule 3,6-difluoro-2,5,7,7,8,8-hexacyanoquinodirnethane
   (F2-HCNQ), a high charge transfer (CT) of 0.5 electrons per adsorbed
   molecule is calculated, resulting in p-type doping of graphene. n-Type
   doping is achieved using cobaltocene and the sulfur-containing molecule
   tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) with a CT of 0.41 and 0.24 electrons donated
   per adsorbed molecule, respectively. Efficient CT is associated with the
   interaction between the pi electrons present in the molecule and in
   graphene. Calculation of the high-frequency conductivity shows
   dispersion-less behavior of the real component of the conductivity over
   a wide range of gigahertz frequencies. Potential high-frequency
   applications in graphene antennas and communications that can exploit
   these properties and the broader impacts of using molecular doping to
   modify functional materials that possess a low-energy Dirac cone are
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber webs have shown
   great potential in making mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion
   devices. Previously, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers were
   produced either using near-field electrospinning (spinning distance < 1
   cm) or conventional electrospinning (spinning distance > 8 cm). PVDF
   fibers produced by an electrospinning at a spinning distance between 1
   and 8 cm (referred to as ``short-distance{''} electrospinning in this
   paper) has received little attention. In this study, we have found that
   PVDF electrospun in such a distance range can still be fibers, although
   interfiber connection is formed throughout the web. The interconnected
   PVDF fibers can have a comparable beta crystal phase content and
   mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion property to those produced by
   conventional electrospinning. However, the interfiber connection was
   found to considerably stabilize the fibrous structure during repeated
   compression and decompression for electrical conversion. More
   interestingly, the short-distance electrospun PVDF fiber webs have
   higher delamination resistance and tensile strength than those of PVDF
   nanofiber webs produced by conventional electrospinning. Short-distance
   electrospun PVDF nanofibers could be more suitable for the development
   of robust energy harvesters than conventionally electrospun PVDF
   nanofibers.}},

Title = {{Better dual-task processing in simultaneous interpreters}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Simultaneous interpreting (SI) is a highly complex activity and requires
   the performance and coordination of multiple, simultaneous tasks:
   analysis and understanding of the discourse in a first language,
   reformulating linguistic material, storing of intermediate processing
   steps, and language production in a second language among others. It is,
   however, an open issue whether persons with experience in SI possess
   superior skills in coordination of multiple tasks and whether they are
   able to transfer these skills to lab-based dual-task situations. Within
   the present study, we set out to explore whether interpreting experience
   is associated with related higher-order executive functioning in the
   context of dual-task situations of the Psychological Refractory Period
   (PRP) type. In this PRP situation, we found faster reactions times in
   participants with experience in simultaneous interpretation in contrast
   to control participants without such experience. Thus, simultaneous
   interpreters possess superior skills in coordination of multiple tasks
   in lab-based dual-task situations.}},

Journal = {{CHEMISTRY CENTRAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: The analysis of mineral elements composition was determined
   in three wild edible herbs (Cichorium intybus L., Sonchus asper L. and
   Borago officinalis) collected in seven different sampling sites which
   were characterized by different pollution grade. The detection of
   mineral elements (Ca, K, Mg and Na), micronutrients (Cu, Fe, Li, Mn and
   Zn) and heavy metals (As, Cd, Hg, Ni and Pb) was performed.
   Results: The results obtained show that in most cases a direct
   relationship appeared between the amount of elements and the sampling
   sites. The highest concentrations of heavy metals were found in samples
   grown in polluted soils. These evaluations showed that contaminants in
   plants may reflect the environmental state in which they develop.
   Conclusion: The examined species are a good source of mineral elements
   and micronutrients, making them particularly adapt to integrate a
   well-balanced diet. The accumulation of heavy metals showed that
   contaminants in plants may reflect the environmental state in which they
   develop. Results showed high concentrations of heavy metals in samples
   taken in locations characterized by high human activity and in some
   samples from the local market, of which no one knows the collection

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic thermodynamics uses Markovian jump processes to model random
   transitions between observable mesoscopic states. Physical currents are
   obtained from antisymmetric jump observables defined on the edges of the
   graph representing the network of states. The asymptotic statistics of
   such currents are characterized by scaled cumulants. In the present
   work, we use the algebraic and topological structure of Markovian models
   to prove a gauge invariance of the scaled cumulant-generating function.
   Exploiting this invariance yields an efficient algorithm for practical
   calculations of asymptotic averages and correlation integrals. We
   discuss how our approach generalizes the Schnakenberg decomposition of
   the average entropy-production rate, and how it unifies previous work.
   The application of our results to concrete models is presented in an

   Curves in Untreated Patients with Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma and Ocular
   Hypertension}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To assess the short-term day-to-day reproducibility of 24-hour
   intraocular pressure (IOP) curves in various respects in untreated
   primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT)
   patients.
   Methods
   47 subjects with POAG and 34 subjects with OHT underwent IOP
   measurements every 2 hours in both eyes for consecutive 48 hours by a
   non-contact tonometer (NCT). IOP values at each time point were
   recorded. Mean IOP, peak IOP, time difference of peak IOP between two
   days and IOP fluctuation were also calculated. Intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate
   reproducibility.
   Results
   ICCs of the entire IOP values for a complete 24-hour curve were 0.577
   and 0.561 in POAG and OHT patients, respectively. ICCs of IOP values at
   different time points ranged from 0.384 (10am) to 0.686 (4am) in POAG
   patients and from 0.347 (6am) to 0.760 (4am) in OHT patients. ICCs of
   mean IOP, peak IOP and IOP fluctuation were respectively 0.832, 0.704,
   0.367 in POAG patients and 0.867, 0.816 0.633 in OHT patients. Only
   37.23\% and 35.29\% of the peak IOP time points appeared within the time
   difference of 2 hours in POAG and OHT patients, respectively, while
   53.19\% and 48.53\% appeared within 4 hours in POAG and OHT patients,
   respectively.
   Conclusion
   A 24-hour IOP curve in a single day is not highly reproducible in
   short-term and has limited use for evaluating individual IOP condition.
   Mean IOP and peak IOP for a 24-hour IOP curve are useful parameters in
   clinical follow-up, while IOP value at a certain time point, IOP
   fluctuation and peak IOP time point should be interpreted with caution.}},

   kg(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). It could also preserve 96.3\%
   of its initial capacitance at a current density of 2 A g(-1) after 10000
   charging/discharging cycles. The remarkable performance is attributed to
   the unique 3D NSP array structure that could play an important role in
   increasing the effective electrode surface area, facilitating
   electrolyte permeation, and shortening the electron pathway in the
   active materials.}},

Title = {{Proton chemical shift tensors determined by 3D ultrafast MAS
   double-quantum NMR spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Proton NMR spectroscopy in the solid state has recently attracted much
   attention owing to the significant enhancement in spectral resolution
   afforded by the remarkable advances in ultrafast magic angle spinning
   (MAS) capabilities. In particular, proton chemical shift anisotropy
   (CSA) has become an important tool for obtaining specific insights into
   inter/intra-molecular hydrogen bonding. However, even at the highest
   currently feasible spinning frequencies (110-120 kHz), H-1 MAS NMR
   spectra of rigid solids still suffer from poor resolution and severe
   peak overlap caused by the strong H-1-H-1 homonuclear dipolar couplings
   and narrow H-1 chemical shift (CS) ranges, which render it difficult to
   determine the CSA of specific proton sites in the standard
   CSA/single-quantum (SQ) chemical shift correlation experiment. Herein,
   we propose a three-dimensional (3D) H-1 double-quantum (DQ) chemical
   shift/CSA/SQ chemical shift correlation experiment to extract the CS
   tensors of proton sites whose signals are not well resolved along the
   single-quantum chemical shift dimension. As extracted from the 3D
   spectrum, the F1/F3 (DQ/SQ) projection provides valuable information
   about H-1-H-1 proximities, which might also reveal the hydrogen-bonding
   connectivities. In addition, the F2/F3 (CSA/SQ) correlation spectrum,
   which is similar to the regular 2D CSA/SQ correlation experiment, yields
   chemical shift anisotropic line shapes at different isotropic chemical
   shifts. More importantly, since the F2/F1 (CSA/DQ) spectrum correlates
   the CSA with the DQ signal induced by two neighboring proton sites, the
   CSA spectrum sliced at a specific DQ chemical shift position contains
   the CSA information of two neighboring spins indicated by the DQ
   chemical shift. If these two spins have different CS tensors, both
   tensors can be extracted by numerical fitting. We believe that this
   robust and elegant single-channel proton-based 3D experiment provides
   useful atomistic-level structural and dynamical information for a
   variety of solid systems that possess high proton density. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Background: Bloodstream infections (BSI) due to carbapenem resistant (C
   R) Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) are of global concern from both clinical
   and public health standpoints. This retrospective study aimed to
   describe C-R Kp BSI epidemiology in a large teaching hospital in
   northern Italy.
   Methods: Between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2014, annual incidences
   both of C-R Kp BSI and of carbapenem-susceptible (C-S) Kp BSI were
   calculated as the number of events per 10,000 patient-days. A Chi square
   test for linear trend was used to assess the change in the incidence of
   C-R Kp BSI and C-S Kp BSI over the study period. Crude 30 day mortality
   rates were provided both for C-R Kp BSI and for C-S Kp BSI.
   Results: From 2007 to 2014, we observed 511 episodes of Kp BSI, 349 of
   which were caused by C-R Kp (68.3 \%). The incidence of C-R Kp BSI
   considerably increased from 0.04/10,000 patient-days in 2007 to
   1.77/10,000 patient-days in 2014 (Chi square for trend p < 0.001). The
   highest incidence of C-R Kp BSI was observed in intensive care units
   (ICUs), with a peak of 22.01 C-R Kp BSI/10,000 patient-days in 2012. A
   less marked but significant increase of C-S Kp BSI was also observed
   (Chi square for trend p = 0.004). Crude 30 day mortality was 36.1 \% in
   patients with C-R Kp BSI and 23.5 \% in those with C-S Kp BSI.
   Conclusions: During the study period, we observed a dramatic increase in
   the incidence of C-R Kp BSI in our hospital. More concerted
   infection-control efforts are needed to contain this alarming C-R Kp
   diffusion.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new method for the determination of reactivity ratios based
   on a nonterminal model of copolymerization kinetics. Within the context
   of this model, we derive simple, reactivity-ratio-dependent expressions
   whose solution relies solely on monomer consumption information spanning
   the full range of conversion. Utilizing this method, reactivity ratios
   are obtained for the aluminum chelate-catalyzed copolymerization of
   phenyl glycidyl ether and allyl glycidyl ether (r(PGE) = 1.56 +/- 0.01
   and r(AGE) = 0.66 +/- 0.03) with monomer consumption monitored by in
   situ H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Additionally, this approach is applied to
   experimental data extracted from the literature for other
   copolymerization systems encompassing a range of monomer types
   (styrenics, isoprene, lactones, lactide, and other cyclic ethers) and
   polymerization type (anionic, coordination, and zwitterionic) to obtain
   reactivity ratios under the mechanistic assumption of nonterminal model
   copolymerization kinetics. We present the nonterminal model of
   copolymerization as the first method that should be utilized before more
   complex frameworks (e.g., terminal or penultimate model of chain
   copolymerization) are used to understand copolymerization kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{B-cell fate is orchestrated by a series of well-characterized
   developmental regulators. Here, we found that the onset of B-cell
   development was accompanied by large-scale changes in DNA cytosine
   modifications associated with promoters, enhancers, and anchors. These
   changes were tightly linked to alterations in transcription factor
   occupancy and nascent RNA (eRNA) transcription. We found that the
   prepro-B to the pro-B-cell transition was associated with a global
   exchange of DNA cytosine modifications for polycomb-mediated repression
   at CpG islands. Hypomethylated regions were found exclusively in the
   active/permissive compartment of the nucleus and were predominantly
   associated with regulatory elements or anchors that orchestrate the
   folding patterns of the genome. We identified superanchors,
   characterized by clusters of hypomethylated CCCTC-binding factor
   (CTCF)-bound elements, which were predominantly located at boundaries
   that define topological associated domains. A particularly prominent
   hypomethylated superanchor was positioned down-stream of the Ig heavy
   chain (Igh) locus. Analysis of global formaldehyde-cross-linking studies
   indicated that the Igh locus superanchor interacts with the V-H region
   repertoire across vast genomic distances. We propose that the Igh locus
   superanchor sequesters the V-H and D(H)J(H) regions into a spatial
   confined geometric environment to promote rapid first-passage times.
   Collectively, these studies demonstrate how, in developing B cells, DNA
   cytosine modifications associated with regulatory and architectural
   elements affect patterns of gene expression, folding patterns of the
   genome, and antigen receptor assembly.}},

   negatively impact on object formation when using complex sonified
   stimuli?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{A critical task for the brain is the sensory representation and
   identification of perceptual objects in the world. When the visual sense
   is impaired, hearing and touch must take primary roles and in recent
   times compensatory techniques have been developed that employ the
   tactile or auditory system as a substitute for the visual system.
   Visual-to-auditory sonifications provide a complex, feature-based
   auditory representation that must be decoded and integrated into an
   object-based representation by the listener. However, we don't yet know
   what role the auditory system plays in the object integration stage and
   whether the principles of auditory scene analysis apply. Here we used
   coarse sonified images in a two-tone discrimination task to test whether
   auditory feature-based representations of visual objects would be
   confounded when their features conflicted with the principles of
   auditory consonance. We found that listeners (N = 36) performed worse in
   an object recognition task when the auditory feature-based
   representation was harmonically consonant. We also found that this
   conflict was not negated with the provision of congruent audio visual
   information. The findings suggest that early auditory processes of
   harmonic grouping dominate the object formation process and that the
   complexity of the signal, and additional sensory information have
   limited effect on this.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was the development of reliable methods to
   determine 2,4-dinitrotoluene, a precursor to explosives. A complex
   between Fe(II) ion and 2,4-dinitrotoluene was formed in solution and
   characterized by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy using Job's
   plots and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. Surface modification of glassy carbon electrodes were
   performed with iron nanoparticles via electrochemical reduction of
   iron(II). The modified electrode was employed for the determination of
   2,4-dinitrotoluene. Scanning electron micrographs showed that the iron
   nanoparticles were incorporated on the surface of glassy carbon
   electrode. The electrochemical determination of 2,4-dinitrotoluene was
   performed by cyclic voltammetry using the modified electrode. The iron
   modified electrode produced larger reduction currents than the
   unmodified electrode for the same concentration of 2,4-dinitrotoluene.
   Concentrations of 2,4-dinitrotoluene as low as 10 parts per billion were
   determined using the modified electrode.}},

Abstract = {{Japanese goats fed a diet of 50\% Timothy grass and 50\% concentrate
   with increasing levels of the anti-methanogenic compound,
   bromochloromethane (BCM) were investigated with respect to the microbial
   population and functional shifts in the rumen. Microbial ecology methods
   identified species that exhibited positive and negative responses to the
   increasing levels of BCM. The methane-inhibited rumen appeared to adapt
   to the higher H-2 levels by shifting fermentation to propionate which
   was mediated by an increase in the population of H-2-consuming
   Prevotella and Selenomonas spp. Metagenomic analysis of propionate
   production pathways was dominated by genomic content from these species.
   Reductive acetogenic marker gene libraries and metagenomics analysis
   indicate that reductive acetogenic species do not play a major role in

Title = {{Development of a community health inclusion index: an evaluation tool
   for improving inclusion of people with disabilities in community health
   initiatives}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Community health initiatives often do not provide enough
   supports for people with disabilities to fully participate in healthy,
   active living opportunities. The purpose of this study was to design an
   instrument that focused on integrating disability-related items into a
   multi-level survey tool that assessed healthy, active living
   initiatives.
   Methods: The development and testing of the Community Health Inclusion
   Index (CHII) involved four components: (a) literature review of studies
   that examined barriers and facilitators to healthy, active living; (b)
   focus groups with persons with disabilities and professionals living in
   geographically diverse settings; (c) expert panel to establish a final
   set of critical items; and (d) field testing the CHII in 164 sites
   across 15 communities in 5 states to assess the instrument's
   reliability.
   Results: Results from initial analysis of these data indicated that the
   CHII has good reliability. Depending on the subscale, Cronbach's alpha
   ranged from 0.700 to 0.965. The CHII's inter-rater agreement showed that
   14 of the 15 venues for physical activity or healthy eating throughout a
   community had strong agreement (0.81 - 1.00), while one venue had
   substantial agreement (0.61 - 0.80).
   Conclusion: The CHII is the first instrument to operationalize community
   health inclusion into a comprehensive assessment tool that can be used
   by public health professionals and community coalitions to examine the
   critical supports needed for improving healthy, active living among
   people with disabilities.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in the
   surfactant-assisted exfoliation and dispersion of carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) in water calls for well-controlled experimental methodologies and
   reliable comparative metrics. We have assessed the ability of several
   ionic surfactants to disperse single and multiwalled carbon nanotubes,
   resorting to a stringently controlled sonication-centrifugation method
   for the preparation of the dispersions. The CNT concentration was
   accurately measured for a wide range of surfactant concentration, using
   combined therrnogravimetric analysis and UV-vis spectroscopy. The
   obtained dispersibility curves yield several quantitative parameters,
   which in turn allow for the effects of nanotube morphology and
   surfactant properties (aromatic rings, chain length, headgroup charge,
   and cmc) to be assessed and rationalized, both in terms of dispersed
   indicate that the CNT-surfactant association follows patterns that are
   markedly different from other equilibrium processes governed by
   hydrophobicity (such as micellization); in particular, the surfactant
   concentration needed for maximum dispersibility, c(s,max), and the
   number of surfactant molecules per unit CNT area at cs,max are shown to
   depend linearly on chain length. The results further suggest that the
   presence of micelles in the exfoliation process is not a key factor
   either for starting CNT dispersibility or attaining its saturation

Abstract = {{The diterpene (1R,3E,7E,11S,12S)-3,7,18-dolabellatriene from the marine
   brown alga Dilophus spiralis belongs to the dolabellanes natural product
   family and has antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus. Recently, we generated a CotB2 diterpene synthase
   mutant (W288G), which instead of its native product
   cyclooctat-9-en-7-ol, generates
   (1R,3E,7E,11S,12S)-3,7,18-dolabellatriene. In vivo CotB2 W288G
   reconstitution in an Escherichia coil based terpene production system,
   allowed efficient production of this olefinic macrocycle. To diversify
   the 3,7,18-dolabellatriene bioactivity we evaluated chemical and
   enzymatic methods for selective oxidation. Epoxidation by acetic
   peracid, which was formed in situ by a lipase catalyzed reaction of
   acetic acid with H2O2, provided efficient access to two monooxidized
   dolabellanes and to a novel di-epoxidated dolabellane species. These
   compounds could act as synthons en-route to new dolabellanes with
   diversified bioactivities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the almost
   quantitative 3,7,18-dolabellatriene conversion into the new, non-natural
   compound (1R,3E,7E,11S,12S,18R)-dolabella-3,7-diene-20-ol by
   hydroboration-oxidation with an enantiomeric excess of 94\%, for the

Abstract = {{Worldwide, prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common malignancy in
   males. We undertook a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety
   of conventional laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with a
   transperitoneal (TLRP) approach, versus that of an extraperitoneal
   (ELRP) approach, for treatment of localized PCa. A comprehensive
   literature search retrieved 14 publications, with a total of 1715
   patients. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that an ELRP approach
   was associated with a significantly shorter postoperative
   catheterization time (MD: 1.99; 95\% CI: 0.52 to 3.54; P = 0.008), less
   blood transfusion rate (OR: 2.05; 95\% CI: 1.03 to 4.06; P = 0.04),
   shorter intestinal function recovery time (MD: 0.08; 95\% CI: 0.52 to
   1.09; P < 0.0001) and shorter hospitalization days (MD: 2.71; 95\% CI:
   1.03 to 4.39; P = 0.002). In addition, our results showed no
   statistically significant differences between the two groups in
   operation time (MD: 19.39; 95\% CI: -6.67 to 45.44; P = 0.014),
   intraoperative blood loss (MD: 4.89; 95\% CI: -105.00 to 114.79; P =
   0.93) and total complication rate (RR: 1.22; 95\% CI: 0.86 to 1.74; P =
   0.27). In summary, our meta-analysis showed that ELRP is likely to be a
   safe and feasible alternative for localized PCa patients compared with

Title = {{Upper abdominal shape as a risk factor of extended operation time and
   severe postoperative complications in HCC hepatectomy through subcostal
   incision}},
Journal = {{WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Subcostal incision is the most widely used approach in open
   surgery for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Body shape is
   recognised to be a factor influencing the difficulty of surgery;
   however, the exact impact of the increased difficulty on the patients'
   operation as well as the outcome has not been analysed. In this study,
   we retrospectively studied the possible influence of patients' body
   shape, tumour burden and varied surgical methods on the operation
   procedure and postoperative complications.
   Methods: From January 2009 to December 2013, 651 patients with HCC were
   included in the study. We studied the patients' sex, age, body mass
   index, upper abdominal body shape described by the depth-to-width ratio
   for the trunk at the celiac axis on CT/MRI, Child-Pugh classification,
   tumour burden and a different liver dissection method before the surgery
   and used a regression model for analysis.
   Results: Prolonged operation time is associated with advanced tumour
   stage, large CA ratio, previous abdominal surgery, selective hepatic
   vascular occlusion and dissecting with Cavitron ultrasonic surgical
   aspirator rather than clamp crushing. Surgical blood loss is associated
   with operation time, liver function and a different liver dissection
   method. The incidence of severe postoperative complication was 17.5 \%
   (114/651) and was associated with larger CA ratio, Child-Pugh stage B
   liver function and greater blood loss.
   Conclusions: Large upper abdominal shape is a risk factor of both
   prolonged operation time and severe postoperative complication. CA ratio
   combined with liver function and surgical blood loss has an acceptable
   power to predict severe postoperative complications.}},

Title = {{Butyrate inhibits pro-proliferative miR-92a by diminishing c-Myc-induced
   miR-17-92a cluster transcription in human colon cancer cells}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR CANCER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Compromised colonic butyrate production resulting from low
   dietary fiber or altered gut microbiota may promote colon neoplasia.
   Previous reports indicate these actions are mediated in part by altered
   levels of miRNAs, including suppressed expression of the oncogenic
   miR-17-92a cluster. Here, we sought to identify the mechanisms
   underlying these effects of butyrate in colon cancer.
   Methods: miR-92a levels were measured in archived human colon cancer and
   adjacent normal colon specimens by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR
   (qPCR). The effects of butyrate and other histone deacetylase inhibitors
   (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid) on primary
   (pri-miR17-92a), precursor and mature miR-92a were analyzed in HCT-116
   and HT-29 human colon cancer cells using qPCR. The effects of butyrate,
   SAHA and valproic acid on protein levels of c-Myc, Drosha and p57 were
   measured in HCT-116 cells using immunoblotting. Regulation of C13orf25
   promoter activity by butyrate was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay
   using modified pGL3 constructs containing a wild-type or mutated c-Myc
   binding site. Expression of c-Myc was modulated using siRNA or
   adenovirus vectors. p57 mRNA and protein were measured before and after
   transfection with miR-92a-mimic molecules. Following butyrate treatment
   and miR-92a-mimic transfection, apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining
   and caspase-3 immunoblotting.
   Results: Microarray, confirmed by qPCR, revealed a seven-fold increase
   in miR-92a levels in sporadic human colon cancer tissue compared to
   adjacent normal colon. Treating human colon cancer cells with butyrate
   reduced the levels of pri-miR17-92a, precursor and mature miR-92a, as
   well as c-Myc. SAHA and valproic acid had similar effects. Mutation of
   the c-Myc binding site diminished butyrate's inhibitory effects on
   C13orf25 promoter activity. Silencing c-Myc expression reduced miR-92a
   levels. c-Myc over-expression neutralized butyrate-induced attenuation
   of pri-miR17-92a. Exogenous miR-92a inhibited butyrate-induced p57
   expression and reversed the beneficial actions of butyrate on colon
   cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.
   Conclusions: Our findings identify a novel cellular mechanism whereby
   butyrate inhibits miR-92a transcription by reducing c-Myc, thus
   augmenting p57 levels. These actions diminish colon cancer cell
   proliferation and stimulate apoptosis. This newly described regulation
   of oncogenic miRNA biogenesis expands our understanding of colon cancer
   cell biology and identifies novel therapeutic targets.}},

Abstract = {{Human Pin1 is involved in cancer developments and has been a
   pharmaceutical target. Thus, finding a high-affinity inhibitor of Pin1
   has become an attractive topic. The WW domain of human Pin1 can
   recognize the phosphoserine/ phosphothreonine-proline (pS/pT-P) motifs,
   while its PPIase domain catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of prolyl
   bonds to regulate the cell cycle. Here we incorporated a series of
   4-substituted proline derivatives into the phosphopeptides and
   investigated their affinities for the WW domain of Pin1 to develop
   better inhibitors of Pin1. On the basis of the ligand Myt1-T412
   {[}PPA(pT)PP], we synthesized several phosphopeptides in which the
   proline residue in the pT-P motif was replaced with various
   4-substituted proline derivatives. Isothermal titration calorimetry and
   fluorescence anisotropy analyses show that the replacement of proline
   with (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline increases the binding affinity of the
   peptide. Circular dichroism measurements suggest that a more PPII-like
   structure of phosphopeptides makes them bind to the WW domain more
   tightly. Chemical shift perturbation experiments also indicate that
   (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline interacts with Trp34 of the WW domain in the
   binding site. Results of molecular modeling further suggested that a
   strong C-H...pi interaction induced by (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline is
   important in enhancing the affinity of the peptide for the WW domain.
   The results of this study provide new valuable information for designing
   and developing effective inhibitors of human Pin1.}},

Abstract = {{Vaccination with the minor capsid protein L2, notably the 17-36
   neutralizing epitope, induces broadly protective antibodies, although
   the neutralizing titers attained in serum are substantially lower than
   for the licensed L1 VLP vaccines. Here we examine the impact of other
   less reactogenic adjuvants upon the induction of durable neutralizing
   serum antibody responses and protective immunity after vaccination with
   HPV16 and HPV31 L2 amino acids 17-36 inserted at positions 587 and 453
   of VP3, respectively, for surface display on Adeno-Associated Virus
   2-like particles {[}AAVLP (HPV16/31L2)]. Mice were vaccinated three
   times subcutaneously with AAVLP (HPV16/31L2) at two week intervals at
   several doses either alone or formulated with alum, alum and MPL, RIBI
   adjuvant or Cervarix. The use of adjuvant with AAVLP (HPV16/31L2) was
   necessary in mice for the induction of L2-specific neutralizing antibody
   and protection against vaginal challenge with HPV16. While use of alum
   was sufficient to elicit durable protection (>3 months after the final
   immunization), antibody titers were increased by addition of MPL and
   RIBI adjuvants. To determine the breadth of immunity, rabbits were
   immunized three times with AAVLP (HPV16/31L2) either alone, formulated
   with alum MPL, or RIBI adjuvants, and after serum collection, the
   animals were concurrently challenged with HPV16/31/35/39/45/58/59
   quasivirions or cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) at 6 or 12
   months post-immunization. Strong protection against all HPV types was
   observed at both 6 and 12 months post-immunization, including robust
   protection in rabbits receiving the vaccine without adjuvant. In
   summary, vaccination with AAVLP presenting HPV L2 17-36 epitopes at two
   sites on their surface induced cross-neutralizing serum antibody,
   immunity against HPV16 in the genital tract, and long-term protection
   against skin challenge with the 7 most common oncogenic HPV types when
   using a clinically relevant adjuvant. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells utilize a novel
   non-canonical pathway of glutamine metabolism that is essential for
   tumor growth and redox balance. Inhibition of this metabolic pathway in
   PDAC can potentially synergize with therapies that increase
   intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as radiation. Here, we
   evaluated the dependence of pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs) on this
   non-canonical glutamine metabolism pathway and researched whether
   inhibiting this pathway can enhance radiosensitivity of PCSCs. We showed
   that glutamine deprivation significantly inhibited self-renewal,
   decreased expression of stemness-related genes, increased intracellular
   ROS, and induced apoptosis in PCSCs. These effects were countered by
   oxaloacetate, but not a-ketoglutarate. Knockdown of glutamic-oxaloacetic
   transaminase dramatically impaired PCSCs properties, while glutamate
   dehydrogenase knockdown had a limited effect, suggesting a dependence of
   PCSCs on non-canonical glutamine metabolism. Additionally, glutamine
   deprivation significantly increased radiation-induced ROS and sensitized
   PCSCs to fractionated radiation. Moreover, transaminase inhibitors
   effectively enhanced ROS generation, promoted radiation sensitivity, and
   attenuated tumor growth in nude mice following radiation exposure. Our
   findings reveal that inhibiting the non-canonical pathway of glutamine
   metabolism enhances the PCSC radiosensitivity and may be an effective
   adjunct in cancer radiotherapy.}},

Title = {{Experimental verification and molecular basis of active immunization
   against fungal pathogens in termites}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Termites are constantly exposed to many pathogens when they nest and
   forage in the field, so they employ various immune strategies to defend
   against pathogenic infections. Here, we demonstrate that the
   subterranean termite Reticulitermes chinensis employs active
   immunization to defend against the entomopathogen Metarhizium
   anisopliae. Our results showed that allogrooming frequency increased
   significantly between fungus-treated termites and their nestmates.
   Through active social contact, previously healthy nestmates only
   received small numbers of conidia from fungus-treated individuals. These
   nestmates experienced low-level fungal infections, resulting in low
   mortality and apparently improved antifungal defences. Moreover,
   infected nestmates promoted the activity of two antioxidant enzymes (SOD
   and CAT) and upregulated the expression of three immune genes
   (phenoloxidase, transferrin, and termicin). We found 20 differentially
   expressed proteins associated with active immunization in R. chinensis
   through iTRAQ proteomics, including 12 stress response proteins, six
   immune signalling proteins, and two immune effector molecules.
   Subsequently, two significantly upregulated (60S ribosomal protein L23
   and isocitrate dehydrogenase) and three significantly downregulated
   (glutathione S-transferase D1, cuticle protein 19, and ubiquitin
   conjugating enzyme) candidate immune proteins were validated by MRM
   assays. These findings suggest that active immunization in termites may
   be regulated by different immune proteins.}},

Abstract = {{The physiological gaseous molecule, carbon monoxide (CO) becomes a
   subject of extensive investigation due to its vasoactive activity
   throughout the body but its role in gastroprotection has been little
   investigated. We determined the mechanism of CO released from its donor
   tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (CORM-2) in protection of
   gastric mucosa against 75\% ethanol-induced injury. Rats were pretreated
   with CORM-2 30 min prior to 75\% ethanol with or without 1)
   non-selective (indomethacin) or selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-1
   (SC-560) and COX-2 (celecoxib) inhibitors, 2) nitric oxide (NO) synthase
   inhibitor L-NNA, 3) ODQ, a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor,
   hemin, a heme oxygenase (HO)-1 inductor or zinc protoporphyrin IX
   (ZnPPIX), an inhibitor of HO-1 activity. The CO content in gastric
   mucosa and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) level in blood was analyzed by gas
   chromatography. The gastric mucosal mRNA expression for HO-1, COX-1,
   COX-2, iNOS, IL-4, IL-1 beta was analyzed by real-time PCR while HO-1,
   HO-2 and Nrf2 protein expression was determined by Western Blot.
   Pretreatment with CORM-2 (0.5-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated
   ethanol-induced lesions and raised gastric blood flow (GBF) but large
   dose of 100 mg/kg was ineffective. CORM-2 (5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg i.g.)
   significantly increased gastric mucosal CO content and whole blood COHb
   level. CORM-2-induced protection was reversed by indomethacin, SC-560
   and significantly attenuated by celecoxib, ODQ and L-NNA. Hemin
   significantly reduced ethanol damage and raised GBF while ZnPPIX which
   exacerbated ethanol-induced injury inhibited CORM-2- and hemininduced
   gastroprotection and the accompanying rise in GBF. CORM-2 significantly
   increased gastric mucosal HO-1 mRNA expression and decreased mRNA
   expression for iNOS, IL-1 beta, COX-1 and COX-2 but failed to affect
   HO-1 and Nrf2 protein expression decreased by ethanol. We conclude that
   CORM-2 released CO exerts gastroprotection against ethanol-induced
   gastric lesions involving an increase in gastric microcirculation
   mediated by sGC/cGMP, prostaglandins derived from COX-1, NO-NOS system
   and its anti-inflammatory properties.}},

Abstract = {{The Shapiro-Francia (SF) normality test is an important test in
   statistical modelling. However, little has been done by researchers to
   compare the performance of this test to other normality tests. This
   paper therefore measures the performance of the SF and other normality
   tests by studying the distribution of their p-values. For the purpose of
   this study, we selected eight well-known normality tests to compare with
   the SF test: (i) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS), (ii) Anderson-Darling (AD),
   (iii) Cramer von Mises (CM), (iv) Lilliefors (LF), (v) Shapiro-Wilk
   (SW), (vi) Pearson chi-square (PC), (vii) Jarque-Bera (JB) and (viii)
   D'Agostino (DA). The distribution of p-values of these normality tests
   were obtained by generating data from normal distribution and well-known
   symmetric non-normal distribution at various sample sizes (small, medium
   and large). Our simulation results showed that the SF normality test was
   the best test statistic in detecting deviation from normality among the
   nine tests considered at all sample sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Mixing of two biopolymers can results in phase separation due to their
   thermodynamically incompatibility under certain conditions. This
   phenomenon was first reported when the solution was allowed to
   equilibrate, but it has later been observed also as a consequence of
   drying. The challenges of this study were to observe phase segregation
   by confocal Raman microscopy and LV-SEM on dried film, individually
   dried particles, and spray dried particles. The influence of the solid
   content and the phase ratio (composition) of a HPMC/maltodextrin mixture
   on the localization of the ingredients in the individually dried
   particles was investigated. We observed that phase segregation of HPMC
   and maltodextrin is induced by solvent evaporation in film drying,
   single particle drying, as well as spray drying. The phase ratio is an
   important parameter that influences the localization of the
   HPMC-enriched phase and maltodextrin-enriched phase, i.e., to the
   particle surface, to the core, or in a more or less bicontinuous
   pattern. The drying time, affected by the solids content, was found to
   control the level of advancement of the phase segregation.}},

Abstract = {{Ferritin A from Escherichia coli (EcEtnA) is 24-meric protein, which
   forms spherical cagelike structures called nanocages. The nanocage
   structure is stabilized by the interface around 4-, 3-, and 2-fold
   symmetric axes. The subunit structure of EcFtnA comprises a four-helix
   bundle (helices A-D) and an additional helix E, which forms a 4-fold
   axis. In this study, we examined the contribution of the interface
   around three symmetric axes. pH-induced dissociation experiments
   monitored by analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray
   scattering showed that the dimer related by 2-fold symmetry is the most
   stable unit. Mutations located near the 3-fold axis revealed that the
   contribution of each interaction was small. A mutant lacking helix E at
   the 4-fold axis formed a nanocage, suggesting that helix E is not
   essential for nanocage formation. Further truncation of the C-terminus
   of helix D abrogated the formation of the nanocage, suggesting that a
   few residues located at the C-terminus of helix D are critical for this
   process. These properties are similar to those known for mammalian
   ferritins and seem to be common principles for nanocage formation. The
   difference between EcFtnA and mammalian ferritins was that helix
   E-truncated EcEtnA maintained an iron-incorporating ability, whereas
   mammalian mutants lost it.}},

Abstract = {{Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited
   intellectual disability, resulting from a CGG repeat expansion in the
   fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Here, we report a strategy
   for CGG repeat correction using CRISPR/Cas9 for targeted deletion in
   both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells derived
   from FXS patients. Following gene correction in FXS induced pluripotent
   stem cells, FMR1 expression was restored and sustained in neural
   precursor cells and mature neurons. Strikingly, after removal of the CGG
   repeats, the upstream CpG island of the FMR1 promoter showed extensive
   demethylation, an open chromatin state, and transcription initiation.
   These results suggest a silencing maintenance mechanism for the FMR1
   promoter that is dependent on the existence of the CGG repeat expansion.
   Our strategy for deletion of trinucleotide repeats provides further
   insights into the molecular mechanisms of FXS and future therapies of
   trinucleotide repeat disorders.}},

Journal = {{BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: To determine whether continuous intravenous infusion of
   dexmedetomidine (DEX) can affect the incidence of Emergence Agitation
   (EA) after general anesthesia in infant undergoing cleft palate repair
   surgery.
   Methods: Forty infants underwent cleft palate repair surgery under
   general anesthesia were randomly divided into the DEX (D) group and
   Placebo (P) groups. Patients in group D received continuous intravenous
   infusion of DEX 0.8 mu g.kg-1.min(-1) after the induction. Patients in
   group P were administered with continuous intravenous infusion of the
   equivalent volume of normal saline. Both groups were induced with
   fentanyl 0.005 mg/Kg, propofol 2 mg/Kg and cisatracurium 0.2 mg/Kg.
   Anaesthesia was maintained with continuous intravenous infusion of
   propofol (2 mg/Kg.h), remifentanil (0.1 mu g/Kg.h), and inhalation of 1
   to 3 \% sevoflurane.
   Result: The heart rate (HR) in group P was significant higher than that
   in group D at the time of operation (P < 0.05), postoperative 15 min, 30
   min and the time of extubation (P < 0.01). The mean arterial pressure
   (MAP) in group P was higher comparing with MAP in group D at the time of
   extubation (P < 0.05). The spontaneous eye opening times and spontaneous
   arm or leg motion times were longer in group D (P < 0.05). The mean
   agitation scores of patients in group D were significantly lower than
   that in group P (P < 0.01). However, the incidence of EA in group P and
   group D was 90 \% and 15 \% (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The continuous intravenous infusion of DEX after induction
   could significantly reduce the occurrence of EA.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:To report the rates and predictors of progression from normal
   cognition to either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia using
   standardized neuropsychological methods.Methods:A prospective cohort of
   patients diagnosed with Parkinson disease (PD) and baseline normal
   cognition was assessed for cognitive decline, performance, and function
   for a minimum of 2 years, and up to 6. A panel of movement disorders
   experts classified patients as having normal cognition, MCI, or
   dementia, with 55/68 (80.9\%) of eligible patients seen at year 6.
   Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to
   examine cognitive decline and its predictors.Results:We enrolled 141
   patients, who averaged 68.8 years of age, 63\% men, who had PD on
   average for 5 years. The cumulative incidence of cognitive impairment
   was 8.5\% at year 1, increasing to 47.4\% by year 6. All incident MCI
   cases had progressed to dementia by year 5. In a multivariate analysis,
   predictors of future decline were male sex (p = 0.02), higher Unified
   Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (p 0.001), and worse global
   cognitive score (p < 0.001).Conclusions:Approximately half of patients
   with PD with normal cognition at baseline develop cognitive impairment
   within 6 years and all new MCI cases progress to dementia within 5
   years. Our results show that the transition from normal cognition to
   cognitive impairment, including dementia, occurs frequently and quickly.
   Certain clinical and cognitive variables may be useful in predicting
   progression to cognitive impairment in PD.}},

Title = {{Kinetics of Zinc and Cadmium Exchanges between Metallothionein and

Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Pages = {{6284-6293}},

Abstract = {{The flexible coordination stoichiometry of a relatively high number of
   metal ions is a property unique to the metallothionein (MT) family of
   proteins. Mammalian MTs, for example, accommodate up to seven divalent
   metal ions in tetrahedral coordination geometries, using its complement
   of 20 cysteine ligands. The lability of the metals from these
   metalloclusters has been used to support the proposal of MTs acting as
   metal chaperones, by donating to other metal-binding proteins. The metal
   exchange kinetics between human MT1A and carbonic anhydrase (CA) were
   examined using time-dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
   (ESI-MS). The time dependence of three different reaction conditions
   were studied: (0 zinc donation from partially metalated zinc-MT to
   apoCA; (ii) metal exchange between zinc saturated MTs and cadmium
   saturated CA (Cd-CA); and (iii) metal exchange between partially
   metalated zinc-MTs and Cd-CA. The results show that zinc donation from
   Zn-MTs to apo-zinc-dependent enzymes is dependent on the metal loading
   of the Z(n)-MT (where n = 1-7) and that this is a direct consequence of
   the increasing metal affinity for smaller values of n. Partially
   metalated MTs are also shown to extract cadmium from Cd-CA with
   significantly faster rates than metal saturated MTs and that even under
   zinc limiting conditions, mammalian Cd-CA would not coexist with MT. On
   the basis of these and previously published results, we suggest that
   protein protein interactions between MT and CA facilitate metal
   transfers through favorable electrostatic interactions and hypothesize
   that the metal could be transferred between the MT and the enzyme active
   site using nearby metal-binding functionalities along the transfer
   pathway.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory disease that results in the
   destruction of soft tissue and bone around the implant. Titanium implant
   corrosion has been attributed to the implant failure and cytotoxic
   effects to the alveolar bone. We have documented the extent of titanium
   release into surrounding plaque in patients with and without
   peri-implantitis. An in vitro model was designed to represent the actual
   environment of an implant in a patient's mouth. The model uses actual
   oral microbiota from a volunteer, allows monitoring electrochemical
   processes generated by biofilms growing on implants and permits control
   of biocorrosion electrical current. As determined by next generation DNA
   sequencing, microbial compositions in experiments with the in vitro
   model were comparable with the compositions found in patients with
   implants. It was determined that the electrical conductivity of titanium
   implants was the key factor responsible for the biocorrosion process.
   The interruption of the biocorrosion current resulted in a 4-5 fold
   reduction of corrosion. We propose a new design of dental implant that
   combines titanium in zero oxidation state for osseointegration and
   strength, interlaid with a nonconductive ceramic. In addition, we
   propose electrotherapy for manipulation of microbial biofilms and to
   induce bone healing in peri-implantitis patients.}},

Abstract = {{We grew Pt films on TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 (001) by atomic layer
   deposition, using trimethyl(methyl-cydopentadienyl)-platinum(IV) as the
   Pt source and O-2 and O-3 as the oxidants. The orientation of the Pt
   films grown with O-2 varied from (111) to (001) as the growth
   temperature was increased from 220 to 350 degrees C, while the Pt films
   grown with O-3 have a strong preference for the (111) orientation even
   at a high growth temperature of 350 degrees C. The difference in the
   orientation of the Pt films on SrTiO3 (001) was attributed to changes in
   the degree of chemical bonding across the Pt/SrTiO3 interface with
   respect to the oxidant. We observed an increase in Pt-O bonding at the
   interface between the Pt grown with O-3 and the SrTiO3 substrate. The
   interfacial energy of Pt (111)parallel to SrTiO3 (001) may have been
   significantly decreased by the increase in Pt-O bonding at the
   interface, which eventually led to the strong (111) preference of the Pt
   grown with O-3. The findings provide the possibility of controlling the
   orientation of Pt without manipulating the kinetic energy of crystal
   growth.}},

Title = {{Cadherin-13, a risk gene for ADHD and comorbid disorders, impacts
   GABAergic function in hippocampus and cognition}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Cadherin-13 (CDH13), a unique glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
   member of the cadherin family of cell adhesion molecules, has been
   identified as a risk gene for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD) and various comorbid neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
   conditions, including depression, substance abuse, autism spectrum
   disorder and violent behavior, while the mechanism whereby CDH13
   dysfunction influences pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders
   remains elusive. Here we explored the potential role of CDH13 in the
   inhibitory modulation of brain activity by investigating synaptic
   function of GABAergic interneurons. Cellular and subcellular
   distribution of CDH13 was analyzed in the murine hippocampus and a mouse
   model with a targeted inactivation of Cdh13 was generated to evaluate
   how CDH13 modulates synaptic activity of hippocampal interneurons and
   behavioral domains related to psychopathologic (endo) phenotypes. We
   show that CDH13 expression in the cornu ammonis (CA) region of the
   hippocampus is confined to distinct classes of interneurons.
   Specifically, CDH13 is expressed by numerous parvalbumin and
   somatostatin-expressing interneurons located in the stratum oriens,
   where it localizes to both the soma and the presynaptic compartment.
   Cdh13(-/-) mice show an increase in basal inhibitory, but not
   excitatory, synaptic transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Associated
   with these alterations in hippocampal function, Cdh13(-/-) mice display
   deficits in learning and memory. Taken together, our results indicate
   that CDH13 is a negative regulator of inhibitory synapses in the
   hippocampus, and provide insights into how CDH13 dysfunction may
   contribute to the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance observed in
   neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ADHD and autism.}},

Abstract = {{In human adults, learning and memory under acute stress are
   characterized by an increased use of rigid habitual response strategies
   at the cost of flexible cognitive strategies. The immediate effects of
   stress on cognitive functioning early in life are not well understood.
   Here we show experimentally that acute stress leads human infants to
   perform habitual behavior rigidly. We found that 15-mo-old infants
   exposed to stress thereafter kept performing a previously effective
   action, even after the action suddenly became ineffective. Infants in a
   no-stress control group flexibly adjusted their behavior by disengaging
   from the newly ineffective action in favor of exploring an alternative
   action. This finding demonstrates that stress impairs infants' ability
   to adjust their behavior to changing circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we have developed a novel vaccine for Bluetongue named BT
   Disabled Infectious Single Animal (DISA) vaccine. Due to the lack of
   non-essential NS3/NS3 a protein, BT DISA vaccine is a replicating
   vaccine, but without the inherent risks of live-attenuated vaccines,
   such as residual virulence or reversion to virulence by mutations,
   reassortment with field virus, horizontal spread by vectors and vertical
   transmission. The immune response induced by BT DISA vaccines is rapidly
   induced, highly protective and serotype specific which is dependent on
   the immunodominant and serotype determining VP2 protein. The BT DISA
   vaccine platform provides the replacement of exclusively VP2 from
   different serotypes in order to safely formulate multivalent cocktail
   vaccines. The lack of NS3/NS3 a directed antibodies by BT DISA
   vaccination enables differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals
   (DIVA principle). A highly conserved immunogenic site corresponding to
   the late domain was mapped in the N-terminal region of NS3. We here
   established an NS3-specific competitive ELISA (NS3 cELISA) as
   serological DIVA test accompanying BT DISA vaccines. To this end, NS3
   protein missing putative transmembrane regions was produced in large
   amounts in bacteria and used as antigen in the NS3 cELISA which was
   investigated with a variety of sera. The NS3 cELISA displayed a high
   sensitivity and specificity similar to the commercially available
   VP7-specific cELISA. Results of previously performed
   vaccination-challenge trials with BT DISA vaccines clearly demonstrate
   the DIVA system based on the NS3 cELISA and BT vaccine free of NS3
   protein. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Multiplex networks (a system of multiple networks that have different
   types of links but share a common set of nodes) arise naturally in a
   wide spectrum of fields. Theoretical studies show that in such multiplex
   networks, correlated edge dynamics between the layers can have a
   profound effect on dynamical processes. However, how to extract the
   correlations from real-world systems is an outstanding challenge. Here
   we introduce the Multiplex Markov chain to quantify correlations in edge
   dynamics found in longitudinal data of multiplex networks. By comparing
   the results obtained from the multiplex perspective to a null model
   which assumes layers in a network are independent, we can identify real
   correlations as distinct from simultaneous changes that occur due to
   random chance. We use this approach on two different data sets: the
   network of trade and alliances between nation states, and the email and
   co-commit networks between developers of open source software. We
   establish the existence of ``dynamical spillover{''} showing the
   correlated formation (or deletion) of edges of different types as the
   system evolves. The details of the dynamics over time provide insight
   into potential causal pathways.}},

Title = {{Genome-wide analysis of myxobacterial two-component systems: genome
   relatedness and evolutionary changes}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Two-component systems (TCSs) are abundant prokaryotic
   signaling pathways, whose evolution is of particular importance because
   of their role in bacterial pathogenicity. Comparative genomics can
   provide important insights into the evolution of these genes, but
   inferences are dependent on the relatedness of the compared genomes.
   This study investigated the relationship between evolutionary distance
   and TCS evolution in myxobacterial genomes, of which there are several
   sequenced examples, of varying relatedness, and which encode large
   numbers of TCSs.
   Methods: Myxobacterial TCS gene sets were compared, orthologues defined,
   and changes in TCS properties such as gene organisation, domain
   architecture and size identified.
   Results: Genome relatedness/evolutionary distance was found to have a
   large effect on the apparent frequency of evolutionary events affecting
   TCS genes, but not on the relative dominance of different types of
   mutations. Large (>= 1 gene) indels were the most common changes, often
   giving rise to gene organisation changes. Smaller indels were also
   common, sometimes changing domain architecture, and/or leading to
   pseudogene formation. Individuality of myxobacterial TCS gene sets seems
   primarily due to lineage specific gene loss. However, there is also
   evidence of extensive acquisition of genes by lateral transfer, with
   gene duplication also creating new TCS genes.
   Conclusions: This study provides catalogues of myxobacterial TCS gene
   sets and their orthology relationships, benchmarked against genome
   relatedness. It also provides insights into the relationship between
   evolutionary distance and the inference of TCS estudies of TCS evolution
   beyond the myxobacteriavolution, which may be important for studies of
   TCS evolutiThe online version of this articleon beyond the myxobacteria.}},

   Alloying Approach}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are very important optical
   nanomaterials with a wide range of potential applications. However,
   blinking behavior of single QD is an intrinsic drawback for some
   biological and photoelectric applications based on single-particle
   emission. Herein we present a rational strategy for fabrication of
   non-blinking (Zn) CuInS/ZnS QDs in organic phase through in situ
   interfacial alloying approach. This new strategy includes three steps:
   synthesis of CuInS QDs, eliminating the interior traps of QDs by forming
   graded (Zn) CuInS alloyed QDs, modifying the surface traps of QDs by
   introducing ZnS shells onto (Zn) CuInS QDs using alkylthiols as sulfur
   source and surface ligands. The suppressed blinking mechanism was mainly
   attributed to modifying QDs traps from interior to exterior via a
   step-by-step modification. Non-blinking QDs show high quantum yield,
   symmetric emission spectra and excellent crystallinity, and will enable
   applications from biology to optoelectronics that were previously
   hindered by blinking behavior of traditional QDs.}},

Abstract = {{Problem-solving has been one of the major strands in science education
   research. But much of the problem-solving research has been conducted on
   discipline-based contexts; little research has been done on how
   students, especially individuals, solve interdisciplinary problems. To
   understand how individuals reason about interdisciplinary problems, we
   conducted an interview study with 16 graduate students coming from a
   variety of disciplinary backgrounds. During the interviews, we asked
   participants to solve two interdisciplinary science problems on the
   topic of osmosis. We investigated participants' problem reasoning
   processes and probed in their attitudes toward general interdisciplinary
   approach and specific interdisciplinary problems. Through a careful
   inductive content analysis of their responses, we studied how
   disciplinary, cognitive, and affective factors influenced their
   interdisciplinary problems-solving. We found that participants' prior
   discipline-based science learning experiences had both positive and
   negative influences on their interdisciplinary problem-solving. These
   influences were embodied in their conceptualization of the
   interdisciplinary problems, the strategies they used to integrate
   different disciplinary knowledge, and the attitudes they had toward
   interdisciplinary approach in general and specific interdisciplinary
   problems. This study sheds light on interdisciplinary science education
   by revealing the complex relationship between disciplinary learning and
   interdisciplinary problem-solving.}},

Abstract = {{The transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is a
   downstream effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, which plays
   important roles in cancer and stem cell biology. Hippo signaling
   inactivates TAZ through phosphorylation (mainly at S89). In the current
   study, we define a new layer of regulation of TAZ activity that is
   critical for its oncogenic function. We found that TAZ is phosphorylated
   in vitro and in vivo by the mitotic kinase CDK1 at S90, S105, T326, and
   T346 during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, mitotic
   phosphorylation inactivates TAZ oncogenic activity, as the
   non-phosphorylatable mutant (TAZ-S89A/S90A/S105A/T326A/T346A, TAZ-5A)
   possesses higher activity in epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
   anchorage-independent growth, cell migration, and invasion when compared
   to the TAZ-S89A mutant. Accordingly, TAZ-5A has higher transcriptional
   activity compared to the TAZ-S89A mutant. Finally, we show that TAZ-S89A
   or TAZ-5A (to a greater extent) was sufficient to induce spindle and
   centrosome defects, and chromosome misalignment/missegregation in
   immortalized epithelial cells. Together, our results reveal a previously
   unrecognized connection between TAZ oncogenicity and mitotic
   phospho-regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) has been reported to be involved in the
   development of several human cancers. However, its clinical significance
   and biological role in bladder cancer remains unclear. In this study, we
   sought to analyze the GOLPH3 expression in bladder cancer samples and
   cells, and explore its clinical significance and biological role. We
   found that GOLPH3 was significantly increased in bladder cancer tissues
   and cells. Overexpression of GOLPH3 had significant correlation with
   poorer survival for bladder cancer patients treated by cystectomy.
   Knockdown of GOLPH3 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion
   of cancer cells, and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. GOLPH3
   silencing inhibited AKT/m-TOR signaling, increased the cyclin-dependent
   kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27 and decreased the CDK regulator cyclin D1 and
   matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9). Thus, GOLPH3 is likely to play
   important roles in bladder cancer progression via modulating AKT/mTOR
   signaling, and it is a novel prognostic biomarker and promising
   therapeutic target for bladder cancer.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{To develop new agents against strawberry grey mould and to aid in the
   development of biological pesticides, we investigated the inhibitory
   effect of a natural compound, phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN), against
   Botrytis cinerea using a growth rate assay. Additionally, indoor
   toxicity and the in vitro control effect of PCN were further studied to
   determine its potential mechanisms of action on B. cinerea. PCN was
   inhibitory against B. cinerea with a 50\% effective concentration (EC50)
   of 108.12 mu g/mL; the toxicity of PCN was equivalent to that of
   carbendazim (CBM). The best in vitro control effect of PCN against grey
   mould in strawberry (fruit) reached 75.32\%, which was slightly higher
   than that of CBM. The field control effect of PCN against grey mould
   reached a maximum of 72.31\% at a PCN concentration of 700 mu g/mL,
   which was 1.02 times higher than that of CBM. Fungistatic activity was
   observed at low concentrations of PCN, while high concentrations of PCN
   resulted in fungicidal activity against B. cinerea. This natural
   compound strongly inhibited both spore and sclerotium germination of B.
   cinerea, with the best relative inhibition rates of 77.03\% and 82.11\%,
   respectively. The inhibitory effect of PCN on mycelial growth of B.
   cinerea was significant and reached levels of 87.32\%. Scanning electron
   microscopy observations revealed that after 48 h of PCN treatment, the
   mycelia appeared loose, locally twisted, and folded, with exudation of
   contents; the mycelia was withered and twisted, with edge burrs,
   deformations, ruptures and a sheet-like structure. Transmission electron
   microscopy observations revealed that after 48 h of PCN treatment, the
   structure of the cell nucleus was unclear and the vacuoles had ruptured;
   additionally, various organelles exhibited disordered structures, there
   were substantial non-membrane transparent inclusions, the cells were
   plasmolysed, the cell walls were collapsed in some cases, and the hyphal
   tissue was essentially necrotic. A PCN dosage of 35-140 mu g/mL had no
   effect on the cell membrane permeability of the mycelia, while a PCN
   dosage of 700 mu g/mL resulted in significant permeability. PCN
   inhibited B. cinerea toxin; the mycotoxin level was approximately 0.41
   of the value recorded for the control at a PCN dosage of 700 mu g/mL.
   PCN affected the activity of pectin methylgalacturonase (PMG),
   polygalacturonase (PG), cellulase (Cx) and beta-glucosidase (BG); the
   lowest activities of PMG, PG, BG and Cx reached 0.3 U/mg, 0.62 U/mg,
   0.64 U/mg, and 0.79 U/mg, respectively, after treatment with 700 mu g/mL

Title = {{Early postnatal demoralisation among primiparous women in the community:
   measurement, prevalence and associated factors}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Demoralisation is a psychological state occurring in
   stressful life situations where a person feels unable to respond
   effectively to their circumstances, characterised by feelings of
   distress, subjective incompetence, helplessness and hopelessness. The
   period after the birth of a first baby is a time of great changes and
   disruptions to many aspects of the mother's physical, psychological and
   social functioning. This can lead to feelings of distress, a sense of
   incompetence and helplessness. This study aimed to examine: (1) the
   psychometric properties of the Demoralisation Scale in a community
   setting; (2) the prevalence of demoralisation symptoms among primiparous
   women in the community; and (3) factors that are uniquely associated
   with demoralisation in the early postnatal period.
   Methods: Primiparous women attending community maternal health centres
   (n = 400) were recruited and administered the study's questionnaires
   through a telephone interview.
   Results: The Demoralisation Scale was found to be a reliable and valid
   tool among women in the community who had recently given birth. Higher
   levels of demoralisation were independently associated with lower
   confidence on going home from the hospital after birth, lower rating of
   mother's self-rated global health, more than 3 h of infant crying and
   fussing in the last 24 h, and a controlling partner, after symptoms of
   depression and anxiety, and vulnerable personality characteristics were
   controlled for.
   Conclusions: The relevance of demoralisation to postnatal health
   practitioners in the community is in helping them to better understand
   women's experiences and to intervene in a way that is more meaningful
   and less stigmatising to women.}},

Title = {{Delineation of Natural Killer Cell Differentiation from Myeloid
   Progenitors in Human}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Understanding of natural killer (NK) cell development in human is
   incomplete partly because of limited access to appropriate human
   tissues. We have developed a cytokine-enhanced humanized mouse model
   with greatly improved reconstitution and function of human NK cells.
   Here we report the presence of a cell population in the bone marrow of
   the cytokine-treated humanized mice that express both NK cell marker
   CD56 and myeloid markers such as CD36 and CD33. The CD56+CD33+CD36+
   cells are also found in human cord blood, fetal and adult bone marrow.
   Although the CD56+CD33+CD36+ cells do not express the common NK cell
   functional receptors and exhibit little cytotoxic and cytokine-producing
   activities, they readily differentiate into mature NK cells by acquiring
   expression of NK cell receptors and losing expression of the myeloid
   markers. Further studies show that CD33+CD36+ myeloid NK precursors are
   derived from granulo-myelomonocytic progenitors. These results delineate
   the pathway of human NK cell differentiation from myeloid progenitors in
   the bone marrow and suggest the utility of humanized mice for studying
   human hematopoiesis.}},

Abstract = {{Fusion of individual myoblasts to form multinucleated myofibers
   constitutes a widely conserved program for growth of the somatic
   musculature. We have used electron microscopy methods to study this key
   form of cell-cell fusion during development of the indirect flight
   muscles (IFMs) of Drosophila melanogaster. We find that IFM
   myoblast-myotube fusion proceeds in a stepwise fashion and is governed
   by apparent cross talk between transmembrane and cytoskeletal elements.
   Our analysis suggests that cell adhesion is necessary for bringing
   myoblasts to within a minimal distance from the myotubes. The branched
   actin polymerization machinery acts subsequently to promote tight
   apposition between the surfaces of the two cell types and formation of
   multiple sites of cell-cell contact, giving rise to nascent fusion pores
   whose expansion establishes full cytoplasmic continuity. Given the
   conserved features of IFM myogenesis, this sequence of cell interactions
   and membrane events and the mechanistic significance of cell adhesion
   elements and the actin-based cytoskeleton are likely to represent
   general principles of the myoblast fusion process.}},

Abstract = {{Seeded emulsion polymerization is a powerful universal method to produce
   ultrasmall multifunctional magnetic nanohybrids. In a two-step
   procedure, iron oxide nanocrystals were initially encapsulated in a
   polystyrene (PS) shell and subsequently used as beads for a controlled
   assembly of elongated quantum dots/quantum rods (QDQRs). The synthesis
   of a continuous PS shell allows the whole construct to be fixed and the
   composition of the nanohybrid to be tuned. The fluorescence of the QDQRs
   and magnetism of iron oxide were perfectly preserved, as confirmed by
   single-particle investigation, fluorescence decay measurements, and
   relaxometry. Biofunctionalization of the hybrids was straightforward,
   involving copolymerization of appropriate affinity ligands as shown by
   immunoblot analysis. Additionally, the universality of this method was
   shown by the embedment of a broad scale of NPs.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of dynamical and static electron correlation (SEC) is
   mandatory for accurate quantum chemistry (QC). SEC is particularly
   difficult to calculate and hence a qualitative understanding is
   important to judge the applicability of approximate QC methods. Existing
   scalar SEC diagnostics, however, lack the important information where
   the SEC effects occur in a molecule. We introduce an analysis tool based
   on a fractional occupation number weighted electron density (rho(FOD))
   that is plotted in 3D for a pre-defined contour surface value. The
   scalar field is obtained by finite-temperature DFT calculations with
   pre-defined electronic temperature (e.g. TPSS at 5000 K). FOD plots only
   show the contribution of the ``hot{''} (strongly correlated) electrons.
   We discuss illustrative plots for a broad range of chemical systems from
   small molecules to large conjugated molecules with polyradicaloid
   character. Spatial integration yields a single number which can be used
   to globally quantify SEC.}},

Abstract = {{Current efforts to promote STEAM (STEM + Arts) education focus
   predominantly on how partnering with the arts provides a range of
   benefits to STEM students. Here we take a different approach and focus
   on what art and art education students stand to gain from collaborating
   with STEM students. Drawing on a variety of student field texts, we
   present three visual-verbal, constructed narratives of art education
   students who, in the context of a transdisciplinary design studio, were
   challenged to experiment with collaborative forms of creative thinking.
   Their stories point to STEAM as an opportunity for art students to
   question the notion of the `lone artist,' reflect upon the tension
   between product and process, and expand disciplinary-based
   understandings of creative thinking. These potential benefits align with
   contemporary visual arts practices that strive to move beyond the
   individual and embrace dialogue, collaborative action, and
   interdisciplinarity as vital aspects of the creative process.}},

Abstract = {{Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a widespread
   post-transcriptional mechanism, but its genomic landscape and clinical
   relevance in cancer have not been investigated systematically. We
   characterized the global A-to-I RNA editing profiles of 6,236 patient
   samples of 17 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and revealed a
   striking diversity of altered RNA-editing patterns in tumors relative to
   normal tissues. We identified an appreciable number of clinically
   relevant editing events, many of which are in noncoding regions. We
   experimentally demonstrated the effects of several cross-tumor
   nonsynonymous RNA editing events on cell viability and provide the
   evidence that RNA editing could selectively affect drug sensitivity.
   These results highlight RNA editing as an exciting theme for
   investigating cancer mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Disintegration of finished dosage forms (FDF) and drug dissolution are
   fundamentally important processes that affect bioavailability.
   Established theories do not account for disintegration and usually
   assume sink conditions for drug dissolution that often do not apply. We
   present the theory to describe the disintegration of FDF with subsequent
   dissolution of liberated particles containing the active pharmaceutical
   ingredient (API) and its application using population data analysis.
   Population modeling, using dissolution profiles of 400 mg cefditoren
   pivoxil tablets manufactured under various tableting pressures,
   characterized the intrinsic lifetime distribution of the particles and
   identified the presence of crystalline API in the formulation that was
   proven by X-ray diffraction. Modeling further estimated the
   disintegration time of FDF, the solubility of the amorphous API and its
   chemical instability in the medium that were in agreement with the
   experimentally determined values. This novel approach provides a
   quantitative understanding of the manufacturing process of FDF and can
   substantially contribute to the targeted development of finished dosage
   forms. (C) 2015 Elsevier BV. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A functional genomics screen identifies an Importin-alpha homolog as a
   regulator of stem cell function and tissue patterning during planarian
   regeneration}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Planarians are renowned for their regenerative capacity and
   are an attractive model for the study of adult stem cells and tissue
   regeneration. In an effort to better understand the molecular mechanisms
   underlying planarian regeneration, we performed a functional genomics
   screen aimed at identifying genes involved in this process in Schmidtea
   mediterranea.
   Methods: We used microarrays to detect changes in gene expression in
   regenerating and non-regenerating tissues in planarians regenerating one
   side of the head and followed this with high-throughput screening by in
   situ hybridization and RNAi to characterize the expression patterns and
   function of the differentially expressed genes.
   Results: Along with five previously characterized genes (Smed-cycD,
   Smed-morf41/mrg-1, Smed-pdss2/dlp1, Smed-slbp, and Smed-tph), we
   identified 20 additional genes necessary for stem cell maintenance
   (Smed-sart3, Smed-smarcc-1, Smed-espl1, Smed-rrm2b-1, Smed-rrm2b-2,
   Smed-dkc1, Smed-emg1, Smed-lig1, Smed-prim2, Smed-mcm7, and a novel
   sequence) or general regenerative capability (Smed-rbap46/48-2,
   Smed-mcm2, Smed-ptbp1, and Smed-fen-1) or that caused tissue-specific
   defects upon knockdown (Smed-ddc, Smed-gas8, Smed-pgbd4, and Smed-b9d2).
   We also found that a homolog of the nuclear transport factor Importin-a
   plays a role in stem cell function and tissue patterning, suggesting
   that controlled nuclear import of proteins is important for
   regeneration.
   Conclusions: Through this work, we described the roles of several
   previously uncharacterized genes in planarian regeneration and
   implicated nuclear import in this process. We have additionally created
   an online database to house our in situ and RNAi data to make it
   accessible to the planarian research community.}},

   characterized as cofactor-free enzymes we report that the addition of
   one equivalent of CuI increases catalytic efficiency more than 20-fold
   and enables the identification of stereoselective C-H bond cleavage at

Title = {{Monte Carlo-based noise compensation in coil intensity corrected
   endorectal MRI}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer
   found in males making early diagnosis important. Magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) has been useful in visualizing and localizing tumor
   candidates and with the use of endorectal coils (ERC), the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved. The coils introduce
   intensity inhomogeneities and the surface coil intensity correction
   built into MRI scanners is used to reduce these inhomogeneities.
   However, the correction typically performed at the MRI scanner level
   leads to noise amplification and noise level variations.
   Methods: In this study, we introduce a new Monte Carlo-based noise
   compensation approach for coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI which
   allows for effective noise compensation and preservation of details
   within the prostate. The approach accounts for the ERC SNR profile via a
   spatially-adaptive noise model for correcting non-stationary noise
   variations. Such a method is useful particularly for improving the image
   quality of coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the
   MRI scanner level and when the original raw data is not available.
   Results: SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) analysis in patient
   experiments demonstrate an average improvement of 11.7 and 11.2 dB
   respectively over uncorrected endorectal MRI, and provides strong
   performance when compared to existing approaches.
   Discussion: Experimental results using both phantom and patient data
   showed that ACER provided strong performance in terms of SNR, CNR, edge
   preservation, subjective scoring when compared to a number of existing
   approaches.
   Conclusions: A new noise compensation method was developed for the
   purpose of improving the quality of coil intensity corrected endorectal
   MRI data performed at the MRI scanner level. We illustrate that
   promising noise compensation performance can be achieved for the
   proposed approach, which is particularly important for processing coil
   intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the MRI scanner
   level and when the original raw data is not available.}},

Abstract = {{The lithium-sulfur primary batteries, as seldom reported in the previous
   literatures, were developed in this work. In order to maximize its
   practical energy density, a novel cauliflower-like hierarchical porous
   C/S cathode was designed, for facilitating the lithium-ions transport
   and sulfur accommodation. This kind of cathode could release about 1300
   mAh g(-1) (S) capacity at sulfur loading of 6 similar to 14 mg cm(-2),
   and showed excellent shelf stability during a month test at room
   temperature. As a result, the assembled Li-S soft package battery
   achieved an energy density of 504 Wh kg(-1) (654 Wh L-1), which was the
   highest value ever reported to the best of our knowledge. This work
   might arouse the interests on developing primary Li-S batteries, with
   great potential for practical application.}},

Abstract = {{Winter ice cover of the Arctic Ocean makes year-round zooplankton
   sampling by plankton net a difficult task. Therefore, the collection of
   copepods with a sediment trap can be a powerful tool. In the present
   study, we analysed the seasonal changes in the population structures of
   five dominant planktonic copepods (Oncaea parila, Calanus hyperboreus,
   Metridia longa, Paraeuchaeta glacialis and Heterorhabdus norvegicus),
   which were collected using a sediment trap rotated at 10-15day intervals
   moored at 184-260m in the Northwind Abyssal Plain (75 degrees 00N, 162
   degrees 00W) of the western Arctic Ocean from October 2010 to September
   2012. Oncaea parila C6F with egg sacs occurred throughout the year, and
   the total abundance and composition of early copepodid stages (C1-C3)
   had two peaks each year. Calanus hyperboreus was dominated by C6F
   throughout the year, and their maturation was observed during February
   to May. Metridia longa C6F had a clear seasonality in lipid accumulation
   and gonad maturation: high lipid accumulation was observed from October
   to February, whereas gonad maturation occurred from March to September.
   Paraeuchaeta glacialis C6F also showed seasonality in lipid accumulation
   and gonad maturation, although their seasonal patterns varied from those
   of M. longa: high lipid individuals were abundant from February to April
   and mature individuals dominated from October to November. Heterorhabdus
   norvegicus showed seasonal changes in population structure as well: C1,
   C5, and C6M dominated from April to May, November to February and August
   to October, respectively. The life cycle patterns of these species are
   compared with those reported from other areas. While the results
   obtained by a sediment trap are inevitably subject to collection bias
   (i.e. passive collection at a fixed depth), a sediment trap should be
   considered as a powerful tool for the evaluation of the life cycle of
   planktonic copepods, especially in ice-covered oceans.}},

   study}},
Journal = {{GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study investigates the health impacts of a major
   liberalization episode in the textile and clothing (T\&C) sector. This
   episode triggered substantial shifts in employment across a wide range
   of countries. It is the first study to empirically link trade
   liberalization to health via changes in employment and offers some of
   the first empirical insights on how trade liberalization interacts with
   social policies to influence health.
   Methods: Data from 32 T\&C reliant countries were analysed in reference
   to the pre- and post-liberalization periods of 2000-2004 and 2005-2009.
   Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used to examine
   the association between countries' a) level of development b) labour
   market and welfare state protections c) T\&C employment changes and d)
   changes in adult female and infant mortality rates. Process tracing was
   used to further investigate these associations through twelve in-depth
   country studies.
   Results: Results from the fsQCA relate changes in employment after the
   phase-out to both changing adult female and infant mortality rates.
   Findings from the in-depth country studies suggest that the worsening of
   adult female mortality rates is related to workers' lack of social
   protection, both in the context of T\&C employment growth and loss.
   Conclusions: Overall, it is found that social protection is often
   inaccessible to the type of workers who may be the most vulnerable to
   processes of liberalization and that many workers are particularly
   vulnerable due to the structure of social protection policies. Social
   policies are therefore found to both moderate pathways to health and
   influence the type of health-related pathways resulting from trade
   liberalizing policies.}},

   edentulous mandibles: five-year results from a double-blind, randomized
   controlled trial}},
Journal = {{BMC ORAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to compare the 5-year survival and
   success rates of 3.3 mm dental implants either made from
   titanium-zirconium (TiZr) alloy or from Grade IV titanium (Ti Grade IV)
   in mandibular implant-based removable overdentures.
   Methods: The core study had a follow-up period of 36 months and was
   designed as a randomized, controlled, double-blind, split-mouth
   multicenter clinical trial. Patients with edentulous mandibles received
   two Straumann Bone Level implants (diameter 3.3 mm, SLActive (R)), one
   of TiZr (test) and one of Ti Grade IV (control), in the interforaminal
   region. This follow-up study recruited patients from the core study and
   evaluated the plaque and sulcus bleeding indices, radiographic crestal
   bone level, as well as implant survival and success 60 months after
   implant placement.
   Results: Of the 91 patients who initially received implants, 75
   completed the 36 month follow-up and 49 were available for the 60 month
   examination. Two patients were excluded so that a total of 47 patients
   with an average age of 72 +/- 8 years were analysed. The characteristics
   and 36-month performance of the present study cohort did not differ from
   the non-included initial participants (p > 0.05). In the period since
   the 36-month follow-up examination, no implant was lost. The cumulative
   implant survival rate was 98.9 \% for the TiZr group and 97.8 \% for the
   Ti Grade IV group. Crestal bone level changes at 60 months were not
   different in the test and control group (TiZr -0.60 +/- 0.69 mm and Ti
   Grade IV -0.61 +/- 0.83 mm; p = 0.96). The cumulative implant success
   rate after 60 months was 95.8 and 92.6 \% for TiZr and Ti Grade IV,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: After 60 months, the positive outcomes of the 36 month
   results for TiZr and Ti Grade IV implants were confirmed, with no
   significant differences with regard to crestal bone level change,
   clinical parameters and survival or success rates. TiZr implants
   performed equally well compared to conventional Ti Grade IV 3.3 mm
   diameter-reduced implants for mandibular removable overdentures.}},

Abstract = {{A non-classical nuclear localization signal (ncNLS) of influenza A virus

   report a 2.3 angstrom resolution crystal structure of mouse
   importin-alpha 1 in complex with NP ncNLS. The structure reveals that NP
   ncNLS binds specifically and exclusively to the minor NLS-binding site
   of importin-alpha. Structural and functional analyses identify key
   binding pockets on importin-a as potential targets for antiviral drug
   development. Unlike many other NLSs, NP ncNLS binds to the NLS-binding
   domain of importin-a weakly with micromolar affinity. These results
   suggest that a modest inhibitor with low affinity to importin-a could
   have anti-influenza activity with minimal cytotoxicity.}},

   taxonomical status. We also analysed data from other arctic and
   subarctic territories to compare with that of Wrangel Island and
   evaluate the latitudinal trends of species richness and distribution of
   Cladocera and Copepoda and their relation to environmental factors. The
   effects of different environmental factors were statistically examined
   to establish which are important in controlling distributional patterns
   and diversity of species. On Wrangel Island the fauna of
   microcrustaceans is primary controlled by three factors: low
   temperatures, the remoteness from the nearest mainland and geological
   history of the island - its relation to ancient Beringia and lack of
   Pleistocene glaciation.}},

Abstract = {{Organic photovoltaics (OPV) have attracted great interest as a solar
   cell technology with appealing mechanical, aesthetical, and
   economies-of-scale features. To drive OPV toward economic viability,
   low-cost, large-scale module production has to be realized in
   combination with increased top-quality material availability and minimal
   batch-to-batch variation. To this extent, continuous flow chemistry can
   serve as a powerful tool. In this contribution, a flow protocol is
   optimized for the high performance benzodithiophene-thienopyrroledione
   copolymer PBDTTPD and the material quality is probed through systematic
   solar-cell evaluation. A stepwise approach is adopted to turn the batch
   process into a reproducible and scalable continuous flow procedure.
   Solar cell devices fabricated using the obtained polymer batches deliver
   an average power conversion efficiency of 7.2\%. Upon incorporation of
   an ionic polythiophene-based cathodic interlayer, the photovoltaic
   performance could be enhanced to a maximum efficiency of 9.1\%.}},

Journal = {{PARASITES \& VECTORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are a major public health threat
   in many countries worldwide. In Central Europe, West Nile virus (WNV)
   and Usutu virus (USUV), both belonging to the Japanese encephalitis
   virus group (Flaviviridae) have emerged in the last decennium.
   Surveillance of mosquito vectors for arboviruses is a sensitive tool to
   evaluate virus circulation and consequently to estimate the public
   health risk.
   Methods: Mosquitoes (Culicidae) were collected at South-Moravian (Czech
   Republic) fishponds between 2010 and 2014. A total of 61,770 female
   Culex modestus Ficalbi mosquitoes, pooled to 1,243 samples, were
   examined for flaviviruses by RT-PCR.
   Results: One pool proved positive for USUV RNA. Phylogenetic analysis
   demonstrated that this Czech USUV strain is closely related to Austrian
   and other Central European strains of the virus. In addition, nine
   strains of WNV lineage 2 were detected in Cx. modestus collected in the
   same reed bed ecosystem.
   Conclusions: This is the first detection of USUV in Cx. modestus. The
   results indicate that USUV and WNV may co-circulate in a sylvatic cycle
   in the same habitat, characterised by the presence of water birds and
   Cx. modestus mosquitoes, serving as hosts and vectors, respectively, for
   both viruses.}},

   We show that while a certain value of squeezing is required to overcome

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2 DM) is a metabolic disorder
   related to either insulin deficiency or resistance. Glycosylated
   haemoglobin (HbA1c) is used to monitor long term regulation of blood
   glucose. Studies relating HbA1c with antioxidant status and lipid
   profile are very few. Present study was carried out to determine the
   relation between HbA1c and antioxidant markers along with lipid profile
   in these patients. METHODOLOGY: Blood samples were collected from
   healthy controls (n=55) and type 2 DM patients (n=52) and their fasting
   lipid profile and HbA1c levels were determined using auto analyser.
   Antioxidant status markers such as serum thiols, ceruloplasmin and GST
   were measured spectrophotometrically. RESULT: There was significant
   increase in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (p<0.001), HbA1c (p<0.001),
   LDL-C (p<0.001) and ceruloplasmin (p<0.001), and there was significant
   decrease in serum total antioxidant status (p<0.001), total thiols
   (p<0.001), GST (p<0.001), and HDL-C (p<0.001) in type 2 DM patients
   compared to healthy controls. HbA1c correlated positively with FPG
   (r=0.749, p<0.001), LDL-C (r=0.513, p<0.001) and negatively with HDL-C
   (r=-0.715, p<0.001), total thiols (r=-0.704, p<0.001) and GST (r=-0.426,
   p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Findings in our study support the fact that
   increased glycation of biomolecules and enhanced generation of free
   radicals lead to deficient antioxidant status coupled with altered lipid
   profile may possibly increase the susceptibility to atherogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{The breast cancer predisposition gene, BRCA2, has a large number of

   transversion in the final exon of the gene that leads to the creation of
   a stop codon 93 amino acids early (K3326(star)), is reported as a
   neutral polymorphism but there is some evidence to suggest an
   association with an increased risk of breast cancer. We assessed whether
   this variant was enriched in a cohort of breast cancer cases ascertained
   through familial cancer clinics compared to population-based non-cancer
   controls using a targeted sequencing approach. We identified the variant
   in 66/2634 (2.5\%) cases and 33/1996 (1.65\%) controls, indicating an
   enrichment in the breast cancer cases (p = 0.047, OR 1.53, 95\% CI
   1.00-2.34). This data is consistent with recent iCOGs data suggesting
   that this variant is not neutral with respect to breast cancer risk.
   rs11571833 may need to be included in SNP panels for evaluating breast

   systems. We propose such a laser-cooling scheme for a nanomechanical
   cantilever, which works even for the low-frequency mechanical mode and
   under weak cooling lasers. The cantilever is coupled by a diamond
   nitrogen-vacancy center under a strong magnetic field gradient and the
   cooling is assisted by a dynamical Stark-shift gate. Our scheme can
   effectively enhance the desired cooling efficiency by avoiding the
   off-resonant and undesired carrier transitions, and thereby cool the
   cantilever down to the vicinity of the vibrational ground state in a
   fast fashion.}},

Abstract = {{We report the effect of epitaxial strain on the magnitude and retention
   of the ferroelectric field effect in high quality PbZr0.3Ti0.7O3
   (PZT)/3.8-4.3 nm Sm0.5Nd0.5NiO3 (SNNO) heterostructures grown on (001)
   LaAlO3 (LAO) and SrTiO3 (STO) substrates. For SNNO on LAO, which
   exhibits a first-order metal-insulator transition (MIT), switching the
   polarization of PZT induces a 10K shift in the transition temperature
   T-MI, with a maximum resistance change between the on and off states of
   Delta R/R-on similar to 75\%. In sharp contrast, only up to 5\%
   resistance change has been induced in SNNO on STO, where the MIT is
   second-order, with the modulation of T-MI negligibly small. We also
   observe thermally activated retention of the off state resistance R-off
   in both systems, with the activation energy of 22 meV (28 meV) for
   devices on LAO (STO). The time dynamics and thermal response of the
   field effect instability points to phonon-assisted interfacial trapping
   of charged mobile defects, which are attributed to strain induced oxygen
   vacancies. At room temperature, R-off stabilizes at similar to 55\% and
   similar to 19\% of the initial switching levels for SNNO on LAO and STO,
   respectively, reflecting the significantly different oxygen vacancy
   densities in these two systems. Our results reveal the critical role of
   strain in engineering and modeling the complex oxide composite
   structures for nanoelectronic and spintronic applications. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Multidrug resistance (MDR) is an important hindrance to efficient cancer
   chemotherapy. Cancer cell lysosomes play an important role in intrinsic
   MDR by accumulating chemotherapy drugs and deactivating their
   therapeutic action. The cationic polymer polyethyleneimine (PEI) can
   disrupt the endosomal/lysosomal membrane via the proton-sponge effect
   (PSE). However, its positive charge makes it toxic and so it cannot be
   used in vivo. Here, linear PEI (LPEI) is used to demonstrate that a
   pH-triggered charge-reversal carrier can solve this problem. The imines
   are amidized by masking a lysosomal pH-active agent. LPEI regenerates
   its positive charge in the acidic endosomal/lysosomal cell compartments
   and disrupts the endosomal/lysosomal membrane, resulting in delivery of
   the drugs into the cytoplasm and nuclei where they exert their
   pharmacologic activity. Folic acid targeting groups are introduced into
   the polymer to increase its cancer-cell targeting capability. An
   anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to the carrier by
   intracellular cleavable disulfide bonds shows improved cytotoxicity over
   free CPT. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ni-based single crystal superalloys have been widely used to produce
   turbine blades for advanced aero-engines because of the super
   temperature-related microstructural stability and comprehensive
   mechanical properties. However, due to effects of the high temperature
   and complicated stresses in service, the microstructures of superalloys
   might gradually evolve and fail in different modes. The present paper
   reviews the progress of microstructural stability and mechanical
   behavior including the gamma ` phase rafting, TCP phase precipitation,
   high temperature creep, low cycle fatigue and thermomechanical fatigue
   of single crystal superalloys. The addition of Ru improves the creep
   life of superalloys, but also indirectly promotes the occurrence of
   ``topological inversion{''}. On the other hand, with the increase of
   aging temperature and time, the contents of refractory elements in mu
   phase rise significantly. With the increase of applied tension stress,
   more mu phase precipitate from the gamma matrix, whereas inverse
   tendency is shown under compression stress. Numerous planar defects are
   formed during precipitation of mu phase, and these defects promote the
   nucleation of P and R phases. During high temperature and low stress
   creep, an important dislocation a < 010 > superdislocation is observed,
   which moves in the gamma ` phase slowly by a combination of slide and
   climb. Under very high temperature, incubation with accelerating creep
   rate occurs before the primary stage, which relates to the extending
   process of the gamma width. At last, the stacking fault energy is
   significantly reduced after Ru additions, and thus a series of complex
   deformation mechanisms occur during low cycle fatigue, e.g. stacking
   faults penetrating gamma/gamma ` interface, trailing a/6 < 112 >
   Shockley dislocations shearing into the gamma ` phase. During
   thermomechanical fatigue, the life of superalloys is influenced by the
   site of crack initiation, microstructural evolution and oxidation
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the analysis of solidification processing in complex turbine
   blades, a new idea of 3-dimensional and precise control of single
   crystal (SC) growth was proposed. A series of new techniques were
   presented, exhibiting the new development in the production of SC blades
   of superalloys. The heat conductor (HC) technique was developed to
   minimize the hot barrier effect which hindered the lateral SC growth.
   This method promotes the successful transition of SC growth from the
   blade body into the platform extremity prior to the nucleation of stray
   grains. To achieve symmetric thermal conditions for solidifying the SC
   blades, the PHC (parallel heating and cooling) system has been employed.
   With this technique, both sides of a shell mold can be both
   symmetrically heated in the heating zone as well as cooled in the
   cooling zone. The negative shadow effect in the current Bridgman process
   and the related defects are hence removed. With the H\&D (dipping and
   heaving) technique using thin shell, the main problems of the Bridgman
   process, such as the ineffective radiative heat exchange and the large
   thermal resistance in thick ceramic molds, can be effectively resolved.
   This technique enables the establishment of a high temperature gradient
   at solidification front. By combining targeted cooling and heating
   technique, a 3-dimensional control of SC growth in large components can
   be achieved.}},

   emissionL(bol), associated with the accretion flow. This Letter presents
   the first extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum of a kinetically dominated
   quasar, 3C 270.1. The EUV continuum flux density of 3C 270.1 is very
   steep, F\_\{\textbackslash{}nu \} \textbackslash{}-\textbackslash{}alpha
   \_\{\{\textbackslash{}rm EUV\}\}\}\$alpha(EUV) = 2.98 +/- A 0.15. This
   value is consistent with the correlation of
   >\$\textbackslash{}overline\{Q\}/L\_\{\{\textbackslash{}rm bol\}\}and
   alpha(EUV) found in previous studies of the EUV continuum of quasars,
   the EUV deficit of radio loud quasars. Curiously, although ultraviolet
   broad absorption line (BAL) troughs in quasar spectra are anticorrelated
   with , 3C 270.1 has been considered a BAL quasar based on an SDSS
   spectrum. This claim is examined in terms of the EUV spectrum of O vi
   and the highest resolution C iv spectrum in the archival data and the
   SDSS spectrum. First, from {[}O iii]4959,5007 (IR) observations and the
   UV spectral lines, it is concluded that the correct redshift for 3C
   270.1 is 1.5266. It is then found that the standard measure of broad

Abstract = {{We investigate the evolution of the galaxy two-point correlation
   function (CF) over a wide redshift range, 0.2 < z less than or similar
   to 3. For the first time, the systematic analysis covers the redshifts
   above 1-1.5. The catalogue of similar to 250 000 galaxies with i(+) < 25
   and known photometric redshifts in the SubaruDeep field is used. The
   galaxies are divided into three luminosity classes and several
   distance/redshift bins. First, the 2D CF is determined for each
   luminosity class and distance bin. Calculations are based on the
   quantitative differences between the surface distributions of galaxy
   pairs with comparable and distinctly different photometric redshifts.
   The power-law approximation for the CF is used. A limited accuracy of
   photometric redshifts as compared to the spectroscopic ones has been
   examined and taken into account. Then, the 3D functions for all the
   selected luminosities and distance are calculated. The power-law
   parameters of the CF, the slope and the correlation length are
   determined. Both parameters do not show strong variations over the whole
   investigated redshift range. The slope of the luminous galaxies appears
   to be consistently steeper than that for the fainter ones. The linear
   bias factor, b(z), grows systematically with redshift; assuming the
   local normalization b(0) approximate to 1.1-1.2, the bias reaches 3-3.5
   at the high-redshift limit.}},

Abstract = {{The ketenyl radical (HCCO) has recently been discovered in two cold
   dense clouds with a non-negligible abundance of a few 10(-11) (compared

   abundances together with HCO, H2CCO and CH3CHO in the dark clouds
   Lupus-1A and L486. The main formation pathway for HCCO is the OH + CCH
   -> HCCO + H reaction as suggested by AgA(0)ndez et al. but with a much
   larger rate coefficient than used in current models. Since this reaction
   has never been studied experimentally or theoretically, this larger
   value is based on a comparison with other similar systems.}},

Title = {{Recovery of residual copper from low-content tailings derived from waste
   electrical cable treatment}},

Abstract = {{The current work aims at the recovery of residual copper from electrical
   cables with low content of copper (less than 5\%). The sample originated
   from the tailings of electrical cables that had been previously
   subjected to copper recycling treatment The tailings were successively
   treated with physical methods (sieving, heavy medium separation in ZnCl2
   bath, and counter-current separation) and electrochemical methods
   (cementation, electrowinning). Sieving seems to be more efficient than
   gravity separation methods, since, for 1.00 mm aperture and sieving time
   as short as 2 min, the undersize copper grade of the product was 57\% in
   copper (from 4\% in the feed), with corresponding copper recovery of
   53\%. Longer sieving times or larger apertures led to products with
   higher copper recovery but of lower grade. As regards cementation,
   preliminary tests were carried out to investigate the effect of pH using
   high purity CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O instead of dissolving metallic
   copper. Subsequent tests using the sieving undersize product of the
   scrap copper wire confirmed the results of the preliminary tests; in
   addition to pH, this product was also used to investigate the effects of
   the attacking chemical (H2SO4, HCl, H2O2), sacrificial metal (aluminium,
   iron scrap), temperature, and surface area on cementation. The results
   show that cementation of the dissolved copper from scrap wire is
   efficient at pH = 2.5-3.2, with sufficient copper recovery within a few
   hours. Also, electrowinning tests on the undersize sieving product
   proved the feasibility to obtain pure copper by electrodeposition onto
   stainless steel cathode with lead anode, without contamination of the
   electrolytic solution. In both methods, copper purity degrades when HCl
   acid is used instead of H2SO4. Especially with the use of H2SO4 in
   electrowinning, it was observed that lead anode is passivated when the
   solution is entirely depleted from copper ions. The results of the
   current work clearly demonstrate the feasibility to obtain pure copper
   from low-grade electric wire scraps by successively submitting the
   tailings to sieving and cementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We used ultra-deep UV observations obtained with the Hubble Space
   Telescope to search for optical companions to binary millisecond pulsars
   (MSPs) in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. We identified four new
   counterparts (to MSPs 47TucQ, 47TucS, 47TucT, and 47TucY) and confirmed
   those already known (to MSPs 47TucU and 47TucW). In the color-magnitude
   diagram, the detected companions are located in a region between the
   main sequence and the CO white dwarf (WD) cooling sequences, consistent
   with the cooling tracks of He WDs with masses between 0.15M(circle dot)
   and 0.20M(circle dot). For each identified companion, mass, cooling age,
   temperature, and pulsar mass (as a function of the inclination angle)
   have been derived and discussed. For 47TucU we also found that the past
   accretion history likely proceeded at a sub-Eddington rate. The
   companion to the redback 47TucW is confirmed to be a non-degenerate
   star, with properties particularly similar to those observed for black
   widow systems. Two stars have been identified within the 2 sigma
   astrometric uncertainty from the radio positions of 47TucH and 47TucI,
   but the available data prevent us from firmly assessing whether they are
   the true companions of these two MSPs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Disease-associated mutations in GJB2 gene are one of the
   major reasons that can cause nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss
   (NSHL). GJB2 gene deafness has various clinical phenotypes. This study
   aims to analyze characteristics and relationships of clinical phenotypes
   through analyzing 1481 NSHL cases and 190 GJB2 deafness patients (with
   dual gene mutations).
   Patients and methods: All the patients diagnosed as deaf disease
   molecular diagnostics were obtained from the people's liberation army
   general hospital from March 2007 to March 2011. The accession number of
   GJB2 was NM\_004004 in GenBank, and sequence alignment and annotation
   were performed using GeneTool software.
   Results: In NSHL patients, mutated allele frequency in GJB2 was 20.57\%,
   and the preponderant type was c235deIC (11.84\%) followed by c.109G>A
   (3.75\%). Mutation rate of double allelic gene was 16.18\%, including
   8.43\% of homozygous mutation rate and 7.75\% of recombination
   heterozygosis mutation. Moreover, auditory threshold of GJB2 biallelic
   marker was associated with ages of onset, while no significant
   correlation was detected with disease time and whether the inner ear
   malformation. Similar clinical phenotype could be detected between
   patients with c.109G>A dual gene mutation and dual gene mutation.
   However, in the aspect of hearing impairment, the phenomenon of
   pathopoiesia caused by mutation of c.109G>A was poorer than the other
   mutations, and even near those patients without pathogenic mutations.
   Conclusion: Our study further shows the definite relationship of
   clinical phenotype and genotype in GJB2 gene correlated deafness, and
   these results can provide basis for revealing pathogenesis, gene
   diagnosis and consult of deafness. The level of evidence in the study is
   level 4 (case series).(C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Electrochemical and circular dichroism spectroscopic evidence of two
   types of interaction between {[}Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) and an elongated
   thrombin binding aptamer G-quadruplex}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},

Abstract = {{In the field of electrochemical biosensing based on DNA probes
   immobilised at electrode surfaces the {[}Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) redox marker is
   commonly used for quantitative characterisation and/or detection
   purposes. Although it is generally assumed that the interactions between
   the hexaammineruthenium(III) cation and DNA are solely of electrostatic
   nature, and thus non-specific in essence, it is shown herein that this
   is not the case for a sequence containing a G-quadruplex part. The
   present work investigates the interactions of {[}Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) with an
   oligonucleotide (21-mer) consisting of the thrombin binding aptamer
   sequence (a G-quadruplex) elongated by a 5'-overhang of six nucleotides.
   Combining circular dichroism and electrochemical analyses by
   differential pulse voltammetry, alternating current voltammetry and
   cyclic voltammetry, it is demonstrated that the overall interaction
   stoichiometry (number of {[}Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) bound to one DNA strand) is
   lower than the 7 {[}Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) per strand expected for a total
   charge compensation. Our results indicate that two types of interaction
   take place between {[}Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) and the elongated TBA sequence:
   one is the conventional electrostatic binding of the positively charged
   redox marker with the negatively charged phosphate groups, while the
   other is connected with the G-quadruplex part of the sequence. This
   latter interaction influences the DNA conformation in solution and
   involves 2 {[}Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) per strand, both in solution and with DNA
   immobilised at gold electrodes. In this configuration, the electron
   transfer rate constant is evaluated at 37 +/- 5s (1) on the basis of a
   Laviron plot. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to validate an earlier developed
   high-performance highly sensitive ultra performance liquid
   chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for
   quantification of tamoxifen and its three main metabolites
   (N-desmethyl-tamoxifen, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen and
   4-hydroxy-N-desmethyl-tamoxifen) in scalp hair. This non-invasive method
   might, by segmental analysis of hair, be useful in the determination of
   the concentration of drugs and its metabolites overtime, which can be
   used to study a wide variety of clinical relevant questions. Hair
   samples (150-300 hair strands, cut as close to the scalp as possible
   from the posterior vertex region of the head) were collected from female
   patients taking tamoxifen 20 mg daily (n = 19). The analytes were
   extracted using a liquid-liquid extraction procedure with carbonate
   buffer at pH 8.8 and a mixture of n-hexane/isopropranol method, followed
   by UPLC-MS/MS chromatography, based on an earlier validated method. The
   calibration curves were linear in the range of 1.00-200 pmol for
   tamoxifen and N-desmethyl-tamoxifen, with lower limit of quantitation of
   1.00 pmol and 0.100-20.0 pmol with lower limit of quantitation of 0.100
   pmol for endoxifen and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. Assay performance was fair
   with a within-run and between-run variability less than 9.24 at the
   three quality control samples and less than 15.7 for the lower limit of
   quantitation. Importantly, a steep linear decline was observed from
   distal to proximal hair segments. Probably, this is due to UV exposure
   as we showed degradation of tamoxifen and its metabolites after exposure
   to UV-light. Furthermore, higher concentrations of tamoxifen were found
   in black hair samples compared to blond and brown hair samples. We
   conclude that measurement of the concentration of tamoxifen and its main
   metabolites in hair is possible, with the selective, sensitive, accurate
   and precise UPLC-MS/MS method. However, for tamoxifen, it seems not
   possible to determine exposure over time with segmental analysis of
   hair, probably largely due to the effect of UV irradiation. Further
   research should therefore focus on quantification of other anticancer
   drugs, in segmented scalp hair, that are less sensitive to UV
   irradiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{THE ROLE OF PLATE TECTONIC-CLIMATE COUPLING AND EXPOSED LAND AREA IN THE
   DEVELOPMENT OF HABITABLE CLIMATES ON ROCKY PLANETS}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{812}},

Abstract = {{The long-term carbon cycle is vital for maintaining liquid water oceans
   on rocky planets due to the negative climate feedbacks involved in
   silicate weathering. Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in driving the
   long-term carbon cycle because it is responsible for CO2 degassing at
   ridges and arcs, the return of CO2 to the mantle through subduction, and
   supplying fresh, weatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny.
   However, the presence of plate tectonics itself may depend on climate
   according to recent geodynamical studies showing that cool surface
   temperatures are important for maintaining vigorous plate tectonics.
   Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show that the negative climate
   feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon cycle are uninhibited by
   climate's effect on plate tectonics. Furthermore, initial atmospheric
   CO2 conditions do not impact the final climate state reached when the
   carbon cycle comes to equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present
   and silicate weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO2 rich
   atmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate climate and
   plate tectonics on a planet. However, globally supply limited weathering
   does prevent the development of temperate climates on planets with small
   subaerial land areas and large total CO2 budgets because supply limited
   weathering lacks stabilizing climate feedbacks. Planets in the supply
   limited regime may become inhospitable for life and could experience
   significant water loss. Supply limited weathering is less likely on
   plate tectonic planets because plate tectonics promotes high erosion
   rates and thus a greater supply of bedrock to the surface.}},

Title = {{THE UNUSUAL RADIO AFTERGLOW OF THE ULTRA-LONG GAMMA-RAY BURST GRB
   130925A}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{812}},

Abstract = {{GRB 130925A is one of the recent additions to the growing family of
   ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; T90 greater than or similar to 1000
   s). While the X-ray emission of ultra-long GRBs have been studied
   extensively in the past, no comprehensive radio data set has been
   obtained so far. We report here the early discovery of an unusual radio
   afterglow associated with the ultra-long GRB 130925A. The radio emission
   peaks at low-frequencies (similar to 7 GHz) at early times, only 2.2
   days after the burst occurred. More notably, the radio spectrum at
   frequencies above 10 GHz exhibits a rather steep cut-off, compared to
   other long GRB radio afterglows. This cut-off can be explained if the
   emitting electrons are either mono-energetic or originate from a rather
   steep, dN/dE proportional to E-4, power-law energy distribution. An
   alternative electron acceleration mechanism may be required to produce
   such an electron energy distribution. Furthermore, the radio spectrum
   exhibits a secondary underlying and slowly varying component. This may
   hint that the radio emission we observed is comprised of emission from
   both a reverse and a forward shock. We discuss our results in comparison
   with previous works that studied the unusual X-ray spectrum of this
   event and discuss the implications of our findings on progenitor
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the salt resistant, temperature tolerance, and
   stability of the acrylamide-based copolymer, the double-tailed
   hydrophobically associating copolymer (DTHAP) was synthesized. The
   chemical and spatial network structures of the copolymer were
   characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and environmental
   scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The salt, temperature, aging
   resistance, and rheological behavior of the copolymer were investigated
   in detail. The experimental results showed that the performance of DTHAP
   were influenced by the amount of AA, PETMAM, SDS, and NaCl in the
   reaction system. Compared with HPAM, DTHAP solution showed excellent
   temperature resistance and salt tolerance. No matter in the solution
   varying NaCl or CaCl2 concentration from 8 to 80 and 1 to 1.8 g/L,
   respectively, DTHAP behaved an obvious salt-thickening phenomenon. The
   simulative tertiary oil recovery tests at 80 degrees C indicated that
   DTHAP can remarkably enhance 16.9\% of the oil recovery ratio. Even at
   100 g/L salt solution, DTHAP exhibited an excellent performance which
   can also enhance 9.9\% of oil recovery ratio. The experiment results
   indicated that DTHAP was superior to HPAM as a kind of oil displacement
   agent for enhanced oil recovery, especially in high-temperature and
   high-mineralization oil fields. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Title = {{THE ROLE OF ERUPTING SIGMOID IN TRIGGERING A FLARE WITH PARALLEL AND

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{812}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present observations and analysis of an interesting
   sigmoid formation, eruption, and the associated flare that occurred on
   2014 April 18 using multi-wavelength data sets. We discuss the possible
   role of the sigmoid eruption in triggering the flare, which consists of
   two different sets of ribbons: parallel ribbons and a large-scale
   quasi-circular ribbon. Several observational evidence and nonlinear
   force-free field extrapolation results show the existence of a
   large-scale fan-spine type magnetic configuration with a sigmoid lying
   under a section of the fan dome. The event can be explained with the
   following two phases. During the preflare phase, we observed the
   formation and appearance of the sigmoid via tether-cutting reconnection
   between the two sets of sheared fields under the fan dome. The second,
   main flare phase features the eruption of the sigmoid, the subsequent
   flare with parallel ribbons, and a quasi-circular ribbon. We propose the
   following multi-stage successive reconnection scenario for the main
   flare. First, tether-cutting reconnection is responsible for the
   formation and the eruption of the sigmoid structure. Second, the
   reconnection occurring in the wake of the erupting sigmoid produces the
   parallel flare ribbons on the both sides of the circular polarity
   inversion line. Third, the null-type reconnection higher in the corona,
   possibly triggered by the erupting sigmoid, leads to the formation of a
   large quasi-circular ribbon. For the first time, we suggest a mechanism
   for this type of flare consisting of a double set of ribbons triggered
   by an erupting sigmoid in a large-scale fan-spine-type magnetic
   configuration.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a two-channel holographic diversity interferometer (2ch-HDI)
   system for single-shot and highly accurate measurements of complex
   amplitude fields with a simple optical setup. In this method, two
   phase-shifted interference patterns are generated, without requiring a
   phase-shifting device, by entering a circularly polarized reference beam
   into a polarizing beam splitter, and the resulting patterns are captured
   simultaneously using two image sensors. However, differences in the
   intensity distributions of the two image sensors may lead to serious
   measurement errors. Thus, we also develop a two-channel algorithm
   optimized for the 2ch-HDI to compensate for these differences.
   Simulation results show that this algorithm can compensate for such
   differences in the intensity distributions in the two image sensors.
   Experimental results confirm that the combination of the 2ch-HDI and the
   calculation algorithm significantly enhances measurement accuracy. (c)

Abstract = {{We study the angular clustering of similar to 6 x 10(5) NVSS sources on
   scales greater than or similar to 50h(-1) Mpc in the context of the
   Lambda CDM scenario. The analysis partially relies on the redshift
   distribution of 131 radio galaxies, inferred from the Hercules and
   CENSORS survey, and an empirical fit to the stellar-to-halo mass
   relation. For redshifts z less than or similar to 0.7, the fraction of
   radio activity versus stellar mass evolves as f(RL) similar to M-{*}
   (alpha 0+alpha 1z), where alpha(0) = 2.529 +/- 0.184 and alpha(1) =
   1.854(-0.761)(+0.708). The estimate on alpha(0) is largely driven by the
   results of Best et al., while the constraint on alpha(1) is new. We
   derive a biasing factor b(z = 0.5) = 2.093(-0.109)(+0.164) between radio
   galaxies and the underlying mass. The function b(z) = 0.33z(2) + 0.85z +
   1.6 fits well the redshift dependence. We also provide convenient
   parametric forms for the redshift-dependent radio luminosity function,
   which are consistent with the redshift distribution and the NVSS source
   count versus flux.}},

Abstract = {{Subarcsecond-resolution images of the rotational line emissions of CS
   and c-C3H2 obtained toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 04368+2557 in
   L1527 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array are
   investigated to constrain the orientation of the outflow/envelope
   system. The distribution of CS consists of an envelope component
   extending from north to south and a faint butterfly shaped outflow
   component. The kinematic structure of the envelope is well reproduced by
   a simple ballistic model of an infalling rotating envelope. Although the
   envelope has a nearly edge-on configuration, we find that the western
   side of the envelope faces the observer. This configuration is opposite
   to the direction of the large-scale (similar to 10(4) AU) outflow
   suggested previously from the (CO)-C-12 (J = 3-2) observation, and to
   the morphology of infrared reflection near the protostar (similar to 200
   AU). The latter discrepancy could originate from high extinction by the
   outflow cavity of the western side, or may indicate that the outflow
   axis is not parallel to the rotation axis of the envelope.
   Position-velocity diagrams show the accelerated outflow cavity wall, and
   its kinematic structure in the 2000 AU scale is explained by a standard
   parabolic model with the inclination angle derived from the analysis of
   the envelope. The different orientation of the outflow between the small
   and large scale implies a possibility of precession of the outflow axis.
   The shape and the velocity of the outflow in the vicinity of the
   protostar are compared with those of other protostars.}},

Title = {{THE ARROWHEAD MINI-SUPERCLUSTER OF GALAXIES}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{812}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Superclusters of galaxies can be defined kinematically from local
   evaluations of the velocity shear tensor. The location where the
   smallest eigenvalue of the shear is positive and maximal defines the
   center of a basin of attraction. Velocity and density fields are
   reconstructed with Wiener Filter techniques. Local velocities due to the
   density field in a restricted region can be separated from external
   tidal flows, permitting the identification of boundaries separating
   inward flows toward a basin of attraction and outward flows. This
   methodology was used to define the Laniakea Supercluster that includes
   the Milky Way. Large adjacent structures include Perseus-Pisces, Coma,
   Hercules, and Shapley but current kinematic data are insufficient to
   capture their full domains. However, there is a small region trapped
   between Laniakea, Perseus-Pisces, and Coma that is close enough to be
   reliably characterized and that satisfies the kinematic definition of a
   supercluster. Because of its shape, it is given the name the Arrowhead
   Supercluster. This entity does not contain any major clusters. A
   characteristic dimension is similar to 25 Mpc and the contained mass is
   only similar to 10(15) M-circle dot.}},

Title = {{Impact of laser-contaminant interaction on the performance of the
   protective capping layer of 1 omega high-reflection mirror coatings}},
Journal = {{APPLIED OPTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{8607-8616}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{High dielectric constant multilayer coatings are commonly used on
   high-reflection mirrors for high-peak-power laser systems because of
   their high laser-damage resistance. However, surface contaminants often
   lead to damage upon laser exposure, thus limiting the mirror's lifetime
   and performance. One plausible approach to improve the overall mirror
   resistance against laser damage, including that induced by
   laser-contaminant coupling, is to coat the multilayers with a thin
   protective capping (absentee) layer on top of the multilayer coatings.
   An understanding of the underlying mechanism by which laser-particle
   interaction leads to capping layer damage is important for the rational
   design and selection of capping materials of high-reflection multilayer
   coatings. In this paper, we examine the responses of two candidate
   capping layer materials, made of SiO2 and Al2O3, over silica-hafnia
   multilayer coatings. These are exposed to a single oblique shot of a
   1053 nm laser beam (fluence similar to 10 J/cm(2), pulse length 14 ns),
   in the presence of Ti particles on the surface. We find that the two
   capping layers show markedly different responses to the laser-particle
   interaction. The Al2O3 cap layer exhibits severe damage, with the
   capping layer becoming completely delaminated at the particle locations.
   The SiO2 capping layer, on the other hand, is only mildly modified by a
   shallow depression. Combining the observations with optical modeling and
   thermal/mechanical calculations, we argue that a high-temperature
   thermal field from plasma generated by the laser-particle interaction
   above a critical fluence is responsible for the surface modification of
   each capping layer. The great difference in damage behavior is mainly
   attributed to the large disparity in the thermal expansion coefficient
   of the two capping materials, with that of Al2O3 layer being about 15
   times greater than that of SiO2.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{313}},
Pages = {{109-126}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{In this work we present a novel surplus production model for fisheries
   stock assessment. Our goal is to enhance parameter estimation and
   fitting speed. The model employs a production function that differs from
   the canonical logistic (Schaefer) and Gompertz (Fox) functions, but is
   still connected to the Pella-Tomlinson formulation. We embed this
   function in a state-space model, using observed catch-per-unit-effort
   indices and measures of fishing effort as input. From the literature we
   derive Bayesian prior densities for all model hyperparameters (carrying
   capacity, catchability, growth rate and error variance), as well as the
   state (annual stock biomass). We use the well-studied Namibian hake
   fishery as a case study, via which we compare the Schaefer, Fox and
   Pella-Tomlinson models with the new model. We also develop a package for
   the software R, which employs a Shiny application for data exploration,
   model specification, and output analyses. Posterior densities of
   hyperparameters and reference points agree across models.
   Identifiability issues emerge in the more cumbersome Pella-Tomlinson
   model. The new model yields small but consistent improvements in
   precision. It also renders implementation faster and easier, with no
   hidden truncation of negative biomasses. We conclude by discussing
   theoretical and practical extensions to this new model. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Cancer cells show an abnormal balance of reduced/oxidised species and
   the detection of cancer redox balance can be exploited for diagnostic
   purposes. In particular, it is known that the expression of oncogenic
   Ras changes the intracellular oxidised/reduced glutathione balance.
   Electrochemical imaging of living cells is currently feasible by
   scanning electrochemical microscopy and was used here, using
   ferrocenemethanol as redox mediator, to measure the oxidised/reduced
   glutathione balance in human breast epithelial MCF10A cells expressing
   constitutively active Ha-Ras Val12 mutant compared to normal MCF10A
   cells. Oxidized ferrocenemethanol is reduced by glutathione and the
   resulting maps of current over cell cultures were different for
   transformed cells compared to normal cells. Furthermore, scanning
   electrochemical microscopy using ferrocenemethanol redox mediator was
   able to distinguish human lung carcinoma cells from the surrounding
   normal epithelium of clinical specimens. We propose that scanning
   electrochemical microscopy analysis using specific redox mediator such
   as ferrocenemethanol may become a useful tool in cancer diagnostics. (C)

Abstract = {{The yeast Cyberlindnera jadinii is a close relative of Candida utilis
   that is being used in the food and feed industries. Here, we present the
   12.7Mb genome sequence of C. jadinii strain CBS 1600 generated by next
   generation sequencing. The deduced draft genome sequence consists of
   seven large scaffolds analogous to the seven largest chromosomes of C.
   utilis. An automated annotation of the C jadinii genome identified 6147
   protein-coding sequences. The level of ploidy for both genomes was
   analyzed by calling single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and was
   verified measuring nuclear DNA contents by florescence activated cell
   sorting (FACS). Both analyses determined the level of ploidy to diploid
   for C. jadinii and to triploid for C utilis. However, SNP calling for C.
   jadinii also identified scaffold regions that seem to be haploid,
   triploid or tetraploid. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present article discusses the application of a new technology using
   solar photovoltaic (PV) cell coupled with membrane distillation (MD) in
   the desalination of tap water. Salinity decreases the palatibility of
   water and causes long-term health issues. MD is the most promising
   technology to provide safe and clean drinking water to households and
   for other applications in small quantities. It consumes less energy than
   the existing commercial brackish water reverse osmosis (RO;
   pressure-driven) desalination technology (48\%) used for the production
   of drinking water. A large population in India relies on tap water,
   groundwater, surface water, deep well water and municipal water for
   drinking and domestic utilization. These sources are highly contaminated
   due to the presence of harmful metals like fluoride and arsenic causing
   serious health hazards. The present study compares water quality
   analysis by chemical methods of both RO and solar PV-driven MD
   technology. The quality of distillate obtained by MD is excellent and
   this has been proved by the results of chemical analysis of water.
   Thermal efficiency of MD operating with solar PV cells and others
   operated purely by conventional mode is calculated and the results are
   compared. The study shows higher production of drinking water for solar
   PV-driven MD.}},

Abstract = {{A ray tracing algorithm for an arbitrarily shaped axially symmetric
   graded index waveguide was proposed. This was achieved by considering
   the center of the waveguide (optical axis) as a set of discrete points.
   The refractive index depends on the distance of the ray position from

   distance between the ray position and a point in the set. Using this
   algorithm, ray tracing could be performed, regardless of the waveguide
   configuration. In this study, a precise explanation of the algorithm is
   given and the errors are evaluated. A technique to reduce computing time

Abstract = {{The co-planarity of solar system planets led Kant to suggest that they
   formed from an accretion disk, and the discovery of hundreds of such
   disks around young stars as well as hundreds of co-planar planetary
   systems by the Kepler satellite demonstrate that this formation
   mechanism is extremely widespread. Many moons in the solar system, such
   as the Galilean moons of Jupiter, also formed out of the accretion disks
   that coalesced into the giant planets. Here we report the discovery of
   an intermediate system, OGLE-2013-BLG-0723LB/Bb, composed of a
   Venus-mass planet orbiting a brown dwarf, which may be viewed either as
   a scaled-down version of a planet plus a star or as a scaled-up version
   of a moon plus a planet orbiting a star. The latter analogy can be
   further extended since they orbit in the potential of a larger, stellar
   body. For ice-rock companions formed in the outer parts of accretion
   disks, like Uranus and Callisto, the scaled masses and separations of
   the three types of systems are similar, leading us to suggest that the
   formation processes of companions within accretion disks around stars,
   brown dwarfs, and planets are similar.}},

   detection approach}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{318}},

Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{The unprecedented explosion of real-life big data sets have sparked a
   lot of research interests in data mining in recent years. Many of these
   big data sets are generated in network environment and are characterized
   by a dauntingly large size and high dimensionality which pose great
   challenges for detecting useful knowledge and patterns, such as network
   traffic anomalies, from them. In this paper, we study the problem of
   anomaly detection in big network connection data sets and propose an
   outlier detection technique, called Adaptive Stream Projected Outlier
   deTector (A-SPOT), to detect anomalies from large data sets using a
   novel adaptive subspace analysis approach. A case study of A-SPOT is
   conducted in this paper by deploying it to the 1999 KDD CUP anomaly
   detection application. Innovative approaches for training data
   generation, anomaly classification and false positive reduction are
   proposed in this paper as well to better tailor A-SPOT to deal with the
   case study. Experimental results demonstrate that A-SPOT is effective
   and efficient in detecting anomalies from network data sets and
   outperforms existing detection methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This article starts from the classical Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model for
   freeway traffic and develops a spectral analysis of its linearized
   version. A counterpart to the Froude number in hydrodynamics is defined
   that enables a classification of the nature of vehicle traffic flow
   using the explicit solution resulting from the analysis. We prove that
   our linearization about an equilibrium is stable for congested regimes
   and unstable otherwise. NGSIM data for congested traffic trajectories is
   used so as to confront the linearized model's predictions to actual
   macroscopic behavior of traffic. The model is shown to achieve good
   accuracy for speed and flow. In particular, it accounts for the
   advection of oscillations on boundaries into the interior domain where
   the PDE under study is solved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Ca2+-regulated cyclic electron flow supplies ATP for nitrogen
   starvation-induced lipid biosynthesis in green alga}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{We previously showed that both the linear photosynthetic electron
   transportation rate and the respiration rate dropped significantly
   during N starvation-induced neutral lipid accumulation in an
   oil-producing microalga, Chlorella sorokiniana, and proposed a possible
   role for cyclic electron flow (CEF) in ATP supply. In this study, we
   further exploited this hypothesis in both Chlorella sorokiniana C3 and
   the model green alga Chlamydomonas. We found that both the rate of CEF
   around photosystem I and the activity of thylakoid membrane-located ATP
   synthetase increased significantly during N starvation to drive ATP
   production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Chlamydomonas mutant
   pgrl1, which is deficient in PGRL1-mediated CEF, accumulated less
   neutral lipids and had reduced rates of CEF under N starvation. Further
   analysis revealed that Ca2+ signaling regulates N starvation-induced
   neutral lipid biosynthesis in Chlamydomonas by increasing calmodulin
   activity and boosting the expression of the calcium sensor protein that
   regulates Pgrl1-mediated CEF. Thus, Ca2+-regulated CEF supplies ATP for
   N starvation-induced lipid biosynthesis in green alga. The increased CEF
   may re-equilibrate the ATP/NADPH balance and recycle excess light energy
   in photosystems to prevent photooxidative damage, suggesting
   Ca2+-regulated CEF also played a key role in protecting and sustaining
   photosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The extracellular regions of epithelial Na+ channel subunits are highly
   ordered structures composed of domains formed by alpha helices and beta
   strands. Deletion of the peripheral knuckle domain of the alpha subunit
   in the alpha beta gamma trimer results in channel activation, reflecting
   an increase in channel open probability due to a loss of the inhibitory
   effect of external Na+ (Na+ self-inhibition). In contrast, deletion of
   either the beta or gamma subunit knuckle domain within the alpha beta
   gamma trimer dramatically reduces epithelial Na+ channel function and
   surface expression, and impairs subunit maturation. We systematically
   mutated individual alpha subunit knuckle domain residues and assessed
   functional properties of these mutants. Cysteine substitutions at 14 of
   28 residues significantly suppressed Na+ self-inhibition. The side
   chains of a cluster of these residues are non-polar and are predicted to
   be directed toward the palm domain, whereas a group of polar residues
   are predicted to orient their side chains toward the space between the
   knuckle and finger domains. Among the mutants causing the greatest
   suppression of Na+ self-inhibition were alpha P521C, alpha I529C, and
   alpha S534C. The introduction of Cys residues at homologous sites within
   either the beta or gamma subunit knuckle domain resulted in little or no
   change in Na+ self-inhibition. Our results suggest that multiple
   residues in the gamma subunit knuckle domain contribute to the mechanism
   of Na+ self-inhibition by interacting with palm and finger domain
   residues via two separate and chemically distinct motifs.}},

Title = {{Secretome profiling of Cryptococcus neoformans reveals regulation of a
   subset of virulence-associated proteins and potential biomarkers by
   protein kinase A}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: The pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans causes
   life-threatening meningoencephalitis in individuals suffering from
   HIV/AIDS. The cyclic-AMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction
   pathway regulates the production of extracellular virulence factors in
   C. neoformans, but the influence of the pathway on the secretome has not
   been investigated. In this study, we performed quantitative proteomics
   using galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible expression of the PKA1
   gene encoding the catalytic subunit of PKA to identify regulated
   proteins in the secretome.
   Methods: The proteins in the supernatants of cultures of C. neoformans
   were precipitated and identified using liquid chromatography-coupled
   tandem mass spectrometry. We also employed multiple reaction monitoring
   in a targeted approach to identify fungal proteins in samples from
   macrophages after phagocytosis of C. neoformans cells, as well as from
   the blood and bronchoalveolar fluid of infected mice.
   Results: We identified 61 secreted proteins and found that changes in
   PKA1 expression influenced the extracellular abundance of five proteins,
   including the Cig1 and Aph1 proteins with known roles in virulence. We
   also observed a change in the secretome profile upon induction of Pka1
   from proteins primarily involved in catabolic and metabolic processes to
   an expanded set that included proteins for translational regulation and
   the response to stress. We further characterized the secretome data
   using enrichment analysis and by predicting conventional versus
   non-conventional secretion. Targeted proteomics of the Pka1-regulated
   proteins allowed us to identify the secreted proteins in lysates of
   phagocytic cells containing C. neoformans, and in samples from infected
   mice. This analysis also revealed that modulation of PKA1 expression
   influences the intracellular survival of cryptococcal cells upon
   phagocytosis.
   Conclusions: Overall, we found that the cAMP/PKA pathway regulates
   specific components of the secretome including proteins that affect the
   virulence of C. neoformans. The detection of secreted cryptococcal
   proteins from infected phagocytic cells and tissue samples suggests
   their potential utility as biomarkers of infection. The proteomics data
   are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD002731 and
   PASS00736.}},

Abstract = {{A simple method based on micro-matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD)
   followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been
   developed for the rapid and simultaneous determination of nine regulated
   water-soluble dyes in personal care and decorative products. The
   proposed miniaturized extraction procedure was optimized by means of
   experimental designs in order to obtain the highest extraction
   efficiency. Under the optimal selected conditions, the method was
   validated showing satisfactory performance in terms of linearity,
   sensitivity, and intra-day and inter-day precision. Recoveries were
   evaluated in different cosmetic matrices and they can be considered
   quantitative with average values between 70 and 120\% with relative
   standard deviations (RSD) lower than 15\%. Finally, the validated method
   was applied to 24 samples of cosmetic and personal care products,
   including decorative makeup, lipsticks, lip gloss, toothpastes,
   regenerating creams, shampoos, and eye shadows, among others, to cover a
   broad range of commercial real samples. Seven of the analyzed dyes were
   detected, being declared all of them in the label list of ingredients.
   More than 50\% of the samples contained at least two dyes. Tartrazine
   was the most frequently found (50\% of the samples) at concentration
   levels of 0.243-79.9 mu g g(-1). Other targets were found in 1-9
   samples, highlighting the presence of Quinoline at high concentration
   (>500 mu g g(-1)) in a toothpaste sample. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Uridine insertion and deletion RNA editing generates functional
   mitochondrial mRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei. The mRNAs are differentially
   edited in bloodstream form (BF) and procyclic form (PF) life cycle
   stages, and this correlates with the differential utilization of
   glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation between the stages. The
   mechanism that controls this differential editing is unknown. Editing is
   catalyzed by multiprotein similar to 20S editosomes that contain
   endonuclease, 3'-terminal uridylyltransferase, exonuclease, and ligase
   activities. These editosomes also contain KREPB5 and KREPA3 proteins,
   which have no functional catalytic motifs, but they are essential for
   parasite viability, editing, and editosome integrity in BF cells. We
   show here that repression of KREPB5 or KREPA3 is also lethal in PF, but
   the effects on editosome structure differ from those in BF. In addition,
   we found that point mutations in KREPB5 or KREPA3 differentially affect
   cell growth, editosome integrity, and RNA editing between BF and PF
   stages. These results indicate that the functions of KREPB5 and KREPA3
   editosome proteins are adjusted between the life cycle stages. This
   implies that these proteins are involved in the processes that control
   differential editing and that the 20S editosomes differ between the life
   cycle stages.}},

Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{The abundant accumulation of inclusion bodies containing
   polyglutamine-expanded mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates is considered
   as the key pathological event in Huntington's disease (HD). Here, we
   demonstrate that FKBP12, an isomerase that exhibits reduced expression
   in HD, decreases the amyloidogenicity of mHTT, interrupts its
   oligomerization process, and structurally promotes the formation of
   amorphous deposits. By combining fluorescence-activated cell sorting
   with multiple biophysical techniques, we confirm that FKBP12 reduces the
   amyloid property of these ultrastructural-distinct mHTT aggregates
   within cells. Moreover, the neuroprotective effect of FKBP12 is
   demonstrated in both cellular and nematode models. Finally, we show that
   FKBP12 also inhibit the fibrillization process of other disease-related
   and aggregation-prone peptides. Our results suggest a novel function of
   FKBP12 in ameliorating the proteotoxicity in mHTT, which may shed light
   on unraveling the roles of FKBP12 in different neurodegenerative
   diseases and developing possible therapeutic strategies.}},

Abstract = {{GLP-1 can help to overcome problems of liver cells metabolism, not only
   pancreatic cell. But the explicit mechanism of this effect remains
   unclear. In recent years, microRNAs have received the attention of
   researchers and some microRNAs have important implications for diabetes.
   The mitochondrial protective gene PGC-1 alpha is also closely related to
   diabetes, and UCP2 is related to anti-mitochondrial oxidative stress,
   but the mechanism of action of these genes is unclear. In this study, we
   used HepG2 cell line and used the cell counting kit (CCK) to measure the
   cell viability with GLP-1(7-36) and/or glucotoxicity. To investigate
   alterations in gene expression resulting from incubation with GLP-1
   (7-36) or hyperglycaemia, the RNA expression levels of miR-23a, PGC-1
   alpha, Bak, Bax and UCP2 were quantified using real-time PCR. The
   protein levels of PGC-1 alpha were determined by western blot. The role
   of miR-23a in the regulation of PGC-1 alpha was further assessed through
   cell transfection to downregulate of miR-23a expression. In this study,
   the viability of HepG2 hepatocytes was decreased under hyperglycaemia,
   but incubation with 10 nmol/L GLP-1 (7-36) amide for 24 h significantly
   increased the viability and decreased the mRNA expression levels of Bax
   and Bak. Incubation with GLP-1(7-36) amide for 24 h attenuated the RNA
   expression of miR-23a and increased the mRNA and protein expression of
   PGC-1 alpha. Inhibition of miR-23a expression by cell transfection led
   to increases in the mRNA and protein expression of PGC-1 alpha. In
   addition, the mRNA expression of UCP2 increased after incubation with
   GLP-1(7-36) for 24 h. In conclusion, GLP-1 induced increased expression
   of mitochondrial protective gene PGC-1 alpha by downregulating miR-23a
   to inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis and also enhanced UCP2 to reduce
   apoptosis. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Wnt signaling-mediated redox regulation maintains the germ line stem
   cell differentiation niche}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Adult stem cells continuously undergo self-renewal and generate
   differentiated cells. In the Drosophila ovary, two separate niches
   control germ line stem cell (GSC) self-renewal and differentiation
   processes. Compared to the self-renewing niche, relatively little is
   known about the maintenance and function of the differentiation niche.
   In this study, we show that the cellular redox state regulated by Wnt
   signaling is critical for the maintenance and function of the
   differentiation niche to promote GSC progeny differentiation. Defective
   Wnt signaling causes the loss of the differentiation niche and the
   upregulated BMP signaling in differentiated GSC progeny, thereby
   disrupting germ cell differentiation. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling
   controls the expression of multiple glutathione-S-transferase family
   genes and the cellular redox state. Finally, Wnt2 and Wnt4 function
   redundantly to maintain active Wnt signaling in the differentiation
   niche. Therefore, this study has revealed a novel strategy for Wnt
   signaling in regulating the cellular redox state and maintaining the
   differentiation niche.}},

Journal = {{NATURE}},

Number = {{7572}},
Pages = {{230+}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{In the 1980s, excess infrared emission was discovered around
   main-sequence stars; subsequent direct-imaging observations revealed
   orbiting disks of cold dust to be the source(1). These `debris disks'
   were thought to be by-products of planet formation because they often
   exhibited morphological and brightness asymmetries that may result from
   gravitational perturbation by planets. This was proved to be true for
   the beta Pictoris system, in which the known planet generates an
   observable warp in the disk(2-5). The nearby, young, unusually active
   late-type star AU Microscopii hosts a well-studied edge-on debris disk;
   earlier observations in the visible and near-infrared found asymmetric
   localized structures in the form of intensity variations along the
   midplane of the disk beyond a distance of 20 astronomical units(6-9).
   Here we report high-contrast imaging that reveals a series of five
   large-scale features in the southeast side of the disk, at projected
   separations of 10-60 astronomical units, persisting over intervals of
   1-4 years. All these features appear to move away from the star at
   projected speeds of 4-10 kilometres per second, suggesting highly
   eccentric or unbound trajectories if they are associated with physical
   entities. The origin, localization, morphology and rapid evolution of
   these features are difficult to reconcile with current theories.}},

Title = {{Strong decays of charmed baryons in heavy hadron chiral perturbation
   theory: An update}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{We first give a brief overview of the charmed baryon spectroscopy and
   discuss their possible structure and spin-parity assignments in the
   quark model. With the new Belle measurement of the widths of
   Sigma(c)(2455) and Sigma(c)(2520) and the recent CDF measurement of the
   strong decays of Lambda(c)(2595) and Lambda(c)(2625), we give updated
   coupling constants in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory. We find
   g(2) = 0.565(-0.024)(+0.011) for P-wave transitions between s-wave and
   s-wave baryons, and h(2), one of the couplings responsible for S-wave
   transitions between s-wave and p-wave baryons, is extracted from
   Lambda(c)(2595)(+) -> Lambda(+)(c)pi pi to be 0.63 +/- 0.07. It is
   substantially enhanced compared to the old value of order 0.437. With
   the help from the quark model, two of the couplings h(10) and h(11)
   responsible for D-wave transitions between s-wave and p-wave baryons are
   determined from Sigma(c)(2880) decays. There is a tension for the
   coupling h(2) as its value extracted from Lambda(c) (2595)(+) ->
   Lambda(+)(c) pi pi pp will imply Xi(c) (2790)(0) -> Xi(c)'pi and
   Xi(c)(2815)(+) -> Xi({*})(c)pi rates slightly above the current limits.
   It is conceivable that SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking can help account
   for the discrepancy.}},

Title = {{Examining the Impact of the National Institutes of Health Public Access
   Policy on the Citation Rates of Journal Articles}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To examine whether National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded articles
   that were archived in PubMed Central (PMC) after the release of the 2008
   NIH Public Access Policy show greater scholarly impact than comparable
   articles not archived in PMC.
   Methods
   A list of journals across several subject areas was developed from which
   to collect article citation data. Citation information and cited
   reference counts of the articles published in 2006 and 2009 from 122
   journals were obtained from the Scopus database. The articles were
   separated into categories of NIH funded, non-NIH funded and whether they
   were deposited in PubMed Central. An analysis of citation data across a
   five-year timespan was performed on this set of articles.
   Results
   A total of 45,716 articles were examined, including 7,960 with
   NIH-funding. An analysis of the number of times these articles were
   cited found that NIH-funded 2006 articles in PMC were not cited
   significantly more than NIH-funded non-PMC articles. However, 2009 NIH
   funded articles in PMC were cited 26\% more than 2009 NIH funded
   articles not in PMC, 5 years after publication. This result is highly
   significant even after controlling for journal (as a proxy of article
   quality and topic).
   Conclusion
   Our analysis suggests that factors occurring between 2006 and 2009

Abstract = {{We present a systematic approach to embed n-dimensional vacuum general
   relativity in an (n+1)-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spacetime whose
   source is either a (non) zero cosmological constant or a scalar field
   minimally coupled to Einstein gravity. Our approach allows us to
   generalize a number of results discussed in the literature. We construct
   all the possible (physically distinct) embeddings in Einstein spaces,
   including the Ricci-flat ones widely discussed in the literature. We
   examine in detail their generalization, which-in the framework under
   consideration-are higher-dimensional spacetimes sourced by a scalar
   field with flat (constant not equal 0) potential. We use the Kretschmann
   curvature scalar to show that many embedding spaces have a physical
   singularity at some finite value of the extra coordinate. We develop
   several classes of embeddings that are free of singularities, have
   distinct non-vanishing self-interacting potentials and are continuously
   connected (in various limits) to Einstein embeddings. We point out that
   the induced metric possesses scaling symmetry and, as a consequence, the
   effective physical parameters (e.g., mass, angular momentum,
   cosmological constant) can be interpreted as functions of the extra
   coordinate.}},

Title = {{Paracrine communication maximizes cellular response fidelity in wound
   signaling}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Population averaging due to paracrine communication can arbitrarily
   reduce cellular response variability. Yet, variability is ubiquitously
   observed, suggesting limits to paracrine averaging. It remains unclear
   whether and how biological systems may be affected by such limits of
   paracrine signaling. To address this question, we quantify the signal
   and noise of Ca2+ and ERK spatial gradients in response to an in vitro
   wound within a novel microfluidics-based device. We find that while
   paracrine communication reduces gradient noise, it also reduces the
   gradient magnitude. Accordingly we predict the existence of a maximum
   gradient signal to noise ratio. Direct in vitro measurement of paracrine
   communication verifies these predictions and reveals that cells utilize
   optimal levels of paracrine signaling to maximize the accuracy of
   gradient-based positional information. Our results demonstrate the
   limits of population averaging and show the inherent tradeoff in
   utilizing paracrine communication to regulate cellular response
   fidelity.}},

Abstract = {{Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and remains a
   major public health problem among women. Fine needle aspiration cytology
   (FNAC) is a reliable diagnostic tool to assess the nature of palpable
   breast lesions. AIMS: To assess cytomorphological study of breast
   lesions, to classify smears into C1-C5 and to correlate FNAC with
   biopsy, ultrasonography and mammography when available. MATERIALS AND
   METHODS: FNAC was done on 170 cases of breast lesions from September
   2005 to Oct 2006 in the Department of Pathology, NSCB medical college,
   Jabalpur. Cases presenting with complaints of lump and pain were
   subjected to FNAC. Aspirations were done with 10ml syringe with a 22
   gauge needle. Aspirates were smeared and air dried for MGG staining.
   RESULTS: Of the 170 cases malignancy accounted for 37.1\%, benign lesion
   made up 50\% and 10\% constituted the gray zone (category C3 and C4).
   Most common benign lesion was fibroadenoma (48.8\%) followed by
   fibrocystic disease (13.3\%) and in malignant cases majority (80.9\%)
   had infiltrating duct carcinoma followed by lobular carcinoma and
   medullary carcinoma. Mammography and sonography was done in 74 cases
   prior to FNAC. Diagnostic accuracy with mammography was 81.8\%. 5
   malignant cases on histology were reported as suspicious on radiology
   and 1 case was wrongly diagnosed as benign. CONCLUSION: Cytologic
   examination can confirm the presence of clinically suspected
   malignancies and classify the nature of atypical or suspicious lesion
   found on mammography. Active use of FNAC and sonomammography could cut
   down the number of surgical biopsies of benign breast lesions.}},

   Ionization of Helium}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{By using a model based on the second-order time-dependent perturbation
   theory, we show that the nonsequential two-photon double ionization of
   He can be understood in a virtual sequential picture: to excite the
   final double continuum state vertical bar k(1); k(2)> by absorbing two
   photons from the ground state vertical bar 1s(2); S-1(0)>, the single
   continuum states vertical bar 1s; k(1)> and vertical bar 1s; k(2)> serve
   as the dominant intermediate states. This virtual sequential picture is
   verified by the perfect agreement of the total ionization cross section,
   respectively, calculated by this model and by the sophisticated
   numerical solution to the full-dimensional time-dependent Schrodinger
   equation. This model, without the consideration of the electron
   correlation in the final double continuum state, works well for a wide
   range of laser parameters extending from the nonsequential to the
   sequential regime. The present Letter demonstrates that the electron
   correlation in the final double continuum state is not important in
   evaluating the total cross section, while it is indispensable for an
   accurate computation of a triply differential cross section. In
   addition, the virtual sequential picture bridges the sequential and
   nonsequential two-photon double ionization and reveals connections and
   distinctions between them.}},

Abstract = {{The biological impact of novel nano-scaled drug delivery vehicles in
   highly topical therapies of bone diseases have to be investigated in
   vitro before starting in vivo trials. Highly desired features for these
   materials are a good cellular uptake, large transport capacity for drugs
   and a good bio-compatibility. Essentially the latter has to be addressed
   as first point on the agenda. We present a study on the biological
   interaction of maltose-modified poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI-Mal) on primary
   human mesenchymal stem cell, harvested from reaming debris (rdMSC) and
   osteoblasts obtained from four different male donors.
   PEI-Mal-nanoparticles with two different molecular weights of the PEI
   core (5000 g/mol for PEI-5k-Mal-B and 25,000 g/mol for PEI-25k-Mal-B)
   have been administered to both cell lines. As well dose as
   incubation-time dependent effects and interactions have been researched
   for concentrations between 1 mu g/ml to 1 mg/ml and periods of 24 h up
   to 28 days. Studies conducted by different methods of microscopy as
   light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy,
   transmission-electron-microscopy and quantitative assays (LDH and
   DC-protein) indicate as well a good cellular uptake of the nanoparticles
   as a particle-and concentration-dependent impact on the cellular
   macro-and micro-structure of the rdMSC samples. In all experiments
   PEI-5k-Mal-B exhibits a superior biocompatibility compared to
   PEI-25k-Mal-B. At higher concentrations PEI-25k-Mal-B is toxic and
   induces a directly observable mitochondrial damage. The alkaline
   phosphatase assay (ALP), has been conducted to check on the possible
   influence of nanoparticles on the differentiation capabilities of rdMSC
   to osteoblasts. In addition the production of mineralized matrix has
   been shown by von-Kossa stained samples. No influence of the
   nanoparticles on the ALP per cell has been detected. Additionally, for
   all experiments, results are strongly influenced by a large
   donor-to-donor variability of the four different rdMSC samples. To
   summarize, while featuring a good cellular uptake, PEI-5k-Mal-B induces
   only minimal adverse effects and features clearly superior
   biocompatibility compared to the larger PEI-25k-Mal-B.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to use the detailed medical
   injury information in the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network
   (CIREN) to evaluate patterns of rib fractures in real-world crash
   occupants in both belted and unbelted restraint conditions. Fracture
   patterns binned into rib regional levels were examined to determine
   normative trends associated with belt use and other possible
   contributing factors.Methods: Front row adult occupants with Abbreviated
   Injury Scale (AIS) 3+ rib fractures, in frontal crashes with a deployed
   frontal airbag, were selected from the CIREN database. The
   circumferential location of each rib fracture (with respect to the
   sternum) was documented using a previously published method (Ritchie
   etal. 2006) and digital computed tomography scans. Fracture patterns for
   different crash and occupant parameters (restraint use, involved
   physical component, occupant kinematics, crash principal direction of
   force, and occupant age) were compared qualitatively and
   quantitatively.Results: There were 158 belted and 44 unbelted occupants
   included in this study. For belted occupants, fractures were mainly
   located near the path of the shoulder belt, with the majority of
   fractures occurring on the inboard (with respect to the vehicle) side of
   the thorax. For unbelted occupants, fractures were approximately
   symmetric and distributed across both sides of the thorax. There were
   negligible differences in fracture patterns between occupants with
   frontal (0 degrees) and near side (330 degrees to 350 degrees for
   drivers; 10 degrees to 30 degrees for passengers) crash principal
   directions of force but substantial differences between groups when
   occupant kinematics (and contacts within the vehicle) were considered.
   Age also affected fracture pattern, with fractures tending to occur more
   anteriorly in older occupants and more laterally in younger occupants
   (both belted and unbelted).Conclusions: Results of this study confirmed
   with real-world data that rib fracture patterns in unbelted occupants
   were more distributed and symmetric across the thorax compared to belted
   occupants in crashes with a deployed frontal airbag. Other factors, such
   as occupant kinematics and occupant age, also produced differing
   patterns of fractures. Normative data on rib fracture patterns in
   real-world occupants can contribute to understanding injury mechanisms
   and the role of different causation factors, which can ultimately help
   prevent fractures and improve vehicle safety.}},

Abstract = {{The Sr0.97Sm0.02TiO3 (SSTO) ceramics were prepared by solid state
   reaction method with the relative dielectric constant of 3681 and a low
   dielectric loss less than 0.02 (measured at 1kHz and room temperature).
   The SSTO ceramics with ZrO2 addition have been studied to improve the
   performance stability under the bias field. The grain size of the
   ceramics decreases with the ZrO2 added. An excellent dielectric
   properties are obtained at the sample with 1wt\% ZrO2 added with the
   variation of dielectric loss of 7 \% at the 0-20kV/cm, which is better
   than that of SSTO ceramics (30 \% at the 0-20kV/cm). The dielectric
   constant of SSTO ceramics with 1wt\% ZrO2 doping remains 3000 and the
   dielectric loss is less than 5 \%. The relaxation behaviors of the ZrO2
   doped SSTO ceramics were also investigated by post-annealing experiments
   and complex-impedance analysis, which indicate that the coupling of
   oxygen vacancies-strontium vacancies and the Maxwell-Wagner polarization
   are the origins of the relaxation behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the dependence of piezoelectric coefficients (PE) on the
   size of artificial fabricated ZnO micropillars on Si substrate is
   investigated. ZnO full film is grown with c-axis orientation and an
   average grain size of 20 nm at a substrate temperature of 500 degrees C
   by pulsed laser ablation. The micropillars with the size range of 1.5 to
   7 mu m are formed by top-down semiconductor device processing. The PE,
   characterized by piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM), is found to
   increase from 18.2 to 46.9 pm/V, when the ZnO pillar size is reduced
   from 7 to 1.5 mu m. The strong PE dependence on ZnO pillar size can be
   explained by local changes in polarization and reduction of unit cell
   volume with respect to bulk values. These results have strong
   implications in the field of energy harvesting, as piezoelectric voltage
   output scales with the piezoelectric coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of surface morphologies can be formed by compressing a
   bilayer comprising a thin film bonded to a compliant substrate. In
   particular, as the applied strain is increased, secondary instabilities
   are triggered and the initial sinusoidal wrinkles evolve into new
   complex patterns. Here, we propose a robust numerical analysis based on
   Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions to detect the primary and secondary
   instabilities triggered upon compression. Because the proposed method is
   based on unit cell simulations, it is computationally very efficient.
   Moreover, it accurately predicts not only the critical strains, but also
   the corresponding critical modes and their wavelengths, enabling us to
   follow the evolution of the surface morphology as the applied strain is
   progressively increased.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{The connection between inflammation and tumourigenesis has been well
   established. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying
   inflammation-associated tumourigenesis remains unknown because this
   process involves a complex interplay between immune microenvironments
   and epithelial cells. To obtain a more systematic understanding of
   inflammation-associated tumourigenesis as well as to identify novel
   therapeutic approaches, we constructed a knowledge-based network
   describing the development of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) by
   integrating the extracellular microenvironment and intracellular
   signalling pathways. Dynamic simulations of the CAC network revealed a
   core network module, including P53, MDM2, and AKT, that may govern the
   malignant transformation of colon epithelial cells in a pro-tumor
   inflammatory microenvironment. Furthermore, in silico mutation studies
   and experimental validations led to a novel finding that concurrently
   targeting ceramide and PI3K/AKT pathway by chemical probes or marketed
   drugs achieves synergistic anti-cancer effects. Overall, our network
   model can guide further mechanistic studies on CAC and provide new
   insights into the design of combinatorial cancer therapies in a rational
   manner.}},

Title = {{Regulation of the unfolded protein response via S-nitrosylation of
   sensors of endoplasmic reticulum stress}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Protein S-nitrosylation modulates important cellular processes,
   including neurotransmission, vasodilation, proliferation, and apoptosis
   in various cell types. We have previously reported that protein
   disulfide isomerase (PDI) is S-nitrosylated in brains of patients with
   sporadic neurodegenerative diseases. This modification inhibits PDI
   enzymatic activity and consequently leads to the accumulation of
   unfolded/misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen.
   Here, we describe S-nitrosylation of additional ER pathways that affect
   the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cell-based models of Parkinson's
   disease (PD). We demonstrate that nitric oxide (NO) can S-nitrosylate
   the ER stress sensors IRE1 alpha and PERK. While S-nitrosylation of IRE1
   alpha inhibited its ribonuclease activity, S-nitrosylation of PERK
   activated its kinase activity and downstream
   phosphorylation/inactivation or eIF2 alpha. Site-directed mutagenesis of
   IRE1 alpha(Cys931) prevented S-nitrosylation and inhibition of its
   ribonuclease activity, indicating that Cys931 is the predominant site of
   S-nitrosylation. Importantly, cells overexpressing mutant IRE1
   alpha(C931S) were resistant to NO-induced damage. Our findings show that
   nitrosative stress leads to dysfunctional ER stress signaling, thus
   contributing to neuronal cell death.}},

Journal = {{BMC PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mothers are important mediators of children's physical
   activity (PA) level and risk of obesity, however previous studies of
   maternal perceptions of child PA have been limited. Furthermore, it is
   unknown if maternal perceptions of child PA are predicted by family,
   mother and child characteristics. Therefore objectives of this study
   were to 1) evaluate maternal perceptions of PA in their children and 2)
   test associations of family, mother and child characteristics with these
   perceptions.
   Methods: 278 low-income mothers of children (mean age 70.9 months)
   participated in an audio-taped semi-structured interview. Transcripts
   were systematically analyzed using the constant comparative method and
   themes were generated. A coding scheme to classify the themes appearing
   in each transcript was developed and reliably applied. Anthropometrics
   were measured. Demographics and questionnaires (the Confusion, Hubbub
   and Order Scale, The Parenting Scale, and the Child Behavior
   Questionnaire (CBQ)) were collected. Logistic regression models were
   used to test the associations of family, mother and child
   characteristics with each theme.
   Results: In this sample of low-income United States mothers, two themes
   emerged: 1) Mothers perceive their children as already very active (87.8
   \%, n = 244), predicted by the child being younger, the child not being
   overweight, and higher child CBQ Activity Level; and 2) Mothers view
   their children's high activity level as problematic (27.0 \%, n = 75),
   predicted by lower Parenting Laxness, the child being male and lower
   child CBQ Inhibitory Control.
   Conclusions: Low-income United States mothers have unique perceptions of
   PA in their children; these beliefs are associated with characteristics
   of the child and mother but not characteristics of the family. Further
   understanding of contributors to maternal perceptions of child PA may
   inform future childhood obesity interventions. The influence of these
   perceptions on physical activity outcomes in low-income children should
   be pursued in future research.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of bridging hydroxyls (OHb) via reactions of water
   molecules with oxygen vacancies (V-O) on reduced TiO2(110) surfaces is
   studied using polarized infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy
   (IRAS), electron-stimulated desorption (ESD), and photon-stimulated
   desorption (PSD). Narrow IR peaks at 2737 and 3711 cm(-1) are observed
   for the stretching vibrations of ODb and OHb, respectively. The IRAS
   spectra indicate that the bridging hydroxyls are oriented normal to the
   TiO2(110) surface. Using IRAS, we have studied the kinetics of water
   reacting with the vacancies by monitoring the formation of bridging
   hydroxyls as a function of the annealing temperature on the TiO2(110).
   Separate experiments have also monitored the loss of water molecules
   (using water ESD) and vacancies (using the CO photooxidation reaction)
   due to the reactions of water molecules with the vacancies. All three
   techniques show that the reaction rate becomes appreciable for T> 150 K
   and that the reactions are largely complete for T> 250 K. The
   temperature-dependent water-V-O reaction kinetics are consistent with a
   Gaussian distribution of activation energies with E-a = 0.545 eV, Delta
   E-a(fwhm) = 0.125 eV, and a ``normal{''} prefactor, v = 10(12) s(-1). In
   contrast, a single activation energy with a physically reasonable
   prefactor does not fit the data well. Our experimental activation energy
   is close to theoretical estimates for the diffusion of water molecules
   along the Ti-5c, rows on the reduced TiO2(110) surface, which suggests
   that the diffusion of water controls the water-V-O reaction rate.}},

Abstract = {{Beyond changing dietary patterns, there is a paucity of data to fully
   explain the high prevalence of obesity and hypertension in urban African
   populations. The aim of this study was to determine whether other
   environmental factors (including sleep duration, smoking and physical
   activity) are related to body anthropometry and blood pressure (BP).
   Data were collected on 1311 subjects, attending two primary health care
   clinics in Soweto, South Africa. Questionnaires were used to obtain data
   on education, employment, exercise, smoking and sleep duration.
   Anthropometric and BP measurements were taken. Subjects comprised 862
   women (mean age 41 +/- 16 years and mean BMI 29.9 +/- 9.2 kg/m(2)) and
   449 men (38 +/- 14 years and 24.8 +/- 8.3 kg/m(2)). In females, ANOVA
   showed that former smokers had a higher BMI (p<0.001) than current
   smokers, while exposure to second hand smoking was associated with a
   lower BMI (p<0.001) in both genders. Regression analyses demonstrated
   that longer sleep duration was associated with a lower BMI (p<0.05) in
   older females only, and not in males, whilst in males napping during the
   day for >30 minutes was related to a lower BMI (beta = -0.04, p<0.01)
   and waist circumference (beta = -0.03, p<0.001). Within males, napping
   for >30 minutes/day was related to lower systolic (beta = -0.02, p<0.05)
   and lower diastolic BP (beta = -0.02, p = 0.05). Longer night time sleep
   duration was associated with higher diastolic (beta = 0.005, p<0.01) and
   systolic BP (beta = 0.003, p<0.05) in females. No health benefits were
   noted for physical activity. These data suggest that environmental
   factors rarely collected in African populations are related, in
   gender-specific ways, to body anthropometry and blood pressure. Further
   research is required to fully elucidate these associations and how they
   might be translated into public health programs to combat high levels of
   obesity and hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic computational investigation has been carried out at the
   density functional level of theory to characterize various
   conformational isomers of furan, pyrrole, and thiophene based oligomers
   and consequently study their stabilities and electronic properties,
   especially in the cases of long oligomers. In these oligomers, adjacent
   heterocyclic rings are connected by either vinylene or azomethine
   linkages. B3LYP and B3LYP-D3 functionals are used to observe the effect
   of dispersion energy. Our results show that a combination of the
   B3LYP-D3 functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set is suitable for
   ground-state studies of these systems. For long vinylene-linked
   oligomers, folding isomers are comparatively more stable than their
   respective linearly conjugated isomers, due to intramolecular
   noncovalent interactions. In the case of azomethine-linked oligomers,
   geometries and stabilities of conformers depend on the type of
   heterocyclic ring in the repeating unit. For vinylene-linked
   heterocyclic oligomers, first optically allowed electronic transitions
   of linearly conjugated oligomers have the largest oscillator strengths,
   and these absorption bands are dominated by HOMO to LUMO transitions. In
   the case of a few linear azomethine-linked oligomers, two major
   electronic transitions, S-0 -> S-1 and S-0 -> S-2, are noticed. However,
   transitions from S-0 to higher electronic states are the most prominent
   transitions in cases of foldamers, except azomethine-linked thiophene
   foldamers. Major absorption bands of these helical oligomers are
   dominated by transitions from HOMO-N to LUMO+N orbitals. All the helical
   conformers are found to be circular dichroism active.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Intersection crashes account for over 4,500 fatalities in the
   United States each year. Intersection Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
   (I-ADAS) are emerging vehicle-based active safety systems that have the
   potential to help drivers safely navigate across intersections and
   prevent intersection crashes and injuries. The performance of an I-ADAS
   is expected to be highly dependent upon driver evasive maneuvering prior
   to an intersection crash. Little has been published, however, on the
   detailed evasive kinematics followed by drivers prior to real-world
   intersection crashes. The objective of this study was to characterize
   the frequency, timing, and kinematics of driver evasive maneuvers prior
   to intersection crashes.Methods: Event data recorders (EDRs) downloaded
   from vehicles involved in intersection crashes were investigated as part
   of NASS-CDS years 2001 to 2013. A total of 135 EDRs with precrash
   vehicle speed and braking application were downloaded to investigate
   evasive braking. A smaller subset of 59 EDRs that collected vehicle yaw
   rate was additionally analyzed to investigate evasive steering. Each
   vehicle was assigned to one of 3 precrash movement classifiers
   (traveling through the intersection, completely stopped, or rolling
   stop) based on the vehicle's calculated acceleration and observed
   velocity profile. To ensure that any significant steering input observed
   was an attempted evasive maneuver, the analysis excluded vehicles at
   intersections that were turning, driving on a curved road, or performing
   a lane change. Braking application at the last EDR-recorded time point
   was assumed to indicate evasive braking. A vehicle yaw rate greater than
   4 degrees per second was assumed to indicate an evasive steering
   maneuver.Results: Drivers executed crash avoidance maneuvers in
   four-fifths of intersection crashes. A more detailed analysis of evasive
   braking frequency by precrash maneuver revealed that drivers performing
   complete or rolling stops (61.3\%) braked less often than drivers
   traveling through the intersection without yielding (79.0\%). After
   accounting for uncertainty in the timing of braking and steering data,
   the median evasive braking time was found to be between 0.5 to 1.5s
   prior to impact, and the median initial evasive steering time was found
   to occur between 0.5 and 0.9s prior to impact. The median average
   evasive braking deceleration for all cases was found to be 0.58g. The
   median of the maximum evasive vehicle yaw rates was found to be 8.2
   degrees per second. Evasive steering direction was found to be most
   frequently in the direction of travel of the approaching
   vehicle.Conclusions: The majority of drivers involved in intersection
   crashes were alert enough to perform an evasive action. Most drivers
   used a combination of steering and braking to avoid a crash. The average
   driver attempted to steer and brake at approximately the same time prior
   to the crash.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to their chemical and magnetic properties, magnetite nanoparticles
   are an interesting adsorbing material for biomolecules. The
   understanding of the interactions of simple biomolecules with inorganic
   nanoparticles is an important approach for research on the bio-nano
   interface and can constitute the fundamentals to manifold applications
   in biotechnology, medicine and catalysis. The aim of the work presented
   here is to compare the interaction of seven different amino acids
   (L-alanine, L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid, glycine, L-histidine, L-lysine,
   and L-serine) with magnetite nanoparticles in a colloidal system at pH
   6. We investigate the influence of the side chain on the adsorption at a
   magnetite-water interface with incubation experiments. Attenuated total
   reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and simultaneous thermal analysis
   (STA) reveal deeper insights into the interactions of amino acids with
   magnetite nanopartides. The amino acids that contain polar side chains
   adsorb on the nanopartides to a high degree. Cysteine demonstrates the
   highest adsorption capacity and the formation of cystine is observed.
   ATR-FTIR spectroscopy results indicate a strong influence of the
   carboxyl group and side chains on the binding mechanism of amino acids
   at the iron oxide surface. Our investigation offers novel knowledge into
   adsorption behavior at the bio-nano interface.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were used to study the kinetics
   and products of the reaction of a variety of epoxides with various
   amines under varying pH conditions. In agreement with a previous
   finding, the amine epoxide reactions were found to be water-catalyzed
   and not directly dependent on the pH of the reaction environment. At pH
   values higher than the plc of the particular amine, the amine epoxide
   reactions were extremely efficient, outcompeting hydrolysis reactions
   even for conditions where water was the solvent and the amine was a
   relatively low-concentration solute. This finding was rationalized by
   measurements that showed that the relative nucleophilic strength of
   amines relative to water was on the order of 1000, while the
   nucleophilic strength of protonated amines (which are predominant when
   pH < pK(a) was negligible. The epoxide carbon substitution environment
   was found to have a large effect on the measured rate constants (more
   substituted epoxides had slower rate constants), while the amine carbon
   substitution environment had a much more limited effect. While the amine
   epoxide rate constants are large enough such that amine epoxide
   reactions may be kinetically feasible for isoprene-derived epoxides and
   high amine secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations, most
   atmospheric amines are expected to be present in protonated form on the
   largely acidic SOA found in the atmosphere and thus are expected to be
   largely unreactive toward epoxides.}},

Title = {{FSP1(+) fibroblast subpopulation is essential for the maintenance and
   regeneration of medullary thymic epithelial cells}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) form a 3-dimentional network supporting
   thymocyte development and maturation. Besides epithelium and thymocytes,
   heterogeneous fibroblasts are essential components in maintaining thymic
   microenvironments. However, thymic fibroblast characteristics,
   development and function remain to be determined. We herein found that
   thymic non-hematopoietic CD45(-)FSP1(+) cells represent a unique
   Fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP1)-fibroblast-derived cell subset.
   Deletion of these cells in FSP1-TK transgenic mice caused thymus atrophy
   due to the loss of TECs, especially mature medullary TECs (MHCIIhigh,
   CD80(+) and Aire(+)). In a cyclophosphamide-induced thymus injury and
   regeneration model, lack of non-hematopoietic CD45-FSP1(+) fibroblast
   subpopulation significantly delayed thymus regeneration. In fact, thymic
   FSP1(+) fibroblasts released more IL-6, FGF7 and FSP1 in the culture
   medium than their FSP1(-) counterparts. Further experiments showed that
   the FSP1 protein could directly enhance the proliferation and maturation
   of TECs in the in vitro culture systems. FSP1 knockout mice had
   significantly smaller thymus size and less TECs than their control.
   Collectively, our studies reveal that thymic CD45-FSP1(+) cells are a
   subpopulation of fibroblasts, which is crucial for the maintenance and
   regeneration of TECs especially medullary TECs through providing IL-6,
   FGF7 and FSP1.}},

Abstract = {{HIV-1 Nef and the unrelated mouse leukaemia virus glycosylated Gag
   (glycoGag) strongly enhance the infectivity of HIV-1 virions produced in
   certain cell types in a clathrin-dependent manner. Here we show that Nef
   and glycoGag prevent the incorporation of the multipass transmembrane
   proteins serine incorporator 3 (SERINC3) and SERINC5 into HIV-1 virions
   to an extent that correlates with infectivity enhancement. Silencing of
   both SERINC3 and SERINC5 precisely phenocopied the effects of Nef and
   glycoGag on HIV-1 infectivity. The infectivity of nef-deficient virions
   increased more than 100-fold when produced in double-knockout human
   CD4(+) T cells that lack both SERINC3 and SERINC5, and re-expression
   experiments confirmed that the absence of SERINC3 and SERINC5 accounted
   for the infectivity enhancement. Furthermore, SERINC3 and SERINC5
   together restricted HIV-1 replication, and this restriction was evaded
   by Nef. SERINC3 and SERINC5 are highly expressed in primary human HIV-1
   target cells, and inhibiting their downregulation by Nef is a potential
   strategy to combat HIV/AIDS.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we study the evolution of valence band (VB) structure
   during a controlled amorphous to tetragonal transformation of ZrO2 core
   shell nanostructures fabricated from electrospun nanofiber template (at
   130, 200, and 250 degrees C). Shell-ZrO2 was formed with atomic layer
   deposition. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy are
   employed to unveil the transformation of amorphous to crystalline
   structure of ZrO2. O is core-level spectra indicated chemisorbed oxygen
   (O-Ch) of almost invariant fraction for the three samples. Zr 3s level
   suggested that the sample deposited at 130 degrees C has depicted a peak
   at relatively higher binding energy. Analyses on Zr 3d spectra indicated
   the presence of metallic-Zr (Zr+zeta, 0 <= vertical bar zeta vertical
   bar < 4), the fraction of which decreases with increasing template
   temperature. VB region is analyzed until similar to 64 eV below the
   Fermi level (E-F). The region close to E-F depicted features that are
   dissimilar to the literature. This discrepancy is explained on the basis
   of the analyses from O 1s, Zr 3d, and Zr 4p levels including
   hybridization of orbitals from chemisorbed species. These levels were
   analyzed in terms of peak characteristics such as spectral position,
   area under the peak, etc. The results of this study would enhance the
   understanding of the evolution of various bands in the presence of O-Ch
   and changes to the crystallinity enabling the functionalities that are
   not available in the single-phase ZrO2.}},

   SNPs, which continue to puzzle the scientific community. Recent evidence
   points to the epigenetic and chromatin states of the genome as having
   important roles.
   Methods: We genotyped 355 healthy young individuals for 52 known
   obesity-associated SNPs and obtained DNA methylation levels in their
   blood using the Illumina 450 K BeadChip. Associations between alleles
   and methylation at proximal cytosine residues were tested using a linear
   model adjusted for age, sex, weight category, and a proxy for blood cell
   type counts. For replication in other tissues, we used two open-access
   datasets (skin fibroblasts, n = 62; four brain regions, n = 121-133) and
   an additional dataset in subcutaneous and visceral fat (n = 149).
   Results: We found that alleles at 28 of these obesity-associated SNPs
   associate with methylation levels at 107 proximal CpG sites. Out of 107
   CpG sites, 38 are located in gene promoters, including genes strongly
   implicated in obesity (MIR148A, BDNF, PTPMT1, NR1H3, MGAT1, SCGB3A1,
   HOXC12, PMAIP1, PSIP1, RPS10-NUDT3, RPS10, SKOR1, MAP2K5, SIX5, AGRN,
   IMMP1L, ELP4, ITIH4, SEMA3G, POMC, ADCY3, SSPN, LGR4, TUFM, MIR4721,
   SULT1A1, SULT1A2, APOBR, CLN3, SPNS1, SH2B1, ATXN2L, and IL27).
   Interestingly, the associated SNPs are in known eQTLs for some of these
   genes. We also found that the 107 CpGs are enriched in enhancers in
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Finally, our results indicate that
   some of these associations are not blood-specific as we successfully
   replicated four associations in skin fibroblasts.
   Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that many obesity-associated
   SNPs are associated with proximal gene regulation, which was reflected
   by association of obesity risk allele genotypes with differential DNA
   methylation. This study highlights the importance of DNA methylation and
   other chromatin marks as a way to understand the molecular basis of
   genetic variants associated with human diseases and traits.}},

Abstract = {{The Grb7 adaptor protein is a therapeutic target for both TNBC and HER2+
   breast cancer. A nonphosphorylated cyclic peptide 1 (known as G7-18NATE)
   inhibits Grb7 via targeting the Grb7-SH2 domain, but requires the
   presence of phosphate ions for both affinity and specificity. Here we
   report the discovery of malonate bound in the phosphotyrosine binding
   pocket of the apoGrb7-SH2 structure. Based on this, we carried out the
   rational design and synthesis of two analogues of peptide 1 that
   incorporate carboxymethylphenylalanine (cmF) and carboxyphenylalanine
   (cF) as mimics of phosphotyrosine (pY). Binding studies using SPR
   confirmed that affinity for Grb7-SH2 domain is improved up to 9-fold
   over peptide 1 under physiological phosphate conditions (K-D = 2.1-5.7
   mu M) and that binding is specific for Grb7-SH2 over closely related
   domains (low or no detectable binding to Grb2-SH2 and Grb10-SH2). X-ray
   crystallographic structural analysis of the analogue bearing a cmF
   moiety in complex with Grb7-SH2 has identified the precise contacts
   conferred by the pY mimic that underpin this improved molecular
   interaction. Together this study identifies and characterizes the
   tightest specific inhibitor of Grb7 to date, representing a significant
   development toward a new Grb7-targeted therapeutic.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Low bone quality is a contributing factor to motor vehicle
   crash (MVC) injury. Quantification of occupant bone mineral density
   (BMD) is important from an injury causation standpoint. The first aim of
   this study was to validate a technique for measuring lumbar volumetric
   BMD (vBMD) from phantomless computed tomography (CT) scans. The second
   aim was to apply the validated phantomless technique to quantify lumbar
   vBMD in Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) occupants
   for correlation with age, fracture incidence, and
   osteopenia/osteoporosis diagnoses.Methods: Quantitative CT (qCT) and
   dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were collected prospectively for
   50 subjects and used to validate a technique to measure vBMD from 281
   phantomless CT scans of CIREN occupants. Hounsfield unit (HU)
   measurements were collected from the L1-L5 vertebrae, right psoas major
   muscle, and anterior subcutaneous fat for all subjects and from 3
   phantom ports with known mg/cc calcium hydroxyapatite values for the
   validation group. qCT calibration was accomplished using regressions
   between the phantom HU and mg/cc values to convert L1-L5 HU values to
   mg/cc. A phantomless calibration technique was developed where the fat
   and muscle HU values were linearly regressed against fat (-69mg/cc) and
   muscle (77mg/cc) to establish a conversion for L1-L5 HU measurements to
   mg/cc. vBMD calculated from qCT versus the phantomless method was
   compared for the 50 subjects to assess agreement and a mg/cc osteopenia
   threshold was established using DXA T-scores. CIREN HU measurements were
   converted to mg/cc using the phantomless technique and the mg/cc
   osteopenia threshold was used to compare vBMD to age, fracture
   incidence, and osteopenia comorbidity classifications in CIREN.Results:
   Linear regression of lumbar vBMD derived from the qCT versus phantomless
   calibrations showed excellent agreement (R-2 = 0.87, P <.0001). A
   145mg/cc threshold for osteopenia was established (sensitivity = 1,
   specificity = 0.57) and 44 CIREN occupants had vBMD below this
   threshold. Of these 44 occupants, 64\% were not classified as osteopenic
   in CIREN, but vBMD suggested undiagnosed osteopenia. Age was negatively
   correlated with vBMD in both sexes (P <.0001) and CIREN occupants with
   less than 145mg/cc vBMD sustained an average 1.7 additional rib/sternum
   fractures (P =.036).Conclusions: Because lumbar vBMD was estimated from
   phantomless CT scans with accuracy similar to qCT, the phantomless
   technique can be broadly applied to both prospectively and
   retrospectively assess patient bone quality for research and clinical
   studies related to MVCs, falls, and aging.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The promotion of health equity, the absence of avoidable and
   unfair differences in health outcomes, is a global imperative.
   Systematic reviews are an important source of evidence for health
   decision-makers, but have been found to lack assessments of the
   intervention effects on health equity. The Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) is a 27 item checklist
   intended to improve transparency and reporting of systematic reviews. We
   developed an equity extension for PRISMA (PRISMA-E 2012) to help
   systematic reviewers identify, extract, and synthesise evidence on
   equity in systematic reviews.
   Methods and findings: In this explanation and elaboration paper we
   provide the rationale for each extension item. These items are additions
   or modifications to the existing PRISMA Statement items, in order to
   incorporate a focus on equity. An example of good reporting is provided
   for each item as well as the original PRISMA item.
   Conclusions: This explanation and elaboration document is intended to
   accompany the PRISMA-E 2012 Statement and the PRISMA Statement to
   improve understanding of the reporting guideline for users. The PRISMA-E
   2012 reporting guideline is intended to improve transparency and
   completeness of reporting of equity-focused systematic reviews. Improved
   reporting can lead to better judgement of applicability by policy makers
   which may result in more appropriate policies and programs and may
   contribute to reductions in health inequities. To encourage wide
   dissemination of this article it is accessible on the International
   Journal for Equity in Health, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, and

Title = {{Action of thymol on spontaneous excitatory transmission in adult rat
   spinal substantia gelatinosa neurons}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{606}},
Pages = {{94-99}},

Abstract = {{Thymol, which is contained in thyme essential oil, has various actions
   including antinociception and nerve conduction inhibition. Although
   thymol activates transient receptor potential (TRP) channels expressed
   in heterologous cells, it remains to be examined whether this is so in
   native neurons. It has not yet been examined how thymol affects synaptic
   transmission. In order to know how thymol modulates excitatory
   transmission with a focus on TRP activation, we investigated its effect
   on glutamatergic spontaneous excitatory transmission in lamina II
   (substantia gelatinosa; SG) neurons with which nerve terminals
   expressing TRP channels make synaptic contacts. The experiment was
   performed by using the blind whole-cell patch-clamp technique in adult
   rat spinal cord slices. Superfusing thymol (1 mM) for 3 min reversibly
   increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current
   (sEPSC) with a minimal increase in its amplitude in all neurons
   examined. Seventy-seven\% of the neurons produced an outward current at
   a holding potential of -70 mV. The sEPSC frequency increase and outward
   current produced by thymol were concentration-dependent with almost the
   same half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of 0.18 and 0.14
   mM, respectively. These activities were repeated at a time interval of
   30 min, although the sEPSC frequency increase but not outward current
   recovered with a slow time course. Voltage-gated Na+-channel blocker
   tetrodotoxin did not affect the thymol activities. The sEPSC frequency
   increase was inhibited by TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031 but not TRPV1 and
   TRPM8 antagonist (capsazepine and BCTC, respectively), while these
   antagonists had no effect on the outward current. This was so, albeit
   the two thymol activities had similar EC50 values. It is concluded that
   thymol increases the spontaneous release of L-glutamate onto SG neurons
   by activating TRPA1 channels while producing an outward current without
   TRP activation. Considering that the SG plays a pivotal role in
   modulating nociceptive transmission from the periphery, these actions of
   thymol could contribute to at least a part of its antinociceptive

Abstract = {{We employ high-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) as a
   sampling approach to discover low-energy, semiconducting, indium
   phosphide nanostructures. Starting from undercoordinated models of InP
   (e.g., a single layer of InP(1 11)), rapid rearrangement into a
   stabilized, higher-coordinate but amorphous cluster is observed across
   the size range considered (In3P3 to In22P22). These clusters exhibit
   exponential decrease in energy per atom with system size as effective
   coordination increases, which we define through distance-cutoff
   coordination number assignment and partial charge analysis. The sampling
   approach is robust to initial configuration choice, as consistent
   results are obtained when alternative crystal models or computationally
   efficient generation of structures from sequential addition and removal
   of atoms are employed. This consistency is observed across the 66
   structures compared here, and even when as many as five approaches are
   compared, the average difference in energy per pair of atoms in these
   structures is only 1.5 kcal/mol at a given system size. Interestingly,
   the energies of these amorphous clusters are lower than geometry
   optimized spherical models of bulk InP typically used for simulations of
   quantum dots. Favorable energetics appear correlated to highly
   coordinated indium and phosphorus with coordination numbers up to 5 and
   7, respectively, as well as formation of phosphorus phosphorus bonds.}},

Title = {{An excited-state approach within full configuration interaction quantum
   Monte Carlo}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{We present a new approach to calculate excited states with the full
   configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method. The
   approach uses a Gram-Schmidt procedure, instantaneously applied to the
   stochastically evolving distributions of walkers, to orthogonalize
   higher energy states against lower energy ones. It can thus be used to
   study several of the lowest-energy states of a system within the same
   symmetry. This additional step is particularly simple and
   computationally inexpensive, requiring only a small change to the
   underlying FCIQMC algorithm. No trial wave functions or partitioning of
   the space is needed. The approach should allow excited states to be
   studied for systems similar to those accessible to the ground-state
   method due to a comparable computational cost. As a first application,
   we consider the carbon dimer in basis sets up to quadruple-zeta quality
   and compare to existing results where available. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

   of low-energy constraints and LHC SUSY searches}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the null results of LHC searches, which together with the
   Higgs mass, severely constrain minimal supersymmetric extensions of the
   standard model, we adopt a model-independent approach to study charged
   slepton flavor. We examine a number of simplified models, with different
   subsets of sleptons, electroweak gauginos, and Higgsinos, and derive the
   allowed slepton flavor dependence in the region probed by current LHC
   searches, and in the region relevant for the 14 TeV LHC. We then study
   the impact of the allowed flavor dependence on lepton plus missing
   energy searches. In some cases, flavor dependence significantly modifies
   the reach of the searches. These effects may be even larger at the next
   LHC run, since for the higher masses probed at 14 TeV, larger flavor
   mixings and relative mass splittings are compatible with low-energy
   constraints. Retaining the full lepton flavor information can increase
   the sensitivity of the searches.}},

Abstract = {{Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful method for nucleic acid
   amplification. However, the PCR is inhibited in its yield due to its
   byproduct, pyrophosphate (PPO, a byproduct of the reaction; the yield is
   thereby limited. The conventional method for hydrolysis of PPi by
   pyrophosphatase (PPase) is not well adapted for operation at elevated
   temperatures over long times as required during the PCK In this work, we
   reported a strategy to improve the PCR yield using a conjugate of the
   enzyme with the thermally responsive polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
   (PNIPAM). Pyrophosphatase (PPase) was conjugated to PNIPAM
   site-specifically near the active center. As compared to the free
   enzyme, the optimum temperature of the conjugate was shown to increase
   from 45 to 60 degrees C. For the conjugate, about 77\% enzyme activity
   was retained after incubation at 60 degrees C for 3 h, representing a
   6.8-fold increase as compared to the unconjugated enzyme. For the PCR
   using the conjugate, the yield was LS-fold greater than using the
   unconjugated enzyme. As well as improving the yield of the PCR (and
   possibly other biological reactions) at elevated temperature, polymer
   conjugation may also provide a strategy to improve the heat resistance
   of proteins more generally.}},

Title = {{Innovative video tailoring for dietary change: final results of the Good
   for you! cluster randomized trial}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Effective, low-cost approaches are needed to enhance dietary
   behavior change. While both video and tailoring technology have been
   effective interventions to improve diet, these approaches have never
   been combined to study the effectiveness of tailored videos. The purpose
   of this paper is to discuss the results of Good For You!, a randomized
   trial that tested the efficacy of innovative, individually tailored
   videos in helping worksite employees decrease dietary fat and increase
   fruit and vegetable (F\&V) intake.
   Methods: Worksites were matched on approximate size, type of company and
   workforce composition and randomized to one of three experimental
   conditions: Non-Tailored written information (NT) (n = 14), Tailored
   Written information (TW) (n = 14), or Tailored Written + Tailored Video
   (TW+ TV) (n = 15). Evaluation was conducted at baseline, 4 and 7 months.
   We used the NCI Fat Screener and an adapted Food Habits Questionnaire
   (FHQ) to estimate fat intake and fat-related behaviors, the NCI F\&V
   Screener and F\&V Habits Questionnaire (FVHQ) to measure F\&V intake and
   behaviors. Generalized linear models were examined for all outcome
   measurements.
   Results: 2525 worksite employees were recruited. At 4 months, dietary
   fat intake decreased significantly more for TW (-2.95 \%) and TW+ TV
   (-3.14 \%) compared with NT (-2.42 \%). FHQ scores decreased
   significantly more for TW+TV than the other two groups. Fruit intake
   increased the most for TW + TV compared to NT and TW. Both TW (1.30
   cups) and TW + TV (1.59 cups) increased F\&V intake significantly more
   than NT (0.78 cups). TW+TV showed the largest increase in F\&V behaviors
   on the FVFQ. At 8 months, dietary fat change continued to be
   significantly better for TW+TV (-3.48 \%) than NT (3.01 \%). F\&V intake
   increased significantly more for the TW+TV group (1.38 cups) compared to
   the NT group (1.04 cups) and FVHQ changes were significantly greater in
   TW+TV and TW than for NT.
   Conclusions: The tailored intervention participants were more likely to
   decrease fat and increase F\&V intake. The TW + TV group was generally
   the stronger of the two tailored interventions, especially at the longer
   term follow-up, demonstrating the promise of tailored video as an
   intervention to change eating habits. Future studies should explore
   newer channels and technologies in addition to DVDs for delivering
   tailored video interventions such as the internet and smart phones.}},

Title = {{The quantum emission spectra of rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes:
   Discrete or continuous?}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS LETTERS B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{749}},
Pages = {{115-118}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Bekenstein and Mukhanov (BM) have suggested that, in a quantum theory of
   gravity, black holes may have discrete emission spectra. Using the
   time-energy uncertainty principle they have also shown that, for a
   (non-rotating) Schwarzschild black hole, the natural broadening delta
   omega of the black-hole emission lines is expected to be small on the
   scale set by the characteristic frequency spacing Delta omega of the
   spectral lines: zeta(Sch) equivalent to delta omega/ Delta omega << 1.
   BM have therefore concluded that the expected discrete emission lines of
   the quantized Schwarzschild black hole are unlikely to overlap. In this
   paper we calculate the characteristic dimensionless ratio zeta((a) over
   bar) equivalent to delta omega/Delta omega for the predicted BM emission
   spectra of rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes (here (a) over bar
   equivalent to J / M-2 is the dimensionless angular momentum of the black
   hole). It is shown that zeta((a) over bar) is an increasing function of
   the black-hole angular momentum. In particular, we find that the quantum
   emission lines of Kerr black holes in the regime (a) over bar greater
   than or similar to 0.9 are characterized by the dimensionless ratio
   zeta((a) over bar) greater than or similar to 1 and are therefore
   effectively blended together. Our results thus suggest that, even if the
   underlying mass (energy) spectrum of these rapidly-rotating Kerr black
   holes is fundamentally discrete as suggested by Bekenstein and Mukhanov,
   the natural broadening phenomenon (associated with the time-energy
   uncertainty principle) is expected to smear the black-hole radiation
   spectrum into a continuum. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Morphological characteristics of dendritic spines form the basis of
   cognitive ability. However, molecular mechanisms involved in fine-tuning
   of spine morphology during development are not fully understood.
   Moreover, it is unclear whether, and to what extent, these developmental
   mechanisms determine the normal adult spine morphological features.
   Here, we provide evidence that alpha 2-isoform of Rac-specific
   GTPase-activating protein alpha-chimaerin (alpha 2-chimaerin) is
   involved in spine morphological refinement during late postnatal period,
   and furthermore show that this developmental alpha 2-chimaerin function
   affects adult spine morphologies. We used a series of mice with global
   and conditional knock-out of alpha-chimaerin isoforms (alpha 1-chimaerin
   and alpha 2-chimaerin). alpha 2-Chimaerin disruption, but not alpha
   1-chimaerin disruption, in the mouse results in an increased size (and
   density) of spines in the hippocampus. In contrast, overexpression of
   alpha 2-chimaerin in developing hippocampal neurons induces a decrease
   of spine size. Disruption of alpha 2-chimaerin suppressed EphA-mediated
   spine morphogenesis in cultured developing hippocampal neurons. alpha
   2-Chimaerin disruption that begins during the juvenile stage results in
   an increased size of spines in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, spine
   morphologies are unaltered when alpha 2-chimaerin is deleted only in
   adulthood. Consistent with these spine morphological results, disruption
   of alpha 2-chimaerin beginning in the juvenile stage led to an increase
   in contextual fear learning in adulthood; whereas contextual learning
   was recently shown to be unaffected when alpha 2-chimaerin was deleted
   only in adulthood. Together, these results suggest that alpha
   2-chimaerin signaling in developmental stages contributes to
   determination of the morphological features of adult spines and
   establishment of normal cognitive ability.}},

Abstract = {{During proton beam radiotherapy, discrete secondary prompt gamma rays
   are induced by inelastic nuclear reactions between protons and nuclei in
   the human body. In recent years, the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit has
   played an important role in the development of a device for real time
   dose range verification purposes using prompt gamma radiation.
   Unfortunately the default physics models in Geant4 do not reliably
   replicate the measured prompt gamma emission. Determining a suitable
   physics model for low energy proton inelastic interactions will boost
   the accuracy of prompt gamma simulations. Among the built-in physics
   models, we found that the precompound model with a modified initial
   exciton state of 2 (1 particle, 1 hole) produced more accurate discrete
   gamma lines from the most important elements found within the body such
   as O-16, C-12 and N-14 when comparing them with the available gamma
   production cross section data. Using the modified physics model, we
   investigated the prompt gamma spectra produced in a water phantom by a
   200 MeV pencil beam of protons. The spectra were attained using a LaBr3
   detector with a time-of-flight (TOF) window and BGO active shield to
   reduce the secondary neutron and gamma background. The simulations show
   that a 2 ns TOF window could reduce 99\% of the secondary neutron flux
   hitting the detector. The results show that using both timing and active
   shielding can remove up to 85\% of the background radiation which
   includes a 33\% reduction by BGO subtraction.}},

Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Fatigue is a vague but common complaint that is poorly characterized by
   physicians as well as patients. While fatigue may result from a number
   of different etiologies, at the present time, a comprehensive approach
   to each patient with fatigue does not include routine measurement of
   serum vitamin D levels. A 61-year-old man was evaluated for excessive
   daytime fatigue. No features characteristic for depression, sleep apnea,
   or narcolepsy were present. A comprehensive work-up, including thyroid
   function tests and testosterone levels, did not reveal any
   abnormalities. However, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was low, at 18.4
   ng/mL. Vitamin D supplementation was initiated. At follow-up in 3 and 12
   months, the patient reported complete resolution of daytime fatigue,
   corresponding to an increase in his vitamin D levels. Possible
   mechanisms for clinical improvement include effects of vitamin D on
   components of inflammatory cascades, including tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha and prostaglandin D2, which result in decrease in central
   nervous system homeostatic sleep pressure. While more research is needed
   to determine if patients presenting with fatigue should be routinely
   screened for vitamin D deficiency, clinicians should consider obtaining
   vitamin D levels in patients with unexplained fatigue, nonspecific
   musculoskeletal pain, and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.}},

Title = {{Mental Health Following Acquisition of Disability in Adulthood-The
   Impact of Wealth}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Acquisition of a disability in adulthood has been associated with a
   reduction in mental health. We tested the hypothesis that low wealth
   prior to disability acquisition is associated with a greater
   deterioration in mental health than for people with high wealth.
   Methods
   We assess whether level of wealth prior to disability acquisition
   modifies this association using 12 waves of data (2001-2012) from the
   Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey-a
   population-based cohort study of working-age Australians. Eligible
   participants reported at least two consecutive waves of disability
   preceded by at least two consecutive waves without disability (1977
   participants, 13,518 observations). Fixed-effects linear regression was
   conducted with a product term between wealth prior to disability (in
   tertiles) and disability acquisition with the mental health component
   score of the SF-36 as the outcome.
   Results
   In models adjusted for time-varying confounders, there was evidence of
   negative effect measure modification by prior wealth of the association
   between disability acquisition and mental health (interaction term for
   lowest wealth tertile: -2.2 points, 95\% CI -3.1 points, -1.2, p <
   0.001); low wealth was associated with a greater decline in mental
   health following disability acquisition (-3.3 points, 95\% CI -4.0,
   -2.5) than high wealth (-1.1 points, 95\% CI -1.7, -0.5).
   Conclusion
   The findings suggest that low wealth prior to disability acquisition in
   adulthood results in a greater deterioration in mental health than among
   those with high wealth.}},

Title = {{Exploring the context of sedentary behaviour in older adults (what,
   where, why, when and with whom)}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY}},

Abstract = {{Background: Older adults are the most sedentary segment of the
   population. Little information is available about the context of
   sedentary behaviour to inform guidelines and intervention. There is a
   dearth of information about when, where to intervene and which specific
   behaviours intervention should target. The aim of this exploratory study
   was to obtain objective information about what older adults do when
   sedentary, where and when they are sedentary and in what social context.
   Methods: The study was a cross-sectional data collection. Older adults
   (Mean age = 73.25, SD +/- 5.48, median = 72, IQR = 11) volunteers wore
   activPAL monitors and a Vicon Revue timelapse camera between 1 and 7
   days. Periods of sedentary behaviour were identified using the activPAL
   and the context extracted from the pictures taken during these periods.
   Analysis of context was conducted using the Sedentary Behaviour
   International Taxonomy classification system.
   Results: In total, 52 days from 36 participants were available for
   analysis. Participants spent 70.1 \% of sedentary time at home, 56.9 \%
   of sedentary time on their own and 46.8 \% occurred in the afternoon.
   Seated social activities were infrequent (6.9 \% of sedentary bouts) but
   prolonged (18 \% of sedentary time). Participants appeared to frequently
   have vacant sitting time (41 \% of non-screen sedentary time) and screen
   sitting was prevalent (36 \% of total sedentary time).
   Conclusions: This study provides valuable information to inform future
   interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour. Interventions should
   consider targeting the home environment and focus on the afternoon
   sitting time, though this needs confirmation in a larger study. Tackling
   social isolation may also be a target to reduce sedentary time.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a protection scheme of a superconducting microwave resonator
   to realize a hybrid quantum system, where cold neutral atoms are coupled
   with a single microwave photon through magnetic dipole interaction at an
   interface inductor. The evanescent field atom trap, such as a
   waveguide/nanofiber atom trap, brings both surface-scattered photons and
   absorption-induced broadband blackbody radiation which result in
   quasiparticles and a low quality factor at the resonator. A proposed
   multiband protection layer consists of pairs of two dielectric layers
   and a thin nanogrid conductive dielectric layer above the interface
   inductor. We show numerical simulations of quality factors and
   reflection/absorption spectra, indicating that the proposed multilayer
   structure can protect a lumped-element microwave resonator from optical
   photons and blackbody radiation while maintaining a reasonably high
   quality factor. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{FAAP20 (Fanconi anemia-associated protein 20) is a subunit of the
   Fanconi anemia (FA) core complex that repairs interstrand cross-links.
   To understand the molecular basis for the FA core complex-mediated
   recruitment of Rev1 to the DNA lesion, we characterized the interactions
   among FAAP20-UBZ4, Rev1-BRCT, and ubiquidn using NMR. We found that
   FAAP20-UBZ4 binds not only ubiquitin but also Rev1-BRCT. Mapping the
   protein-protein interactions showed that FAAP20-UBZ4 has distinct
   binding surfaces for ubiquitin and Rev1-BRCT. In addition, the chemical
   exchange patterns indicated that the interaction between FAAP20-UBZ4 and
   ubiquitin might enhance the binding affinity between FAAP20-UBZ4 and
   Rev1-BRCT. These results provide new insight into the Rev1 recognition
   mechanism by FAAP20. (C) 2015 Federation of European Biochemical

Title = {{Reversibly Switching Silver Hierarchical Structures via Reaction
   Kinetics}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Here we report a study on controllable synthesis of hierarchical silver
   structures via regulating reaction kinetics. Silver particles with
   various morphologies are synthesized by a solution-based reduction
   approach at the addition of amino acids. The amino acid is used to
   coordinate with silver ions to slow down the reduction of silver ions.
   With the increase of glycine concentration, the morphologies of silver
   particles switch from dendrites, to flowers and to compacted spheres,
   which is attributed to the decrease of reaction rate as a result of the
   coordination. Three more amino acids are examined and confirms the role
   of reaction kinetic in shaping silver particles. Furthermore, by
   increasing the concentration of the reductant, the silver morphologies
   change from compact spheres to loose flowers as a result of the increase
   of reaction rate. Therefore the silver hierarchical structure can be
   reversibly switched by reaction kinetics. The silver particles
   synthesized are tested for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
   property and the dendritic particles present a remarkable SERS activity.
   This study shows that reaction kinetics is a powerful tool to tune
   hierarchical structures of silver particles, which is expected to be
   transferable to other material systems.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogenase is the only enzyme that can convert atmospheric dinitrogen
   (N-2) into biologically usable ammonia (NH3). To achieve this
   multielectron redox process, the nitrogenase component proteins,
   MoFe-protein (MoFeP) and Fe-protein (FeP), repeatedly associate and
   dissociate in an ATP-dependent manner, where one electron is transferred
   from FeP to MoFeP per association. Here, we provide experimental
   evidence that encounter complexes between Fe? and MoFeP play a
   functional role in nitrogenase catalysis. The encounter complexes are
   stabilized by electrostatic interactions involving a positively charged
   patch on the beta-subunit of MoFeP. Three single mutations (beta
   Asn399Glu, beta Lys400Glu, and beta Arg401Glu) in this patch were
   generated in Azotobacter vinelandii MoFeP. All of the resulting variants
   displayed decreases in specific catalytic activity, with the beta K400E
   mutation showing the largest effect. As simulated by the Thomeley-Lowe
   kinetic scheme, this single mutation lowered the rate constant for
   FeP-MoFeP association S-fold. We also found that the beta K400E mutation
   did not affect the coupling of ATP hydrolysis with electron transfer
   (ET) between FeP and MoFeP. These data suggest a mechanism where FeP
   initially forms encounter complexes on the MoFeP beta-subunit surface en
   route to the ATP-activated, ET-competent complex over the alpha
   beta-interface.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus in Healthy
   Community Hospital Visitors {[}CA-MRSA] and Hospital Staff {[}HA-MRSA]}},
Journal = {{MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: The prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus {[}CA-MRSA] is unknown in Oman.
   Methods: Nasal and cell phones swabs were collected from hospital
   visitors and health-care workers on sterile polyester swabs and directly
   inoculated onto a mannitol salt agar containing oxacillin, allowing
   growth of methicillin-resistant microorganisms. Antibiotic
   susceptibility tests were performed using Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion
   method on the isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was
   determined for vancomycin and teicoplanin against the resistant isolates
   of MRSA by the Epsilometer {[}E] test. A brief survey questionnaire was
   requested be filled to ascertain the exposure to known risk factors for
   CA-MRSA carriage.
   Results: Overall, nasal colonization with CA-MRSA was seen in 34
   individuals (18\%, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 12.5\%-23.5\%),
   whereas, CA-MRSA was additionally isolated from the cell phone surface
   in 12 participants (6.3\%, 95\% CI = 5.6\%-6.98\%). Nasal colonization
   prevalence with hospital-acquired {[}HA] MRSA was seen in 16 individuals
   (13.8\%, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 7.5\%-20.06\%), whereas,
   HA-MRSA was additionally isolated from the cell phone surface in 3
   participants (2.6\%, 95\% CI = 1.7-4.54). Antibiotic sensitivity was
   100\% to linezolid and rifampicin in the CA-MRSA isolates. Antibiotic
   resistance to vancomycin and clindamycin varied between 9-11 \% in the
   CA-MRSA isolates. Mean MIC for vancomycin amongst CA- and HA-MRSA were
   6.3 and 9.3 mu g/ml, whereas for teicoplanin they were 13 and 14 mu g/ml
   respectively by the E-test. There was no statistically significant
   correlation between CA-MRSA nasal carriage and the risk factors (P >
   0.05, Chi-square test).
   Conclusions: The prevalence of CA-MRSA in the healthy community hospital
   visitors was 18 \% (95\% CI, 12.5\% to 23.5\%) as compared to 13.8\%
   HA-MRSA in the hospital health-care staff. Despite a significant
   prevalence of CA-MRSA, these strains were mostly sensitive.
   Recommendation: The universal techniques of hand washing, personal
   hygiene and sanitation are thus warranted.}},

Title = {{High-fat diet prevents adaptive peripartum-associated adrenal gland
   plasticity and anxiolysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Maternal obesity is associated with lower basal plasma cortisol levels
   and increased risk of postpartum psychiatric disorders. Given that both
   obesity and the peripartum period are characterized by an imbalance
   between adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, we hypothesized
   that the adrenal glands undergo peripartum-associated plasticity and
   that such changes would be prevented by a high-fat diet (HFD). Here, we
   demonstrate substantial peripartum adrenal gland plasticity in the
   pathways involved in cholesterol supply for steroidogenesis in female
   rats. In detail, the receptors involved in plasma lipid uptake, low
   density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) and scavenger receptor class B
   type 1 (SRB1), are elevated, intra-adrenal cholesterol stores are
   depleted, and a key enzyme in de novo cholesterol synthesis,
   hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), is downregulated;
   particularly at mid-lactation. HFD prevented the lactation-associated
   anxiolysis, basal hypercorticism, and exaggerated the corticosterone
   response to ACTH. Moreover, we show that HFD prevented the
   downregulation of adrenal cholesterol stores and HMGCR expression, and
   LDLR upregulation at mid-lactation. These findings show that the adrenal
   gland is an important regulator of peripartum-associated HPA axis
   plasticity and that HFD has maladaptive consequences for the mother,
   partly by preventing these neuroendocrine and also behavioural changes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the phenomenological characteristics of the
   multiphase flow in a 3D urea prilling tower under conditions close to
   those of the industrial-scale process, considering the simultaneous heat
   and momentum transfer and the droplet solidification, using the
   computational fluid dynamics technique. The Euler-Lagrange approach is
   used to represent the multiphase flow. Solidification of the droplets
   was considered by means of an unsolidified core model, which predicts
   the thickness of the solid phase formed from the surface to the center
   of the droplets during the evolution of their trajectories in the
   continuous phase. The global operational performance of the process was
   evaluated on the basis of the solidification and breaking indexes
   defined from local variables obtained from numerical simulations.
   Solidification index values in the range of 0.83-1.00 were obtained from
   simulations, and the internal resistance to heat transfer was found to
   strongly affect the solidification phenomenon. A nonsymmetrical flow was
   used to evaluate the breaking index of droplets broken because of impact
   with the walls. The global thermal properties associated with the
   droplets, i.e., the surface and core temperatures and the overall
   heat-transfer coefficient, had values of 34.37 degrees C, 115.79 degrees
   C, and 19.29 W/m(2)K, respectively, for droplets with a diameter of 1.2
   mm. The air temperature at the top of the tower was 74.26 degrees C for
   droplets of this diameter.}},

Abstract = {{Addiction to synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) is a growing social and health

   acute abdomen resulting from chronic use of a SC, Bonzai. AGD and HPVG
   were detected by computerized tomography examination. Patchy mucosal
   ischemia was seen in endoscopic examination. Despite the findings of an
   acute abdomen, a non-surgical approach with nasogastric decompression,
   antibiotic therapy, and close radiologic and endoscopic follow-up was
   preferred in the presented case. Clinical and radiologic findings
   decreased dramatically on the first day, and endoscopic findings
   gradually disappeared over 7 d. In conclusion, this case shows that
   chronic use of a SC may cause AGD and accompanying HPVG, which can be
   managed non-surgically despite the findings of acute abdomen.}},

   Consistent with experiments, we find that an all-in-all-out ordered

   crystal field enhances the hybridization between the j(eff) = 1/2 and
   j(eff) = 3/2 states, and strong interband correlations are induced by
   the Coulomb interaction, which indicates that a three-band description
   is important. We demonstrate a substantial band narrowing in the

Title = {{HIV/AIDS presenting with stroke-like features caused by cerebral
   Nocardia abscesses: a case report}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Immunosuppression in Human Immunodeficiency Virus can
   predispose to opportunistic infections of the central nervous system and
   can be life threatening without early recognition and management. This
   can be delayed in undiagnosed Human Immunodeficiency Virus. The present
   article is the only case report in the literature to describe a first
   presentation of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome as cerebral Nocardia
   abscesses that were initially treated as a stroke.
   Case presentation: A previously well 59 year old Caucasian man presented
   with sudden onset of left sided hemiparesis and sensory change, right
   sided headache, diplopia and confusion. The patient was initially
   treated as a stroke but was eventually found to have pulmonary and
   cerebral Nocardia abscesses secondary to a new diagnosis of Human
   Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
   Conclusion: Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection can produce a variety
   of neurological presentations with the added possibility of multiple
   pathological processes being present simultaneously. This is only
   further complicated in instances, such as the present case, when Human
   Immunodeficiency Virus infection has not yet been diagnosed. It is
   therefore imperative that appropriate neuroimaging is done at an early
   stage to ensure timely initiation of appropriate therapy. Cerebral
   Nocardia abscesses are a serious and potentially life threatening
   complication of Human Immunodeficiency Virus.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the modifications that a spatially varying external load
   produces on a Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES) by
   calculating static quantities of interest. The effects of the external
   loads are exemplified using electronic structure calculations (at the

   hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-s-triazine (RDX). The calculated transition
   states and Hessian matrices of stationary points show that spatially
   varying external loads shift the stationary points and modify the
   curvature of the PES, thereby affecting the harmonic transition rates by
   altering both the energy barrier as well as the prefactor. The harmonic
   spectra of both molecules are blueshifted with increasing compressive
   ``pressure.{''} Some stationary points on the RDX-PES disappear under
   application of the external load, indicating the merging of an energy
   minimum with a saddle point. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Computational finite element models are commonly used for the simulation
   of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatments. However, the accuracy of
   these simulations is limited by the lack of precise knowledge of tissue
   parameters. In this technical note, an inverse solver based on the
   unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is proposed to optimize values for
   specific heat, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity
   resulting in accurately simulated temperature elevations. A total of 15
   RFA treatments were performed on ex vivo bovine liver tissue. For each
   RFA treatment, 15 finite-element simulations were performed using a set
   of deterministically chosen tissue parameters to estimate the mean and
   variance of the resulting tissue ablation. The UKF was implemented as an
   inverse solver to recover the specific heat, thermal conductivity, and
   electrical conductivity corresponding to the measured area of the
   ablated tissue region, as determined from gross tissue histology. These
   tissue parameters were then employed in the finite element model to
   simulate the position-and time-dependent tissue temperature. Results
   show good agreement between simulated and measured temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The association between oral bisphosphonate use and upper
   gastrointestinal cancer has been controversial. Therefore, we examined
   the association with esophageal and gastric cancer within the Kaiser
   Permanente, Northern California population. A total of 1,011 cases of
   esophageal (squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) and 1,923 cases
   of gastric adenocarcinoma (cardia, non-cardia and other) diagnosed
   between 1997 and 2011 from the Kaiser Permanente, Northern California
   cancer registry were matched to 49,886 and 93,747 controls,
   respectively. Oral bisphosphonate prescription fills at least one year
   prior to the index date were extracted. Conditional logistic regression
   was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals
   (95\% CI) for the associations between prospectively evaluated oral
   bisphosphonate use with incident esophageal and gastric cancer diagnoses
   with adjustment for potential confounders. After adjustment for
   potential confounders, no significant associations were found for
   esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OR 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.51, 1.52),
   esophageal adenocarcinoma (OR 0.68; 95\% CI: 0.37, 1.24), or gastric
   non-cardia adenocarcinoma (OR 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.59, 1.18), but we
   observed an adverse association with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (OR
   1.64; 95\% CI: 1.07, 2.50). In conclusion, we observed no association
   between oral bisphosphonate use and esophageal cancer risk within a

Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Work-related functional impairment in terms of sickness absence and
   disability pension (SA/DP) has been reported to be associated with
   subsequent suicide. However, there is only limited knowledge on SA/DP
   patterns prior to suicide. The aim was to identify trajectories of
   work-related functional impairment prior to suicide and to describe
   associations of socio-demographic and medical factors with such
   trajectories.
   Methods
   This is a population-based retrospective cohort study of the 4 209
   individuals aged 22-65 years who committed suicide during 2007-2010 in
   Sweden. Work-related functional impairment was measured as mean annual
   number of months of SA/DP. We analyzed trajectories of SA/DP during five
   years prior to suicide (i.e., 2002-2009) by a group-based trajectory
   method. Associations between socio-demographic and medical factors with
   different groups of trajectories were estimated by chi(2)-test and
   multinomial logistic regression.
   Results
   Five different functional impairment trajectory groups were identified
   prior to suicide. One group had constant low levels of SA/DP (46\%),
   while 30\% had constant high levels of SA/DP. Two groups (16\%) showed
   increasing number of SA/DP months. The remaining 7\% showed decreasing
   number of SA/DP months before the suicide. Sex, age, educational level,
   family situation, and diagnosis-specific healthcare were significantly
   associated with different trajectory groups (Likelihood ratio X-2 tests
   <0.05). A larger proportion of higher educated and younger men with a
   lower proportion of previous suicide attempts were found in the group
   with constant low levels. Opposite characteristics were displayed in the
   group with constant high levels.
   Conclusions
   This study identified five different groups of work-related functional
   impairment trajectories before suicide. These differences might be
   partly explained by the variations in socio-demographic profiles and
   health care consumptions five years before suicide.}},

   ferrites were investigated by growing epitaxial LuxFe3-xO4 (LFO, 0 <= x

   decreases on SrTiO3 substrates, while increases on MgO substrates with

   larger saturation magnetization and smaller exchange bias and coercive
   field. Phase shift of anisotropic magnetoresistance is also observed in
   the LFO films on SrTiO3 substrates. In addition, the nonmagnetic Lu3+
   ions in spinel ferrites enhance the spin canting, which further
   increases the exchange bias and coercive field and strengthens the

Abstract = {{Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3 have
   achieved great success with efficiencies exceeding 20\%. However, there
   are increasing concerns over some reported efficiencies as the cells are
   susceptible to current-voltage (I-V) hysteresis effects. It is therefore
   essential that the origins and mechanisms of the I-V hysteresis can
   clearly be understood to minimize or eradicate these hysteresis effects
   completely for reliable quantification. Here, a detailed electro-optical
   study is presented that indicates the hysteresis originates from
   lingering processes persisting from sub-second to tens of seconds.
   Photocurrent transients, photoluminescence, electroluminescence,
   quasi-steady state photoinduced absorption processes, and X-ray
   diffraction in the perovskite solar cell configuration have been
   monitored. The slow processes originate from the structural response of
   the CH3NH3PbI3 upon E-field application and/or charge accumulation,
   possibly involving methylammonium ions rotation/displacement and lattice
   distortion. The charge accumulation can arise from inefficient charge
   transfer at the perovskite interfaces, where it plays a pivotal role in
   the hysteresis. These findings underpin the significance of efficient
   charge transfer in reducing the hysteresis effects. Further improvements
   of CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cells are possible through careful
   surface engineering of existing TiO2 or through a judicious choice of
   alternative interfacial layers.}},

Abstract = {{Optically transparent cellulose nanopaper is one of the best candidate
   substrates for flexible electronics. Some types of cellulose nanopaper
   are made of mechanically or chemically modified cellulose nanofibers.
   Among these, nanopapers produced from chemically modified cellulose
   nanofibers are the most promising substrate because of their lower power
   consumption during fabrication and higher optical transparency (lower
   haze). However, because their thermal durability is as low as plastics,
   paper devices using chemically modified nanopaper often do not have
   sufficiently high performance. In this study, by decreasing the
   carboxylate content in the cellulose nanofibers, the thermal durability
   of chemically modified nanopaper was drastically improved while
   maintaining high optical transparency, low coefficient of thermal
   expansion, and low power consumption during fabrication. As a result,
   light-emitting diode lights illuminated on the chemically modified
   nanopaper via highly conductive lines, which were obtained by printing
   silver nanoparticle inks and high-temperature heating.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound tissue characterization is crucial for the detection of
   tissue abnormalities. Since the statistics of the backscattered
   ultrasound signals strongly depend on density and spatial arrangement of
   local scatterers, appropriate modeling of the backscattered signals may
   be capable of providing unique physiological information on local tissue
   properties. Among various techniques, the Nakagami imaging, realized in
   a window-based estimation scheme, has a good performance in assessing
   different scatterer statistics in tissues. However, inconsistent m
   values have been reported in literature and obtained only from a local
   tissue region, abating the reliability of Nakagami imaging in tissue
   characterization. The discrepancies in m values in relevant literature
   may stem from the nonuniformity of the ultrasound image resolution,
   which is often neglected. We therefore hypothesized that window-based
   Nakagami m estimation was highly associated with the regional spatial
   resolution of ultrasound imaging. To test this hypothesis, our study
   investigated the effect of beamforming methods, including synthetic
   aperture (SA), coherent plane wave compounding (CPWC), multi-focusing
   (MF), and single-focusing (SF), on window-based m parameter estimation
   from the perspective of the resolution cell. The statistics of m
   parameter distribution as a function of imaging depth were characterized
   by their mean, variance, and skewness. The phantom with a low scatterer
   density (16 scatterers mm(-3)) had significantly lower m values compared
   to the ones with high scatterer densities (32 and 64 scatterers mm(-3)).
   Results from the homogeneous phantom with 64 scatterers mm(-3) showed
   that SA, MF, and CPWC had relatively uniform lateral resolutions
   compared to SF and thus relatively constant m estimates at different
   imaging depths. Our findings suggest that an ultrasound imaging regime
   exhibiting invariant spatial resolution throughout the entire imaging
   field of view would be the most appropriate for Nakagami imaging for
   tissue characterization.}},

Abstract = {{It is meaningful to exploit copper sulfide materials with desired
   structure as well as potential application due to their cheapness and
   low toxicity. A low-temperature and facile solvothermal method for
   preparing three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical covellite (CuS)
   microspheres from an ionic liquid precursor {[}Bmim](2)Cu2Cl6 (Bmim =
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium) is reported. The formation of CuS
   nanostructures was achieved by decomposition of intermediate complex
   Cu(Tu)(3)Cl (thiourea = Tu), which produced CuS microspheres with
   diameters of 2.5-4 mu m assembled by nanosheets with thicknesses of
   10-15 nm. The ionic liquid, as an ``all-in-one{''} medium, played a key
   role for the fabrication and self-assembly of CuS nanosheets. The
   alkylimidazolium rings ({[}Bmim](+)) were found to adsorb onto the (001)
   facets of CuS crystals, which inhibited the crystal growth along the
   {[}001] direction, while the alkyl chain had influence on the assembly
   of CuS nanosheets. The CuS microspheres showed enhanced electrochemical
   performance and high stability for the application in supercapacitors
   due to intriguing structural design and large specific surface area.
   When this well-defined CuS electrode was assembled into an asymmetric
   supercapacitor (ASC) with an activated carbon (AC) electrode, the
   CuS//AC-ASC demonstrated good cycle performance (similar to 88\%
   capacitance after 4000 cycles) and high energy density (15.06 W h kg(-1)
   at a power density of 392.9 W kg(-1)). This work provides new insights
   into the use of copper sulfide electrode materials for asymmetric
   supercapacitors and other electrochemical devices.}},

Abstract = {{Vesicles with synthetic nonionic surfactants are called niosomes or
   NSVs, and these have been the focus of attention as an alternative to
   phospholipid liposomes as drug carriers. Especially it is demanded to
   discover novel niosomal systems with polyol-type nonionic surfactants
   from the viewpoint of environmental aspects. In this paper, a novel
   series of double-tailed nonionic surfactants, polyglyceryl dialkyl
   ethers, (C-12)(2)G(n) (n = 2.3, 5.4, 9.4, and 13.8), was synthesized,
   and its aqueous phase behavior and niosome formation were studied.
   Because of its double-tailed molecular structure, a lamellar liquid
   crystalline phase was dominant in the binary phase diagrams for
   different polyglyceryl chain lengths. The single lamellar liquid
   crystalline phase region was expanded as the polymerization degree in
   the hydrophilic moiety increased. Small-angle X-ray scattering spectra
   revealed the lamellar structure for the (C-12)(2)G2.3 was extremely
   loose. Molecular packing in the lamellar phase was analyzed except for
   the (C-12)(2)G2.3 system by using a geometrical model of the lamellar
   phase. The effective cross-sectional area per molecule at the interface
   increased extensively as dilution for the (C-12)(2)G13.8 system but
   remained almost unchanged for the (C-12)(2)G5.4 system. From the
   molecular parameters, water-holding ability in the lamellar phase was
   evaluated, and the results indicated strong hydration ability of the
   long polyglyceryl chain. In a dilute region, micron-sized giant niosomes
   and small niosomes of about 100 nm were formulated by vortex mixing and
   ultrasonication, respectively. The multilamellar structure of the small
   niosomes was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Cholesterol
   addition in the present surfactant lamellar phase induced the phase
   transition to the liquid ordered phase, which is the same phenomenon in
   a phospholipid-cholesterol mixture. The stability of niosomes
   with/without cholesterol was monitored by the niosome size change. In
   both cases, the niosomes were stable for at least 100 days.}},

Title = {{Use of the second-generation antipsychotic, risperidone, and secondary
   weight gain are associated with an altered gut microbiota in children}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{The atypical antipsychotic risperidone (RSP) is often associated with
   weight gain and cardiometabolic side effects. The mechanisms for these
   adverse events are poorly understood and, undoubtedly, multifactorial in
   etiology. In light of growing evidence implicating the gut microbiome in
   the host's energy regulation and in xenobiotic metabolism, we
   hypothesized that RSP treatment would be associated with changes in the
   gut microbiome in children and adolescents. Thus, the impact of chronic
   (>12 months) and short-term use of RSP on the gut microbiome of
   pediatric psychiatrically ill male participants was examined in a
   cross-sectional and prospective (up to 10 months) design, respectively.
   Chronic treatment with RSP was associated with an increase in body mass
   index (BMI) and a significantly lower ratio of Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes
   as compared with antipsychotic-naive psychiatric controls (ratio = 0.15
   vs 1.24, respectively; P < 0.05). Furthermore, a longitudinal
   observation, beginning shortly after onset of RSP treatment, revealed a
   gradual decrease in the Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio over the ensuing
   months of treatment, in association with BMI gain. Lastly, metagenomic
   analyses were performed based on extrapolation from 16S ribosomal RNA
   data using the software package, Phylogenetic Investigation of
   Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). Those data
   indicate that gut microbiota dominating the RSP-treated participants are
   enriched for pathways that have been implicated in weight gain, such as
   short-chain fatty acid production.}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures of metals and polycydic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) occur
   ubiquitously in aquatic environments, yet relatively little is known
   regarding their potential to produce non-additive toxicity (i.e.,
   antagonism or potentiation). A review of the lethality of metal-PAH
   mixtures in aquatic biota revealed that more-than-additive lethality is
   as common as strictly additive effects. Approaches to ecological risk
   assessment do not consider non-additive toxicity of metal PAR mixtures.
   Forty-eight-hour water-only binary mixture toxicity experiments were
   conducted to determine the additive toxic nature of mixtures of Cu, Cd,
   V, or Ni with phenanthrene (PHE) or phenanthrenequinone (PHQ) using the
   aquatic amphipod Hyalella azteca. In cases where more-than-additive
   toxicity was observed, we calculated the possible mortality rates at
   Canada's environmental water quality guideline concentrations. We used a
   three-dimensional response surface isobole model-based approach to
   compare the observed co-toxicity in juvenile amphipods to predicted
   outcomes based on concentration addition or effects addition mixtures
   models. More-than-additive lethality was observed for all Cu-PHE, Cu-PHQ
   and several Cd-PHE, Cd-PHQ and Ni-PETE mixtures. Our analysis predicts
   Cu-PHE, Cu-PHQ Cd-PHE, and Cd-PHQ mixtures at the Canadian Water Quality
   Guideline concentrations would produce 7.5\%, 3.7\%, 4.4\% and 1.4\%
   mortality, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Crystallization/recrystallization behaviors of poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG) aqueous solutions with water contents (W-C's) of similar to 36-51
   wt \% were investigated by temperature-variable mid-infrared
   spectroscopy. At a W-C of 43.2 wt \%, crystallization and
   recrystallization of water and PEG were not observed. At this specific
   W-C value (W-CPV), perfect vitrification occurred. Below and above the
   W-CPV value, crystallization/recrystallization behaviors changed
   drastically. The crystallization temperature below W-CPV (237 K) was
   similar to 10 K greater than that above W-CPV (226 K). Recrystallization
   above and below W-CPV occurred in one (213 K) and two (198 and 210 K)
   steps, respectively. These findings resulted from the difference in the
   (re)crystallization behaviors of water molecules associated with PEG
   chains with helical and random-coil conformations. These two types of
   water molecules might have limiting concentrations for their
   (re)crystallization, indicating that perfect vitrification might have
   occurred when the concentrations of the two types of water molecules
   were less than the limiting concentrations of their (re)crystallization.}},

Abstract = {{Background Given the recent declines in heart attack and stroke
   incidence, it is unclear how women and men differ in first lifetime
   presentations of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We compared the
   incidence of 12 cardiac, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular
   diseases in women and men at different ages.
   Methods and Results We studied 1 937 360 people, aged 30 years and free
   from diagnosed CVD at baseline (51\% women), using linked electronic
   health records covering primary care, hospital admissions, acute
   coronary syndrome registry, and mortality (Cardiovascular Research Using
   LInked Bespoke Studies and Electronic Records {[}CALIBER] research
   platform). During 6 years median follow-up between 1997 and 2010, 114
   859 people experienced an incident cardiovascular diagnosis, the
   majority (66\%) of which were neither myocardial infarction nor ischemic
   stroke. Associations of male sex with initial diagnoses of CVD, however,
   varied from strong (age-adjusted hazard ratios, 3.6-5.0) for abdominal
   aortic aneurysm, myocardial infarction, and unheralded coronary death
   (particularly >60 years), through modest (hazard ratio, 1.5-2.0) for
   stable angina, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease, heart
   failure, and cardiac arrest, to weak (hazard ratio <1.5) for transient
   ischemic attack, intracerebral hemorrhage, and unstable angina, and
   inverse (0.69) for subarachnoid hemorrhage (all P<0.001).
   Conclusions The majority of initial presentations of CVD are neither
   myocardial infarction nor ischemic stroke, yet most primary prevention
   studies focus on these presentations. Sex has differing associations
   with different CVDs, with implications for risk prediction and
   management strategies.

Abstract = {{Functional interactions between gene regulatory factors and chromatin
   architecture have been difficult to directly assess. Here, we use
   micrococcal nuclease (MNase) footprinting to probe the functions of two
   chromatin-remodeling complexes. By simultaneously quantifying
   alterations in small MNase footprints over the binding sites of 30
   regulatory factors in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we provide
   evidence that esBAF and Mbd3/NuRD modulate the binding of several
   regulatory proteins. In addition, we find that nucleosome occupancy is
   reduced at specific loci in favor of subnucleosomes upon depletion of
   esBAF, including sites of histone H2A.Z localization. Consistent with
   these data, we demonstrate that esBAF is required for normal H2A.Z
   localization in ESCs, suggesting esBAF either stabilizes
   H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes or promotes subnucleosome to nucleosome
   conversion by facilitating H2A.Z deposition. Therefore, integrative
   examination of MNase footprints reveals insights into nucleosome
   dynamics and functional interactions between chromatin structure and key
   gene-regulatory factors.}},

Title = {{Impact of electromagnetism on phase structure for Wilson and
   twisted-mass fermions including isospin breaking}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{In a recent paper we used chiral perturbation theory to determine the
   phase diagram and pion spectrum for Wilson and twisted-mass fermions at
   nonzero lattice spacing with nondegenerate up and down quarks. Here we
   extend this work to include the effects of electromagnetism, so that it
   is applicable to recent simulations incorporating all sources of isospin
   breaking. For Wilson fermions, we find that the phase diagram is
   unaffected by the inclusion of electromagnetism-the only effect is to
   raise the charged pion masses. For maximally twisted fermions, we
   previously took the twist and isospin-breaking directions to be
   different, in order that the fermion determinant is real and positive.
   However, this is incompatible with electromagnetic gauge invariance, and
   so here we take the twist to be in the isospin-breaking direction,
   following the RM123 Collaboration. We map out the phase diagram in this
   case, which has not previously been studied. The results differ from
   those obtained with different twist and isospin directions. One
   practical issue when including electromagnetism is that the critical
   masses for up and down quarks differ. We show that one of the criteria
   suggested to determine these critical masses does not work, and propose
   an alternative.}},

Title = {{Hand-Held Portable Desorption Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization
   Ion Source for in Situ Analysis of Nitroaromatic Explosives}},
Journal = {{ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{10047-10055}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{A novel, lightweight (0.6 kg), solvent- and gas-cylinder-free, hand-held
   ion source based on desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
   has been developed and deployed for the analysis of nitroaromatic
   explosives on surfaces in open air, offering portability for in-field
   analysis. A small, inexpensive, rechargeable lithium polymer battery was
   used to power the custom-designed circuitry within the device, which
   generates up to +/- 5 kV dc voltage to ignite a corona discharge plasma
   in air for up to 12 h of continuous operation, and allowing positive-
   and negative-ion mass spectrometry. The generated plasma is
   pneumatically transported to the surface to be interrogated by ambient
   air at a rate of 1-3.5 L/min, compressed using a small on-board
   diaphragm pump. The plasma source allows liquid or solid samples to be
   examined almost instantaneously without any sample preparation in the
   open environment. The advantages of low carrier gas and low power
   consumption (<6 W), as well as zero solvent usage, have aided in
   developing the field-ready, hand-held device for trigger-based,
   near-real-time{''} sampling/ionization. Individual nitroaromatic
   explosives (such as 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) can be easily detected in
   amounts as low as 5.8 pg with a linear dynamic range of at least 10
   (10-100 pg), a relative standard deviation of ca. 7\%, and an R-2 value
   of 0.9986. Direct detection of several nitroaromatic compounds in a
   complex mixture without prior sample preparation is demonstrated, and
   their identities are confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor in children
   and adolescents, with treatment remaining a clinical challenge. This
   disease is mediated by somatic chromosomal translocations of the EWS
   gene and a gene encoding an ETS transcription factor, most commonly,
   FLI1. While direct targeting of aberrant transcription factors remains a
   pharmacological challenge, identification of dependencies incurred by
   EWS/FLI1 expression would offer a new therapeutic avenue. We used a
   combination of super-enhancer profiling, near-whole genome shRNA-based
   and small-molecule screening to identify cyclin D1 and CDK4 as Ewing
   sarcoma-selective dependencies. We revealed that super-enhancers mark
   Ewing sarcoma specific expression signatures and EWS/FLI1 target genes
   in human Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Particularly, a super-enhancer
   regulates cyclin D1 and promotes its expression in Ewing sarcoma. We
   demonstrated that Ewing sarcoma cells require CDK4 and cyclin D1 for
   survival and anchorage-independent growth. Additionally, pharmacologic
   inhibition of CDK4 with selective CDK4/6 inhibitors led to cytostasis
   and cell death of Ewing sarcoma cell lines in vitro and growth delay in
   an in vivo Ewing sarcoma xenograft model. These results demonstrated a
   dependency in Ewing sarcoma on CDK4 and cyclin D1 and support
   exploration of CDK4/6 inhibitors as a therapeutic approach for patients
   with this disease.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated multiple discharges of treated wastewater on the

   collected along the Mississippi River during three different periods of
   4 days during the summer of 2012, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
   was used to enumerate several ARGs and related targets. Even though the
   wastewater effluents contained 75- to 831-fold higher levels of ARGs
   than the river water, the quantities of ARGs in the Mississippi River
   did not increase with downstream distance. Plasmids from the
   incompatibility group A/C were detected at low levels in the wastewater
   effluents but not in the river water; synthetic DNA containing an
   ampicillin resistance gene (bla) from cloning vectors was not detected
   in either the wastewater effluent or river samples. A simple 1D model
   suggested that the primary reason for the small impact of the wastewater
   discharges on ARG levels was the large flow rate of the Mississippi
   River compared to that of the wastewater discharges. Furthermore, this
   model generally overpredicted the ARG levels in the Mississippi River,
   suggesting that substantial loss mechanisms (e.g., decay or deposition)
   were occurring in the river.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Epigenetic, genetic, and molecular studies have identified
   several diagnostic and prognostic markers in diffuse gliomas. Their
   importance for evaluating WHO grade II gliomas has yet to be
   specifically delineated.
   Methods: We analyzed markers, including IDH mutation(IDHmut), 1p19q
   codeletion(1p19qcodel), ATRX expression loss(ATRX loss) and p53
   overexpression, and outcomes in 159 patients with WHO grade II
   oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, and astrocytoma (2003-2012).
   Results: IDHmut was found in 141(91\%) and ATRX loss in 64(87\%) of
   IDHmut-noncodel tumors (p = 0.003). All codeleted tumors (n = 66) were
   IDHmut. Four subgroups were identified: IDHmut-codel, 66(43\%);
   IDHmut-noncodel-ATRX loss, 60(39\%); IDHmut-noncodel-ATRXwt, 9(6\%);
   IDHwt, 14(9\%). Median survival among 4 groups was significantly
   different (p = 0.038), particularly in IDHmut-codel (median survival
   15.6 years) compared to the remaining 3 groups (p = 0.025). Survival by
   histology was not significant. Overall (OS), but not progression-free
   (PFS), survival was significantly longer with gross total resection vs.
   biopsy only (p = 0.042). Outcomes for patients with subtotal resection
   were not significantly different from those with biopsy only. Among
   these uniformly treated patients, OS far exceeds PFS, particularly in
   those with 1p/19q codeletion.
   Conclusions: For WHO grade II diffuse glioma, molecular classification
   using 1p/19qcodel, IDHmut, and ATRX loss more accurately predicts
   outcome and should be incorporated in the neuropathologic evaluation.}},

Title = {{Transcriptomic Analysis of Trout Gill Ionocytes in Fresh Water and Sea
   Water Using Laser Capture Microdissection Combined with Microarray
   Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Fish gills represent a complex organ composed of several cell types that
   perform multiple physiological functions. Among these cells, ionocytes
   are implicated in the maintenance of ion homeostasis. However, because
   the ionocyte represents only a small percent of whole gill tissue, its
   specific transcriptome can be overlooked among the numerous cell types
   included in the gill. The objective of this study is to better
   understand ionocyte functions by comparing the RNA expression of this
   cell type in freshwater and seawater acclimated rainbow trout. To
   realize this objective, ionocytes were captured from gill cryosections
   using laser capture microdissection after immunohistochemistry. Then,
   transcriptome analyses were performed on an Agilent trout
   oligonucleotide microarray. Gene expression analysis identified 108
   unique annotated genes differentially expressed between freshwater and
   seawater ionocytes, with a fold change higher than 3. Most of these
   genes were up-regulated in freshwater cells. Interestingly, several
   genes implicated in ion transport, extracellular matrix and structural
   cellular proteins appeared up-regulated in freshwater ionocytes. Among
   them, several ion transporters, such as CIC2, SLC26A6, and NBC, were
   validated by qPCR and/or in situ hybridization. The latter technique
   allowed us to localize the transcripts of these ion transporters in only
   ionocytes and more particularly in the freshwater cells. Genes involved
   in metabolism and also several genes implicated in transcriptional
   regulation, cell signaling and the cell cycle were also enhanced in
   freshwater ionocytes. In conclusion, laser capture microdissection
   combined with microarray analysis allowed for the determination of the
   transcriptional signature of scarce cells in fish gills, such as
   ionocytes, and aided characterization of the transcriptome of these
   cells in freshwater and seawater acclimated trout.}},

   Copper(II) Ions by Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization Mass
   Spectrometry with Ion Mobility Separation}},

Abstract = {{Native electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) is often
   used to monitor noncovalent complex formation between peptides and
   ligands. The relatively low throughput of this technique, however, is
   not compatible with extensive screening. Laser ablation electrospray
   ionization (LAESI) MS combined with ion mobility separation (IMS) can
   analyze complex formation and provide conformation information within a
   matter of seconds. Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin, a
   37-amino acid residue peptide, is produced in pancreatic beta-cells
   through proteolytic cleavage of its prohormone. Both amylin and its
   precursor can aggregate and produce toxic oligomers and fibrils leading
   to cell death in the pancreas that can eventually contribute to the
   development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The inhibitory effect of the
   copper(II) ion on amylin aggregation has been recently discovered, but
   details of the interaction remain unknown. Finding other more
   physiologically tolerated approaches requires large scale screening of
   potential inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that LAESI-IMS-MS can reveal
   the binding stoichiometry, copper oxidation state, and the dissociation
   constant of human amylin copper(II) complex. The conformations of hIAPP
   in the presence of copper(II) ions were also analyzed by IMS, and
   preferential association between the beta-hairpin amylin monomer and the
   metal ion was found. The copper(II) ion exhibited strong association
   with the -HSSNN- residues of the amylin. In the absence of copper(II),
   amylin dimers were detected with collision cross sections consistent
   with monomers of beta-hairpin conformation. When copper(II) was present
   in the solution, no dimers were detected. Thus, the copper(II) ions
   disrupt the association pathway to the formation of beta-sheet rich
   amylin fibrils. Using LAESI-IMS-MS for the assessment of
   amylin-copper(II) interactions demonstrates the utility of this
   technique for the high-throughput screening of potential inhibitors of
   amylin oligomerization and fibril formation. More generally, this rapid
   technique opens the door for high-throughput screening of potential
   inhibitors of amyloid protein aggregation.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Manual palpation is a common and very informative diagnostic tool based
   on estimation of changes in the stiffness of tissues that result from
   pathology. In the case of a small lesion or a lesion that is located
   deep within the body, it is difficult for changes in mechanical
   properties of tissue to be detected or evaluated via palpation.
   Furthermore, palpation is non-quantitative and cannot be used to
   localize the lesion. Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound
   (MRgFUS) can also be used to evaluate the properties of biological
   tissues non-invasively. In this study, an MRgFUS system combines high
   field (7T) MR and 3 MHz focused ultrasound to provide high resolution MR
   imaging and a small ultrasonic interrogation region (similar to 0.5 x
   0.5 x 2 mm), as compared with current clinical systems. MR-Acoustic
   Radiation Force Imaging (MR-ARFI) provides a reliable and efficient
   method for beam localization by detecting micron-scale displacements
   induced by ultrasound mechanical forces. The first aim of this study is
   to develop a sequence that can concurrently quantify acoustic radiation
   force displacements and image the resulting transient shear wave. Our
   motivation in combining these two measurements is to develop a technique
   that can rapidly provide both ARFI and shear wave velocity estimation
   data, making it suitable for use in interventional radiology. Secondly,
   we validate this sequence in vivo by estimating the displacement before
   and after high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation, and we
   validate the shear wave velocity in vitro using tissue-mimicking gelatin
   and tofu phantoms. Such rapid acquisitions are especially useful in
   interventional radiology applications where minimizing scan time is
   highly desirable.}},

Title = {{Etiology, treatment outcome and prognostic factors among patients with
   secondary peritonitis at Bugando Medical Centre, Mwanza, Tanzania}},
Journal = {{WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Secondary peritonitis due to perforation of the
   gastrointestinal tract is one of the most common surgical emergencies
   all over the world and is associated with significantly morbidity and
   mortality. Previous studies conducted at Bugando Medical Centre (BMC)
   were retrospective and each was focused on single etiology; therefore
   there was an obvious need to evaluate the etiologies, treatment outcome
   and their prognostic factors altogether.
   Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving patients
   with secondary peritonitis admitted at BMC from May 2014 to April 2015.
   Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics among consented patients
   were collected using questionnaires. Peritoneal aspirate, biopsy and
   blood were collected perioperatively and processed using standard
   operating procedures. Analysis was done using STATA version 11 software.
   Results: The study enrolled 97 patients with the female to male ratio of
   1:1.8 and approximately 41.2 \% (40/97) were in their third and fourth
   decades of life. Only 3 (3.09 \%) patients arrived to the hospital
   within 24 hours of onset of illness, 26 (26.80 \%) patients presented
   with shock and HIV seropositivity among all patients was 13.40 \%
   (13/97). The common etiologies of secondary peritonitis were perforated
   appendicitis 23 (23.71 \%), peptic ulcer disease 18 (18.56 \%), ischemia
   18 (18.56 \%) and typhoidal perforation 15 (15.46 \%). Of the 97
   patients, 35 (36.08 \%) had complications and 15 (15.46 \%) died.
   Presence of premorbid illness and post-operative complication were found
   to be associated with death (p values = 0.004 and <0.001 respectively).
   Conclusions: The most common etiologies of secondary peritonitis at BMC
   are perforated appendicitis, peptic ulcer disease, ischemia and
   typhoidal perforation. Premorbid illness and postoperative complications
   in this setting are associated with death and as the matter of fact
   proper screening on admission should be done to identify patients with
   premorbid illness and confer prompt management.}},

Title = {{Antioxidant Capacity of Melatonin on Preimplantation Development of
   Fresh and Vitrified Rabbit Embryos: Morphological and Molecular Aspects}},

Abstract = {{Embryo cryopreservation remains an important technique to enhance the
   reconstitution and distribution of animal populations with high genetic
   merit. One of the major detrimental factors to this technique is the
   damage caused by oxidative stress. Melatonin is widely known as an
   antioxidant with multi-faceted ways to counteract the oxidative stress.
   In this paper, we investigated the role of melatonin in protecting
   rabbit embryos during preimplantation development from the potential
   harmful effects of oxidative stress induced by in vitro culture or
   vitrification. Rabbit embryos at morula stages were cultured for 2 hr
   with 0 or 10(-3) M melatonin (C or M groups). Embryos of each group were
   either transferred to fresh culture media (CF and MF groups) or
   vitrified/devitrified (CV and MV groups), then cultured in vitro for 48
   hr until the blastocyst stage. The culture media were used to measure
   the activity of antioxidant enzymes: glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the levels of two oxidative
   substrates: lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide (NO). The
   blastocysts from each group were used to measure the expression of
   developmental- related genes (GJA1, POU5F1 and Nanog) and
   oxidative-stress-response-related genes (NFE2L2, SOD1 and GPX1). The
   data showed that melatonin promoted significantly (P<0.05) the
   blastocyst rate by 17\% and 12\% in MF and MV groups compared to their
   controls (CF and CV groups). The GST and SOD activity significantly
   increased by the treatment of melatonin in fresh or vitrified embryos,
   while the levels of LPO and NO decreased (P<0.05). Additionally,
   melatonin considerably stimulated the relative expression of GJA1,
   NFE2L2 and SOD1 genes in MF and MV embryos compared to CF group.
   Furthermore, melatonin significantly ameliorated the reduction of POU5F1
   and GPX1 expression induced by vitrification. The results obtained from
   the current investigation provide new and clear molecular aspects
   regarding the mechanisms by which melatonin promotes development of both
   fresh and vitrified rabbit embryos.}},

Title = {{Does Cognitive Behavior Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) show a sustainable
   effect on delusions? A meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive Behavior Therapy for psychosis (OBTp) is an effective
   treatment resulting in small to medium effect sizes with regard to
   changes in positive symptoms and psychopathology. As a consequence, CBTp
   is recommended by national guidelines for all patients with
   schizophrenia. However, although CBTp was originally developed as a
   means to improve delusions, meta-analyses have generally integrated
   effects for positive symptoms rather than for delusions. Thus, it is
   still an open question whether CBTp is more effective with regard to
   change in delusions compared to treatment as usual (TAU) and to other
   interventions, and whether this effect remains stable over a follow-up
   period. Moreover, it would be interesting to explore whether newer
   studies that focus on specific factors involved in the formation and
   maintenance of delusions (causal-interventionist approach) are more
   effective than the first generation of CBTp studies. A systematic search
   of the trial literature identified 19 RCTs that compared CBTp with TAU
   and/or other interventions and reported delusions as an outcome measure.
   Meta-analytic integration resulted in a significant small to medium
   effect size for CBTp in comparison to TAU at end-of-therapy (k = 13; (d)
   over bar = 0.27) and after an average follow-up period of 47 weeks (k =
   12; (d) over bar = 0.25). When compared with other interventions, there
   was no significant effect of CBTp at end-of-therapy (k = 8; (d) over bar
   = 0.16) and after a follow-up period (k = 5; (d) over bar = 0.04).
   Comparison between newer studies taking a causal-interventionist
   approach (k = 4) and first generation studies showed a difference of
   0.33 in mean effect sizes in favor of newer studies at end-of-therapy.
   The findings suggest that CBTp is superior to TAU, but is not superior
   to other interventions, in bringing about a change in delusions, and
   that this superiority is maintained over the follow-up period. Moreover,
   interventions that focus on causal factors of delusions seem to be a
   promising approach to improving interventions for delusions.}},

Abstract = {{Gel electrophoresis is a powerful experimental method to probe the
   topology of DNA and other biopolymers. Although there is a large body of
   experimental work that allows us to accurately separate different
   topoisomers of a molecule, a full theoretical understanding of these
   experiments has not yet been achieved. Here we show that the mobility of
   DNA knots depends crucially and subtly on the physical properties of the
   gel and, in particular, on the presence of dangling ends. The
   topological interactions between these and DNA molecules can be
   described in terms of an ``entanglement number{''} and yield a
   nonmonotonic mobility at moderate fields. Consequently, in 2D
   electrophoresis, gel bands display a characteristic arc pattern; this
   turns into a straight line when the density of dangling ends vanishes.
   We also provide a novel framework to accurately predict the shape of
   such arcs as a function of molecule length and topological complexity,
   which may be used to inform future experiments.}},

Title = {{Availability of emergency neonatal care in eight districts of Karnataka

Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emergency Neonatal Care (EmNC) is an important service for
   the health and survival of newborns. The objective of our study was to
   assess the availability of emergency neonatal care services in the
   north-eastern region of Karnataka state in India.
   Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional epidemiologic study in the year
   2010. We assessed the provision of eight life-saving `signal functions'
   (Comprehensive EmNC) or at least five `signal functions' (Basic EmNC) by
   self-reporting through a structured questionnaire, coupled with
   verification by direct observation for presence of drugs and equipment
   in the prior three months. The assessment was undertaken in 443
   government and 422 private healthcare facilities of eight districts of
   Karnataka.
   Results: There was an average of 3.6 EmNC facilities available per
   500,000 population for the entire region. Only three out of eight
   districts and 10 of 42 sub-districts in the region had the recommended
   {[} greater than or equal to 5] EmNC facilities per 500,000. Further,
   over 95 \% of CEmNC facilities and 88 \% of BEmNC facilities were within
   the private sector. About 80 \% of government hospitals at district and
   sub-district levels did not have EmNC capability.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a simple
   assessment tool to measure health facility availability of life-saving
   services for newborn care. EmNC availability was seen to be suboptimal
   at the regional, district and sub-district levels within the northern
   part of Karnataka state. There is a need to improve availability of
   emergency newborn care in health facilities, with special emphasis on
   equity at population level.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the cortical large-scale functional
   network underpinning audiovisual integration via magnetoencephalographic
   recordings. The reorganization of this network related to long-term
   musical training was investigated by comparing musicians to
   nonmusicians. Connectivity was calculated on the basis of the estimated
   mutual information of the sources' activity, and the corresponding
   networks were statistically compared. Nonmusicians' results indicated
   that the cortical network associated with audiovisual integration
   supports visuospatial processing and attentional shifting, whereas a
   sparser network, related to spatial awareness supports the
   identification of audiovisual incongruences. In contrast, musicians'
   results showed enhanced connectivity in regions related to the
   identification of auditory pattern violations. Hence, nonmusicians rely
   on the processing of visual clues for the integration of audiovisual
   information, whereas musicians rely mostly on the corresponding auditory
   information. The large-scale cortical network underpinning multisensory
   integration is reorganized due to expertise in a cognitive domain that
   largely involves audiovisual integration, indicating long-term
   training-related neuroplasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Choice of network topology for gene regulation has been a question of
   interest for a long time. How do simple and more complex topologies
   arise? In this work, we analyze the topology of the marRAB operon in
   Escherichia coil, which is associated with control of expression of
   genes associated with conferring resistance to low-level antibiotics to
   the bacterium. Among the 2102 promoters in E. co/i, the marRAB promoter
   is the only one that encodes for an autoactivator and an autorepressor.
   What advantages does this topology confer to the bacterium? In this

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to determine the fate of ESBL-producing
   Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) emitted from faecal sources in surface water,
   and the probability of human exposure through swimming. Concentrations
   of ESBL-EC were measured in recreational waters and in source waters,
   being water in ditches surrounding poultry farms and municipal
   wastewater. Additionally, the potential of ESBL-EC in source waters to
   reach recreational waters located downstream of these sources was
   modeled. Modeled ESBL-EC concentrations in recreational waters appeared
   to be mostly determined by the concentrations in the source waters and
   by subsequent dilution in surface water, and less by inactivation. The
   mean (95\%) risk of human exposure to ESBL-EC per person per swimming
   event, as assessed from measured ESBL-EC concentrations in recreational
   waters, was 0.16 (0.89) for men, 0.13 (0.72) for women and 0.20 (0.95)
   for children. exposure risks were estimated for hypothetical
   recreational waters containing 100- or 1000-times diluted source water,
   located 10 days water travel time downstream of the sources. Human
   exposure to ESBL-EC through swimming is likely, if recreational waters
   are located downstream of poultry farms and municipal wastewater
   discharge points.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are prone to clustering either via aggregation
   (irreversible) or agglomeration (reversible) processes. It is
   exceedingly difficult to distinguish the two via conventional techniques
   such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis
   (NTA), or electron microscopy imaging (scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM)) as such techniques only
   generally confirm the presence of large particle clusters. Herein we
   develop a joint approach to tackle the issue of distinguishing between
   nanoparticle aggregation vs agglomeration by characterizing a colloidal
   system of Ag NPs using DLS, NTA, SEM imaging and the electrochemical
   nanoimpacts technique. In contrast to the conventional techniques which
   all reveal the presence of large clusters of particles, electrochemical
   nanoimpacts provide information regarding individual nanoparticles in
   the solution phase and reveal the presence of small nanopartides (<30
   nm) even in high ionic strength (above 0.5 M KCl) and allow a more
   complete analysis. The detection of small nanopartides in high ionic
   strength media evidence the clustering to be a reversible process. As a
   result it is concluded that agglomeration rather than irreversible
   aggregation takes place. This observation is of general importance for
   all colloids as it provides a feasible analysis technique for a wide
   range of systems with an ability to distinguish subtly different

Title = {{Systematic Characteristic Exploration of the Chimeras Generated in
   Multiple Displacement Amplification through Next Generation Sequencing
   Data Reanalysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The chimeric sequences produced by phi29 DNA polymerase, which are named
   as chimeras, influence the performance of the multiple displacement
   amplification (MDA) and also increase the difficulty of sequence data
   process. Despite several articles have reported the existence of
   chimeric sequence, there was only one research focusing on the structure
   and generation mechanism of chimeras, and it was merely based on
   hundreds of chimeras found in the sequence data of E. coli genome.
   Method
   We finished data mining towards a series of Next Generation Sequencing
   (NGS) reads which were used for whole genome haplotype assembling in a
   primary study. We established a bioinformatics pipeline based on
   subsection alignment strategy to discover all the chimeras inside and
   achieve their structural visualization. Then, we artificially defined
   two statistical indexes (the chimeric distance and the overlap length),
   and their regular abundance distribution helped illustrate of the
   structural characteristics of the chimeras. Finally we analyzed the
   relationship between the chimera type and the average insertion size, so
   that illustrate a method to decrease the proportion of wasted data in
   the procedure of DNA library construction.
   Results/Conclusion
   131.4 Gb pair-end (PE) sequence data was reanalyzed for the chimeras.
   Totally, 40,259,438 read pairs (6.19\%) with chimerism were discovered
   among 650,430,811 read pairs. The chimeric sequences are consisted of
   two or more parts which locate inconsecutively but adjacently on the
   chromosome. The chimeric distance between the locations of adjacent
   parts on the chromosome followed an approximate bimodal distribution
   ranging from 0 to over 5,000 nt, whose peak was at about 250 to 300 nt.
   The overlap length of adjacent parts followed an approximate Poisson
   distribution and revealed a peak at 6 nt. Moreover, unmapped chimeras,
   which were classified as the wasted data, could be reduced by properly
   increasing the length of the insertion segment size through a linear
   correlation analysis.
   Significance
   This study exhibited the profile of the phi29MDA chimeras by tens of
   millions of chimeric sequences, and helped understand the amplification
   mechanism of the phi29 DNA polymerase. Our work also illustrated the
   importance of NGS data reanalysis, not only for the improvement of data
   utilization efficiency, but also for more potential genomic information.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pericarp browning is a critical problem resulting in reduced
   commercial value and shelf life of longan fruit.
   Results: Two non-protein amino acids, a-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) and
   beta-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIB) at 100 and 1 mM were applied to longan
   fruit prior to storage for up to 8 days at 25 degrees C respectively.
   Contents of the major five phenolics (gallic acid, catechin, corilagin,
   epicatechin and gallocatechin gallate) were assayed by high-performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC). Physiological properties related to
   pericarp browning of longan fruit were investigated during storage.
   Respiration rate, membrane permeability, malondialdehyde (MDA) content,
   and activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) were
   down-regulated by AIB or BAIB treatments, with significantly lower
   pericarp browning index and higher proportion of edible fruit than the
   control. Moreover, exogenous application of AIB and BAIB maintained
   higher contents of catechin, corilagin, epicatechin and gallocatechin
   gallate, but lower content of gallic acid compared to the control in the
   pericarp of longan fruit during storage, which was associated with the
   oxidation of browning substrate.
   Conclusions: Pericarp browning was inhibited and storage life of longan
   fruit was extended effectively by AIB and BAIB treatments with AIB
   treatment being more significant than BAIB. The findings may provide a
   new strategy for controlling pericarp browning of harvested longan
   fruit.}},

Abstract = {{Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a unique member of the histone
   deacetylase family. Although HDAC6 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm,
   it can regulate the activities of the transcription factors in the
   nucleus. However, a correlation of intracellular distribution of HDAC6
   with tumor progression is lacking. In this study, we found that a low
   frequency of nuclear HDAC6-positive cells in tumors was associated with
   distant metastasis and a worse overall survival in 134 patients with
   non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ectopic expression of wild-type
   HDAC6 promoted migration and invasion of A549 and H661 cells. However,
   the enforced expression of nuclear export signal-deleted HDAC6 inhibited
   the invasion but not the migration of both cell lines. The inhibitory
   effect of nuclear HDAC6 on invasion was mediated by the deacetylation of
   the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B, which decreased its
   DNA-binding activity to the MMP2 promoter, leading to the downregulation
   of MMP2 expression. Our findings indicated that the loss of nuclear
   HDAC6 may be a potential biomarker for predicting metastasis in patients
   with NSCLC.}},

Title = {{Passive dust collectors for assessing airborne microbial material}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Settled airborne dust is used as a surrogate for airborne
   exposure in studies that explore indoor microbes. In order to determine
   whether detecting differences in dust environments would depend on the
   sampler type, we compared different passive, settled dust sampling
   approaches with respect to displaying qualitative and quantitative
   aspects of the bacterial and fungal indoor microbiota.
   Results: Settled dust sampling approaches-utilizing plastic petri
   dishes, TefTex material, and electrostatic dustfall collectors
   (EDCs)-were evaluated in indoor spaces in the USA and Finland and in an
   experimental chamber study. The microbial content was analyzed with
   quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify total bacterial and fungal biomass
   and through high-throughput sequencing to examine bacterial community
   composition. Bacterial composition and diversity were similar within a
   sampling environment regardless of the sampler type. The sampling
   environment was the single largest predictor of microbial community
   composition within a study, while sampler type was found to have much
   less predictive power. Quantitative analyses in indoor spaces indicated
   highest yields using a petri dish approach, followed by sampling with
   EDCs and TefTex. The highest correlations between duplicate samples were
   observed for EDC and petri dish approaches, indicating greater
   experimental repeatability for these sampler types. For the EDC samples,
   it became apparent that, due to the fibrous nature of the material, a
   rigorous extraction protocol is crucial to obtain optimal yields and
   stable, repeatable results.
   Conclusions: Correlations between sampler types were strong both in
   compositional and quantitative terms, and thus, the particular choice of
   passive settled dust sampler is not likely to strongly alter the overall
   conclusion of a study that aims to characterize dust across different
   environments. Microbial cell abundances determined from settled dust
   varied with the use of different sampling approaches, and thus,
   consistency in the method is necessary to allow for absolute comparisons
   within and among studies. Considering practical aspects, petri dishes
   were found to be an inexpensive, simple, and feasible approach that
   showed the highest quantitative determinations under typical building
   conditions, though the choice of sampler will ultimately depend on study
   logistics and characteristics such as low-or high-exposure settings.}},

Abstract = {{In-plane and out-of-plane coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) are
   important parameters for thermodynamic analysis of Carbon/Carbon (C/C)
   composite. In this study, CTEs of a high performance 3D orthogonal woven
   C/C composite at high temperature are studied by multi-scale mechanical
   modeling using the finite element method. Two representative volume
   element (RVE) models at different length scales are used to evaluate the
   CTEs of the C/C material. Micro-scale model predicts the CTEs at the
   fibre tow scale in the three orthogonal directions (x, y and z). The
   output results from the micro-scale model are then incorporated in the
   meso-scale model to obtain the in-plane and out-of-plane CTEs of the 3D
   C/C composite. The modeling results have good agreement with the
   experimental results reported in references. Based on the numerical
   approach, global CTEs of the 3D C/C composite are calculated from 300 to
   2500 K, and their temperature dependences are discussed. The current
   applied multi-scale models provide an efficient approach to predict the
   CTEs of 3D textile materials, which will give some highlights for
   thermodynamic analysis and structures design of the C/C composite. (C)

Abstract = {{Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) blues (PB15) are largely used in art and
   industry as pigments. In these fields mainly three different polymorphic
   modifications of PB15 are employed: alpha, beta and epsilon.
   Differentiating among these CuPc forms can give important information
   for developing conservation strategy and can help in relative dating,
   since each form was introduced in the market in different time periods.
   This study focuses on the classification of Raman spectra measured using
   532 nm excitation wavelength on: (i) dry pigment powders, (ii) unaged
   mock-ups of self-made paints, (iii) unaged commercial paints, and (iv)
   paints subjected to accelerated UV ageing. The ratios among integrated
   Raman bands are taken in consideration as features to perform Random
   Forest (RF). Features selection based on Gini Contrast score was carried
   out on the measured dataset to determine the Raman bands ratios with
   higher predictive power. These were used as polymorphic markers, in
   order to establish an easy and accessible method for the identification.
   Three different ratios and the presence of a characteristic vibrational
   band allowed the identification of the crystal modification in pigments
   powder as well as in unaged and aged paint films. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The individual roles of three chloroplast CPN60 protomers (CPN60 alpha,
   CPN60 beta 1, and CPN60 beta 2) and whether and how they are assembled
   into functional chaperonin complexes are investigated in Chlamydomonas
   reinhardtii. Protein complexes containing all three potential subunits
   were identified in Chlamydomonas, and their co-expression in Escherichia
   coli yielded a homogeneous population of oligomers containing all three
   subunits (CPN60 alpha beta 1 beta 2), with a molecular weight consistent
   with a tetradecameric structure. While homo-oligomers of CPN60 beta
   could form, they were dramatically reduced when CPN60 alpha was present
   and homo-oligomers of CPN60 beta 2 were readily changed into
   hetero-oligomers in the presence of ATP and other protomers. ATP
   hydrolysis caused CPN60 oligomers to disassemble and drove the purified
   protomers to reconstitute oligomers in vitro, suggesting that the
   dynamic nature of CPN60 oligomers is dependent on ATP. Only
   hetero-oligomeric CPN60 alpha beta 1 beta 2, containing CPN60 alpha,
   CPN60 beta 1, and CPN60 beta 2 subunits in a 5: 6: 3 ratio, cooperated
   functionally with GroES. The combination of CPN60 alpha and CPN60 beta
   subunits, but not the individual subunits alone, complemented GroEL
   function in E. coli with subunit recognition specificity.
   Down-regulation of the CPN60 alpha subunit in Chlamydomonas resulted in
   a slow growth defect and an inability to grow autotrophically,
   indicating the essential role of CPN60 alpha in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The high-luminosity LHC (HiLumi LHC) upgrade with planned operation from
   2025 onward has a goal of achieving a tenfold increase in the number of
   recorded collisions thanks to a doubling of the intensity per bunch
   (2.2e11 protons) and a reduction of beta{*} to 15 cm. Such an increase
   would significantly expedite new discoveries and exploration. To avoid
   detrimental effects from long-range beam-beam interactions, the half
   crossing angle must be increased to 295 microrad. Without bunch
   crabbing, this large crossing angle and small transverse beam size would
   result in a luminosity reduction factor of 0.3 (Piwinski angle).
   Therefore, crab cavities are an important component of the LHC upgrade,
   and will contribute strongly to achieving an increase in the number of
   recorded collisions. The proposed crab cavities are electromagnetic
   devices with a resonance in the radio frequency (rf) region of the
   spectrum (400.789 MHz). They cause a kick perpendicular to the direction
   of motion (transverse kick) to restore an effective head-on collision
   between the particle beams, thereby restoring the geometric factor to
   0.8 {[}K. Oide and K. Yokoya, Phys. Rev. A 40, 315 (1989).]. Noise
   injected through the rf/low level rf (llrf) system could cause
   significant transverse emittance growth and limit luminosity lifetime.
   In this work, a theoretical relationship between the phase and amplitude
   rf noise spectrum and the transverse emittance growth rate is derived,
   for a hadron machine assuming zero synchrotron radiation damping and
   broadband rf noise, excluding infinitely narrow spectral lines. This
   derivation is for a single beam. Both amplitude and phase noise are
   investigated. The potential improvement in the presence of the
   transverse damper is also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the numerous studies on the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of
   alkylthiols on gold, the mechanisms involved, especially the nature and
   influence of the thiol-gold interface are still under debate. In this
   work the adsorption of aminothiols on Au(111) surfaces has been studied
   by using surface IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well
   as by density functional theory (DFT) modeling. Two aminothiols were
   used, cysteamine (CEA) and mercaptoundecylamine (MUAM), which contain
   two and eleven carbon atoms, respectively. By combining experimental and
   theoretical methods, it was possible to draw a molecular picture of the
   thiol-gold interface. The long-chain aminothiol produced better ordered
   SAMs, but, interestingly, the XPS data showed different sulfur binding
   environments depending on the alkyl chain length; an additional peak at
   low binding energy was observed upon CEA adsorption, which indicates the
   presence of sulfur in a different environment. DFT modeling showed that
   the positions of the sulfur atoms in the SAMs on gold with similar unit
   cells {[}(2 root 3x 2 root 3)R30 degrees] depended on the length of the
   alkyl chain. Short-chain alkylthiol SAMs were adsorbed more strongly
   than long-chain thiol SAMs and were shown to induce surface
   reconstruction by extracting atoms from the surface, possibly forming
   adatom/vacancy combinations that lead to the additional XPS peak. In the
   case of short alkylthiols, the thiol-gold interface governs the layer,
   CEA adsorbs strongly, and the mechanism is closer to single-molecule
   adsorption than self-assembly, whereas for long chains, interactions
   between alkyl chains drive the system to self-assembly, leading to a
   higher level of SAM organization and restricting the influence of the
   sulfur-gold interface.}},

Abstract = {{The main target of this paper is to get an interesting data for the
   preparation and characterizations of metal oxide (MO) nanoparticles
   using H2L Schiff base complexes as precursors through the thermal
   decomposition procedure. Five Schiff base complexes of Mn(II), Co(II),
   Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) metal ions were synthesized from
   2-{[}(2-hydroxy-naphthalen-1-ylmethylene)-amino]-benzoic acid new adduct
   (H2L). Theses complexes were characterized using infrared, electronic,
   mass and H-1 NMR spectroscopic techniques. The elemental analysis data
   was confirmed that the stoichiometry of (metal:H2L) is 1:1 molar ratio.
   The molar conductance indicates that all of complexes are non
   electrolytic. The general chemical formulas of these complexes is
   {[}M(L)(NH3)]center dot nH(2)O. All complexes are tetrahedral geometry.
   The thermal decomposition behavior of H2L hydrated and anhydrous
   complexes has been discussed using thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG)
   and differential thermal analyses (DTA) under nitrogen atmosphere. The
   crystalline phases of the reaction products were checked using X-ray
   diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). (C) 2015

Abstract = {{As part of a study of the effects of seasonal hypoxia on sediment
   properties, samples were collected during the spring and late summer of
   2009 from four sites of similar sediment type and water depth (30 -39
   m), but different recent history of bottom water oxygen concentration on
   the continental shelf of Louisiana. Sediment profile imaging (SPI), box
   coring, X-radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging were
   employed to characterize the biogenic structural differences in
   surficial sediments among a normoxic control site and three sites
   subjected to hypoxic events varying in frequency of occurrence. Results
   of the CT imagery indicated that macrobenthic biogenic structures were
   the most numerous at the H7 site that had experienced the least hypoxia
   in the past 23 years. The E4 site that had experienced hypoxia
   seasonally with a frequency between 50\% and 75\% of the time had the
   fewest biogenic structures in spring 2009, but exhibited recovery in
   terms of their abundance and diameter in summer 2009. E4 also exhibited
   high rates of bioturbation during the late-summer sampling as determined
   from excess Th-234. This suggests that the macrobenthos community at
   this site was in an active phase of recovery from hypoxia. At the A6
   site, exposed to hypoxia with an annual frequency >= 75\%, biogenic
   structures were numerous but dimensionally small, correlating with the
   average individual size of macrobenthos found there. The total volume
   maxima occupied by biogenic structures in the sediment occurred below
   the uppermost sediment intervals, with the exception of the spring
   sample from the D5 site that experienced hypoxia between 25\% and 50\%
   of the time. CT-imagery indicating effects of seasonal hypoxia on
   biogenic structure in the top 10 cm of sediments detected more
   structures than SPI, X-radiographic imagery, or macrobenthos census
   data. The presence of relict burrows probably inflated estimates of
   biogenic structures in the subcores, rendering an integrated result that
   included creation, destruction, and preservation of burrows and voids
   over time. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The production of cork stoppers is currently a process in rapid
   evolution. Where in the past hand labor was common, today we observe
   increasing attempts to introduce technologies that increase the
   productivity of production lines. One these example are automated cork
   drillers that produce thousands of cork stoppers per hour. In order to
   harness this increase in productivity to its full potential, it must the
   followed by other processes in the production line upstream of the
   driller, as for example the feeding of the latter.
   This article presents the application of computer vision techniques that
   extract information of cork strips that move on a conveyor belt, to
   obtain automated feeding of a cork driller using a robotic manipulator.
   Image Processing extracts information regarding the strip position and
   orientation, and also which side of the strip is visible. Thus the strip
   is consistently placed in the driller in order to extract stoppers from
   the best quality cork. The segmentation of the cork strips is obtained
   by background subtraction. To estimate the strip visible surface, we
   apply Machine Learning techniques that enable a robust classification
   given a set of features extracted from the cork texture.
   In the experiences carried out, we were able to obtain 100\%
   classification rate with a test dataset of more than a hundred cork
   strips. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel complex chitosan derivative, O-2'-hydroxypropyltrimethyl
   ammonium chloride chitosan (O-2'-HACC), was synthesized and used to make
   nanoparticles as a delivery vehicle for live attenuated Newcastle
   disease vaccine. We found that O-2'-HACC had high antimicrobial
   activity, low toxicity, and a high safety level. Newcastle disease virus
   (NDV) was then encapsulated in the O-2'-HACC nanoparticles (NDV/La
   Sota-O-2'-HACC-NPs) by the ionic crosslinking method, and the properties
   of the resulting nanoparticles were determined by transmission electron
   microscopy, Zeta potential analysis, Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and X-ray
   diffraction. NDV/La Sota-O-2'-HACC-NPs had regular spherical
   morphologies and high stability, with an encapsulation efficiency of
   95.68 +/- 2.2\% and a loading capacity of 58.75 +/- 4.03\%. An in vitro
   release assay indicated that release of NDV from NDV/La
   Sota-O-2'-HACC-NPs occurred slowly. Specific pathogen-free chickens
   immunized with NDV/La Sota-O-2'-HACC-NPs intranasally had much stronger
   cellular, humoral and mucosal immune responses than did those immunized
   intramuscularly or with live attenuated Newcastle disease vaccine.
   NDV/La Sota-O-2'-HACC-NPs are a novel drug delivery carrier with immense
   potential in medical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This research discusses the acetylation of cotton cellulose with acetic
   anhydride without solvents. The acetylation was done in the presence of
   different amounts of N-Iodosuccinimide (NIS) as a catalyst; this took
   place under mild reaction conditions. The extent of acetylation was
   measured by the weight percent gain (WPG) that varied from 24.71 to
   71.83\%. Cotton cellulose acetates, with the degree of substitution (DS)
   that ranged from 0.89 to 2.84, were prepared in one step. The cellulose
   triacetate, with a degree of substitution (DS) 2.84, was obtained. The
   WPG and DS were easily controlled by changing the reaction duration (1-5
   h), and the concentration of the catalyst (0.05 g, 0.075 g and 0.10 g
   for 1 g of cellulose) in 25 ml of acetic anhydride. NIS was recognized
   as a novel and more successful catalyst for the acetylation of hydroxyl
   groups in cotton cellulose. Formation of the acetates and the
   calculation of the degree of substitution were performed by FT-IR,
   Raman, and H-1 NMR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Different mechanisms such as selection or genetic drift permitted e.g.
   by geographical isolation can lead to differentiation of populations and
   could cause subsequent speciation. The two subspecies of Poecilimon
   veluchianus, a bushcricket endemic to central Greece, show a parapatric
   distribution and are partially reproductively isolated. Therefore, P.
   veluchianus is suitable to investigate an ongoing speciation process. We
   based our analysis on sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
   and the mitochondrial control region (CR). The population genetic
   analysis based on the nuclear marker ITS revealed a barrier to gene flow
   within the range of Poecilimon veluchianus, which corresponds well to
   the described subspecies. In contrast to the results based on the
   nuclear ITS marker, the mitochondrial CR marker does not clearly support
   the separation into two subspecies with restricted gene flow and a clear
   contact zone. Furthermore, we could identify isolation by distance (IBD)
   as one important mechanism responsible for the observed genetic
   structure (based on the ITS marker). The population genetic analysis
   based on the nuclear marker ITS also suggests the existence of hybrids
   in the wild. Furthermore, the simultaneous lack of strong prezygotic
   barriers and the presence of postzygotic mating barriers, observed in
   previous laboratory experiments, suggest that a secondary contact after
   an allopatric phase is more likely than parapatric speciation.}},

   Lumbricus rubellus are not reproductively isolated}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The accurate delimitation of species is essential to
   numerous areas of biological research. An unbiased assessment of the
   diversity, including the cryptic diversity, is of particular importance
   for the below ground fauna, a major component of global biodiversity. On
   the British Isles, the epigeic earthworm Lumbricus rubellus, which is a
   sentinel species in soil ecotoxicology, consists of two cryptic taxa
   that are differentiated in both the nuclear and the mitochondrial
   (mtDNA) genomes. Recently, several deeply divergent mtDNA lineages were
   detected in mainland Europe, but whether these earthworms also
   constitute cryptic species remains unclear. This information is
   important from an evolutionary perspective, but it is also essential for
   the interpretation and the design of ecotoxicological projects. In this
   study, we used genome-wide RADseq data to assess the reproductive
   isolation of the divergent mitochondrial lineages of L. rubellus that
   occur in sympatry in multiple localities in Central Europe.
   Results: We identified five divergent (up to 16 \% net p-distance)
   mitochondrial lineages of L. rubellus in sympatry. Because the
   clustering of the RADseq data was according to the population of origin
   and not the mtDNA lineage, reproductive isolation among the mtDNA
   lineages was not likely. Although each population contained multiple
   mtDNA lineages, subdivisions within the populations were not observed
   for the nuclear genome. The lack of fixed differences and sharing of the
   overwhelming majority of nuclear polymorphisms between localities,
   indicated that the populations did not constitute allopatric species.
   The nucleotide diversity within the populations was high, 0.7-0.8 \%.
   Conclusions: The deeply divergent mtDNA sympatric lineages of L.
   rubellus in Central Europe were not reproductively isolated groups. The
   earthworm L. rubellus, which is represented by several mtDNA lineages in
   continental Europe, apparently is a single highly polymorphic species
   rather than a complex of several cryptic species. This study
   demonstrated the critical importance of the use of multilocus nuclear
   data for the unbiased assessment of cryptic diversity and for the
   delimitation of species in soil invertebrates.}},

Title = {{Elevated blood pressure and headache disorders in China - associations,
   under-treatment and implications for public health}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEADACHE AND PAIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Both hypertension (HTN) and headache disorders are highly
   prevalent worldwide. Our purpose, in a nationwide study of the Chinese
   general population, was to evaluate any association between primary
   headache disorders and elevated blood pressure (eBP). We could not
   collect data on antihypertensive therapy, but took the view that,
   whatever such therapy might be taken, eBP was a sign that it was failing
   to meet treatment needs. Therefore, as a secondary purpose, important
   from the public-health perspective, we would present the prevalence of
   eBP (treated or not) as indicative of unmet health-care need in China.
   Methods: This was a questionnaire-based nationwide cross-sectional
   door-to-door survey using cluster random-sampling, selecting one adult
   (18-65 years) per household. Headache was diagnosed by ICHD-II criteria
   and eBP as systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood
   pressure >= 90 mmHg. Chi-squared test and multivariate logistic
   regression analysis were used to assess the strength and significance of
   associations. We set significance at P <= 0.05.
   Results: Of 5,041 survey participants (participation rate 94.1 \%), 154
   were excluded because of missing BP data, leaving 4,987 for analysis
   {[}mean age: 43.6 +/- 12.8 years; male 2,532 (mean age: 43.4 +/- 12.9
   years); female 2,455 (mean age 43.9 +/- 12.8 years)]. There were 466
   participants with migraine, 535 with tension type headache (TTH) and 48
   with all causes of headache on >= 15 days/month. The prevalence of eBP
   was 22.1 \% (males 22.9 \%, females 21.3 \%). No associations of eBP
   with any of the headache disorders survived multivariate adjusted
   analysis. The demographic and anthropometric variables most strongly
   associated with eBP were higher age (AOR 3.7) and being overweight (AOR
   2.4), seen in both genders. Less strong were male gender, lower
   educational level and urban habitation.
   Conclusions: We found no clear-cut associations between eBP and any
   headache disorder. The associations with demographic and anthropometric
   variables may have acted as confounders in past reports to the contrary.
   We did find an alarmingly high prevalence of eBP, recognizing that this
   signals substantial under-treatment in China of a serious condition, and
   therefore a major public-health concern.}},

Abstract = {{A facile technique was developed for the preparation of monodispersed
   nanospheres composed of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) for use as a
   biodegradable polymer in a liquid-liquid system. The preparation of PLGA
   particles by solvent evaporation from an emulsion prepared by adding a
   nonionic or reactive surfactant to the water phase was examined. The
   size of the PLGA particles gradually decreased as the surfactant
   concentration in the water phase increased. However, nanosized PLGA
   particles were difficult to prepare using this procedure. Preparation of
   nanosized particles of PLGA by solvent evaporation from a mixture of an
   aqueous solution of polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and ethanol was also
   examined. As the amount of ethanol was increased relative to the amount
   of PVA solution, the size of the PLGA particles decreased. At a ratio of
   50: 40 v/v\% PVA(aq): ethanol, monodispersed spherical PLGA particles,
   170 nm in diameter, were generated. Nanosized PLGA particles in
   liquid-liquid systems are generally prepared using solvent evaporation
   methods after emulsion droplets are first prepared using a particulate
   disperser apparatus (e.g., an ultrasonic homogenizer), although the
   resulting particles are polydispersed. In this study, monodispersed
   nanosized PLGA particles were generated even though we used a simple
   high-speed rotary homogenizer, which is usually not capable of preparing
   nanosized particles, without the use of a particulate mechanical
   disperser or a combination of particulate emulsion techniques. The
   technique used in this study may also be applicable to the preparation
   of other types of polymers and emulsion particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Major climatic reorganizations, including changes in the nature of
   glacialeinterglacial cycles through the Pleistocene, are a key issue for
   improving the understanding of Earth's climate system. Highly resolved
   marine sedimentary records are essential to reconstruct the details of
   these past climatic changes and investigate the mechanisms responsible
   for them. The Kazusa Group, located in the central part of the Japanese
   island chain, is well-exposed and contains a remarkably continuous and
   thick, deep-and shallow-water marine sedimentary succession. This group
   also contains well-preserved marine micro-fossils, pollen, paleomagnetic
   reversal events, geochemical signatures, and a large number of tephra
   beds. These features allow us to establish a robust chronological and
   stratigraphic framework for the Kazusa Group, and provide a rare
   opportunity to study oceanic and terrestrial climatic and environmental
   changes at high resolution especially through the Lower and lower Middle
   Pleistocene. In the Boso Peninsula, Chiba Prefecture, the Kazusa Group
   is deeply incised, yielding spectacular river-cut exposures. The
   Matuyama-Brunhes paleomagnetic reversal is observed immediately above
   the widespread Byakubi-E (Byk-E) tephra in the Chiba composite section
   within the Kokumoto Formation (Kazusa Group). Because the
   Matuyama-Brunhes boundary customarily serves as the primary guide for
   the Lower-Middle Pleistocene Subseries boundary, the Chiba composite
   section is considered an excellent candidate for its global boundary
   stratotype section and point (GSSP). This study reviews the published
   data for the Kazusa Group (hitherto almost exclusively in Japanese) in
   order to place the Chiba composite section within its broader
   depositional and chronostratigraphic context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{164}},
Pages = {{392-407}},

Abstract = {{The benthic boundary layer (BBL) macrofauna consists of epibenthic,
   hyperbenthic and zooplanktonic organisms with different degrees of
   mobility and bottom dependence. The top-level predators within this
   habitat include demersal fish species. The BBL species are considered to
   be the most readily available prey for these fish making them an
   attractive source of food and therefore key taxa in marine food webs.
   The present study is a field experiment in the oligotrophic continental
   shelf of Heraklion Bay (Cretan Sea, eastern Mediterranean) investigating
   the ways in which demersal fish utilize BBL sources as food. Species
   diversity patterns derived from samples collected by using a modified
   hyperbenthic sledge as well as different benthic, hyperbenthic and
   pelagic samplers are described. These patterns are compared with those
   derived from stomach content analysis of demersal fish species
   inhabiting the same area. Results reveal that BBL macrofaunal

Abstract = {{The alloying effects of group-II elements on the properties of the
   Zn0.86X0.1Ga0.04O (X: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr) films were investigated and

   quality of film, whereas Ca or Sr incorporation significantly
   deteriorated the properties of the resultant films. The lowest
   resistivity of 1.07 x 10(-3) Omega cm was achieved from the film alloyed
   with Mg and while, the wide band-gap of 3.76 eV was reached by Be doping
   in ZnGaO. It was suggested that the film property was strongly dependent
   on the alloying elements and critically affected by the mismatch of
   ionic radii between alloying elements and Zn. Additional phonon modes
   were found in the Raman spectra of Ca and Sr doped films and these
   phonons were suggested to be due to the local vibration modes related to
   Ca or Sr doping. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Statistical Analysis of Zebrafish Locomotor Response}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Zebrafish larvae display rich locomotor behaviour upon external
   stimulation. The movement can be simultaneously tracked from many larvae
   arranged in multi-well plates. The resulting time-series locomotor data
   have been used to reveal new insights into neurobiology and
   pharmacology. However, the data are of large scale, and the
   corresponding locomotor behavior is affected by multiple factors. These
   issues pose a statistical challenge for comparing larval activities. To
   address this gap, this study has analyzed a visually-driven locomotor
   behaviour named the visual motor response (VMR) by the Hotelling's
   T-squared test. This test is congruent with comparing locomotor profiles
   from a time period. Different wildtype (WT) strains were compared using
   the test, which shows that they responded differently to light change at
   different developmental stages. The performance of this test was
   evaluated by a power analysis, which shows that the test was sensitive
   for detecting differences between experimental groups with sample
   numbers that were commonly used in various studies. In addition, this
   study investigated the effects of various factors that might affect the
   VMR by multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The results indicate
   that the larval activity was generally affected by stage, light
   stimulus, their interaction, and location in the plate. Nonetheless,
   different factors affected larval activity differently over time, as
   indicated by a dynamical analysis of the activity at each second.
   Intriguingly, this analysis also shows that biological and technical
   repeats had negligible effect on larval activity. This finding is
   consistent with that from the Hotelling's T-squared test, and suggests
   that experimental repeats can be combined to enhance statistical power.
   Together, these investigations have established a statistical framework
   for analyzing VMR data, a framework that should be generally applicable
   to other locomotor data with similar structure.}},

Volume = {{130}},

Abstract = {{Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is an unavoidable consequence of Quantum
   Chromodynamics (QCD). High-energy heavy-ion collisions offer the unique
   possibility to reproduce in the laboratory the conditions expected
   during the very first stages of the evolution of the Universe. The ALICE
   (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) experiment at the Large Hadron
   Collider (LHC) allows the study of the dense nuclear environment created
   in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Particle Identification (PID) is one of
   the key features of the ALICE experiment. Identified particle spectra
   represent a crucial tool to understand the behaviour of the matter
   created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The transverse momentum
   p(T) distributions of identified hadrons contain information about the
   transverse expansion of the system and constrain the freeze-out
   properties of the system. Hydrodynamic models have proved to be very
   successful reproducing a large number of features of heavy-ion
   collisions (e.g., particle p(T) distributions, radial flow, elliptic
   flow, Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations,...). The measurement of the p(T)
   distributions of identified pi, K and p in Pb-Pb collisions at
   root(NN)-N-S = 2.76TeV is presented and discussed in terms of
   hydrodynamics. The V0 detector allows the selection of events based on
   the eccentricity of the collision (related with the initial geometry).
   This makes possible the study of the correlation between the p(T)
   distribution of hadrons and elliptic flow on an event-by-event basis.
   Hadron abundances can be obtained from the principle of maximum entropy
   using statistical concepts. This allows the extrapolation of the
   chemical freeze-out parameters from the data. Over the last years it has
   been proved that the chemical freeze-out temperature T-ch is connected
   with the phase transition temperature T-C. The measurements of the
   freeze-out parameters at the LHC energies are described in detail and
   the results obtained by various groups at lower energies are extended
   with the inclusion of the LHC measurement. The LHC measurements cast a
   new light upon the hydrodynamic and thermal behaviour of the hadron
   production in heavy-ion collisions. The possible scenarios are described
   and commented.}},

   Mn2CoGa is L2(1b)-type Fm (3) over barm (i.e., (Mn,Co)(2)MnGa), but not

   order-disorder transition temperature shows a maximum at the
   stoichiometric composition of Co2MnGa and the Curie temperature of the
   L2(1) phase decreases with increasing Ga content. Magnetic moments
   converted from magnetization curves at 4.2 K for CoxMn(76-x)Ga24 alloys

Abstract = {{The lithological content and mineralogical assemblage of main tephra
   layers (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V7) embedded in the Montalbano Jonico
   succession have been fully characterized. Major-element analyses were
   carried out on the juvenile glass fractions and main crystal phases, and
   trace-element contents were determined on glasses extracted from the
   thickest layer of the sequence (V5). Single crystal Ar-40/Ar-39 laser
   fusions were performed on sanidine from the V4 layer, yielding a
   weighted mean age of 773.9 +/- 1.3 ka. The Vulture volcano is likely the
   source of two tephra layers, V3 and V4, embedded to the middle part of
   the Interval B of the sequence, which represent the oldest products of
   this center ever found. Moreover, the V4 layer was emplaced near the
   Matuyama-Bruhnes Chron boundary, and thus serves as an important
   chronostratigraphic marker. Complete chemical characterization of V5
   allows us to suggest the Campanian Volcanic Zone as its eruptive source;
   corroborating the idea that activity there began at similar to 720 ka
   and spanned most of the Middle Pleistocene. Finally, we insert our new
   framework from the Montalbano Jonico sequence into a reappraised tephra
   sequence from the Middle Pleistocene to present in southern Italy, which
   results in a more robust series of tephrostratotypes and improves the
   reliability of inter-archive correlations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to determine if an alphavirus-based vaccine
   encoding human Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) could generate an
   effective anti-tumor immune response in a stringent mouse model of
   prostate cancer. DR2bxPSA F-1 male mice expressing human PSA and
   HLA-DRB1{*}1501 transgenes were vaccinated with virus-like particle
   vector encoding PSA (VLPV-PSA) followed by the challenge with Transgenic
   Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate cells engineered to express PSA
   (TRAMP-PSA). PSA-specific cellular and humoral immune responses were
   measured before and after tumor challenge. PSA and CD8 reactivity in the
   tumors was detected by immunohistochemistry. Tumor growth was compared
   in vaccinated and control groups. We found that VLPV-PSA could infect
   mouse dendritic cells in vitro and induce a robust PSA-specific immune
   response in vivo. A substantial proportion of splenic CD8 T cells (19.6
   +/- 7.4\%) produced IFN gamma in response to the immunodominant peptide
   PSA(65-73). In the blood of vaccinated mice, 18.4 +/- 4.1\% of CD8 T
   cells were PSA-specific as determined by the staining with
   H-2D(b)/PSA(65-73) dextramers. VLPV-PSA vaccination also strongly
   stimulated production of IgG2a/b anti-PSA antibodies. Tumors in
   vaccinated mice showed low levels of PSA expression and significant CD8+
   T cell infiltration. Tumor growth in VLPV-PSA vaccinated mice was
   significantly delayed at early time points (p = 0.002, Gehan-Breslow
   test). Our data suggest that TC-83-based VLPV-PSA vaccine can
   efficiently overcome immune tolerance to PSA, mediate rapid clearance of
   PSA-expressing tumor cells and delay tumor growth. The VLPV-PSA vaccine
   will undergo further testing for the immunotherapy of prostate cancer.

Title = {{The vasorelaxant effect of 8(17),12E,14-labdatrien-18-oic acid involves
   stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP/PKA pathway: Evidences by
   pharmacological and molecular docking studies}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY}},

Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{The relaxant effect of 8(17),12E,14-labdatrien-18-oic acid (LBD) was
   investigated on isolated aortic rings and compared with forskolin (FSK),
   a standard and potent activator of adenylyl cyclase (AC) with relaxing
   effect. The presence of potassium channel blockers, such as
   glibenclamide (ATP-blocker), apamin (SKCa-blocker), charybdotoxin
   (BKCa-blocker) did not significantly affect either the LBD or FSK
   concentration-response curves. However, in the presence of
   4-aminopyridine (K-V-blocker), the relaxant effect for both diterpenes
   was significantly attenuated, with reduction of its relative potencies.
   Moreover, the relaxation induced by 8-Br-cAMP, an analog of cAMP, was
   also significantly attenuated in the same conditions, i.e., in the
   presence of 4-aminopyridine. The presence of aminophylline, a
   nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caused a significant
   increasing in the potency for both LBD and FSK. On the other hand, the
   presence of Rp-cAMPS, a selective PKA-inhibitor, significantly
   attenuated the relaxant effect of LBD. In this work, in the same
   experimental conditions, both labdane-type diterpenes presented
   remarkably similar results; FSK, however, presented a higher potency
   (100-fold) than LBD. Thus, the hypothesis that LBD could be a novel
   AC-activator emerged. To assess that hypothesis, computational molecular
   docking studies were performed. Crystallographic structure of adenylyl
   cyclase/forskolin complex (1AB8) was obtained from RSCB Protein Data
   Bank and used to compare the modes of interaction of the native ligand
   and LBD. The computational data shows many similarities between LBD and
   FSK concerning the interaction with the regulatory site of AC. Taken
   together, the results presented here pointed to LBD as a novel
   AC-activator. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated power system of a PEM fuel cell and hydride tanks designed
   for stationary applications is described. The work was focused on
   different aspects related to the development of the metal hydride tank
   and to its integration with the fuel cell, using water as thermal fluid.
   A commercially available LaNi4.8Al0.2 intermetallic compound was chosen
   as hydrogen storage material, having sorption characteristics adequate
   to the working conditions of the system (i.e. 60 degrees C and 1 atm).
   Tanks were constituted by stainless steel, together with copper fins for
   improving heat exchanges between the thermal fluid and the tank. The
   performances of the integrated system were tested in different working
   conditions, in order to evaluate its reliability and efficiency. The
   system can operate for about 6 h, at an average power of 0.76 kW and
   delivering a total energy of 4.8 kW h, consuming about 3120 Nl of H-2.

Abstract = {{The detection of carbon monoxide in solution and air has been achieved
   using simple, inexpensive systems based on the vinyl complexes {[}M(CH=
   CHR)Cl(CO)(BTD)(PPh3)(2)] (R= aryl, BTD= 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole).
   Depending on the nature of the vinyl group, chromogenic and fluorogenic
   responses signalled the presence of this odourless, tasteless,
   invisible, and toxic gas. Solutions of the complexes in CHCl3 underwent
   rapid change between easily differentiated colours when exposed to air
   samples containing CO. More significantly, the adsorption of the
   complexes on silica produced colorimetric probes for the naked-eye
   detection of CO in the gas phase. Structural data for key species before
   and after the addition of CO were obtained by means of single X-ray
   diffraction studies. In all cases, the ruthenium and osmium vinyl
   complexes studied showed a highly selective response to CO with
   exceptionally low detection limits. Naked-eye detection of CO at
   concentrations as low as 5 ppb in air was achieved with the onset of
   toxic levels (i.e., 100 ppm), thus resulting in a remarkably clear
   colour change. Moreover, complexes bearing pyrenyl, naphthyl, and
   phenanthrenyl moieties were fluorescent, and greater sensitivities were
   achieved (through turn-on emission fluorescence) in the presence of CO
   both in solution and air. This behaviour was explored computationally
   using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) experiments. In
   addition, the systems were shown to be selective for CO over all other
   gases tested, including water vapour and common organic solvents.
   Supporting the metal complexes on cellulose strips for use in an
   existing optoelectronic device allows numerical readings for the CO
   concentration to be obtained and provision of an alarm system.}},

Title = {{Plasma membrane restricted RhoGEF activity is sufficient for
   RhoA-mediated actin polymerization}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{The small GTPase RhoA is involved in cell morphology and migration. RhoA
   activity is tightly regulated in time and space and depends on guanine
   exchange factors (GEFs). However, the kinetics and subcellular
   localization of GEF activity towards RhoA are poorly defined. To study
   the mechanism underlying the spatiotemporal control of RhoA activity by
   GEFs, we performed single cell imaging with an improved FRET sensor
   reporting on the nucleotide loading state of RhoA. By employing the FRET
   sensor we show that a plasma membrane located RhoGEF, p63RhoGEF, can
   rapidly activate RhoA through endogenous GPCRs and that localized RhoA
   activity at the cell periphery correlates with actin polymerization.
   Moreover, synthetic recruitment of the catalytic domain derived from
   p63RhoGEF to the plasma membrane, but not to the Golgi apparatus, is
   sufficient to activate RhoA. The synthetic system enables local
   activation of endogenous RhoA and effectively induces actin
   polymerization and changes in cellular morphology. Together, our data
   demonstrate that GEF activity at the plasma membrane is sufficient for
   actin polymerization via local RhoA signaling.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-reactive polysaccharide-based inisurf (acting both as initiator
   and stabilizer) has been designed for the first time from dextran with
   the aim of preparing dextran-covered nanoparticles with covalent linkage
   between core and coverage. This inisurf was used for polymerizing butyl
   acrylate in miniemulsion by AGET-ATRP. Both hydrophobic phenoxy groups
   and initiator groups (bromoisobutyryl ester) were introduced within
   hydrophilic dextran chain, conferring it amphiphilic and macroinitiator
   characters. Amphiphilic properties of dextran inisurfs have been
   evidenced as well as their ability to stabilize the direct miniemulsion
   of n-butyl acrylate. After optimization of polymerization conditions
   with model studies, assays were successfully realized with dextran-based
   inisurfs. Because of their amphiphilic character, inisurfs migrated at
   oil/water interface and initiated polymerization from bromoisobutyryl
   ester groups. Therefore graft copolymers were produced at oil/water
   interface, due to the multifunctional character of these inisurfs and
   constituted the particle inner core with covalent links to the dextran
   coverage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to prepare, characterize novel types of
   pH-sensitive konjac gum-xanthan gum-glycerol-sodium alginate hydrogel
   (KGM-XG-GLY-SA hydrogel) allowing for the site-specific delivering of
   drugs to the colon and evaluate its colon-targeting characteristic. In
   this study, hydrophilic drug of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (HSS)
   was chosen as a model drug and successfully loaded in hydrogel without
   any organic solvent. In vitro investigations were carried out to
   evaluate its release process. The drug-loaded hydrogel shown good
   sustained release property that drugs release from test hydrogel was
   minimal at pH 1.2 (2h, 23.40\%), pH 6.8 (4h, 25.88\%), and significantly
   higher (4h, 70.20\%) at pH 7.4. It is clear that adding glycerol in
   hydrogel as hysteresis preparation prevented the rapid dissolution of
   material in the higher pH of the intestine. Thus ensuring a controlled
   release of the entrapped drug. We studied the colonic-targeting
   behavior, in vivo toxicity test, pharmacokinetic study, features to
   reduce drug toxicity, and therapeutic effect of experimental UC of this
   preparation. All the results in vitro were shown that the K
   (KGM-XG-GLY-SA) hydrogels with glycerol had a good colon-targeting
   characteristic. In addition, results in vivo were indicated that K
   (KGM-XG-GLY-SA) hydrogel were nontoxic, reduced the spleen and thymus
   index, and had an obvious effect on the treatment of UC. Therefore, all
   results suggested that the developed HSS/KGM-XG-GLY-SA hydrogel
   (HSS-GEL) with glycerol as a colon-targeting vector might have greatly
   potential application in the UC healing. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{46-55}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{A transient three-dimensional model for describing fluid flow
   characteristics and particles migration behavior within the melt pool
   during selective laser melting (SLM) of TiC/AlSi10Mg nanocomposites was
   developed. The powder-solid transition, variation of thermophysical
   properties, and surface tension were considered in the model. The
   influence of laser energy per unit length (LEPUL) on heat and mass
   transfer, melt pool dynamics, and particles rearrangement was
   investigated. It showed that the Marangoni convection became more
   vigorous with an increase of LEPUL, accordingly enhancing the thermal
   capillary force. The high laser energy input induced a sufficient liquid
   formation and an improved wettability, lowering the friction force
   exerting on TiC solids. Under this condition, the reinforcing particles
   can be well mixed within the matrix. The experimental study on the
   distribution state of TiC reinforcement in the SLM-processed Al matrix
   was performed. The results validated that the dispersion of TiC
   reinforcement changed from a severe aggregation to a uniform dispersion
   in the matrix with the increase of LEPUL. The TiC reinforcement
   experienced a microstructural variation from the standard nanoscale
   structure with a mean particle size of 70-90 nm to the relatively
   coarsened submicron morphology with an average particle size of 134 nm
   as LEPUL increased. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{When did the Anthropocene begin? A mid-twentieth century boundary level
   is stratigraphically optimal}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{383}},
Pages = {{196-203}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{We evaluate the boundary of the Anthropocene geological time interval as
   an epoch, since it is useful to have a consistent temporal definition
   for this increasingly used unit, whether the presently informal term is
   eventually formalized or not. Of the three main levels suggested - an
   `early Anthropocene' level some thousands of years ago; the beginning of
   the Industrial Revolution at similar to 1800 CE (Common Era); and the
   `Great Acceleration' of the mid-twentieth century - current evidence
   suggests that the last of these has the most pronounced and globally
   synchronous signal. A boundary at this time need not have a Global
   Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP or `golden spike') but can
   be defined by a Global Standard Stratigraphic Age (GSSA), i.e. a point
   in time of the human calendar. We propose an appropriate boundary level
   here to be the time of the world's first nuclear bomb explosion, on July
   16th 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico; additional bombs were detonated at
   the average rate of one every 9.6 days until 1988 with attendant
   worldwide fallout easily identifiable in the chemostratigraphic record.
   Hence, Anthropocene deposits would be those that may include the
   globally distributed primary artificial radionuclide signal, while also
   being recognized using a wide range of other stratigraphic criteria.
   This suggestion for the Holocene-Anthropocene boundary may ultimately be
   superseded, as the Anthropocene is only in its early phases, but it
   should remain practical and effective for use by at least the current
   generation of scientists. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.}},

   transport in expanding plasmas}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{The electron thermal transport in fluid theory would be inaccurate when
   the collisionality is not enough, and the Fokker-Planck (FP) simulations
   are usually employed to resolve the inadequacies. In this paper, the
   one-dimensional Fokker-Planck code is extended to handle the cylindrical
   and spherical geometries in which the electron distribution functions
   are solved in the reference frame of the ion fluid. The FP code is
   validated in the fluid limit by comparing with fluid (MULTI)
   simulations. Then, the expansions of plasmas in different spatial
   geometries are simulated with the FP and fluid codes. As the main
   characters of nonlocal transport, the electron thermal transport
   inhibition and preheating are investigated in expanding plasmas. The
   spherical nonlocal theory can give the thermal transport inhibition and
   preheating phenomenon, which is exploited to fit the heat flux with
   variation of fitting parameter gamma. The spherical nonlocal theory will
   reproduce Spizer-Harm expression as gamma = 0. Then we analyze the heat
   flux after the plasma expanding 200 ps with a uniform initial
   temperature T = 100 eV and density n(e) = 1 x 10(21)/cm(3). By comparing
   the heat flux computed by spherical nonlocal thermal transport theory
   and FP simulation, it is found that (n - 1)/r term in Eq. (3a) cannot be
   neglected when the radius is small and the geometrical curvature effect
   will decrease the nonlocality of transport in outer expanding plasmas.
   The geometrical curvature effect leads to a smaller thermal transport
   inhibition and preheating in the expanding plasmas as comparing the
   spherical case with the planar one. The expansions of plasmas in
   different spatial geometries are also simulated with the FP and fluid
   codes under the initial conditions which are similar to the inertial
   confinement fusion. The same influence of geometrical curvature on
   nonlocal electron thermal transport are also obtained.}},

Abstract = {{A superhydrophobic/superoleophilic Cu(OH)(2)-thioled film was fabricated
   by a simple chemical vapor corrosion method with thiol modification. The
   resultant can be applied to separate oil/water mixtures. Peculiarly, in
   the separation process, oil selectively permeated from water first, and
   then the water spontaneously passed through later, which can collect oil
   and water step by step without external energy. This is the first report
   describing the phenomenon as we know. It provides a new point of view
   for both theoretical research and industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{We review the key building blocks of a design framework for modeling and
   optimizing biomedical systems under development in the Biological
   Systems Engineering Laboratory and the Centre for Process Systems
   Engineering at Imperial College. The framework features the following
   components: (i) in vitro environment, where model parameters can be
   obtained and new setups can be tested; (ii) in silica environment,
   including a simulation module for representing relevant physical or
   biological processes, and an optimization module, for calculating
   improved in vitro or in vivo outcomes; (iii) in vivo environment, from
   which organ and patient-specific parameters are collected and which can
   also implement personalized suggestions for improved outcomes. Two
   applications in the area of healthy and diseased blood are thoroughly
   discussed to exemplify the framework's characteristics. We discuss
   progress in the different areas and the way in which they are connected
   and finally propose a hybrid in vitro/in silico/in vivo platform. (C)

Title = {{Perceptions of similarity and response to selected comparison targets in

Pages = {{1206-1220}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Social comparisons (i.e. self-evaluations relative to others)
   may affect motivation for diabetes self-care behaviours. Comparisons can
   have either positive or negative effects, but it is not clear what
   differentiates these responses. This study tested the effect of a
   patient's perceived similarity to a comparison target on motivation for
   self-care.
   Design: Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n=180, M-A1c=7.59\%) selected
   to read one of four brief descriptions of a patient with diabetes.
   Main outcome measures: Participants rated their motivation for self-care
   behaviours prior and subsequent to reading and reported the extent to
   which they focused on similarities between the self and the selected
   patient while reading.
   Results: Perceived similarity moderated the effect of selection on
   motivation for self-care (p=.01, eta(2 )= .06). Increased motivation was
   observed if participants focused on similarities with patients `doing
   better' (i.e. high coping effectiveness/low symptom severity) and
   decreased motivation if they focused on similarities with patients
   `doing worse' (low coping effectiveness/high symptom severity).
   Conclusions: Providing social comparison information in diabetes
   management (and perhaps other chronic diseases) may improve motivation
   for self-care among some patients. A subset of patients, however, may
   benefit from guidance to focus on similarities with certain targets.}},

Abstract = {{Government agencies in cities across Asia recognise that municipalities
   must take steps to adapt to projected climate changes if people and
   places are to be kept above water. This paper focuses on planning for
   climate change in Bangkok because it ranks among the top 10 port cities
   vulnerable to climate change related flooding. It is also understood
   that the most devastating impacts of climate change will be suffered by
   the city's most vulnerable residents: the poor. Not only do impoverished
   people occupy physically vulnerable space, such as riverbanks, but they
   are also the least equipped to recover from the disruption of their
   livelihoods.Several scholars have identified institutional traps that
   prevent the Thai government from successfully aiding poor and
   marginalised flood victims in the past. These include poor coordination,
   lack of monitoring and evaluation, rigidity, crisis management and elite
   capture. Lebel, Manuta, and Garden (2011, 56) pose the crucial question:
   How have individuals - from local community leaders through to national
   level politicians and bureaucrats - successfully influenced policy and
   programmes to avoid institutional traps and improve adaptive capacities
   to climate change?In this paper, we begin to address this question
   through examining emergent methods of community based adaptation and
   reviewing case studies of adaptation action from other vulnerable
   communities in the Global South. These lessons - such as overcoming
   institutional rigidity and avoiding elite capture - are important for
   Bangkok and other cities in the Global South that face many different
   challenges by global environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{This article is a critique of the flawed logic Derrida employed in
   articulating his program of a Grammatology for deconstructing Western
   philosophy. I argue that Derrida in several instances built his
   arguments around what Kant called the paralogism. I look at an often
   cited case in order to substantiate my claim: Derrida's reading of
   Saussure, where his argument is based on a paralogism. Derrida
   misinterprets Saussure by seeing his alleged rejection of graphical
   writing as a rejection of his own idiosyncratic notion of writing (alias
   differance, trace, generalized writing, etc.), which only corresponds to
   Saussure's own notion of linguistic value, produced in a system of
   differences without positive terms.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted to estimate the amount of Cr, Mn, and Ni
   deposited in the respiratory system of 44 welders in two facilities.
   Each worker wore a nanoparticle respiratory deposition (NRD) sampler
   during gas metal arc welding (GMAW) of mild and stainless steel and
   flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) of mild steel. Several welders also wore
   side-by-side NRD samplers and closed-face filter cassettes for total
   particulate samples. The NRD sampler estimates the aerosol's
   nano-fraction deposited in the respiratory system. Mn concentrations for
   both welding processes ranged 2.8-199 mu g/m(3); Ni concentrations
   ranged 10-51 mu g/m(3); and Cr concentrations ranged 40-105 mu g/m(3).
   Cr(VI) concentrations ranged between 0.5-1.3 mu g/m(3). For the FCAW
   process the largest concentrations were reported for welders working in
   pairs. As a consequence this often resulted in workers being exposed to
   their own welding fumes and to those generated from the welding partner.
   Overall no correlation was found between air velocity and exposure (R-2
   = 0.002). The estimated percentage of the nano-fraction of Mn deposited
   in a mild-steel-welder's respiratory system ranged between 10 and 56\%.
   For stainless steel welding, the NRD samplers collected 59\% of the
   total Mn, 90\% of the total Cr, and 64\% of the total Ni. These results
   indicate that most of the Cr and more than half of the Ni and Mn in the
   fumes were in the fraction smaller than 300nm.}},

Abstract = {{Two risk assessment protocols were adopted to assess the risks posed by
   alien plants that naturalized or non-naturalized in the agro-pastoral
   ecotone of northern China (AGENC). In this study the Risk Assessment for
   Central Europe method revealed that more than two-thirds of the 19
   naturalized and four-fifths of the 17 non-naturalized alien plants
   presented high or moderate risk, and all 36 alien plants were considered
   to be rejected for their potential agricultural and environmental risks
   under the Australian Weed Risk Assessment system. On the characteristics
   of plant invasions, more attention should be given to disturbed habitats
   rather than these relative natural or closed ecosystems, and also be
   prudent and careful of the alien plants that are introduced as useful
   plants from North or South America and unintentional introduction from
   Europe. Moreover, annuals needed special attention: three-quarters of
   the alien plants were annual species, only a few were biennial (8.3\%),
   perennial (11.1\%), liana and tree plants (2.8\%). Plant invasions are
   not extremely serious in the AGENC, but there are several alien plants
   that have naturalized and spread themselves in the region. However,
   attention should be given in the future to predicting and preventing
   plant invasions in this fragile region.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among people
   living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa. In PLHIV,
   Smear-Negative Pulmonary Tuberculosis (SNPTB) and Extrapulmonary
   Tuberculosis (EPTB) are predominant. Presumptive anti-tuberculosis
   (anti-TB) treatment is often delayed leading to a high mortality
   rate.Objectives: To investigate the clinical outcomes of presumptive
   anti-TB treatment in HIV patients suspected of having TB and to
   determine the factors associated with patients' death.Methods: We
   conducted a retrospective descriptive study from 1 January 2007 to 31
   December 2008 in the Department of Internal Medicine of the Hospital
   Yalgado Ouedraogo on patients infected with HIV who received a
   presumptive anti-TB treatment. Defining patients with SNPTB or EPTB was
   based on the 2007 WHO's diagnostic algorithm of SNPTB and EPTB.Results:
   One hundred and sixteen patients of the 383 (30.2\%) HIV patients
   hospitalized in this period were suspected of having TB. The average CD4
   count was 86.1cells/mu l (SD=42.3). A SNPTB was diagnosed in 67 patients
   (57.8\%) and a EPTB in 49 patients (42.2\%). The median length of
   hospitalization duration was 23.5 days. The average time of initiation
   of anti-TB treatment after admission was 22 days (SD=9.2 days).
   Evolution during the hospital stay was favorable for 65 patients
   (56.0\%), unfavorable for 48 patients (41.4\% or 12.5\% of all
   hospitalized patients), and 3 patients (2.6\%) were treatment
   defaulters. In a multivariate analysis, hospitalization duration longer
   than 15 days and a delay of anti-TB treatment initiation of more than 30
   days are independent factors associated with patients'
   deaths.Conclusion: An urgent access to TB-diagnostic tools and a
   revision of the International algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment
   of SNPTB and EPTB in the context of HIV could help to reduce the delay
   of anti-TB treatment initiation and the mortality rate of PLHIV in
   sub-Saharan Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Absorption chillers are a potential technology for using solar energy or
   waste heat for cooling and air-conditioning purposes. State-of-the-art
   working pairs require elaborate system designs and an appropriate
   material selection to deal with such problems as formation of
   non-condensable gases, corrosion, and crystallization. The investigation
   of alternative working pairs is one important possibility to reduce or
   avoid such problems. A new approach is to use linear- or hyper-branched
   polymers in combination with water as a working pair. A selected polymer
   used in this work has the capability to absorb water at suitable vapor
   pressure levels. Furthermore, the new working pair is expected to
   potentially diminish the problems of corrosion, formation of
   non-condensable gases, and damage of the machine due to crystallization
   and to relax at least the pricing situation. On the other hand, the high
   viscosity and the low heat conductivity compared to conventional working
   pairs are crucial for its application. To prove the feasibility of the
   polymeric-based working pair, experiments have been carried out in a
   lab-scale single-stage absorption chiller. The lab-scale chiller used
   falling-film heat exchangers and had a cooling capacity between 60 and
   100W. It is shown that under equal operating conditions, the new working
   pair is able to reach about one-third of the cooling power compared to
   lithium bromide/water at vaporizer temperatures suitable for cooling
   ceilings applications. If used as a drop-in replacement, the cooling
   power of the new working pair does not reach the performance of lithium
   bromide/water. Nevertheless, the usage in adapted machines for specific
   applications should be discussed in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Background: As swimming and surfing are prone dominant sports, it would
   be more sport specific to assess shoulder active range of motion in this
   position. Objectives: To determine the reliability of the inclinometer
   and HALO (c) for assessing shoulder active range of motion in supine and
   prone and the concurrent validity of the HALO (c). Concurrent validity
   is based on the comparison of the HALO (c) and inclinometer. To
   determine if active range of motion (AROM) differences exists between
   prone and supine when assessing shoulder internal (IR) and external
   rotation (ER). Design: The design included clinical measurement,
   reliability and validity. Methods: Thirty shoulders (mean age=26.8
   years) without pathology were evaluated. Measurements were taken in
   supine and prone with both an inclinometer and HALO (c) device. Results:
   Active ER ROM in prone was significantly higher than in supine when
   using both devices. Intra-rater reliability (within and between session)
   intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values ranged between 0.82-0.99
   for both devices in supine and prone. An ICC test revealed a significant
   (p<0.01) correlation for both devices in IR and ER movements
   (ICC3,1=0.87 and ICC3,1=0.72), respectively. Conclusion: This study has
   shown prone assessment of active ER and IR ROM to be a reliable and
   appropriate method for prone dominant athletes (swimmers and surfers).
   In this study greater ER ROM was achieved in prone compared to supine.
   This finding highlights the importance of standardizing the test
   position for initial and follow up assessments. Furthermore the HALO (c)
   and inclinometer have been shown to be reliable tools that show good
   concurrent validity.}},

Abstract = {{Many adults that are severely mentally ill or intellectually or

   discuss existing disconnects between basic human rights and issues
   regarding safety when clients are in service with a supported living
   agency. Ethical dilemmas abound when an individual makes assumptions and
   decisions regarding the lives of another, so where that line is or
   should be drawn can be a difficult one to conceptualize. This article
   will illustrate how acting as a client-centered agency may often go
   against the perceived ``good{''} of the client, and who ultimately has
   the right to determine quality-of-life issues within the theoretical

Abstract = {{Children's computer use is rapidly growing, together with reports of
   related musculoskeletal outcomes. Models and theories of adult-related
   risk factors demonstrate multivariate risk factors associated with
   computer use. Children's use of computers is different from adult's
   computer use at work. This study developed and tested a child-specific
   model demonstrating multivariate relationships between musculoskeletal
   outcomes, computer exposure and child factors. Using pathway modelling,
   factors such as gender, age, television exposure, computer anxiety,
   sustained attention (flow), socio-economic status and somatic complaints
   (headache and stomach pain) were found to have effects on children's
   reports of musculoskeletal symptoms. The potential for children's
   computer exposure to follow a dose-response relationship was also
   evident. Developing a child-related model can assist in understanding
   risk factors for children's computer use and support the development of
   recommendations to encourage children to use this valuable resource in
   educational, recreational and communication environments in a safe and
   productive manner.Practitioner Summary: Computer use is an important
   part of children's school and home life. Application of this developed
   model, that encapsulates related risk factors, enables practitioners,

   densification and deformation characteristics of the sintered plain
   carbon steel (Fe-0.5\%C) processed through the powder metallurgy using
   Taguchi-grey relational analysis. Atomized iron powders (Fe) of size 100
   mu m and graphite (C) were accurately weighed on the basis of weight and
   homogeneously blended in an indigenously fabricated pot mill. Compacts
   of various aspect ratios (ARs), viz., 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.3, were
   made using a suitable cylindrical die and punch set up on a 1000 kN
   computer interfaced universal testing machine. The green compacts were
   then sintered in a nitrogen purged muffle furnace. The sintered preforms
   of various ARs of the plain carbon steel were subjected to cold upset
   forging to study their deformation and densification properties.
   Taguchi-grey optimization technique was then applied to optimize the
   parameters such as AR and load for maximum deformation and density. The
   preforms of higher AR are found to be the better for higher axial,

Abstract = {{Coronary artery disease is responsible for almost 30\% of all deaths
   worldwide. The saphenous vein and umbilical vein (UV) are the most
   common veins using for treatment as a coronary artery bypass graft
   (CABG). The mechanical properties of UV belonging to its long-term
   patency for CABG are very important. However, there is a lack of
   knowledge on the linear elastic and nonlinear hyperelastic mechanical
   properties of the UV. In this study, three stress definitions (second
   Piola-Kichhoff stress, engineering stress and true stress) and four
   strain definitions (Almansi-Hamel strain, Green-St Venant strain,
   engineering strain and true strain) are used to determine the elastic
   modulus, maximum stress and strain of eight human UVs under
   circumferential loading. The nonlinear mechanical behaviour of the UV is
   computationally investigated using Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic model. A
   numerical finite element analysis is also carried out to simulate the
   constitutive modelling versus its numerical results. The results show
   that the Almansi-Hamel strain definition overestimates the elastic
   modulus while Green-St Venant strain definition underestimates the
   elastic modulus at different stress definitions. The true stress-true
   strain definition, which gives more accurate measurements of the
   tissue's response using the instantaneous values, reveals the Young's
   modulus and maximum stress of 2.18 and 6.01MPa, respectively. The
   Mooney-Rivlin material model is well represented by the nonlinear
   mechanical behaviour of the UV. The findings of this study could have
   implications not only for understanding the extension and rupture
   mechanism of UV but also for interventions and surgeries, including
   balloon angioplasty, bypass and stenting.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether rater agreement is randomly distributed
   or varies importantly with test-taker characteristics, test words, or
   rater experience with the dichotic words test (DWT). Design: DWT was
   administered to 34 children in 1st-4th grade and responses scored by two
   raters. The proportion of rater agreement was calculated for each child
   and for each word. Correlates of inter-rater agreement were explored.
   Study sample: Two raters judged 6686 total responses from 34 children.
   Results: Overall agreement between the two raters was 0.97. Test-taker
   scores ranged from 35\%-91\% (mean = 81\%). Agreement was associated
   with score but not with test-taker age or sex. Test words spanned the
   full range of difficulty (pass proportion 0.06-1.00). Rater agreement
   was not randomly distributed among the words. Inter-rater agreement for
   test words ranged from 0.82-1.00 and was associated with pass proportion
   (Spearman's = 0.28; p < 0.0001). However, there were words at all pass
   proportions with perfect or near-perfect agreement. Rater agreement
   improved from 0.94 on the first day of data collection to 0.98 on the
   fifth day (p = 0.026). Conclusions: Inter-rater reliability should be
   considered along with test item difficulty when developing speech
   audiometry materials, scoring protocols, and rater training.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on smoothed functional canonical correlation analysis
   (SFCCA) to investigate the relationships and changes in large, seasonal
   and long-term data sets. The aim of this study is to introduce a
   guideline for SFCCA for functional data and to give some insights on the
   fine tuning of the methodology for long-term periodical data. The
   guidelines are applied on temperature and humidity data for 11 years
   between 2000 and 2010 and the results are interpreted. Seasonal changes
   or periodical shifts are visually studied by yearly comparisons. The
   effects of the number of basis functions' and the selection of smoothing
   parameter' on the general variability structure and on correlations
   between the curves are examined. It is concluded that the number of time
   points (knots), number of basis functions and the time span of
   evaluation (monthly, daily, etc.) should all be chosen harmoniously. It
   is found that changing the smoothing parameter does not have a
   significant effect on the structure of curves and correlations. The
   number of basis functions is found to be the main effector on both
   individual and correlation weight functions.}},

   10.25 mM CaCl2 and a W:TF of 7.8:1, while other variables were fixed at
   5 mM citric acid, 60 min incubation, pH 11, and centrifugal speed of
   8,000 x g. At these conditions, the great reduction of lipids (93.9\%),
   Hg (97.6\%), and As (95.5\%), as well as 86.1\% of protein recovery,

   Victoria, Australia}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this article was to explore trends in
   licensing among babyboomer older drivers in the state of Victoria,
   Australia. The study aims were to (1) compare the car licensing trends
   of the babyboomer cohort to that of previous birth cohorts and (2)
   predict the number of babyboomers licensed to drive a car in 2021 when
   the babyboomer cohort reaches an average age of 65years.Methods: The
   residential population of Victoria, Australia, for 2001-2013 was
   obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics; car licensing
   statistics were obtained from VicRoads. Birth cohorts from 1916 to 1975
   were defined in 10-year birth-year intervals. Population size was
   modeled using logistic regression. License prevalence was modeled using
   a logit model.Results: The babyboomer cohort (1946-1965) in Victoria is
   1.7times larger than the cohort before them. At age 60years, license
   prevalence among babyboomers was higher than in previous cohorts: 88\%
   in the 1936-1945 cohort vs. 96\% in the 1946-1955 cohort. When the
   babyboomers reach 65years (average) in 2021, we estimate there to be
   over twice as many license holders among them than in the preceding
   cohort (n = 1,300,094vs. 630,830, respectively).Conclusions: Aging of
   the babyboomer cohort will have a greater impact on the driving
   population than on the general population, due to the multiplicative
   effect of cohort size and license prevalence. The impact of road user
   aging on burden of injury can be minimized by focusing prevention at
   crashes typical to older drivers, such as intersection crashes, and
   promoting car safety features among older drivers.}},

Abstract = {{This article's objective is twofold: First, to provide a framework for
   understanding the role of external information sources in service
   innovation, with particular attention to innovation in public

   proposed framework. Method of analysis is based on data at European
   level from the 2010 Innobarometer Survey on Public Innovation. Data is
   used for estimating a bivariate probit with sample selection, where the
   selection variable indicates whether or not organisations have recently
   implemented service innovations and the estimated variable indicates
   whether organisations have introduced services that are new to the whole
   public sector. Results indicate a significant relation between the use
   of both internal and external sources of information and the
   implementation of innovations by public organisations. External sources
   are shown to be more relevant for the implementation of services that
   are new to the public sector.}},

Abstract = {{For forestry sector in transition economies organizational or corporate
   culture can be a key link in restructuring processes and business
   improvements of forest companies. A considerable amount of research
   about corporate culture influence on firm's efficiency in various
   sectors has been conducted, but no one has explored the impact of
   cultural and managerial components on the development of organizational
   structure of forest company and improvement of its organizational
   efficiency. This paper addresses this dearth of research by examining
   forestry employee's attitudes, using Competing Value Framework and
   associated models. The goal is to evaluate forestry firm's
   organizational culture, investigate the relationship between culture
   characteristics and diverse measures of company units' efficiency (a
   separate structural and production units). The findings should be used
   as a potential mediator for the firms restructuring process and business
   improvement. Results of research, conducted in Croatian forestry sector
   context, provide evidence that developed approach, i.e. examining and
   identifying corporate culture, can be used for performance improvements.
   Results suggest that unbalanced focus of the existing firm culture, with
   formally directive management style and the lack of reward system,
   results with a strong resistance to essential improvements in forest
   company performance. In the discussion this is displayed and argued
   through a holistic approach to develop (upgrade) forest company
   (structural, business, and cultural) efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of pollutants with
   multiple variants classified as carcinogenic. The Occupational Safety
   and Health Administration (OSHA) provided access to two PAH exposure
   databanks of United States workplace compliance testing data collected
   between 1979 and 2010. Mixed-effects logistic models were used to
   predict the exceedance fraction (EF), i.e., the probability of exceeding
   OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL = 0.2mg/m(3)) for PAHs based on
   industry and occupation. Measurements of coal tar pitch volatiles were
   used as a surrogate for PAHs. Time, databank, occupation, and industry
   were included as fixed-effects while an identifier for the compliance
   inspection number was included as a random effect. Analyses involved
   2,509 full-shift personal measurements. Results showed that the majority
   of industries had an estimated EF < 0.5, although several industries,
   including Standardized Industry Classification codes 1623 (Water, Sewer,
   Pipeline, and Communication and Powerline Construction), 1711 (Plumbing,
   Heating, and Air-Conditioning), 2824 (Manmade Organic Fibres), 3496
   (Misc. Fabricated Wire products), and 5812 (Eating Places), and Major
   group's 13 (Oil and Gas Extraction) and 30 (Rubber and Miscellaneous
   Plastic Products), were estimated to have more than an 80\% likelihood
   of exceeding the PEL. There was an inverse temporal trend of exceeding
   the PEL, with lower risk in most recent years, albeit not statistically
   significant. Similar results were shown when incorporating occupation,
   but varied depending on the occupation as the majority of industries
   predicted at the administrative level, e.g., managers, had an estimated
   EF < 0.5 while at the minimally skilled/laborer level there was a
   substantial increase in the estimated EF. These statistical models allow
   the prediction of PAH exposure risk through individual occupational
   histories and will be used to create a job-exposure matrix for use in a
   population-based case-control study exploring PAH exposure and breast
   cancer risk.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorogenic benzothiazole-based receptor has been easily immobilised

   exhibited a high affinity and selectivity for Hg2+ over other competing
   metal ions. Therefore, the TLC-1 holds promise as a portable sensor for

Abstract = {{Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) are at risk for undernutrition.
   Dietary counseling during treatment has positive effects on nutritional
   status and quality of life, however, the effects of dietary counseling
   started before initiation of treatment are currently unknown. Therefore
   we assessed the effect of early individualized dietary counseling (DC)
   on weight loss, major complications, and length of hospital stay (LOS)
   in patients with HNC. Ninety-five newly diagnosed HNC patients with
   (risk of) undernutrition receiving DC were compared to 95 matched HNC
   patients receiving usual nutritional care (UC). Difference in weight
   change over time was analyzed by generalized estimating equations (GEE).
   Differences in complications and LOS were studied by Pearson chi-squared
   and student's t-tests. Weight change between diagnosis and end of
   treatment was -6.0 +/- 6.9\% (DC) and -5.4 +/- 5.7\% (UC; GEE: -0.4kg,
   95\% confidence interval: -1.2 to 0.5; P = 0.44). Less DC patients
   experienced overall postoperative complications (44\%/70\%, P = 0.04).
   No effect on major postoperative or (chemo)radiotherapy complications or
   LOS was found. This study showed a lower prevalence of overall
   postoperative complications in HNC patients receiving DC but could not
   demonstrate an effect on weight loss, other complications, and LOS.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study explores men with advanced prostate cancers' own
   practices for promoting and maintaining emotional well-being using
   Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.
   Design: Five men with advanced prostate cancer participated in
   face-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews.
   Results: Within rich narratives of lost and regained well-being, two
   super-ordinate themes emerged - `living with an imminent and uncertain
   death' and `holding on to life.' Well-being was threatened by reduced
   sense of the future, isolation and uncertainty. Yet, the men pursued
   well-being by managing their emotions, striving for the future whilst
   enjoying life in the present, taking care of their families and
   renegotiating purpose. Running through participant's accounts was a
   preference for taking action and problem-solving. Sense of purpose,
   social connectedness, and life engagement were revealed as concepts
   central to improving well-being, indicating areas which practitioners
   could explore with men to help them re-establish personal goals and life
   purpose.
   Conclusions: The findings also add weight to the evidence base for the
   potential value of psychological interventions such as cognitive
   behaviour therapy and mindfulness in men with prostate cancer.}},

Abstract = {{During translation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize the identities
   of the tRNAs to charge them with their respective amino acids. The
   conserved identities of 58,244 eukaryotic tRNAs of 24 invertebrates and
   45 vertebrates in genomic tRNA database were analyzed and their novel
   features extracted. The internal promoter sequences, namely, A-Box and
   B-Box, were investigated and evidence gathered that the intervention of
   optional nucleotides at 17a and 17b correlated with the optimal length
   of the A-Box. The presence of canonical transcription terminator
   sequences at the immediate vicinity of tRNA genes was ventured. Even
   though non-canonical introns had been reported in red alga, green alga,
   and nucleomorph so far, fairly motivating evidence of their existence
   emerged in tRNA genes of other eukaryotes. Non-canonical introns were
   seen to interfere with the internal promoters in two cases, questioning
   their transcription fidelity. In a first of its kind, phylogenetic
   constructs based on tRNA molecules delineated and built the trees of the
   vast and diverse invertebrates and vertebrates. Finally, two tRNA models
   representing the invertebrates and the vertebrates were drawn, by
   isolating the dominant consensus in the positional fluctuations of
   nucleotide compositions.}},

Abstract = {{In an era of population ageing, the primary home is increasingly viewed

   This article assesses the extent to which Australians aged 45 years and
   over withdraw housing equity through in situ mortgage equity withdrawal
   (MEW), downsizing and selling up. We find that the incidence of housing
   equity withdrawal has increased over the last decade despite a global
   financial crisis. MEW is the dominant form of equity release among those
   under pension age, while downsizing or selling up is more frequent among
   those above pension age. Downsizing and selling up are more likely to be
   prompted by adverse life events than MEW. Selling up is typically an
   option of last resort. Our findings offer insights into important
   debates around homeownership societies and the welfare role performed by
   owner-occupied housing in mid-to-late life.}},

Abstract = {{Many believe that humans can `perceive unconsciously' - that for weak
   stimuli, briefly presented and masked, above-chance discrimination is
   possible without awareness. Interestingly, an online survey reveals that
   most experts in the field recognize the lack of convincing evidence for
   this phenomenon, and yet they persist in this belief. Using a recently
   developed bias-free experimental procedure for measuring subjective
   introspection (confidence), we found no evidence for unconscious
   perception; participants' behavior matched that of a Bayesian ideal
   observer, even though the stimuli were visually masked. This surprising
   finding suggests that the thresholds for subjective awareness and
   objective discrimination are effectively the same: if objective task
   performance is above chance, there is likely conscious experience. These
   findings shed new light on decades-old methodological issues regarding
   what it takes to consider a neurobiological or behavioral effect to be
   `unconscious,' and provide a platform for rigorously investigating
   unconscious perception in future studies.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Accurate atmospheric correction is an important preprocessing step for
   studies of multi-temporal land-cover mapping using optical satellite
   data. Model-based surface reflectance predictions (e.g. 6S - Second
   Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) are highly
   dependent on the adjustment of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data. For
   regions with no or insufficient spatial and temporal coverage of
   meteorological ground measurements, Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived AOT data are a valuable alternative,
   especially with regard to the dynamics of atmospheric conditions. In
   this study, atmospheric correction strategies were assessed based on the
   change in standard deviation (sigma) compared to the raw data and also
   by machine learning land-cover classification accuracies. For three
   Landsat 8 OLI (acquired in 2013) and two RapidEye (acquired in 2010 and
   2014) scenes, seven different correction strategies were tested over an
   agricultural area in southeast Ireland. Visibility calculated from daily
   spatial averaged TERRA-MODIS estimates (1 degrees x 1 degrees Aerosol
   Product) served as input for the atmospheric correction. In almost all
   cases the standard deviation of the raw data is reduced after
   incorporation of terrain correction, compared to the
   atmospheric-corrected data. ATCOR (R)-IDL-based correction decreases the
   standard deviation almost consistently (ranging from -0.3 to -26.7). The
   6S implementation in GRASS GIS showed a tendency of increasing the
   variation in the data, especially for the RapidEye data. No major
   differences in overall accuracies (OAs) and kappa values were observed
   between the three machine learning classification approaches. The
   results indicate that the ATCOR (R)-IDL-based correction and MODIS
   parameterization methods are able to decrease the standard deviation and
   are therefore an appropriate approach to approximate the top-of-canopy
   reflectance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer
   in children and L-asparaginase is an essential component of the
   treatment. Cessation of L-asparaginase decreases event free survival.
   Acute pancreatitis is the toxicity that most commonly results in
   cessation of L-asparaginase. We tested whether serial ultrasound
   examinations could predict asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP).
   Methods: Children (aged 1.0-17.9years) with childhood ALL treated at the
   University Hospital Rigshopitalet, Copenhagen, according to the standard
   or intermediate risk arms of the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol, with
   PEG-asparaginase of 2 or 6 week intervals, for 30 weeks had their
   pancreas monitored using serial ultrasound in order to detect early
   signs of inflammation. Results: Nineteen of 31 eligible patients were
   included. Three of the included patients developed AAP. None of the
   patients, including the three patients that developed AAP, had signs of
   inflammatory edema or pancreas enzymes above three times the upper
   normal limit prior to AAP. Conclusion: We found no signs of inflammatory
   edema within the pancreas on ultrasound during treatment with
   PEG-asparginase in our cohort prior to development of AAP or in patients
   that did not develop AAP.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has established that student learning is influenced by
   how accurately teachers perceive student academic ability. But studies
   rarely investigate the degree to which inaccuracies in teacher
   perceptions exacerbate demographic inequality in academic ability. Using
   a sample of almost 14,000 children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal
   Study, Kindergarten Cohort, we found that children whose literacy skills
   are overestimated by their teachers typically gain more literacy skills
   during kindergarten. Conversely, children whose skills are
   underestimated learn less. It is important to note that the skills of
   socioeconomically disadvantaged children are on average underestimated.
   As a result, inequalities in kindergarten literacy development stem in
   part from the links between teacher misperceptions and student
   background. We also explored the extent to which these relationships
   operate through practices associated with ability grouping. We found
   instructional grouping to be a weak facilitator of the link between
   teacher perceptions and student learning, suggesting the need for
   further research that identifies the social and structural classroom
   characteristics that link teacher perceptual accuracy to student
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces a new approach for enhancing immunity toward
   mucosal vaccines. HEV71 killed vaccine that is formulated with nanosize
   calcium phosphate adjuvant and encapsulated onto chitosan and alginate
   delivery carriers was examined for eliciting antibody responses in serum
   and saliva collected at weeks 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 for viral-specific IgA
   \& IgG levels and viral neutralizing antibody titers. The antibody
   responses induced in rabbits by the different formulations delivered by
   a single (buccal) route were compared to those of dual immunization
   (intradermal/mucosal) and un-immunized control. Chitosan-loaded vaccine
   adjuvant induced elevated IgA antibody, while Alginate-adjuvant
   irreversible bonding sequestered the vaccine and markedly reduced
   immunogenicity. The induced mucosal and parenteral antibody profiles
   appeared in an inverse manner of enhanced mucosal IgA antibody
   accompanied by lower systemic IgG following a single oral immunization
   route. The combined intradermal and oral dual-immunized group developed
   an elevated salivary IgA, systemic IgG, and virus neutralizing response.
   A reduced salivary neutralizing antibody titer was observed and
   attributed to the continual secretion exchanges in saliva. Designing a
   successful mucosal delivery formulation needs to take into account the
   vaccine delivery site, dosage, adjuvant and carrier particle size,
   charge, and the reversibility of component interactions. The dual
   immunization seems superior and is a important approach for modulating
   the antibody response and boosting mucosal protection against HEV71 and
   similar pathogens based on their transmission mode, tissue tropism and
   shedding sites. Finally, the study has highlighted the significant role
   of dual immunization for simultaneous inducing and modulating the
   systemic and mucosal immune responses to EV71.}},

Abstract = {{Survivors of childhood cancer frequently suffer from endocrine late
   effects, which are, at least partly, attributed to toxic effects of
   chemotherapy. Treatment of retinoblastoma typically involves
   chemotherapy at a very young age. The authors conducted a
   cross-sectional study to assess bone health in a pediatric cohort of 33
   survivors of retinoblastoma (mean age: 4.4years) who had undergone
   chemotherapy treatment at an especially young age (mean age: 0.76years).
   Of these patients, 14 had unilateral and 19 bilateral retinoblastoma.
   Polychemotherapy consisted of treatment with cyclophosphamide,
   etoposide, vincristine, and carboplatin. Ten patients had undergone
   external beam radiotherapy. Clinical and biochemical parameters of
   growth, pubertal development, and bone health were obtained. A vitamin D
   deficiency was found in 51.7\% of the patients, and 13.7\% of patients
   displayed severe vitamin D deficiency. Secondary hyperparathyroidism and
   altered readings for bone formation or resorption markers were present
   in 15\%. Nine percent reported bone pain or experienced fractures of the
   long bones after primary diagnosis. No difference between children with
   bilateral and unilateral disease or irradiated versus nonirradiated
   children was observed. The parameters of thyroid function, growth, and
   pubertal development were within age-appropriate norms in almost all
   children. In conclusion, altered parameters of bone health can be
   present in survivors of retinoblastoma at a young age and warrant
   regular follow-up in these children. The endocrine
   hypothalamic-pituitary axes, however, were not impaired at this early
   age in this group of survivors of retinoblastoma.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to advance knowledge of how to measure gist and
   verbatim understanding of risk magnitude information and to apply this
   knowledge to address whether graphics that focus on the number of people
   affected (the numerator of the risk ratio, i.e., the foreground) are
   effective displays for increasing (a) understanding of absolute and
   relative risk magnitudes and (b) risk avoidance. In 2 experiments, the
   authors examined the effects of a graphical display that used icons to
   represent the foreground information on measures of understanding
   (Experiments 1 and 2) and on perceived risk, affect, and risk aversion
   (Experiment 2). Consistent with prior findings, this foreground-only
   graphical display increased perceived risk and risk aversion; however,
   it also led to decreased understanding of absolute (although not
   relative) risk magnitudes. Methodologically, this work shows the
   importance of distinguishing understanding of absolute risk from
   understanding of relative risk magnitudes, and the need to assess gist
   knowledge of both types of risk. Substantively, this work shows that
   although using foreground-only graphical displays is an appealing risk
   communication strategy to increase risk aversion, doing so comes at the
   cost of decreased understanding of absolute risk magnitudes.}},

Abstract = {{The managerial approach of Kaizen is used by different organisations
   around the world in order to improve the performance of their work
   processes and operations. Both the Total Quality Management literature
   and Kaizen have shown different efforts to illustrate the application of
   this approach in the traditional classroom-style business education.
   Also, business schools have a clear need for showing consistency between
   what is being taught in the classroom and what is being done in the
   day-to-day operations of the organisation. The purpose of this article
   is to describe the systematic application of Kaizen and its learned
   lessons during the last three years in the Operations Management (OM)
   course from the Master in Business Administration graduate programme
   taught at the Mexican Business School. An exploratory qualitative study
   was conducted. This research project provides empirical evidence of how
   Kaizen's continuous improvement cycle (PDCA) enables better results in
   students who have taken the subject of OM in a business school. The
   findings in each phase of the cycle show the Kaizen-oriented improvement
   actions and the results obtained in final grades (exam) and written
   reports. Finally, the study contributes to the limited existing
   literature on Kaizen in education and subsequently disseminates this
   information in order to provide impetus, guidance and support towards
   improvement in the quality of teaching in a business school.}},

Abstract = {{Heat-treated (120 degrees C for 120min) rice flour showed high affinity

   by shaking the heat-treated rice flour (2.0g), oil (4.0mL), and water
   (20mL) vigorously in a test tube, and the oil bound to the rice flour
   sank into the water. To examine the time-dependent levels of the
   oil-binding ability, rice flour was heat-treated at 120 degrees C for
   10, 20, 40, 60, and 120min, and the precipitated volume of oil/rice
   flour complex increased with an increase of the heating time. The
   oil-binding ability of the rice flour was not affected by the treatments
   with diethyl ether or boiled chloroform/methanol (2:1) solutions, which
   suggested no relationship to the oil in the rice flour, but was lost
   upon alkali (0.2\% NaOH solution) or pepsin treatment, which suggested
   its relationship to the rice proteins.}},

Abstract = {{When the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
   (PEPFAR)-supported Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) programme began
   working in Ethiopia in 2006, the estimated population of people living
   with HIV exceeded one million, while only 24,000 were on treatment and
   only 50 treatment sites were in operation. SCMS and other key partners
   entered into this context to support the Ethiopian government in
   significantly strengthening the public health supply chain system, with
   the aim of increasing the availability and accessibility of
   pharmaceutical products. The country now has 1,047 treatment sites and
   is nearing complete treatment coverage. This article discusses how
   priorities were set among many competing challenges from 2006 until
   2014, and how the four-step strategy of build, operate, transfer, and
   optimise has resulted in a successful partnership. Lorsque le programme
   Supply Chain Management System (SCMS Systeme de gestion des chaines
   d'approvisionnement) soutenu par l'Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
   (PEPFAR Plan d'urgence pour l'aide a la lutte contre le sida) du
   president des Etats-Unis a commence a operer en Ethiopie en 2006, la
   population estimee de personnes seropositives depassait un million. Or,
   seulement 24 000 suivaient un traitement et on comptait seulement 50
   sites de traitement operationnels. Le SCMS et d'autres partenaires cles
   sont entres dans ce contexte pour aider le gouvernement ethiopien a
   renforcer considerablement le systeme de chaine d'approvisionnement en
   matiere de sante publique, dans le but d'accroitre la disponibilite et
   l'accessibilite des produits pharmaceutiques. Le pays compte maintenant
   1,047 sites de traitement et approche d'une couverture de traitement
   presque complete. Cet article traite de la maniere dont les priorites
   ont ete etablies dans un contexte de nombreux defis concurrents de 2006
   a 2014, et du fait que la strategie en quatre etapes consistant a
   construire, operer, transferer et optimiser a abouti a un partenariat
   reussi. Cuando en Etiopia empezo a funcionar el Sistema para la
   Administracion de la Cadena de Suministro (scms) impulsado por el Plan
   Presidencial de EE.UU. de Emergencia para el Alivio del sida (pepfar por
   sus siglas en ingles) en 2006, la poblacion de seropositivos excedia el
   millon de personas. Sin embargo, solo 24 mil de estas recibian
   tratamiento y unicamente funcionaban 50 centros de tratamiento. El scms
   y otros importantes socios ingresaron a este contexto con la intencion
   de coadyuvar a que el gobierno etiope fortaleciera significativamente el
   sistema de la cadena de suministro de la salud publica, orientado a
   elevar la disponibilidad y el acceso a productos farmaceuticos. Ahora el
   pais cuenta con 1,047 centros de tratamiento, acercandose a alcanzar una
   cobertura de tratamiento del 100\%. El presente articulo analiza como se
   establecieron las prioridades en un contexto de multiples retos en

Abstract = {{With this paper, we contribute to the complex field of assessment of
   student learning in work placements. The complexity includes the dual
   role of clinical educators as mentors and assessors, students as
   pre-accredited practitioners and the diverse purposes of assessment. A
   philosophical hermeneutic approach was adopted to explore the
   perceptions and practices of clinical assessments as they were
   experienced by clinical educators and students of the Bachelor of
   Physiotherapy programme of the Claudiana College of Health Professions
   at Bozen, Italy. Philosophical hermeneutics is grounded in dialogues
   where dialogue partners explore each others' statements or experiences,
   question assumptions that underpin experiences and perceptions and
   search for shared understanding. Focus group questions invited
   participants to share their experiences and engage in a dialogue with
   other participants. The research team engaged in cycles of interpretive
   dialogues according to the hermeneutic tradition. Data interpretation
   was guided by interpretive questions such as: what does the transcript
   say about assessment? Each target group was analysed separately before
   comparing them. Findings highlight that the relational and emotional
   dimensions of assessment experiences were key issues for both target
   groups. Finally, conclusions are drawn from our findings in form of
   recommendations for placement assessment practices as well as for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Disclosure, or degree of outness has been recognized as an important
   measurement in lesbian and gay populations to provide better
   understanding of various health issues associated with disclosure. In
   2008, A Lesbian Identity Disclosure Assessment (ALIDA) was created to
   quantify the daily degree of disclosure. Reliability for the instrument
   was adequate for both lesbians with and without children. It was
   recognized, through statistical analysis, that the instrument may be
   lacking an important concept that, when included, may raise the
   instrument's reliability. Hence, the concept of general public
   disclosure was added to ALIDA-II, and the instrument was tested in a new
   study. Reliability for lesbians with and without children increased to

Title = {{Memristors: Memory elements in potato tubers}},
Journal = {{PLANT SIGNALING \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{A memristor is a nonlinear element because its current-voltage
   characteristic is similar to that of a Lissajous pattern for nonlinear
   systems. This element was postulated recently and researchers are
   looking for it in different biosystems. We investigated electrical
   circuitry of red Irish potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L.). The goal
   was to discover if potato tubers might have a new electrical component -
   a resistor with memory. The analysis was based on a cyclic
   current-voltage characteristic where the resistor with memory should
   manifest itself. We found that the electrostimulation by bipolar
   sinusoidal or triangle periodic waves induces electrical responses in
   the potato tubers with fingerprints of memristors. Tetraethylammonium
   chloride, an inhibitor of voltage gated K+ channels, transforms a
   memristor to a resistor in potato tubers. Our results demonstrate that a
   voltage gated K+ channel in the excitable tissue of potato tubers has
   properties of a memristor. Uncoupler
   carbonylcyanide-4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl hydrazone decreases the
   amplitude of electrical responses at low and high frequencies of bipolar
   periodic sinusoidal or triangle electrostimulating waves. The discovery
   of memristors in plants creates a new direction in the understanding of
   electrical phenomena in plants.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined undergraduate students' reports of emotions and
   emotion regulation during studying from a self-regulated learning (SRL)
   perspective. Participants were 111 university students enrolled in a
   first-year course designed to teach skills in SRL. Students reflected on
   their emotional experiences during goal-directed studying episodes at
   three times over the semester. Measures included self-evaluations of
   goal attainment, emotion intensity ratings and open-ended descriptions
   of emotion regulation strategies. Findings generally revealed that
   positive emotions were positive predictors and negative emotions were
   negative predictors of self-evaluations of goal attainment, although
   positive emotions were associated with larger changes in
   self-evaluations. Boredom was analysed separately and was found to be a
   positive predictor at the between-person level but not a predictor at
   the within-person level. Finally, students reported (a) enacting a
   variety of strategies to regulate their emotions and (b) using a
   different strategy more often than the same strategy from one study
   session to the next.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the H-infinity control problem for a class of
   linear singularly perturbed systems in the finite frequency range. A
   mixed output feedback controller comprising of a static output feedback
   controller and a dynamic output feedback controller is developed for the
   system stabilisation. Based on the generalised Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov
   (GKYP) lemma, the frequency-domain inequalities can be converted into
   linear matrix inequalities which are numerically tractable. Compared
   with the existing full frequency approaches, better results are
   obtained. Moreover, the selection methods of the cut-off frequencies in
   both low and high frequency ranges are extensively studied with a view
   to reduce the conservativeness in output feedback control design.
   Simulation results suggest the asymptotic validity of the main results

   group and the widest in the South Asian group. The non-European ethnic
   groups had higher rates of abstinence and lower alcohol consumption
   rates; nevertheless, a considerable proportion of people from these
   groups may be at risk of alcohol-related harm due to risky and harmful

Abstract = {{Corynocarpus is a small, morphologically and phylogenetically isolated

   when examined in combination with other published molecular dating
   studies, indicates that the origin of the genus and the arrival of
   Corynocarpus in New Zealand are likely to be much more recent than
   previously suggested. A second focus of our study was to investigate
   patterns of pre-European putative translocation of C. laevigatus
   (karaka, kpi) by Mori throughout New Zealand using diversity at these
   two loci. Our New Zealand-wide sampling revealed the distinctiveness of
   specimens from the Three Kings Islands at both loci, precluding the
   Three Kings Islands as the source population for translocated C.
   laevigatus. However, the low level of sequence variation at these loci
   prevented further insight into the human-mediated dispersal of this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The division cycle of unicellular yeasts is completed with the
   activation of a cell separation program that results in the dissolution
   of the septum assembled during cytokinesis between the 2 daughter cells,
   allowing them to become independent entities. Expression of the eng1(+)
   and agn1(+) genes, encoding the hydrolytic enzymes responsible for
   septum degradation, is activated at the end of each cell cycle by the
   transcription factor Ace2. Periodic ace2(+) expression is regulated by
   the transcriptional complex PBF (PCB Binding Factor), composed of the
   forkhead-like proteins Sep1 and Fkh2 and the MADS box-like protein Mbx1.
   In this report, we show that Ace2-dependent genes contain several
   combinations of motifs for Ace2 and PBF binding in their promoters.
   Thus, Ace2, Fkh2 and Sep1 were found to bind in vivo to the eng1(+)
   promoter. Ace2 binding was coincident with maximum level of eng1(+)
   expression, whereas Fkh2 binding was maximal when mRNA levels were low,
   supporting the notion that they play opposing roles. In addition, we
   found that the expression of eng1(+) and agn1(+) was differentially
   affected by mutations in PBF components. Interestingly, agn1(+) was a
   major target of Mbx1, since its ectopic expression resulted in the
   suppression of Mbx1 deletion phenotypes. Our results reveal a complex
   regulation system through which the transcription factors Ace2, Fkh2,
   Sep1 and Mbx1 in combination control the expression of the genes
   involved in separation at the end of the cell division cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of women's rights on a country's competitiveness in the
   global economy is a source of contention. While educational
   opportunities for women, as well as political empowerment, are linked to
   a variety of positive outcomes, the impact of economic rights is mixed.
   Toward better understanding these issues, we focus on the role of
   women's rights in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Though
   foreign capital plays a key role in the development strategies of many
   countries, and many of the growth areas in FDI rely heavily on women's
   labor, extant literature on the determinants of FDI largely ignores
   gender. To gain insight into these issues, we examine the impact of
   women's political, economic, and educational rights across four
   different types of US FDI into the developing world. We find a mixed
   relationship between women's rights and FDI that varies across
   industrial sectors.}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{East London's former docklands have been at the centre of planning and
   regeneration debates for the past four decades. The setting up of the
   London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) has been variously
   interpreted as `3-D Thatcherism' in action, a symbol of the death of
   comprehensive planning and the replacement of a corporatist, Keynesian
   era of urban policy with a more neoliberal approach. Moving away from
   simplistic and straightforward interpretations of the processes
   happening at this time, this article uses new archival and interview
   material to re-examine the setting up of the LDDC and its early years,
   revealing a more complex and contradictory picture than existing
   accounts suggest. It focuses on three themes: changing forms of state
   intervention; the uncertain `break' in the post-war consensus as
   evidenced by the changes in approaches to the regeneration of Docklands;
   and the unintended, disordered process of actual policy change. As such
   we aim to reveal how shifting visions, modes of governance and practices
   could compete and co-exist in the midst of seemingly coherent `eras', as
   Docklands as a place and as an approach to regeneration was constantly
   made and re-made - a process that continues to this day.}},

Abstract = {{Consumers have become increasingly skeptical about salespeople's
   persuasion attempts. Nonetheless, during the decision-making process,
   consumers depend on the aid of salespeople because of their knowledge.
   This dependence can result in consumer ambivalence toward the sales
   encounter-consumers may feel torn between their distrust and suspicion
   toward salespeople, and yet they need their help and expertise to make
   an informed decision. Using both qualitative and sequential experimental
   methods, we investigate how ambivalence manifests itself in the
   buyer-seller encounter, how and when it can be reduced, and its effect
   on attitudes and intent to purchase. Our results demonstrate that
   positive message amplification can be a potential help but also a
   hindrance in the initial buyer-seller encounter. Specifically, we found
   that ambivalent consumers responded more favorably to positive
   information provided by the salesperson after the interaction. This
   result may have emerged because consumers are more skeptical of
   salespeople and their guard is up when interacting with such
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Engaging students in effective technology use and literacy learning is
   an ongoing challenge, particularly for students who are impacted by

   critical role in addressing this challenge. This paper illustrates the
   practices of teachers, identified to be exemplary in engaging students
   in low socio-economic status (SES) locations, with a focus on their use
   of technology and associated literacy practices. The data is drawn from
   a large-scale study of the practices of 28 exemplary teachers in low SES
   primary and secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Using the
   Fair Go student engagement framework, we illustrate the ways these
   teachers used high cognitive, high affective and high operative
   strategies with technology to build students' discipline and literacy
   knowledge, to scaffold their learning and to create a nurturing
   environment for literacy learning. Technology-literacy markers are
   presented as a pedagogical guide that draws on exemplary practice by
   teachers in a range of low SES settings. The analysis presented also
   provides forward-thinking input to governments and policymakers for

Abstract = {{This article presents a framework informed by two disciplines, Social
   Innovation and Applied Ethics, to be used in an ongoing analysis of
   territorial democratic systems. It aims to combine Social Innovation and
   Applied Ethics analysis to better understand the socio-political
   regeneration process in Iceland initiated with the 2008 global crisis.
   This crisis, particularly in Iceland had an economic and political
   aspect affecting the self-understanding of the territories as a whole,
   but in the Basque Country at present, it also deals with the current
   peace process to settle down political violence and its causes. In both
   cases there are deep underlying value issues. Nevertheless, this article
   introduces only the results obtained in Iceland. While its democratic
   system has proven to be able to contest the causes of the crisis, there
   is no definitive evidence that the re-examination process that was
   opened in October 2008 is resolved yet.}},

Abstract = {{Many bacterial respiratory redox enzymes depend on the twin-arginine
   translocase (Tat) system for translocation and membrane insertion. Tat
   substrates contain an N-terminal twin-arginine (SRRxFLK) motif serving
   as the targeting signal towards the translocon. Many Tat substrates have
   a system specific chaperone redox enzyme maturation protein (REMP) for
   final folding and assembly prior to Tat binding. The REMP DmsD strongly
   interacts with the twin-arginine motif of the DmsA signal sequence of
   dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase. In this study, we have utilized the
   in vitro protein protein interaction technique of an affinity pull down
   assay, as well as protein thermal stability measurement via differential
   scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to investigate the interaction of guanosine
   nucleotides (GNPs) with DmsD. Here we have shown highly cooperative
   binding of DmsD with GTR A dissociative ligand-binding style isotherm
   was generated upon GTP titration into the DmsD:DmsAL interaction,
   yielding sigmoidal release of DmsD with a Hill coefficient of 2.09 and a
   dissociation constant of 0.99 mM. DSF further illustrated the change in
   thermal stability upon DmsD interaction with DmsAL and GTP. These
   results imply the possibility of DmsD detection and binding of GTP
   during the DMSO protein maturation mechanism, from ribosomal translation
   to membrane targeting and final assembly. Conceivably, GTP is shown to
   act as a molecular regulator in the biochemical pathway. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{The emergence of queer diaspora studies has demanded increasing
   attention to the ways in which women writers have challenged the
   heterocentrism of dominant conceptions of diaspora. The theoretical
   intersection of queer studies with diaspora and black studies in
   relatively recent years has produced a vital reassessment of the black
   studies project. In the attempt to reconceptualize black queer and black
   diaspora, Rinaldo Walcott, in particular, has stressed the importance of
   a broader geographical and comparative framework, and offered crucial
   insights into the spatial redefinition of queer studies. Walcott's new
   black queer theory provides a particularly useful framework in this
   article to analyse the poetic work of Patience Agbabi in Transformatrix
   (2000) and Bloodshot Monochrome (2008) as queer poetic praxis. A British
   poet of Nigerian ancestry, Agbabi combines her experience as a
   spoken-word artist and performer with her literary background as an
   Oxford-educated poet. Straddling the British lyric tradition and
   performance poetry, her work explores the sonnet form while revealing
   the complexities of gender and sexuality. This article agues that, as
   she steps beyond safe boundaries of literary conventions in a creative
   interplay of formal constraint and experimentation, Agbabi queers the
   sonnet form, destabilizing normative gay, lesbian, black, men's and
   women's identities.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To explore the associations between decreased pulse oximetry
   values (SpO(2)) and clinical, laboratory, and demographic variables in
   general practice patients diagnosed with asthma or chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD), including those with both COPD and asthma in
   combination.Design/setting: A cross-sectional study in seven Norwegian
   general practices of patients aged 40 years or over who were diagnosed
   by their general practitioner (GP) with asthma and/or COPD. The patients
   were examined during a stable phase of their disease. Patients diagnosed
   with COPD (including those with combined COPD/asthma) and those
   diagnosed with asthma only were analysed separately.Main outcome
   measures: Decreased SpO(2) values (95\% and92\%).Results: Of 372
   patients included (mean age 61.5 years, 62\% women), 82 (22.0\%) had
   SpO(2)95\%, of which 11 had SpO(2)92\%. In both asthma and COPD
   patients, SpO(2)95\% was significantly associated with reduced lung
   function (spirometry), a diagnosis of coronary heart disease and older
   age (65 years). In the COPD group, haemoglobin above normal was
   associated with SpO(2)95\%. These associations were confirmed by
   multivariable logistic regression, where FEV1\% predicted<50 was the
   strongest predictor of SpO(2)95\% (odds ratio 6.8, 95\% confidence
   interval 2.8-16.4).Conclusion. Pulse oximetry represents a useful
   diagnostic adjunct for assessing the severity of obstructive pulmonary
   disease. Decreased pulse oximetry values in stable-phase patients with
   asthma and/or COPD should prompt the GP to consider revising the
   diagnosis and treatment and to look for co-morbidities.}},

Abstract = {{We analyse trends in inflation-adjusted audit and non-audit fees from
   2003 to 2009 with the aim of identifying the impact of International
   Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Spain, where (a) the shift from
   national to international accounting standards represented major changes
   and (b) the implementation process was conducted in 2005 for group
   accounts of listed companies and 2008 for the individual accounts. To
   that end, we build a well-tested audit and non-audit fee model based on
   2003 and compare the actual with the predicted values had the accounting
   reforms not taken place. We report unexpected higher audit fees for the
   group accounts model in the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. A plausible
   explanation for these results is the incremental audit costs associated
   with the mandatory IFRS adoption. Similarly, the unexpected increment in
   2008 for parent company audit fees is feasibly associated with the new
   domestic accounting rules. The behaviour of non-audit fees is more
   erratic and likely influenced by the auditors' independence regulation
   enacted in 2002. We only identify significant prediction errors in 2008
   for group accounts. Total fees exhibit significant increases in 2005 and
   2008 for group accounts and 2008 for parent company accounts. Our
   results are robust to different additional tests.}},

   hesternus was established by Ameghino in the late 1800s on the basis of
   a cervical vertebra (NHMUK-A599) from the Santa Cruz Formation
   (Santacrucian, South American Land Mammal Age, early Miocene,
   Burdigalian Stage) of Patagonia, Argentina. Although taxonomic
   attributions were controversial, the specimen is now confidently
   assigned to Anhingidae. Recently, however, L. hesternus was designated a
   nomen dubium because of its uninformative diagnostic characters and
   apparent loss of the holotype. Nevertheless, NHMUK-A599 has been
   relocated and is redescribed here prompting referral to Anhinga. A
   combination of traits are shared with the extant Anhinga anhinga and A.
   melanogaster, and the material is dimensionally compatible with A.
   anhinga. The estimated body size of NHMUK-A599 would have been larger
   than A. minuta but less than A. grandis, A. subvolans, A. fraileyi and
   A. walterbolesi. Finally, Anhinga hesterna is considered valid and
   represents the stratigraphically oldest occurrence of the genus in South
   America and the southernmost yet recorded.}},

Title = {{Validation of the Physician Teaching Motivation Questionnaire (PTMQ)}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Physicians play a major role as teachers in undergraduate
   medical education. Studies indicate that different forms and degrees of
   motivation can influence work performance in general and that teachers'
   motivation to teach can influence students' academic achievements in
   particular. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and to
   validate an instrument measuring teaching motivations in hospital-based
   physicians.
   Methods: We chose self-determination theory as a theoretical framework
   for item and scale development. It distinguishes between different
   dimensions of motivation depending on the amount of self-regulation and
   autonomy involved and its empirical evidence has been demonstrated in
   other areas of research. To validate the new instrument (PTMQ =
   Physician Teaching Motivation Questionnaire), we used data from a sample
   of 247 physicians from internal medicine and surgery at six German
   medical faculties. Structural equation modelling was conducted to
   confirm the factorial structure, correlation analyses and linear
   regressions were performed to examine concurrent and incremental
   validity.
   Results: Structural equation modelling confirmed a good global fit for
   the factorial structure of the final instrument (RMSEA = .050, TLI =
   .957, SRMR = .055, CFI = .966). Cronbach's alphas indicated good
   internal consistencies for all scales (a = .75 - .89) except for the
   identified teaching motivation subscale with an acceptable internal
   consistency (a = .65). Tests of concurrent validity with global work
   motivation, perceived teaching competence, perceived teaching
   involvement and voluntariness of lesson allocation delivered
   theory-consistent results with slight deviations for some scales.
   Incremental validity over global work motivation in predicting perceived
   teaching involvement was also confirmed.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the PTMQ is a reliable, valid and
   therefore suitable instrument for assessing physicians' teaching
   motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Although multiregional input-output (MRIO) databases use data from
   national statistical offices, the reconciliation of various data sources
   results in significantly altered country data. This makes it problematic
   to use MRIO-based footprints for national policy-making. This paper
   develops a potential solution using the Netherlands as case study. The
   method ensures that the footprint is derived from an MRIO dataset (in
   our case the World Input-Output Database (WIOD)) that is made consistent
   with Dutch National accounts data. Furthermore, usage of microdata
   allows us to separate re-exports at the company level. The adjustment
   results in a foreign footprint in 2009 that is 22\% lower than the
   original WIOD estimates and a significantly altered country allocation.
   We demonstrate that already in the data preparation phase due to the
   treatment of re-exports and margins, large differences arise with Dutch
   national statistics, which may help explain the variation in footprint
   estimates across MRIO databases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper scrutinizes why the Western European type of social democracy
   has not developed in Turkey. Both the historical backdrop and current
   constraints on the development of social democracy are examined. This
   paper argues that social democracy's failure in Turkey has stemmed from
   two reasons. On the one hand, historical and structural constraints that
   obstructed social democracy should be taken into account. On the other,
   social democratic movements suffered from an agency question. The
   leadership of the political parties, which defined themselves as
   centre-left entities, had a number of chances to build a genuine social
   democracy', but they chose alternative policy paths based on identity
   politics. This phenomenon too prevented the development of social
   democracy. The CHP (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi, Republican People's Party)
   is the focal point of the paper since it has always been the main
   subject in the debates over social democracy in Turkey.}},

Abstract = {{This article considers the legal validity of citizens' actions in civil
   disobedience as it pertains to the umbrella movement in Hong Kong. It
   introduces the critical approach of legal realism in order to reconsider
   normative law, such as police enforcement and court interventions, in
   relation to political struggle. It has been argued that the legal
   precepts of rights, responsibility, and the rule of law are capable of
   contingent and contextually appropriate interpretations by different
   legal actors, including citizens who participate in civil disobedience.
   In politics, justice, and most importantly law, civil disobedience
   offers an alternative legal normativity to consider the citizen's right,
   and even duty, to express dissent. Furthermore, this right or duty is
   legally persuasive and conducive to guarding democratic principles.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Despite theoretical advances, non-linear input-output models have been
   empirically applied only to a limited extent. This is mainly due to the
   fact that the number of parameters to be estimated is much higher than
   the number of available data points. Taking advantage of the recent
   proliferation of input-output databases and by applying an estimation
   strategy that relies on entropy econometrics, this paper suggests a way
   to estimate the parameters that characterize non-linear relationships
   between inputs and output. This non-linear modelling allows for
   considering time-specific input coefficients, instead of fixed ones.
   Several types of multipliers can be derived from this non-linear model,
   and the proposed generalized maximum entropy (GME) estimator allows
   estimating them from time series or cross-sectional datasets of
   input-output tables. The proposed GME technique is illustrated by means
   of an empirical application that estimates the parameters that
   characterize a non-linear input-output model for the Spanish economy
   over the period 1995-2011.}},

Abstract = {{In South Africa's democracy, the dismantling of the apartheid low-wage
   migrant labour system has been a stated goal of the state and trade
   unions. Through an investigation of the recruitment regime on the
   Rustenburg platinum belt, this article demonstrates how mine managements
   have responded to the goal of guaranteeing a continued supply of cheap
   and plentiful labour, how it has manipulated the unionised labour
   market, how it has ensured labour's consent in its project and how this
   has impacted on workers. Using Michael Burawoy's (1983) conceptual
   distinction between despotic' and hegemonic' labour regimes which
   embraces the idea of the politics of production, the article
   demonstrates how migrant labour recruitment patterns contain
   continuities, but have also fractured under the impact of neoliberal
   flexible labour patterns, the state's transformational laws which
   particularly impact on non-South African labour, and the local labour
   market characterised by deep structural unemployment. Workers have in
   some measure benefited from changed recruitment patterns, but for many
   it has rendered their position increasingly precarious and has
   simultaneously segmented the solidarity of labour, resulting in some
   segments of mine labour belonging to the new democratic dispensation
   more than others.}},

   Anderson, urging that Sen correctly advocates comprehensive

   and agent-neutrality, and that Sen correctly sees these contrasts
   exemplified in the Bhagavadgt. It concludes with a discussion of the

Abstract = {{This paper examines how the authenticity of intangible craftsmanship
   heritage is planned and staged in the cultural museum context. Based on
   a case study of the Craftsmanship Museum Cluster in Hangzhou, China,
   this paper discusses and analyses how tourism serves as a catalyst at
   the museums to showcase the authenticity of craftsmanship heritage and
   provide tourists authentic experience, through combing the tangible and
   intangible forms (e.g. object display, modern exhibition technology,
   simulated environment, and living process of craftsmanship showcase).
   The local governmental organisations, museum planners, curators, and
   crafts masters co-produce the authenticity of craftsmanship heritage
   through full negotiation, compromise, and creation. This paper also
   highlights the changing nature of intangible heritage and the role of
   museums in contemporary tourism.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to analyze students' academic results following
   the introduction of a continuous assessment system in Higher Education.
   This study examines a large sample that consists of third-year students'
   grades across nine subjects in the Bachelor of Business Administration
   program at the University of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). Specifically,
   this paper studies the relations among three types of grades (i.e. final
   exam grades (FEGs), continuous assessment activities grades (excluding
   the final exam) and GAGs, which are calculated as the weighted averages
   of the FEGs and the continuous assessment activities grades) and the
   influence of the number of students who actively participate in a
   subject and the date of the final exam on students' grades. Generally,
   this study reveals a positive effect of continuous assessment activities
   on students' academic success. Furthermore, there is a statistically
   significant positive relation between the number of students who
   actively follow a subject and their GAGs. Finally, the earlier the
   students completed the final exam, the higher their grades were on this
   exam.}},

Abstract = {{This article will focus on the wartime cinema facilities provided by the
   philanthropic association the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA).
   At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the YMCA turned
   its attention to supporting troops fighting for Britain and her Empire.
   YMCA huts were built to provide soldiers with food and a place to rest
   on the frontline, or at home in military camps and railway stations.
   Alongside the arrangements for entertainments made by the Army at
   Divisional level, the YMCA had a central role in providing
   morale-boosting entertainment and moral-strengthening education to
   British soldiers. Films became a central mode of entertainment for
   British servicemen serving on the Western Front and the Mediterranean.
   Cinema shows were the most popular part of the concert party programme,
   with many cinema halls also acting as theatres. The YMCA had 77 cinema
   plants, the majority of which were portable units providing free
   showings to men in forward positions. There were 20 specially
   constructed cinema theatres in principal Base Camps, each with a
   capacity of up to 1500 men, and towards the end of the war, the
   organisation estimated that it had shown films to 35,000 men for every
   night of the conflict. This article will show how valuable the medium of
   film became to the British Army in terms of morale and discipline. An
   effective ``counter-attraction' to less wholesome forms of recreation,
   the cinema was an essential element of wartime life for British troops
   serving in the First World War.}},

Abstract = {{Aron Ralston and Christopher McCandless, two outdoor adventurers, have
   captured the hearts of many American environmentalists. Each has
   attained the status of cultural icons and inspired books and films to
   recount their tales. While entertainment media have romanticized both
   individuals, news media are not as easy on oneMcCandless is vilified
   while Ralston is valorized. When reporting these stories, news media
   outlets attempted to retell each story in a way that conforms to the
   dominant American ideology of wilderness, where progress is marked by
   control over naturecontrol that both Ralston and McCandless clearly
   unsettled. In addition, both committed many of the same errors in being
   underprepared. Despite these similarities, why are they each presented
   so differently in the news media? This paper offers a rhetorical
   analysis of newspaper articles on each story, where the phenomenon of
   scapegoating alienates McCandless, and the phenomenon of mortification
   purifies Ralston, restabilizing this American environmental ideology in
   both stories. In conclusion, I argue that the essential difference
   between these two stories is that they present two opposing ideals of a
   human-nature relationship, with Ralston's ideology including a space for
   technology and industrial knowledge, and thus construed as more
   appropriate than McCandless' ideology.}},

Abstract = {{Using recent Chinese data on outward foreign direct investment (OFDI)
   (2003-11), this study shows that Chinese OFDI has expanded in both
   distant developing and developed countries. Statistical analysis
   suggests that Chinese investors are attracted to countries with large
   market size, rich resources and strategic assets, and demand a sound
   legal system but avoid countries with the best rule of law. Chinese
   investors do not directly respond to political risk and corruption.
   However, they favour politically stable locations when seeking markets
   and care about political stability and corruption control when seeking
   resources. Institutional factors play a more significant role in the
   investment decision making prior to the actual investments, but the
   moderating role of institutions is influential for the actual
   investments. Chinese investors are more likely to seek markets and
   resources in developing countries, with careful evaluation of
   institutional quality.}},

Abstract = {{Social work in the UK remains embroiled in concerns about child
   protection error. The serious injury or death of vulnerable children
   continues to evince much consternation in the public and private
   spheres. Governmental responses to these concerns invariably draw on
   technocratic solutions involving more procedures, case management
   systems, information technology and bureaucratic regulation. Such
   solutions flow from an implicit use of instrumental rationality based on
   a means-end' logic. While bringing an important perspective to the
   problem of child protection error, instrumental rationality has been
   overused limiting discretion and other modes of rational inquiry. This
   paper argues that the social work profession should apply an enlarged
   form of rationality comprising not only the instrumental-rational mode
   but also the critical-rational, affective-rational and
   communicative-rational forms. It is suggested that this combined,
   conceptual arsenal of rational inquiry leads to a gestalt that has been
   termed the holistic-rational perspective. It is also argued that
   embracing a more rounded perspective such as this might offer greater
   opportunities for reducing child protection error.}},

Abstract = {{Focusing on the process of technology transfer, this paper aims to
   critically examine the production and usage of the information and
   communication technology (ICT) curriculum, and discusses its
   possibilities. It is found that the goals in both of the two stages of
   the ICT curriculum in Taiwan were rather rhetorical. Three problems are
   then discussed: an inevitable discourse, but opposed to its original
   intention, the exclusion of instructional issues, and the exclusion of
   students' life experience and reflection. Finally, three possibilities
   for the ICT curriculum are proposed: expanding educators' understanding
   of the ICT curriculum, developing an ICT curriculum beyond the dominance
   of ICT experts, and rethinking the role of teachers in the
   implementation of the curriculum.}},

Abstract = {{There is a substantial body of academic literature analysing David
   Dabydeen's fiction and poetry as postcolonial writing, but much less
   critical attention has been paid to his treatment of gender. In some
   ways, his approach to this issue makes for uncomfortable reading, giving
   rise to a desire to gloss over its substance as well as its
   implications. However, if Dabydeen is courageous enough to write so
   explicitly and honestly about misogyny in colonial and postcolonial
   contexts, an unflinching examination of this aspect of his work is long
   overdue, and it is in this spirit that this article approaches his three
   novels which deal most directly with the West Indies (specifically his
   native Guyana): The Intended (1991), The Counting House (1996) and Our
   Lady of Demerara (2004). There is a sense in which these three novels,
   taken together, can be seen as a relentless catalogue of men's
   historical and contemporary brutality to women in Guyana, Britain and
   India. Dabydeen's fiction exposes in ruthless detail not only the nature
   of gendered violence, but also the conditions which exacerbate it, the
   lies men tell themselves to justify it, and the ways in which women
   respond to it. He suggests links between violence, sexual desire,
   misogyny and the commodification of women in colonial and postcolonial
   societies.}},

Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{John Tyndall, Irish-born natural philosopher, completed his PhD at the
   University of Marburg in 1850 while starting his first substantial
   period of research into the phenomenon of diamagnetism. This paper
   provides a detailed analysis and evaluation of his contribution to the
   understanding of magnetism and of the impact of this work on
   establishing his own career and reputation; it was instrumental in his
   election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1852 and as Professor of
   Natural Philosophy at the Royal Institution in 1853. Tyndall's
   interactions and relationships with Michael Faraday, William Thomson,
   Julius Plucker and others are explored, alongside his contributions to
   experimental practice and to emerging theory. Tyndall's approach,
   challenging Faraday's developing field theory with a model of
   diamagnetic polarity and the effect of magnetic forces acting in
   couples, was based on his belief in the importance of underlying
   molecular structure, an idea which suffused his later work, for example
   in relation to the study of glaciers and to the interaction of
   substances with radiant heat.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Amphidromy is a distinct form of diadromy, involving a downstream
   migration (drift') to a pelagic feeding habitat undertaken by
   exceptionally small, undeveloped larvae immediately after hatch.
   Identifying patterns of larval drift may indicate critical periods
   within which conservation measures can be targeted to protect migrating
   larvae. This study utilised diel and spatial drift sampling to examine
   patterns of larval drift in two of New Zealand's endemic eleotrid
   species, the bluegill bully (Gobiomorphus hubbsi) and the common bully
   (G. cotidianus) in the Waianakarua River, South Island, New Zealand. A
   distinct spatial and temporal window was identified within which the
   vast majority of larvae were migrating to sea, extending only a few
   hours after sunset and < 10km inland. Similar diel patterns of larval
   drift have been found in other amphidromous species, suggesting this may
   be a widespread migratory behaviour. Managing water takes to minimise
   impacts on migrating larvae within this relatively small spatial and
   temporal window potentially represents a management strategy that could
   provide safe passage to the vast majority of larval fish while
   minimising disruption to human activities.}},

Abstract = {{Performance feedback remains a commonly implemented and successful

   75 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental
   conditions: (a) contingent and supportive feedback, (b) contingent and
   critical feedback, (c) independent and supportive feedback, or (d)
   independent and critical feedback. Outcomes suggested that contingent
   feedback improved performance relative to independent feedback, however,
   no differences were found between supportive and critical types of
   feedback. The need for additional research into the functional and

Abstract = {{This study critically examines the representation of the 2006 suspected
   aircraft terror plot at Heathrow Airport in London by three mainstream
   newspapers in New Zealandthe Otago Daily Times, the Press (Press) and
   the New Zealand Herald. It seeks to illustrate how these newspapers
   espoused an Orientalist view of Islamic Other in framing the issue by
   representing Islam and Muslims as a threat to the West as well as to New
   Zealand. It is argued that in reporting the issue, these newspapers
   provided extraordinary emphasis on Islamic terrorism that was
   extrapolated from the event but they maintained their categorical
   silence when the initial sensationalizing representations were found to
   be questionable, as evidence did not fully support the scale of the
   Orientalist representation. In trying to explain this media frenzy, we
   point to the existential fear of New Zealand society about Islam and
   Muslims both globally and locally. We argue that this typical media
   representation aimed at controlling discourses and discursive formations
   about Islam and Muslims in society by overfeeding media consumers with
   ideologies so that they do not have an opportunity to internalize
   alternative discourses.}},

Abstract = {{Property relations are often ambiguous in postcolonial settings.
   Property is only considered as such if socially legitimate institutions

   frequently subject to conflict and negotiation in a social arena'.
   Settler arrivals and new economic possibilities challenge these norms
   and extend the arena. The article analyses conflicts and negotiations in
   the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the light of its
   unique settler history and economic activity, focussing on the
   little-studied remote northern district of Poum on the Caledonian main
   island Grande Terre. In this region, the descendants of British
   fishermen intermarried with the majority Kanak clans. We illustrate the
   interaction between customary conflicts, European settlement, struggles
   for independence and a desire for economic development. Customary claims
   are in tension with the attractions of economic growth and service
   delivery, which has been slow in coming to Poum for reasons largely
   outside the control of local people.}},

   seek to analyse how well the state has fared in achieving this

   should exist and a clear strategic conception of the state's national
   interest should be formulated. Old paradigms about the role and
   functions of the diplomatic corps are challenged and a meritocratic
   diplomatic corps is strongly advocated to support the state's declared

Abstract = {{There is a long tradition of museum research assessing visitors'
   personal background. In this article, we suggest an insightful way to
   enhance and intensify visitor analyses and adopt a more integrative
   approach. To this end, we draw attention to Latent Class Analysis (LCA),
   a classification method that allows us to investigate visitor profiles
   rather than isolated characteristics while using a mixture of
   socio-demographic variables and other personal characteristics. We
   illustrate our suggestion with two examples drawn from a study we
   conducted at two science museums and two museums of cultural history.
   The first example shows the use of LCA on variables that are easily
   assessed and that many museums already have access to through their
   visitor surveys. The second LCA involves more specific cognitive and
   motivational visitor variables that are of general importance for
   learning and that are assumed to be especially important when dealing
   with conflicting information. Both examples illustrate the additional
   value of investigating visitor profiles for researchers as well as
   museum practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
   metformin on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) differentiation and the
   possible mechanisms.
   Methods: EPCs were treated with metformin and differentiation, migration
   and tube formation of EPCs were evaluated. Moreover, we also assessed
   the AMPK-mTOR-p70SEK pathway, AMPK related autophagy pathway and eNOS-NO
   pathway to explore the mechanisms.
   Results: Metformin treatment could significantly increase
   differentiation of EPCs. On the mechanisms, increased level of AMPKand
   eNOS phosphorylation, LC3 expression and NO production, and decreased
   mTOR, p70 S6K as well as TGF-beta expression were found in EPCs. The
   AMPK inhibitor compound C, Atg5 knocking-down and eNOS inhibitor L-NAME
   could reverse the effect exerted by metformin.
   Conclusions: Our results here showed that metformin could regulate the
   differentiation of EPCs. Autophagy related pathway and AMPK-eNOS-NO
   pathway were involved in the mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Background. Poor interprofessional collaboration has been shown to
   negatively affect patient care within many fields of medicine. Growing
   evidence is suggesting that improved interprofessional collaboration can
   positively affect patient care. Postoperative rehabilitation of many
   orthopedic conditions necessitates the combined efforts of surgeons, and
   therapists. There is a paucity of literature examining collaboration
   among orthopedic surgeons and therapists regarding postoperative
   rehabilitation. Objectives. The following study examines the perceived
   quality of communications between orthopedic surgeons and therapists
   employing an online survey. We hypothesized that collaborative practice
   patterns result in improved perceptions of communication. Methods.
   Ethics board approval was obtained. Subjects consisted of orthopedic
   surgeons, licensed physiotherapists and certified athletic therapists.
   The online survey was distributed through the Canadian Orthopaedic
   Association (COA), the Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA) and the
   Canadian Athletic Therapists Association (CATA). Data analysis was
   performed using Stata/IC 12.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).
   Descriptive statistics were calculated to determine the median responses
   and ranges. Median responses were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis
   one-way analysis of variance. Qualitative analysis regarding text
   responses was performed by three reviewers. Results. Reponses were
   received from all specialties (COA 164, CPA 524, CATA 163). There were
   significant differences in the perceived quality of communication by
   quantitative and qualitative analysis (p < 0.001). Analysis of
   communication within practice patterns of stand-alone versus
   collaborative revealed improved perception of communication quality with
   increased contact. 65.6\% of responders that practiced as stand-alone
   had a negative view of interprofessional communication. 48.4\% of
   responders in a collaborative practice had a positive view of
   interprofessional communication. Analysis of the preferred form of
   communication found that orthopedic surgeons felt the most useful
   referral information was a pre-printed consult sheet (odds ratio {[}OR]
   = 1.56, p < 0.001), whereas therapists were more likely to rank consult
   notes (OR = 1.27, p < 0.042) and operative reports (OR = 1.20, p <
   0.092) as a more useful form of communication. Conclusions.
   Collaborative practice shows improved perceptions of communication
   between specialties. Orthopedic surgeons perceive a higher quality of
   communication than therapists. Therapists and orthopedic surgeons also
   do not agree on the information that should be relayed between the
   specialties regarding postoperative rehabilitation.}},

Abstract = {{Polyglutamine expansion is a hallmark of nine neurodegenerative
   diseases, with protein aggregation intrinsically linked to disease
   progression. Although polyglutamine expansion accelerates protein
   aggregation, the misfolding process is frequently instigated by flanking
   domains. For example, polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-3 allosterically
   triggers the aggregation of the catalytic Josephin domain. The molecular
   mechanism that underpins this allosteric aggregation trigger remains to
   be determined. Here, we establish that polyglutamine expansion increases
   the molecular mobility of two juxtaposed helices critical to ataxin-3
   deubiquitinase activity. Within one of these helices, we identified a
   highly amyloidogenic sequence motif that instigates aggregation and
   forms the core of the growing fibril. Critically, by mutating residues
   within this key region, we decrease local structural fluctuations to
   slow ataxin-3 aggregation. This provides significant insight, down to
   the molecular level, into how polyglutamine expansion drives aggregation
   and explains the positive correlation between polyglutamine tract
   length, protein aggregation, and disease severity.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the politics of gender in armed guerrilla
   organizations during Mexico's Dirty War (1960-1980s) and the role of
   visual culture in documenting histories of state violence and
   revolutionary struggle. By centering specifically on Mexican film-maker
   Luisa Riley's documentary Flor en Otomi (2012), this article explores
   the possibilities and limitations of visual culture in representing
   gendered histories of trauma in recent Mexican history. As one of the
   few cultural texts that documents women's participation in the history
   of Mexico's armed socialist organizations, the film alludes to the
   difficulty of audiovisually portraying violence and the tensions that
   emerge when representing the gendered ghosts of Mexico's Dirty War.
   Ultimately, this article argues that the eradication of thousands of
   (gendered) subjectivities from Mexico's national consciousness has
   created a gendered haunting that holds contemporary neoliberal Mexico
   accountable to its recent violent past.}},

Abstract = {{Tospoviruses are plant-infecting viruses belonging to the family

   distinct tomato spotted wilt virus isolates and related
   silencing-suppressor defective mutants to study the effects on the small
   RNA (sRNA) accumulation during infection of Nicotiana benthamiana. Our
   data showed that absence of a functional silencing suppressor determined
   a marked increase of the total amount of viral sRNAs (vsRNAs), and
   specifically of the 21 nt class. We observed a common
   under-representation of vsRNAs mapping to the intergenic region of S and
   M genomic segments, and preferential mapping of the reads against the
   viral sense open reading frames, with the exception of the NSs gene. The
   NSs-mutant strains showed enrichment of NSm-derived vsRNA compared to
   the expected amount based on gene size. Analysis of 5' terminal
   nucleotide preference evidenced a significant enrichment in U for the 21
   nt- and in A for 24 nt-long endogenous sRNAs in all the samples. Hotspot
   analysis revealed a common abundant accumulation of reads at the 5' end
   of the L segment, mostly in the antiviral sense, for the NSs-defective
   isolates, suggesting that absence of the silencing suppressor can
   influence preferential targeting of the viral genome. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   it was shown that microbes have mechanosensors on the surface of the
   cells and can sense small changes of the external environment. The
   obtained results were shown that the time-dependent effects of MV at 4
   and 8Hz frequency could either stimulate or inhibit the growth of
   microbes depending from exposure time. It more particularly, the
   invention relates to a method for controlling biological functions
   through the application of mechanical vibration, thus making it possible
   to artificially control the functions of bacterial cells, which will
   allow us to develop method that can be used in agriculture, industry,
   medicine, biotechnology to control microbial growth.}},

Title = {{The relationship between young children's enjoyment of learning to read,

Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{389-402}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: While there is a considerable body of research exploring the
   relationship between older primary school children's reading attitudes,
   confidence and attainment, there is a noticeable lack of research with
   younger children. Furthermore, there is relatively little research
   exploring the extent to which children's reading attitudes, confidence
   and attainment are related to their enjoyment of learning to
   read.Purpose: To understand the relationship between young children's
   reading attitudes, reading confidence, enjoyment of learning to read and
   reading attainment.Sample: Two hundred and three children (103 boys)
   with an average age of 6years and 9months (.32years standard deviation)
   participated in this study. Children were from 11 primary schools in
   England, located within a wide range of socio-economic
   neighbourhoods.Design and methods: All children completed questionnaires
   examining their attitudes to reading, reading confidence (using Progress
   in International Reading Literacy Study items) and enjoyment of learning
   to read. Children also completed an assessment of word reading. All
   assessments were administered individually.Results: Children's attitudes
   to reading, reading confidence and enjoyment of learning to read
   correlated with their word reading skill; however, only reading
   attitudes and reading confidence predicted variance in reading success.
   With regard to gender differences, girls reported more positive reading
   attitudes than boys, even after controlling for differences in reading
   skill.Conclusions: Results highlight that the relationship between
   children's reading skills and the affective aspects of learning to read
   develops from a young age. Therefore, methods of reading instruction
   need to foster affective aspects of reading, in addition to developing
   cognitive skills to best support young children's reading development.}},

Abstract = {{Science communication and science education have the same overarching
   aimto engage their audiences in scienceand both disciplines face similar
   challenges in achieving this aim. Knowing how to effectively engage
   their audiences' is fundamental to the success of both. Both disciplines
   have well-developed research fields identifying best practice. However,
   there seems to be an impediment in putting this knowledge into practice,
   or even much sharing of knowledge between the 2 disciplines. Threshold
   concepts refer to concepts that are fundamental to thinking and practice
   in a discipline. In this paper, we argue that engagement is a threshold
   concept for both science education and science communication.
   Considering the vast amount of literature on science education and
   science communication, the focus in this paper is on recent
   recommendations rather than longstanding, more general notions,
   providing a contemporary view. This paper illustrates how engagement
   fulfils the characteristics of a threshold concept for both disciplines
   and highlights how the 2 fields could assist each other. The purpose of
   this paper is to spark new conversations and sharing between the 2
   disciplines, with the use of threshold concepts as a vehicle for
   enabling collaboration and progress.}},

Abstract = {{Giorgio Agamben's The Kingdom and the Glory opens by intervening in a
   debate between the jurist Carl Schmitt and the theologian Erik Peterson.
   Peterson's Monotheism as a Political Problem undermined Schmitt's thesis
   that the modern concept of sovereignty derives from Christian theology
   by arguing that divine monarchy is a Judaic and Greek idea that was
   liquidated by the doctrine of the Trinity. Agamben, by contrast, argues
   that the Trinity preserves and transforms the model of divine monarchy
   by casting God as singular in his being and multiple in his management
   of the world (his oikonomia). I argue that this critique of Peterson in
   fact builds upon the Monotheism essay, which shows how political
   theologians inherited and rearticulated conceptual problems derived from
   Aristotle's Metaphysics, and is driven by Agamben's concern with the
   impact of Aristotle's thought on ontology and politics.}},

Title = {{A general practice perspective on early rheumatoid arthritis management:
   A qualitative study from Flanders}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: General practitioners (GPs) may play a crucial role in early
   recognition, rapid referral and intensive treatment follow-up of
   patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To improve early RA management,
   perceived barriers in general practice must be addressed. However, the
   general practice perspective on early RA management remains
   understudied.Objective: To explore GPs' experiences, beliefs and
   attitudes regarding detection, referral, and intensive treatment for
   early RA.Methods: In 2014, a qualitative study was conducted by means of
   individual, in depth, face-to-face interviews of a purposive sample of
   13 Flemish GPs. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and
   coded using the constant comparative method.Results: GPs applied
   multiple assessment techniques for early RA detection and regularly
   prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if they suspected early
   RA. However, GPs felt unconfident about their detection skills because
   early RA symptoms are often unclear, diagnostic tests could provide
   inconclusive results and the incidence is low in general practice. GPs
   mentioned various approaches and multiple factors determining their
   referral decision. Perceived referral barriers included limited
   availability of rheumatology services and long waiting times. GPs
   considered intensive treatment initiation to be the expertise of
   rheumatologists. Reported key barriers to intensive treatment included
   patients' resistance and non-adherence, lack of GP involvement and
   unsatisfactory collaboration with rheumatology services.Conclusion: GPs
   acknowledge the importance of an early and intensive treatment, but
   experience various barriers in the management of early RA. GPs should
   enhance their skills to detect early RA and should actively be involved
   in early RA care.}},

Abstract = {{This paper questions the implications of entrepreneurial responses to
   conditions of employment precarity by healthy volunteers' in phase I
   clinical trials in the United States. Such individuals are typically
   serial participants who often identify as professional volunteers and
   seek out drug studies as their primary source of income. Drawing on
   extensive qualitative research, this paper illustrates how healthy
   volunteers selectively import the identity of hustler' from the street
   environment and reposition it as connoting a set of valuable creative
   skills that give them a competitive edge over other participants. An
   entrepreneurial ethos allows them to view personal sacrifice and
   exposure to potentially dangerous drugs as smart investments leading to
   financially stable futures. These discursive moves normalize extractive,
   and at times dehumanizing, labour relations that offload expenses and
   risks to workers.}},

Abstract = {{The clinical significance of Mycobacterium kansasii respiratory isolates
   is uncertain. The aims of this study were to determine the clinical
   relevance of M. kansasii isolates and to identify the clinical features
   and outcomes of M. kansasii lung disease. We reviewed the medical
   records of 104 patients from whom at least one respiratory M. kansasii
   isolate was obtained from January 2003 to July 2014 at Samsung Medical
   Center, South Korea. Of these 104 patients, 54 (52\%) met the diagnostic
   criteria for nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease; among them, 41
   (76\%) patients received antibiotic treatment for a median time of 15.0
   months (interquartile range {[}IQR], 7.0-18.0 months). The remaining 13
   (24\%) without overt disease progression were observed for a median
   period of 24.0 months (IQR, 5.0-34.5 months). Patients with M. kansasii
   lung disease exhibited various radiographic findings of lung disease,
   including the fibrocavitary form (n = 24, 44\%), the nodular
   bronchiectatic form (n = 17, 32\%), and an unclassifiable form (n = 13,
   24\%). The fibrocavitary form was more common in patients who received
   treatment (n = 23, 56\%), while the nodular bronchiectatic form was more
   common in patients with M. kansasii lung disease who did not receive
   treatment (n = 9, 70\%). None of the patients with a single sputum
   isolate (n = 18) developed M. kansasii disease over a median follow-up
   period of 12.0 months (IQR, 4.0-26.5 months). In total, 52\% of all
   patients with M. kansasii respiratory isolates exhibited clinically
   significant disease. Moreover, patients with M. kansasii lung disease
   displayed diverse radiographic findings in addition to the fibrocavitary
   form. The nodular bronchiectatic form was more common in patients with
   M. kansasii lung disease with an indolent clinical course. Thus, since
   the clinical significance of a single M. kansasii respiratory isolate is
   not definite, strict adherence to recommended diagnostic criteria is
   advised.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To determine whether electrical stimulation (ES) following
   botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) injection increases passive extensibility of
   the hamstring muscles in children with spastic diplegia. Methods: Six
   children undergoing bilateral BoNT/A injections to the hamstrings
   participated in this within-participant single blind randomized
   controlled trial. One leg of each child was randomised to the
   experimental condition and the other to the control condition. The
   experimental leg received daily stretch and ES to the hamstrings for 12
   weeks, while the control leg received only daily stretch. The primary
   outcome was passive hamstring extensibility reflected by popliteal angle
   measured with a standardised torque. Secondary outcomes were two
   goniometric measures of popliteal angle using the Modified Tardieu Scale
   (R1 and R2), and parents' perceptions of treatment effectiveness.
   Outcomes were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months.
   Results: The mean between-group difference (95\% CI) at 4 weeks was 2
   degrees (-2 to 5) for popliteal angle measured with a standardised
   torque, favouring the experimental leg. Tardieu results for R1 and R2
   were 0 degrees (-4 to 3) and 7 degrees (0 to 14), respectively.
   Conclusion: ES does not improve passive extensibility of the hamstring
   muscles at 4 weeks over any possible effects of BoNT/A alone.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The role of cardiovascular risk factor control in the
   development of heart failure (HF) has not yet been clearly
   established.Objective: To determine the effect of cardiovascular risk
   factor control on the occurrence of a first episode of hospital
   admission for HF.Methods: A case-control study using propensity
   score-matching was carried out to analyse the occurrence of first
   hospital admission for HF taking into account the degree of
   cardiovascular risk factor control over the previous 24 months. All
   patients admitted to the cardiology unit of the Hospital del Mar between
   2008 and 2011 because of a first episode of HF were considered cases.
   Controls were selected from the population in the hospital catchment
   area who were using primary care services. Cardiovascular risk factor
   measurements in the primary healthcare electronic medical records prior
   to the first HF episode were analysed.Results: After the matching
   process, 645 participants were analysed (129 HF cases and 516 controls).
   Patients suffering a first HF episode had modest increments in body mass
   index and blood pressure levels during the previous two years. Adjusted
   odds ratio for experiencing a first HF hospital admission episode
   according to systolic blood pressure levels and body mass index was (OR:
   1.031, 95\% CI: 1.001-1.04), and (OR: 1.09, 95\% CI: 1.03-1.15),
   respectively.Conclusion: Increased levels of body mass index and
   systolic blood pressure during the previous 24 months may determine a
   higher risk of having a first HF hospital admission episode.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of hydrogen
   sulfide (H2S) on the membrane potential, action potential discharge and
   exocytosis of secretory granules in neurosecretory pituitary tumor cells
   (GH3). The H2S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) induced membrane
   hyperpolarization, followed by truncation of spontaneous electrical
   activity and decrease of the membrane resistance. The NaHS effect was
   dose-dependent with an EC50 of 152 mu M (equals effective H2S of 16-19
   NaHS effects were not altered after inhibition of maxi conductance
   calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels by tetraethylammonium or
   paxilline, but were significantly reduced after inhibition or activation
   of ATP-dependent potassium channels (K-ATP) by glibenclamide or by
   diazoxide, respectively. In whole-cell recordings NaHS increased the
   amplitude of K-ATP currents, induced by hyperpolarizing pulses and
   subsequent application of glibenclamide decreased currents to control
   levels. Using the fluorescent dye FM 1 43 exocytosis of secretory
   granules was analyzed in basal and stimulated conditions (high K+
   external solution). Prior application of NaHS decreased the fluorescence
   of the cell membrane in both conditions which links with activation of
   K-ATP currents (basal secretion) and activation of K-ATP currents and
   BK-currents (stimulated exocytosis). We suggest that H2S induces
   hyperpolarization of GH3 cells by activation of K-ATP channels which
   results in a truncation of spontaneous action potentials and a decrease
   of hormone release. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We systematically investigate the crystal structure, magneto-optical
   properties, magnetization, and magnetotransport properties of a new
   ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga1-x, Fe-x)Sb grown by low-temperature
   molecular beam epitaxy. Crystal structure analyses by x-ray diffraction,
   scanning transmission microscopy, and transmission electron diffraction
   indicate that the (Ga1-x, Fe-x)Sb thin films maintain the zinc-blende
   crystal structure up to x = 20\%. We carried out the characterizations
   of the magnetic properties of the (Ga1-x, Fe-x) Sb thin films by various
   methods, including magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, anomalous
   Hall effect, and superconducting quantum interference device
   magnetometry, and found that (Ga,Fe)Sb is an intrinsic ferromagnetic
   semiconductor without any second-phase precipitations. The Curie
   temperature TC of (Ga1-x, Fe-x)Sb depends on x and hole concentration,
   as in the case of hole-induced ferromagnetism. The highest T-C reaches
   230 K at x = 20\%, which is the highest value so far reported in III-V

Abstract = {{Myoclonic status in nonprogressive encephalopathy (MSNE) is an
   early-onset, drug-resistant epileptic syndrome characterized by
   occurrence of continuous diffuse epileptiform abnormalities, associated
   with positive and/or negative phenomena and accompanied by transient and
   recurring motor, cognitive, and behavioral impairment. MSNE has been
   reported in Angelman syndrome (AS) secondary to 15q11-13 deletions or
   UBE3A mutations but not to paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). We
   describe the case of a male patient with AS caused by UPD who developed
   a myoclonic status (MS) associated with long-lasting fever of central
   origin, both promptly regressed with introduction of levetiracetam. Only
   three descriptions of thermal dysregulation in AS exist, and none of the
   previously reported cases were associated with MS or with UPD.
   Association of MS and central fever expands the spectrum of epileptic
   and non-epileptic features in UPD-related AS and provides a further
   evidence of hypothalamus involvement in the pathogenesis of this
   neurodevelopmental disorder.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, historians have produced a wealth of scholarship
   demonstrating the importance of the exploration of domestic contexts and
   familial dynamics to the development of understandings of women's
   historical experiences. However, the home lives of a particular group of

   investigation. The study of such women challenges the hetero-orthodox
   assumption that women's relationships with men have historically been
   more important than their relationships with one another. This article
   suggests that men were often fleeting figures in the families of
   criminal women. Male absence encouraged women from criminal subcultures,
   instead, to draw together to form female-centred households. Such living
   arrangements were further facilitated by the general instability in the
   home lives of criminal women caused by financial uncertainty, periodic
   incarceration and crackdowns by authorities, as well as by separations
   from their natal families and a high degree of personal mobility. These
   issues are explored through archival material from late nineteenth- and
   early twentieth century Melbourne, and through the writings of prison
   poet Janet Dibben.}},

Abstract = {{This paper identifies vulnerable, transport-poor populations in the
   Canberra Metropolitan Region, and in doing so, makes two significant
   contributions to the literature. The first contribution is
   methodological, advancing accessibility indicators compared with
   previous attempts in the literature. The second contribution is
   policy-relevant, identifying significant spatial gap of service in
   Queanbeyan, east of Canberra. This gap appears to be associated with the
   ACT-NSW state border. The findings are consistent with similar research
   projects in Australia; however, this particular research presents an
   example of transport disadvantage arising from governance, rather than
   from any particular social-spatial relationship to the configuration of
   the city. The findings suggest that public policy and public transport
   planning does not yet effectively reach across the state border.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-reform Chinese cities base their uniqueness in urban transformation
   on Mao's duality of utopian and revolutionary ideals and pragmatic and
   economized approaches in practice. Through the lens of urban economy,
   population management, and city planning, this paper examines China's
   pre-reform urban transformation. By the case study of Hangzhou, this
   research reveals that urban development was driven by a diverse set of
   forces devised by the communist state to configure the urban conditions
   and control people's daily lives in pursuit of radical socialist goals.
   The controls from the state and other pertinent forces led to the actual
   outcomes of political-economic ambitions and spatial policy rhetoric. It
   was an inherent feature of the society and economy to go outside of the
   state's controls, and the unintended consequences were unavoidable. The
   state had to revise their strategies, the outcomes of which were again
   to be tested by time. An iterative process determined the urban
   transformation of Chinese cities.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical evidence overwhelmingly shows that democracy in Muslim
   societies is poorly institutionalized. Many scholars of democratization
   studies critique that the methodology of Western institutions that audit
   democracy and freedoms worldwide employs normative metrics which are
   insensitive to cultural particularisms and thus biased. This paper
   presents a minimal framework for democratic audit of electoral Islamic
   regimes that while being normative, answers to this criticism. It is
   also shown to be in the self-interest of modernizing elites in such
   regimes. This framework is premised on the transference of the burden of
   legitimacy from `majority consent' to `minority concern' by basing
   itself on the substantive `political equality' proviso of Dahl. This is
   achieved without constraining the democratic capacity of the majority.
   Structured as a guarantee of rights and two guarantees of justice in a
   system of fairness, the framework can be used for democratic audit of a
   much larger set of electoral regimes.}},

   Traps magmatic system underwent a state shift approximately coincident
   with the Chicxulub impact and the terminal-Cretaceous mass extinctions,
   after which similar to 70\% of the Traps' total volume was extruded in
   more massive and more episodic eruptions. Initiation of this new regime
   occurred within similar to 50,000 years of the impact, which is
   consistent with transient effects of impact-induced seismic energy.
   Postextinction recovery of marine ecosystems was probably suppressed

Title = {{Genetics, Synergists, and Age Affect Insecticide Sensitivity of the
   Honey Bee, Apis mellifera}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{The number of honey bee colonies in the United States has declined to
   half of its peak level in the 1940s, and colonies lost over the winter
   have reached levels that are becoming economically unstable. While the
   causes of these losses are numerous and the interaction between them is
   very complex, the role of insecticides has garnered much attention. As a
   result, there is a need to better understand the risk of insecticides to
   bees, leading to more studies on both toxicity and exposure. While much
   research has been conducted on insecticides and bees, there have been
   very limited studies to elucidate the role that bee genotype and age has
   on the toxicity of these insecticides. The goal of this study was to
   determine if there are differences in insecticide sensitivity between
   honey bees of different genetic backgrounds (Carniolan, Italian, and
   Russian stocks) and assess if insecticide sensitivity varies with age.
   We found that Italian bees were the most sensitive of these stocks to
   insecticides, but variation was largely dependent on the class of
   insecticide tested. There were almost no differences in organophosphate
   bioassays between honey bee stocks (< 1-fold), moderate differences in
   pyrethroid bioassays (1.5 to 3-fold), and dramatic differences in
   neonicotinoid bioassays (3.4 to 33.3-fold). Synergism bioassays with
   piperonyl butoxide, amitraz, and coumaphos showed increased phenothrin
   sensitivity in all stocks and also demonstrated further physiological
   differences between stocks. In addition, as bees aged, the sensitivity
   to phenothrin significantly decreased, but the sensitivity to naled
   significantly increased. These results demonstrate the variation arising
   from the genetic background and physiological transitions in honey bees
   as they age. This information can be used to determine risk assessment,
   as well as establishing baseline data for future comparisons to explain
   the variation in toxicity differences for honey bees reported in the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{This study is an empirical investigation into some of the determinants
   of attitudes towards BDSM. The methodology was mixed: a
   between-subjects' factor was included along with correlational
   variables. Additionally, there was a longitudinal element to this
   methodology. Ninety-four university women read a passage which contained
   information about BDSM with a manipulation such that identical content
   was presented either positively or negatively. Erotophobia-erotophilia,
   a sexual dimension of personality (i.e. avoidance-approach to
   sexuality), was assessed with different instruments at two times.
   Results indicated (1) attitudes were generally neutral or slightly
   positive towards BDSM; (2) reading a negative or positive passage had
   little impact on BDSM attitudes and (3) erotophobia-erotophilia was a
   correlate of attitudes towards BDSM both several weeks before (i.e.
   predictively) and at the time of attitude assessment. Implications of
   these findings are that attitudes towards topics such as BDSM are
   probably not easily amenable to change as a function of a mild
   intervention - such as reading a positive or negative depiction of the
   topic. Underpinnings of attitudes towards sexual topics such as BDSM are
   probably more likely determined by pre-existing sexual
   liberalism/conservatism in personality. Thus, attitudes towards sexual
   topics such as BDSM are not likely to be easily changed.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the public legitimacy of the National Assembly for
   Wales. Both the Assembly and the broader system of devolved government
   for Wales initially enjoyed very limited public support. It is shown
   that support for devolution in general has risen substantially, while
   some elements of public attitudes towards the Assembly itself now appear
   distinctly positive. However, it is also demonstrated that public
   legitimacy, defined as diffuse support' for the Assembly, remains
   limited. The article then examines what factors explain levels of
   diffuse support for the National Assembly. It is found that variation in
   such support is best accounted for by factors associated with
   non-material consequentialism': perceptions of the impact of the
   Assembly on the process of government. The conclusion assesses the
   implications of the findings for the National Assembly, as well as for
   the study of devolution and political institutions more generally.}},

   the transparency that makes the exchange of properties between them
   visible. These convergences continue into the post-media age, as

Abstract = {{Two different alumina sols were prepared using different precursor
   sources and the sols were solely used as binder in no cement high
   alumina castable. The sols were characterized for their solid content,
   pH, particle size, zeta potential, thermal behaviour through DSC-TG,
   phase formation on calcination, etc. The sols were used as sole binder
   in high alumina castables with different particle size distribution, as
   per Dinger and Funk model, to attain different flow consistency. The
   castables were processed conventionally and heat treated at three
   different temperatures. Different physical and mechanical properties
   were evaluated and compared. Sol prepared from nitrate precursor
   resulted in better properties when used as binder in castables as
   compared to that prepared from commercially available boehmite powder.
   No deformation in the castables was observed on firing at 1650oC, much
   above the application temperature of any cement/ sol bonded castables.
   Absence of any component other than alumina nullifies any eutectic or
   liquid phase formation in the system.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study is the first to explore how child supervisory
   neglect influences patterns of substance use among young adults. This
   study investigated patterns of substance use among males and females, 18
   to 24years old, after controlling for adolescent parental drinking,
   living with parents, relationship status, delinquency, and depression.
   Methods: The study sample (N = 10,618) included individuals who
   participated in Waves I (1994-1995) and III (2001-2002) of the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The study used
   latent class analysis to ascertain how patterns of substance use emerged
   as distinct classes. Results: For both males and females, we identified
   the following 4 classes of substance use: (1) heavy polysubstance use,
   (2) moderate polysubstance use, (3) alcohol and marijuana, and (4)
   low-use substance use patterns. Multinomial logistic regression
   indicated that, for both males and females 18 to 24years old,
   experiencing supervisory neglect, being depressed, being single, and
   engaging in adolescent delinquency serve as risk factors for heavy
   polysubstance use class membership. Conversely, being black or Hispanic
   lowered the likelihood of polysubstance use for males and females. For
   females only, living with parents served as a protective factor that
   reduced the risk of membership in heavy polysubstance use, moderate
   polysubstance use, and alcohol and marijuana classes. For males only,
   being less educated increased the risk of heavy polysubstance use class
   membership. Conclusions: Results from this exploratory study underscore
   the enduring effect of supervisory neglect on substance use among male
   and female young adults. Future studies should explore whether these
   relationships hold over time.}},

Abstract = {{The spirometric measurement of pulmonary function by measuring the
   forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a heritable trait that
   reflects the physiological condition of the lung and airways.
   Genome-wide linkage and association studies have identified a number of
   genes and genetic loci associated with pulmonary function. However,
   limited numbers of studies have been reported for Asian populations. In
   this study, we aimed to investigate genetic evidence of pulmonary
   function in a population in northeast Asia. We conducted a family-based
   association test with 706 GENDISCAN study participants from 72 Mongolian
   families to determine candidate genetic determinants of pulmonary
   function. For the replication, we chose seven candidate single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the 5 loci, and tested 1062 SNPs
   for association with FEV1 from 2,729 subjects of the Korea Healthy Twin
   study. We identified TMEM132C as a potential candidate gene at 12q24.3,
   which is a previously reported locus of asthma and spirometric indices.
   We also found two adjacent candidate genes (UNC93A and TTLL2) in the
   6q27 region, which has been previously identified as a pulmonary
   function locus in the Framingham cohort study. Our findings suggest that
   novel candidate genes (TMEM132C, UNC93A and TTLL2) in two different
   regions are associated with pulmonary function in a population in
   northeast Asia.}},

   metaphysics and examines the consequences of this for the ethics that
   can be drawn from his work. For Deleuze, the space in which difference
   manifests itself is one of discord, monstrosity and violence. This
   becomes evident in his revision of Leibniz's notion of harmony in which
   he offers a new harmony based on the violent discords of differential
   relations, his evocation of the monstrosity of difference, and his
   theorization of the violence of thought. This paper addresses the
   critically neglected juncture between Deleuze's violent metaphysics and
   the kinds of speculative ethics that this metaphysics calls forth.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a variable selection method termed subtle
   uprooting for linear regression. In this proposal, variable selection is
   formulated into a single optimization problem by approximating
   cardinality involved in the information criterion with a smooth
   function. A technical maneuver is then employed to enforce sparsity of
   parameter estimates while maintaining smoothness of the objective
   function. To solve the resulting smooth nonconvex optimization problem,
   a modified Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm with
   established global and super-linear convergence is adopted. Both
   simulated experiments and an empirical example are provided for
   assessment and illustration. Supplementary materials for this article
   are available online.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater crabs of the family Trichodactylidae are widely distributed
   in major river basins of the South American continent. The population
   structure of one species, Dilocarcinus pagei, was analyzed in an
   artificial reservoir in Southeastern Brazil, recording data on the sex
   ratio, recruitment, and mortality. A total of 1339 crabs were collected
   and included 804 males and 535 females (3 ovigerous and 4 with
   hatchlings); the sex ratio was 1:0.61 (males: females). Two modes of
   male and female carapace width (CW) were recorded, with means of 14.4 mm
   (n=407) and 38.9 mm (n=394) for males and 17.9 mm CW (n=269) and 39.2 mm
   (n=267) for females. The mean size of males (CW=26.6 +/- 13.8 mm) was
   significantly larger than that of females (CW=28.5 +/- 12.8 mm). The
   data indicated that recruitment occurs in summer (January-March), with
   the reproductive period in spring (October-December), periods with the
   highest rainfall and temperature values in the region. Reproduction
   leads to the death of the parents, influencing the sex ratio, which
   oscillates mainly during the reproductive period.}},

Abstract = {{DNA polymerase nu (POLN) is one of 16 DNA polymerases encoded in
   vertebrate genomes. It is important to determine its gene expression
   patterns, biological roles, and biochemical activities. By quantitative
   analysis of mRNA expression, we found that POLN from the zebrafish Danio
   rerio is expressed predominantly in testis. POLN is not detectably
   expressed in zebrafish embryos or in mouse embryonic stem cells.
   Consistent with this, injection of POLN-specific morpholino antisense
   oligonucleotides did not interfere with zebrafish embryonic development.
   Analysis of transcripts revealed that vertebrate POLN has an unusual
   gene expression arrangement, sharing a first exon with HAUS3, the gene
   encoding augmin-like complex subunit 3. HAUS3 is broadly expressed in
   embryonic and adult tissues, in contrast to POLN. Differential
   expression of POLN and HAUS3 appears to arise by alternate splicing of
   transcripts in mammalian cells and zebrafish. When POLN was ectopically
   overexpressed in human cells, it specifically coimmunoprecipitated with
   the homologous recombination factors BRCA1 and FANCJ, but not with
   previously suggested interaction partners (HELQ and members of the
   Fanconi anemia core complex). Purified zebrafish POLN protein is capable
   of thymine glycol bypass and strand displacement, with activity
   dependent on a basic amino acid residue known to stabilize the
   primer-template. These properties are conserved with the human enzyme.
   Although the physiological function of pol nu remains to be clarified,
   this study uncovers distinctive aspects of its expression control and
   evolutionarily conserved properties of this DNA polymerase.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of phosphatic fertiliser on growth and nutrients in trials
   at different stages of stand development have been studied in
   second-rotation Pinus radiata plantation sites of Lidsdale State Forest,
   New South Wales. The sites were on phosphorus-deficient clay soils.
   High, early growth responses to phosphatic fertiliser occurred when
   applied to individual trees at the time of planting compared with slower
   initial growth when fertiliser was broadcast applied. There were
   long-term responses to broadcast treatments of phosphorus or
   nitrogen/phosphorus at time of planting, but it took several growing
   seasons for the trees to access the applied phosphorus. Later-age
   applications of phosphorus also gave significant responses with and
   without nitrogen and the level of response was related to the prior
   nutritional status of the stand. There were additional responses to high
   levels of nitrogen when the initial phosphorus deficiency was overcome.
   Application of phosphorus or nitrogen/phosphorus after thinning resulted
   in significant increases in growth. Combining trial results and assuming
   treatments were additive, it was concluded that productivity could be
   increased from 8m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) to about 16m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) over
   24years. The trials show there could be a range of nutritional
   management strategies where fertilisers are applied at various times in
   the rotation process and the appropriate one would be selected in terms

Abstract = {{In addition to the genetic profile of the donor, body fluid stains can
   provide forensic scientists with a lot of other information. Knowing the
   nature of these fluids can be fundamental in categorising a crime and
   reconstructing the events involved. To do so, it is necessary to have
   the means to confirm the origin of the body fluids. Prepared commercial
   kits to evaluate haemoglobin and prostate-specific antigen have been
   utilised for many years in forensic laboratories. The RSID-saliva test
   performs a similar function in the determination of this body fluid. The
   test's sensitivity and specificity have been confirmed in previous
   studies, but in order to apply it to real samples it is also necessary
   to evaluate its efficacy on fluids exposed to real conditions of
   deterioration. The present study deals with mock casework samples,
   introducing the factors of the age of the sample and the effect of
   contact with the environment. The influence of the type of material is
   also evaluated. The results show the resistance to these factors of
   40-day-old saliva samples. Consequently, in the study conditions,
   positives can be obtained using RSID-saliva. Thus, the data provided
   indicate that RSID-saliva is a useful forensic test for examining
   evidentiary items suspected of containing saliva.}},

Abstract = {{Postpartum mammary gland involution is the physiological process by
   which the lactating gland returns to its pre-pregnant state. In rodent
   models, the microenvironment of mammary gland involution is sufficient
   to induce enhanced tumor cell growth, local invasion, and metastasis.
   Therefore, a deeper understanding of the physiological regulation of
   involution may provide in-depth information on breast cancer therapy. We
   herein identified Nucling as an important regulator of involution of the
   mammary gland. Aknock-out mouse model was generated and revealed that
   postpartum involution were impaired in mice lacking Nucling. Involution
   is normally associated with an increase in the activation of NF-kappa B
   and STAT3, which is required for the organized regulation of involution,
   and was observed in WT glands, but not in the absence of Nucling.
   Furthermore, the loss of Nucling led to the suppression of Calpain-1,
   IL-6, and C/EBP delta factors, which are known to be essential for
   normal involution. The number of M2 macrophages, which are crucial for
   epithelial cell death and adipocyte repopulation after weaning, was also
   reduced in Nucling-KO glands. Taken together, the results of the present
   study demonstrated that Nucling played an important role in mammary
   gland involution by regulating NF-kappa B and STAT3 signaling pathways.}},

   of individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). This study presents
   an analysis of how medical students at the University of the
   Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, are trained to treat this
   marginalised population. Methods This was an exploratory qualitative
   study using multiple methodologies, including a curricular review, 18
   purposively selected key informants' interviews, and 3 focus group
   discussions, with medical students across 4 relevant teaching
   departments. Using Lennox and Diggens' curricular framework, thematic
   content analysis was conducted to identify dominant themes and
   subthemes. Results Of Lennox and Diggens' 15-point model of knowledge,
   skills, and attitudes, 3 aspects were not taught, and attitudes fared
   the most poorly whereas skills fared the strongest. Differences in the
   quality and nature of training offered on clinical rotations were
   highlighted, and the practical exposure to patients with ID was found to
   be limited. Conclusions The shortfalls in content and unplanned clinical
   exposure suggest that a more focused teaching approach to people with ID
   will result in greater competence and confidence in graduates.}},

Abstract = {{Fish feed accounts for more than 50\% of aquaculture farms' operating
   costs and thus careful feeding planning is vital. In the case of the
   Mediterranean, most farms have their installations in coastal waters,
   hence this is relatively easy to perform. Low magnitude environmental
   conditions (winds, waves and currents) as well as easy and quick access
   ensures high consumption rates and smooth operation. Nevertheless, as
   competition for these waters increases the option of moving to offshore
   waters is seen as a solution. Moving further away from shore means
   exposing installations to harsher environments and lower degree of
   onshore monitoring. As a result, environmental conditions must now be
   monitored on-site, especially the ones affecting operations and feeding
   planning. For this reason, this article presents a feed management
   system powered by a stand-alone renewable energy sources system. The
   system provides energy independence and mobility by wirelessly
   transmitting important parameters onshore. An investment appraisal cost
   model is also described. The model compares the system's costs over the
   fish feed cost saved by a priori feeding planning through better
   monitoring of on-site conditions. It concludes that such synergies have
   profitable potentials.}},

Abstract = {{While a number of scales exist for studying explicit attitudes towards
   sexual minorities (i.e., lesbians, gay men and bisexuals), there is
   currently no heterosexual parallel. The utility of such a scale,
   however, would be a boon for researchers interested in comparative,
   longitudinal and/or experimental studies of attitudes based on sexual
   orientation. With this goal in mind, we created the attitudes towards
   heterosexuals scale (ATHS) and tested its psychometric properties across
   three studies. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed a
   uni-dimensional factor structure for the 15-item ATHS. Multiple groups'
   analysis suggested a similar factor structure for both heterosexuals and
   sexual minorities. We also investigated relationships between ATHS and
   other attitudinal, affective and demographic measures for evidence of
   construct validity. More positive attitudes on ATHS were related to more
   negative attitudes towards sexual minorities, less awareness of
   heterosexual privilege and greater positive affect towards
   heterosexuals. Lastly, we examined ATHS for temporal stability, finding
   high test-retest reliability. We offer ATHS as a measure to be used on
   its own, or in combination with other attitudinal measures, in research
   in a number of different fields across a number of different
   methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{Graffiti is a ubiquitous feature of the urban landscape commonly
   perceived to be a symptom of disorder, deprivation, and violence. Broken
   windows theory asserts that it is also a cause. To examine this, we
   conduct a geographic correlation study of graffiti and violence using
   geographic information systems. A strong spatial covariation is
   observed, with spatially dependent residual clusters suggesting that the
   graffiti-violence relationship is context dependent and varied. Ferrell
   and Weide's spot theory provides a lens for situating hot spots and
   facilitating a more nuanced interrogation of graffiti and violence in
   several Vancouver neighborhoods. We advocate for situated spatial
   analyses of interpersonal violence to inform public health interventions
   and advance policymaking beyond the popular aesthetic symbolism of urban
   space.

Abstract = {{There is an ongoing need for modeling voice communications in industrial
   applications, with system performance often depending on the accuracy of
   this information transfer. This article presents a case study using data
   from a human-in-the-loop experiment with a simulated flight environment

   investigate airborne spacing procedures. The interval management
   procedures during approach to an airport required a complex voice
   clearance issued by Air Traffic Control to a flight crew using radio
   communications. The time required for voice communication transfers is
   modeled, as is the time required for flight crews to complete data entry
   tasks. Commonly used reliability distributions are fit to the data, and
   the lognormal and log-logistic distributions are found to model the data
   reasonably well. Two analytical methods for calculating the confidence
   intervals for the lognormal mean are compared, and bootstrapping is used
   for log-logistic mean confidence intervals. Extensive investigation of
   outliers was performed to identify procedural anomalies. These initial
   results lead to design guidance for the phraseology used in air/ground

Abstract = {{According to the specific requirements and interests of users, search
   engines select and display advertisements that match user needs and have
   higher probability of attracting users' attention based on their
   previous search history. New objects such as user, advertisement or
   query cause a deterioration of precision in targeted advertising due to
   their lack of history. This article surveys this challenge. In the case
   of new objects, we first extract similar observed objects to the new
   object and then we use their history as the history of new object.
   Similarity between objects is measured based on correlation, which is a
   relation between user and advertisement when the advertisement is
   displayed to the user. This method is used for all objects, so it has
   helped us to accurately select relevant advertisements for users'
   queries. In our proposed model, we assume that similar users behave in a
   similar manner. We find that users with few queries are similar to new
   users. We will show that correlation between users and advertisements'
   keywords is high. Thus, users who pay attention to advertisements'
   keywords, click similar advertisements. In addition, users who pay
   attention to specific brand names might have similar behaviours too.}},

   polymerization of the casting solution containing 2-hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate (HEMA) and pre-dispersed silica nanoparticles in two glass
   sheets under pressure. Porous polyHEMA membranes were prepared via
   removing the silica nanoparticles embedded in the polymer matrix. Dense
   poly(HEMA/MAA)/SiO2 membranes were fabricated by adding methacrylic acid
   (MAA) as co-monomer without removing the silica nanoparticles. Membrane
   thickness could be conveniently controlled by varying the distance
   between the two slide glasses. Field emission scanning electron
   microscope (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water
   contact angle measurement were employed to characterize the morphology
   and surface chemical composition of the resultant membranes. The porous
   polyHEMA membranes exhibited high efficiency in purification of bovine
   serum albumin (BSA) from BSA/yeast solution while the dense
   poly(HEMA/MAA)/SiO2 membranes exhibited high rejection of orange Gll.
   Both porous membranes and dense membranes exhibited strong
   hydrophilicity as a result of hydrophilic monomer HEMA, leading to good
   antifouling properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

Title = {{Surfactant-modified flowerlike layered double hydroxide-coated magnetic
   nanoparticles for preconcentration of phthalate esters from
   environmental water samples}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},

Volume = {{1414}},

Abstract = {{A novel type of layered, flowerlike magnetic double hydroxide (MLDH)
   nanoparticles modified by surfactants has been successfully synthesized
   and was applied as an effective sorbent for pre-concentration of several
   phthalate ester pollutants (PAEs) from water prior to quantification.
   The MLDH was obtained via a simple ultrasound-assisted method by using
   silica coated Fe3O4 as the core and anisotropic Mg-Al layered double
   hydroxide (Mg-Al LDH) nanocrystals as the shell to which analytes were
   absorbed. Orientation and dimensionality hierarchical structure as well
   as the large expandable interlayer free space and positive charge of the
   Mg-Al LDH shell make it easier to form anionic surfactant micelles on
   its surface via self-assembly. Due to its high adsorption area, compared
   with non-mesoporous nano solid-phase extraction agents, mesoporous
   channel shell and reduction diffusion path, MLDH exhibited high
   extraction efficiency of organic target residues. Under optimized
   conditions, with a total of 30 mg of adsorbant added to from samples
   containing 400 mL water from the environment recoveries of DPP, DBP, DCP
   and DOP were consistent with ranges of 69-101\%, 79-101\%, 86-102\% and
   63-100\%, respectively. Standard deviations of recoveries ranged from 1
   to 7\%, respectively and the method was sensitive with limits of
   detection of 12.3, 18.7, 36.5 and 15.6 ng L-1. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first report of use of surfactant-modified MLDH
   nanoparticles and its application as adsorbent to pre-concentration of
   PAEs from environmental water samples prior to instrumental analyses.

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the efficiency of the combined therapy with
   metformin and dapaglifiozin, a new oral anti-diabetic drug with an
   insulin-independent mechanism of action, in the treatment of type-2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to DPP4 inhibitors, sulphonylureas and
   thiazolidindiones, also combined with metformin.
   Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a discrete event simulation
   model based on the results of the available clinical trials and
   considering patient's entire life as time horizon.
   Setting: National Health System perspective.
   Participants: The model simulated the natural history of 30,000 patients
   with T2DM for each of the options compared.
   Main measurements: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and economic
   consequences of managing the disease and its complications. The analysis
   considered direct costs updated to 2013. A discount rate of 3\% was
   applied to costs and health outcomes.
   Results: In the main analysis comparing dapagliflozin with DPP4
   inhibitors, dapagliflozin resulted in a treatment option that would
   provide a slightly higher effectiveness (0.019 QALY) and lower overall
   associated costs (-(sic)42). In the additional analyses, dapaglifiozin
   was a cost-effective option compared with sulphonylureas and
   thiazolidinediones resulting in a cost per QALY gained of (sic)3,560 and
   (sic)2,007, respectively. The univariate and probabilistic sensitivity
   analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.
   Conclusions: The results of the analyses performed suggested that
   dapaglifiozin, in combination with metformin, would be a cost-effective
   alternative in the Spanish context for the treatment of T2DM. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{With the increasing use of cloud services, for both providers and users,
   saving energy and using needed resources regardless of time and place
   have got outmost importance. Resource provisioning in the cloud
   providers has come along availability of workloads in a given time. Most
   cloud providers conduct inquiries with a limited amount of resources
   that may be cause to reject the request of customers at the peak of
   workloads. Cloud federation is an approach to share resources, enhance
   the scalability and availability. High energy consumption is one of the
   current challenges for cloud providers; also it should be discussed and
   researched about providers' profit as an important issue. We have
   presented an approach in this paper to reduce power consumption for IaaS
   Providers, by choosing the most appropriate host and allocating the best
   virtual machine which leads to satisfy users requests, save energy and
   reduce the cost of resources. Simulation results show that the proposed
   approach, compared to the other similar approaches, causes to increase
   utilization and turns off idle servers to decrease consumed power which
   followed by an increase in providers' profit.}},

Abstract = {{Multimedia content adaptation allows the ever increasing variety of
   handheld devices such as Smartphones to access distributed rich media
   resources available on the Internet today. Path planning and
   determination is a fundamental problem in enhancing performance of
   distributed multimedia content adaptation systems. Most of the existing
   path determination mechanisms use static path determination criteria
   based solely on associating a path with a single behavior aggregate
   score. However, some criteria such as availability are best represented
   using different functionality rather than being accumulated into the
   aggregate score. Moreover, since selection criteria have different
   behavior towards the score, this principle need to be considered. In
   this paper, we propose a dynamic multi-criteria path determination
   policy that selects an optimal path to the content adaptation services
   that best meet the user preferences and QoS requirements. The
   performance of the proposed approach is studied in terms of score's
   fairness and reliability under different variations. The results
   indicate that the proposed policy performs substantially better than the
   baseline policy.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleation and crystal growth of CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O (gypsum) was
   studied under simulated conditions of scale formation using a reverse
   osmosis desalination technique. Calcium chloride and sodium sulfate were
   mixed with concentrated sodium chloride solution (40 g/L), and the
   reaction mixture turbidity was measured at different time intervals to
   determine the induction time of precipitated gypsum. Induction time was
   measured under different high supersaturation ratios ranging from 3.92
   to 6.71. The induction time decreases exponentially with increasing the
   supersaturation. Using crystallization equations that relate induction
   times with supersaturation ratios, the free energy barrier and critical
   nuclei radius were calculated with and without addition of a scale
   inhibitor (trisodium phosphate, TSP). Rates of nucleation at a 4.47
   supersaturation ratio are 0.4 x 10(28) and 0.5 x 10(28) nuclei/cm(3).s

Abstract = {{In this paper the induced voltages along the length of the buried gas
   pipeline, due to the inductive coupling and conductive coupling between
   this pipeline and the overhead transmission line (OHTL), are calculated
   under normal and fault conditions of the OHTL. Also, this paper deals
   with the mitigation of these induced voltages. Fault conditions of the
   OHTL include symmetric and un-symmetric faults. Where, ATP software is
   used to simulate the OHTL under all fault conditions. The obtained
   results from the ATP program are used to calculate the pipeline induced
   voltages under both normal and fault conditions. Mitigation system to
   minimize the impact of the OHTL on pipelines at normal and fault
   conditions is designed. Under normal condition, the pipeline induced
   voltages, after earthing system (mitigation system) was erected, are
   measured and compared with the calculated values. Also, pipeline coating
   discharging current and pipeline AC current density due to inductive
   coupling under normal operation and due to inductive and conductive
   coupling under single phase to ground fault condition of the OHTL,
   before and after erecting the mitigation system, are calculated and

Abstract = {{Introduction: Although there are many literature examining the possible
   effects of varicocelectomy on classic semen parameters and recurrence
   rate, few published articles have examined the effect of conventional
   laparoscopic varicocelectomy on sperm DNA integrity. Objectives: The
   objective was to evaluate the effect of extensive laparoscopic venous
   disconnections on the recurrence rate and sperm DNA damage in varicocele
   patients. Methods: Totally, 54 patients with varicocele underwent
   extensive laparoscopic venous disconnections were assessed by clinical
   evaluation, duplex scan, semen analysis, and sperm DNA fragmentation
   assay before surgery and after 6 and 12 months following surgery.
   Results: No intra- or post-operative complications were observed and out
   of 54 patients preoperatively complained from varicocele 2 (3.7\%)
   patients' have recurrence during the follow-up period for 12 months. Out
   of 54 patients complaining from male infertility, 14 patients success to

Abstract = {{Theory-based evaluation (TBE) is an effectiveness assessment technique
   that critically analyses the theory underlying an intervention. Whilst
   its use has been widely reported in the area of social programmes, it is
   less applied in the field of energy and climate change policy
   evaluations. This paper reports a recent study that has evaluated the
   effectiveness of the national biofuel policy (NBP) for the transport
   sector in Malaysia by adapting a TBE approach. Three evaluation criteria
   were derived from the official goals of the NBP, those are (i) improve
   sustainability and environmental friendliness, (ii) reduce fossil fuel
   dependency, and (iii) enhance stakeholders' welfare. The policy theory
   underlying the NBP has been reconstructed through critical examination
   of the policy and regulatory documents followed by a rigorous appraisal
   of the causal link within the policy theory through the application of
   scientific knowledge. This study has identified several weaknesses in
   the policy framework that may engender the policy to be ineffective.
   Experiences with the use of a TBE approach for policy evaluations are
   also shared in this report. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the treatment of red mud by autoclave leaching for its
   conversion into ferrous hydrogarnet product and extraction of valuable
   components (i.e. Na2O, Al2O2, Ga and V2O5) was investigated. Leaching of
   red mud using high modulus alkaline solution (Na2O 240 g/L; alpha(kappa)
   = 30) in the presence of lime at 240-260 degrees C was found to allow
   the recovery of the contained values (98.5\% Na2O, 65.3\% Al2O2, 55.5\%
   Ga and 65.8\% V2O5) and the fixing silica in the form of hydrogarnet mud
   (3CaO center dot Fe2O3 center dot 2SiO(2)center dot 2H(2)O) with a low
   alkali content (0.35\% Na2O). An effective treatment scheme for the
   leach solution based on precipitation and two-stage carbonization
   processes was developed and demonstrated. This allowed the generation of
   alkaline solutions suitable for recycling back to leaching stage and
   recovery of a concentrate (30\% Al2O2) that is rich in Ga (0.32\%) and
   V2O5 (3.7\%). The chemical and phase composition of the solid products
   obtained from each stage of processing were determined by XRF and XRD
   analyses. This study has demonstrated that Bayer-hydrogarnet process can
   be suitably exploited for processing of red mud. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   lymphocyte differentiation and the immune response, little is known
   regarding its in vivo regulation. To address this issue, we established
   a mouse line with targeted deletion of the conserved non-coding sequence
   1 (CNS1) element found 3.6 kb upstream of the IL-7R alpha promoter. We
   report that IL-7R alpha is expressed normally on T and B cells in thymus
   and bone marrow of CNS1(-/-) mice except for in regulatory T cells. In
   contrast, these mice show reduced IL-7R alpha expression in conventional
   CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as regulatory T, NKT, and gamma delta T
   cells in the periphery. CD4 T cells of CNS1(-/-) mice showed IL-7R alpha
   upregulation in the absence of growth factors and IL-7R alpha
   downregulation by IL-7 or TCR stimulation, although the expression
   levels were lower than those in control mice. Naive CD4 and CD8 T cells
   of CNS1(-/-) mice show attenuated survival by culture with IL-7 and
   reduced homeostatic proliferation after transfer into lymphopenic hosts.
   CNS1(-/-) mice exhibit impaired maintenance of Ag-stimulated T cells.
   Furthermore, IL-7R alpha upregulation by glucocorticoids and TNF-alpha
   was abrogated in CNS1(-/-) mice. This work demonstrates that the CNS1
   element controls IL-7R alpha expression and maintenance of peripheral T
   cells, suggesting differential regulation of IL-7R alpha expression
   between central and peripheral lymphoid organs.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at investigating the presence of antibiotic-resistant
   Escherichia coli in river bed sediments of the Apies River, Gauteng,
   South Africa, in order to better inform health management decisions
   designed to protect users of the river. Overall, 180 water and sediment
   samples were collected at 10 sites along the Apies River from January to
   February 2014. E. coli was enumerated using the Colilert (R)
   18/Quanti-Tray (R) 2000 (IDEXX). Isolates were purified by streaking on
   eosin methylene blue agar followed by the indole test. Pure E. coli
   isolates were tested for resistance to nine antibiotics by the
   Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Over 98 \% of the isolates were
   resistant to at least one of the antibiotics tested. The highest
   resistance was observed against nitrofurantoin (sediments) and
   ampicillin (water). Over 80 \% of all resistant isolates showed multiple
   antibiotic resistance (resistance to >= 3 antibiotics). The abundance of
   E. coli in the sediments not only adds to the evidence that sediments
   are a reservoir for bacteria and possibly other pathogens including
   antibiotic-resistant bacteria but also suggests that
   antibiotic-resistant genes could be transferred to pathogens due to the
   high prevalence of multiple-antibiotic-resistant (MAR) strains of E.
   coli observed in the sediment. Using untreated water from the Apies
   River following resuspension for drinking and other household purposes
   could pose serious health risks for users. Our results suggest that
   river bed sediments could serve as reservoirs for MAR bacteria including
   pathogens under different climatic conditions and their analysis could
   provide information of public health concerns.}},

Abstract = {{The M17 leucine aminopeptidase (M17LAP) enzymes of the other
   apicomplexan parasites have been characterized and shown to be inhibited
   by bestatin. Though Babesia bovis also belongs to the apicomplexan
   group, it is not known whether its M17LAP could display similar
   biochemical properties as well as inhibition profile. To unravel this
   uncertainty, a B. bovis M17LAP (BbM17LAP) gene was expressed in
   Escherichia coli, and activity of the recombinant enzyme as well as its
   inhibition by bestatin were evaluated. The inhibitory effect of the
   compound on growths of B. bovis and Babesia gibsoni in vitro was also
   determined. The expression of the gene fused with glutathione
   S-transferase (GST) yielded approximately 81-kDa recombinant BbM17LAP
   (rBbM17LAP). On probing with mouse anti-rBbM17LAP serum, a green
   fluorescence was observed on the parasite cytosol on confocal laser
   microscopy, and a specific band greater than the predicted molecular
   mass was seen on Western blotting. The K-m and V-max values of the
   recombinant enzyme were 139.3 +/- 30.25 and 64.83 +/- 4.6 mu M,
   respectively, while the K-i was 2210 +/- 358 mu M after the inhibition.
   Bestatin was a more potent inhibitor of the growth of B. bovis {[}IC50
   (50\% inhibition concentration) = 131.7 +/- 51.43 mu M] than B. gibsoni
   {[}IC50 = 460.8 +/- 114.45 mu M] in vitro. The modest inhibition of both
   the rBbM17LAP activity and Babesia parasites' growth in vitro suggests
   that this inhibition may involve the endogenous enzyme in live
   parasites. Therefore, BbM17LAP may be a target of bestatin, though more
   studies with other aminopeptidase inhibitors are required to confirm
   this.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:Bariatric surgery (BS) is currently the most effective
   treatment for severe obesity. However, these weight loss procedures may
   result in the development of gut failure (GF) with the need for total
   parenteral nutrition (TPN). This retrospective study is the first to
   address the anatomic and functional spectrum of BS-associated GF with
   innovative surgical modalities to restore gut function.Methods:Over 2
   decades, 1500 adults with GF were referred with history of BS in 142
   (9\%). Of these, 131 (92\%) were evaluated and received
   multidisciplinary care. GF was due to catastrophic gut loss (Type-I,
   42\%), technical complications (Type-II, 33\%), and dysfunctional
   syndromes (Type-III, 25\%). Primary bariatric procedures were
   malabsorptive (5\%), restrictive (19\%), and combined (76\%). TPN
   duration ranged from 2 to 252 months.Results:Restorative surgery was
   performed in 116 (89\%) patients with utilization of visceral
   transplantation as a rescue therapy in 23 (20\%). With a total of 317
   surgical procedures, 198 (62\%) were autologous reconstructions; 88
   (44\%) foregut, 100 (51\%) midgut, and 10 (5\%) hindgut. An
   interposition alimentary conduit was used in 7 (6\%) patients. Reversal
   of BS was indicated in 84 (72\%) and intestinal lengthening was required
   in 10 (9\%). Cumulative patient survival was 96\% at 1 year, 84\% at 5
   years, and 72\% at 15 years. Nutritional autonomy was restored in 83\%
   of current survivors with persistence or relapse of obesity in
   23\%.Conclusions:GF is a rare but serious life-threatening complication
   after BS. Successful outcome is achievable with comprehensive
   management, including reconstructive surgery and visceral
   transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Ebola virus disease (EVD) is at the moment a global pandemic
   disease. The importance of public awareness and alertness toward the
   disease cannot be underestimated since it is an important step to
   prevent unnecessary anxiety, fear, as well as an excessive reaction that
   accompany such anxiety. The main objective of this study is to assess
   the current level of knowledge and perception of students and staff at
   Universiti Sains Malaysia toward EVD.
   Method: A cross sectional survey method was used, and a
   self-administered questionnaire was used as an instrument for data
   collection. The questionnaire consisted of three sections. Section A
   with 6 questions pertaining to demographic data of respondents', Section
   B had 20 questions pertaining to respondents knowledge of cause,
   symptoms, transmission, prevention, and current affairs about EVD.
   Section C had 12 questions pertaining to respondents' perception toward
   EVD. Respondents in this study included both students and staff.
   Results: From the 520 questionnaire (400 among students and 120 among
   staff) distributed, only 458 were retrieved (380 from students and 78
   from staff). Results showed that majority of the students were female
   (163; 66.0\% for undergraduates, 71; 53.4\% for postgraduate and 50;
   64.1\% for staff). The majority of the students first learned about EVD
   from the internet (193, 80.4\%; 102, 81.0\%; and 43, 58.9\%,
   respectively, for undergraduate, postgraduate, and staff). This study
   found that the current level of knowledge about EVD among respondents is
   low (median knowledge score <50\%). However, postgraduate students
   possess more knowledge than undergraduate and staff (median score
   46.2\%, P = 0.002). In addition, staff respondents from the university
   hospital (clinic) were found to possess more knowledge than other
   category of staff (median score = 61.5\%, P = 0.002). Furthermore,
   sciences based students were found to have more knowledge than arts and
   social sciences based students (median score = 46.2\%, P < 0.0001). Most
   of the respondents; 136 (56.7\%), 52 (41.3\%), and 30 (41.1\%),
   respectively, of undergraduates, postgraduates, and staff have a
   misconception that there are foods that can effectively cure or prevent
   EVD. The internet was found to be the most commonly acceptable method
   for provision of education about EVD among undergraduate, 64 (27.7\%)
   and postgraduate students, 32 (26.2\%). A combination of internet, TV
   shows and awareness campaign was found to be the most acceptable way to
   provide EVD education among staff (26, 41.9\%).
   Conclusion: It was concluded that the current level of knowledge among
   students and staff regarding EVD is low and there is a need to raise
   awareness about EVD among the university population.}},

   Hispanic BRCA mutations (HISPANEL). Among the 266 cases, 13 deleterious
   mutations were identified (11 in BRCA1 and 2 in BRCA2), representing 5\%
   of the total. The average age of breast cancer in the mutation-positive
   cases was 44 years. BRCA1 185delAG represented 7 of 11 mutations in
   BRCA1. Other mutations detected in BRCA1 included: two 2080delA, one
   943ins10, and one 3878delTA. The BRCA2 3036del4 mutation was seen in two
   patients. Given the relatively low cost of the HISPANEL test, one should
   consider offering this test to all Peruvian women with breast or ovarian
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Islet antigen (IA)-2, IA-2b, and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65) are
   major autoantigens in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Autoantibodies to these
   autoantigens appear years before disease onset and are widely used as
   predictive markers. Little is known, however, about what regulates the
   expression of these autoantigens. The present experiments were initiated
   to test the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRNAs) can target and affect the
   levels of these autoantigens. Bioinformatics was used to identify miRNAs
   predicted to target the mRNAs coding IA-2, IA-2b, and GAD65. RNA
   interference for the miRNA processing enzyme Dicer1 and individual miRNA
   mimics and inhibitors were used to confirm the effect in mouse islets
   and MIN6 cells. We show that the imprinted 14q32 miRNA cluster contains
   56 miRNAs, 32 of which are predicted to target the mRNAs of T1D
   autoantigens and 12 of which are glucose-sensitive. Using miRNA mimics
   and inhibitors, we confirmed that at least 7 of these miRNAs modulate
   the mRNA levels of the T1D autoantigens. Dicer1 knockdown significantly
   reduced the mRNA levels of all 3 autoantigens, further confirming the
   importance of miRNAs in this regulation. We conclude that miRNAs are
   involved in regulating the expression of the major T1D autoantigens.}},

Abstract = {{Education and health care policies in Ghana since independence have been
   universalist in approach providing free universal health care and free
   basic and tertiary education until the early 1980s. Precipitated
   primarily by a severe drought, stagnant economic growth, mismanagement,
   and political instability, Ghana undertook major economic reforms with
   prodding from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in a bid to
   salvage the economy. These economic measures included cost recovery and
   cutback spending in education and health sectors. However, in recent
   years, purposive targeted interventions have been pursued to address
   inequalities in education and health care. These new programs include
   the Education Capitation Grant, school feeding program, and the National
   Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), which are propelling Ghana toward the
   achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The prospects of these
   programs in addressing disparities in access to education and health
   care in the country and recommendations for improved delivery are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and trigger finger may be seen
   simultaneously in the same hand. The development of trigger finger in
   patients undergoing CTS surgery is not rare, but the relationship
   between these conditions has not been fully established. The aims of
   this prospective randomized study were to investigate the incidence of
   trigger finger in patient groups undergoing transverse carpal ligament
   releasing (TCL) or TCL together with distal forearm fascia releasing and
   to identify other factors that may have an effect of these conditions.
   Materials and Method This prospective randomized study evaluated 159
   hands of 113 patients for whom CTS surgery was planned. The patients
   were separated into 2 groups: group 1 (79 hands of 57 patients)
   undergoing TCL releasing only and group 2 (80 hands of 56 patients)
   undergoing TCL and distal forearm fascia releasing together. The age and
   gender of the patients, dominant hand, physical examination findings,
   visual analogue scale (VAS), and electromyography (EMG) results were
   recorded. Follow-up examinations were made at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months
   for all patients. We noted development of trigger finger in the surgical
   groups, and its location and response to treatment.
   Results The incidence of trigger finger development was statistically
   significantly different between group 1 and group 2 (13.9\% and 31.3\%,
   respectively). The logistic regression analysis of factors affecting the
   development of trigger finger posttreatment found that the surgical
   method and severity of EMG were significant, whereas the effects of the
   other factors studied were not found to have any statistical
   significance.
   Conclusion There was an increased risk of postoperative trigger finger
   development in patients undergoing TCL and distal forearm fascia
   releasing surgery for CTS compared to those undergoing CTL only. There
   is a need for further studies to support this result and further explain
   the etiology.}},

Abstract = {{Background Asian-Americans outlive whites by an average of nearly 8
   years. By determining the sources of the Asian mortality advantage, we
   can pinpoint where there is the greatest potential for raising the life
   expectancy of whites and other groups in the USA.
   Methods Our analyses include all Asian and white deaths in the USA
   between 2006 and 2010, from the Center for Disease Control. Using the
   International Classification of Diseases (V.10), we code causes of
   deaths into 19 categories, based on the most common causes as well as
   causes particularly relevant to racial differences. We then create life
   tables and apply a newly-developed demographic method to determine
   whether Asians have longer life expectancy because they are less likely
   than whites to die of causes of death that strike at younger ages, or
   because they tend to outlive whites regardless of cause of death.
   Results Nearly 90\% of the Asian-white life expectancy gap is
   attributable to the fact that Asians tend to outlive whites regardless
   of the cause of death. The causes that contribute the most to the gap
   are heart disease (24\%) and cancers (18\%). Men contribute somewhat
   more to the gap than women do (55\% vs 45\%), primarily because
   Asian-white differences in mortality are greater among men than among
   women with respect to suicide, traffic accidents and accidental
   poisoning.
   Conclusions For almost all causes of death, Asian victims tend to be
   older than white victims. The greatest potential for raising the life
   expectancy of whites to that of Asians, then, resides in efforts that
   effectively increase whites' average age at death for the most common
   causes of death.}},

Abstract = {{The very demanding requirements of the SKA-low instrument call for a
   challenging antenna design capable of delivering excellent performance
   in radiation patterns, impedance matching, polarization purity, cost,
   longevity, etc. This paper is devoted to the development (design and
   test of the first prototypes) of an active ultra-wideband antenna
   element for the low-frequency instrument of the SKA radio telescope. The
   antenna element and differential low noise amplifier described here were
   originally designed to cover the former SKA-low band (70-450 MHz) but it
   is now aimed to cover the re-defined SKA-low band (50-350 MHz) and
   furthermore the antenna is capable of performing up to 650 MHz with the
   current design. The design is focused on maximum sensitivity in a wide
   field of view (+/- 45A degrees from zenith) and low cross-polarization
   ratios. Furthermore, the size and cost of the element has to be kept to
   a minimum as millions of these antennas will need to be deployed for the
   full SKA in very compact configurations. The primary focus of this paper
   is therefore to discuss various design implications for the SKA-low
   telescope.}},

Abstract = {{A technical ingredient in Faltings' original approach to p-adic
   comparison theorems involves the construction of K(pi, 1)-neighborhoods

   ring with a perfect residue field: every point x is an element of X has
   an open neighborhood U whose generic fiber is a K(pi, 1) scheme (a
   notion analogous to having a contractible universal cover). We show how
   to extend this result to the logarithmically smooth case, which might
   help to simplify some proofs in p-adic Hodge theory. The main ingredient
   of the proof is a variant of a trick of Nagata used in his proof of the
   Noether normalization lemma.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Visual search is an essential task for many lifesaving professions;
   airport security personnel search baggage X-ray images for dangerous
   items and radiologists examine radiographs for tumors. Accuracy is
   critical for such searches; however, there are potentially negative
   influences that can affect performance; for example, the displays can be
   cluttered and can contain multiple targets. Previous research has
   demonstrated that clutter can hurt search performance and a second
   target is less likely to be detected in a multiple-target search after a
   first target has been found, which raises a concernhow does clutter
   affect multiple-target search performance? The current study explored
   clutter in a multiple-target search paradigm, where there could be one
   or two targets present, and targets appeared in varying levels of
   clutter. There was a significant interaction between clutter and target
   number: Increasing levels of clutter did not affect single-target
   detection but did reduce detection of a second target. Multiple-target
   search accuracy is known to be sensitive to contextual influences, and
   the current results reveal a specific effect wherein clutter
   disproportionally affected multiple-target search accuracy. These
   results suggest that the detection and processing of a first target
   might enhance the masking effects of clutter around a second target.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This clinical focus article presents an illustration of a
   complex communication intervention, the Social Communication
   Intervention Programme (SCIP), as delivered to a child who has a social
   communication disorder (SCD). The SCIP intervention combined language
   processing and pragmatic and social understanding therapies in a program
   of individualized therapy activities and in close liaison with families.
   Method: The study used an enhanced AB single-subject design in which an
   8-year-old child with an SCD participated in 20 therapy sessions with a
   specialist speech-language pathologist. A procedure of matching
   assessment findings to intervention choices was followed to construct an
   individualized treatment program. Examples of intervention content and
   the embedded structure of SCIP are illustrated. Observational and formal
   measurements of receptive and expressive language, conversation, and
   parent-teacher ratings of social communication were completed before
   therapy, after therapy, and at a 6-month follow-up session.
   Results: Outcomes revealed change in total and receptive language scores
   but not in expressive language. Conversation showed marked improvement
   in responsiveness, appreciation of listener knowledge, turn taking, and
   adaptation of discourse style. Teacher-reported outcomes included
   improved classroom behavior and enhanced literacy skills.
   Parent-reported outcomes included improved verbal interactions with
   family members and personal narratives.
   Conclusions: This clinical focus article demonstrates the complexity of
   needs in a child with an SCD and how these can be addressed in
   individualized intervention. Findings are discussed in relation to the
   essential nature of language support including pragmatic therapy for
   children with SCDs. Discussion of the role of formal and functional
   outcome measurement as well as the proximity of chosen outcomes to the
   intervention is included.}},

Abstract = {{Chitosan multiple addition strategy was developed to improve laccase
   production from Trametes versicolor cultures. The optimized multiple
   addition strategy was carried out by two-time addition of 0.1 g L-1
   chitosan to a 2-day-old culture media, with 24-h interval between the
   treatments. Under these conditions, laccase activity of 644.9 U l(-1)
   was achieved on the seventh day and laccase production was improved by
   93.5 \% higher than the control. Chitosan treatment increased reactive
   oxygen species generation and extracellular protein concentration in the
   treated mycelia. In contrast, the inducer inhibited the mycelia growth.
   The result of the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
   reaction showed that the copy number of the laccase gene transcript
   increased by 16.7-fold in the treated mycelia relative to the control.
   This study provides insight into some of the intrinsic metabolic
   processes involved in the upregulation of laccase production in the

Abstract = {{Germinal center (GC) B cells undergo apoptosis after B cell receptor
   (BCR) ligation, unless they receive CD40-mediated survival signal from
   helper T cells. In the present study, we used a human follicular
   lymphoma cell line HF1A3, as an in vitro model to study the selection
   process in germinal centers. We show here that BCR ligation led to
   immediate ERK1/2 activation and phosphorylations of its downstream
   targets, Bim EL/L and Bcl-2 (at Ser70) which resulted in short-term
   survival. On the other hand, during the late phase of BCR signaling,
   ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited which resulted in apoptosis. In
   addition, CD40 signaling led to sustained ERK1/2 activation and
   up-regulation of Bc1-xL in BCR-primed HF1A3 GC B cells. In conclusion,
   MEK-ERK pathway and Bc1-2 family proteins are crucial players in
   BCR-mediated survival/apoptosis and CD40-mediated survival. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   technique for global optimization. Many variants of the technique have
   been proposed in literature. However, two major things characterize many
   of these variants namely, static search space and velocity limits, which
   bound their flexibilities in obtaining optimal solutions for many
   optimization problems. Furthermore, the problem of premature convergence
   persists in many variants despite the introduction of additional
   parameters such as inertia weight and extra computation ability. This
   paper proposes an improved PSO algorithm without inertia weight. The
   proposed algorithm dynamically adjusts the search space and velocity
   limits for the swarm in each iteration by picking the highest and lowest
   values among all the dimensions of the particles, calculates their
   absolute values and then uses the higher of the two values to define a
   new search range and velocity limits for next iteration. The efficiency
   and performance of the proposed algorithm was shown using popular
   benchmark global optimization problems with low and high dimensions.
   Results obtained demonstrate better convergence speed and precision,
   stability, robustness with better global search ability when compared
   with six recent variants of the original algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal design of switching converters for the integration and optimal
   exploitation of renewable energy sources (RES) represents a crucial
   issue often debated in the recent power electronics literature. The
   design problem required to carry out a multiobjective optimization
   characterized by simultaneous conflicting objectives, such as
   efficiency, reliability, and price, where the best compromise solution
   should be found by the decision maker among Pareto-optimal solutions. In
   this paper, a novel design method for distributed maximum power point
   tracking (DMPPT) synchronous boost converter is proposed. The method is
   based on nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with the aim to obtain
   the best synchronous rectification (SR) boost topology while considering
   different targets such as converter efficiency and reliability
   maximization, as well as converter price minimization. New weighted
   indices are also proposed for a more realistic characterization of the
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of optical sensor technology to monitor the milk
   quality on dairy farms and milk processing plants would support the
   early detection of altering production processes. Basic visible and
   near-infrared spectroscopy is already widely used to measure the
   composition of agricultural and food products. However, to obtain
   maximal performance, the design of such optical sensors should be
   optimized with regard to the optical properties of the samples to be
   measured. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the visible
   and near-infrared bulk absorption coefficient, bulk scattering
   coefficient, and scattering anisotropy spectra for a diverse set of raw
   milk samples originating from individual cow milkings, representing the
   milk variability present on dairy farms. Accordingly, this database of
   bulk optical properties can be used in future simulation studies to
   efficiently optimize and validate the design of an optical milk quality
   sensor. In a next step of the current study, the relation between the
   obtained bulk optical properties and milk quality properties was
   analyzed in detail. The bulk absorption coefficient spectra were found
   to mainly contain information on the water, fat, and casein content,
   whereas the bulk scattering coefficient spectra were found to be
   primarily influenced by the quantity and the size of the fat globules.
   Moreover, a strong positive correlation (r >= 0.975) was found between
   the fat content in raw milk and the measured bulk scattering
   coefficients in the 1,300 to 1,400 nm wavelength range. Relative to the
   bulk scattering coefficient, the variability on the scattering
   anisotropy factor was found to be limited. This is because the milk
   scattering anisotropy is nearly independent of the fat globule and
   casein micelle quantity, while it is mainly determined by the size of
   the fat globules. As this study shows high correlations between the
   sample's bulk optical properties and the milk composition and fat
   globule size, a sensor that allows for robust separation between the
   absorption and scattering properties would enable accurate prediction of
   the raw milk quality parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The Slavonic translation of the Life of Saint Euthymius the Great (BHG
   647) by Cyril of Scythopolis, attested at the earliest manuscript of the
   late 14th c., was probably made by a person originating from South-East
   Rus in the 11th c., as it displays some grammatical, lexical, and
   phonetic features peculiar for this area and time, and visible, in
   particular, in Ipatiev Chronicle and the Tale of Igor's Campaign. It may
   have formed a part of the collection comprising several writings by
   Cyril, including the Life of Saint Sabas and the Praise of Euthymius and
   Sabas (lost in the Greek original). This collection was later
   incorporated into the Great Lectionary Menologion of Metropolitan
   Makarij. The details added by the translator to the description of
   certain realia pertaining to the Monastery of Saint Euthymius in
   Palestine suggest a personal knowledge of that monastic complex (the
   Laura and the coenobium). The proposed author of the translation is
   Saint Anthony of the Cave Monastery in Kiev (+ 1073), who could
   perfectly well have visited the Holy Land during his stay on Mount Athos
   prior to 1051.}},

Abstract = {{At least 52 eruption centres are scattered within the similar to 360
   km(2) Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF). Motukorea, now an island in the
   Waitemata Harbour, is one of 39 AVF volcanoes that experienced a
   phreatomagmatic explosive phase, before a magmatic phase. The volcano
   erupted through a similar to 200-300 m-thick, consolidated,
   mudstone/sandstone sequence of the Miocene Waitemata Group, which
   overlies the Waipapa Terrane greywacke basement. Detailed field
   descriptions of the sedimentary characteristics of the early
   phreatomagmatic deposits were carried out, along with examination of
   lithics. The ejecta ring deposit comprises 55.to 60 vol.\% lithics, of
   which Waitemata Group fragments constitute approximately 90 vol.\%,
   whereas <10 vol.\% are Waipapa fragments, suggesting a dominance of
   shallow fragmentation. The sedimentary characteristics of the
   stratigraphic sequence at Motukorea suggest a dominance of wet surges at
   the beginning of the eruption with progression into drier sequences
   upwards. This is reflected in increasing inter-bedded
   juvenile-pyroclast-dominated fall deposits up-sequence. These
   characteristics are attributed to the changing hydrogeological
   conditions within the diatreme and the host rocks. These findings shed
   light on the eruption dynamics of phreatomagmatic eruptions through
   consolidated rocks in the AVF and enable the depiction of a scenario of
   future eruptions within the field in similar substrates. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Post-operative nausea vomiting (PONV) is a distressing
   complaint particularly in high-risk patients. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists
   has proved a promising role in the prophylaxis of PONV.
   Aim: We aim to compare the anti-emetic responsiveness of ramosetron and
   palonosetron in post-operative patients of middle ear surgeries.
   Materials and Methods: In the present randomized, prospective
   double-blind study is including 60 American Society of Anesthesiology
   Grade I/II female patients, between 25 and 40 years of age undergoing
   elective middle ear surgeries. Patients were divided into two groups;
   Group R: Injection ramosetron 0.3 mg (intravenous {[}IV]) in 2 ml
   solution and Group P: Injection palonosetron 0.075 mg (IV) made 2 ml
   after adding 0.5 ml normal saline, were administered for prevention of
   PONV in the present study. The study drugs were administered before
   shifting of the patient from the operating room to the post anesthesia
   care unit. The efficacy, as well as side effects of ramosetron and
   palonosetron was documented and compared.
   Results: In the present study, the complete response was observed in
   90.91\% and 70.91\% of the patients observed during 0-2 h and 2-24 h
   respectively in Group R while in Group P no PONV was found in 92.73\%
   and 80\% of the patients within the same time frame (P > 0.05). However,
   during 24-48 h significant complete response was observed among both the
   groups (P = 0.03). Severity of nausea, retching and vomiting was also
   found to be significantly high in ramosetron group as compared to the
   patients received palonosetron. Total rescue antiemetic was given more
   among ramosetron group. However, no significant difference was observed
   when compared with palonosetron group (P = 0.11).
   Conclusion: Palonosetron was found an effective and better antiemetic
   than ramosetron in patients undergoing middle ear surgeries.}},

Title = {{The effect of dietary wheat bran on sucrose-induced changes of serum

Abstract = {{Introduction: wheat bran has been known for many health benefits, but
   its glucose- and lipid-lowering activity still remains unresolved.
   Objective: to investigate effects of varying amounts of wheat bran and
   feeding period on serum glucose and lipids in sucrose-fed rats.
   Methods: eighty male Sprague Dawley rats were assigned into 4
   sucrose-based diets containing either 0, 5, 10 or 20\% wheat bran (WB)
   and given ad libitum to rats for 4, 8, 12 or 16 weeks. Serum glucose,
   total cholesterol (TC), low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   (LDL-C and HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL) and total
   lipids (TL) were quantified at end of each feeding period and other
   biological parameters were assessed.
   Results: in all feeding periods, food intake showed ascending linear
   trend (p <0.05), whereas body weight did not respond to WB. Compared to
   0\%, 10 or 20\% WB induced decrease (p <0.05) in TC (16 weeks) and HDL-C
   (12 or 16 weeks), whereas 5, 10 or 20\% WB induced similar decrease in
   PL (4 or 12 weeks), TL (all periods) and glucose (4 or 8 weeks). This
   glucose- and lipid- lowering effect was substantiated by descending
   linear responses (p <0.05) to WB. PL and TL descending responses to WB
   were seen in all feeding periods. TG exhibited no change with WB, but
   linearly responded (4 or 8 weeks). Differences in glucose or lipid
   variables of rats fed WB diets for all feeding periods were less
   evident.
   Conclusions: results suggest that wheat bran reduces serum glucose and
   lipids mainly phospholipids in sucrose fed rats in an interaction that
   is likely to have clinical implications in cardiometabolic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate whole substitution of Egyptian
   berseem hay (Trifolium alexandrinum) with a mixture of Atriplex
   nummuiaria and Acacia saligna (1:1 DM) in the diet of Barki lambs for 70
   days. Thirty six lambs (27.0 +/- 0.89 kg initial BW) were divided into
   four treatment groups of nine lambs each and fed: (1) the Control group
   with no substitution (70\% concentrate mixture and 30\% berseem hay, DM
   basis), (2) A. nummularia and A. saligna mixture without fungal
   treatment (treatment group AU), or (3) Trichoderma reesei treated A.
   nummularia and A. saligna mixture (treatment group AF), or (4) A.
   nummularia and A. saligna mixture supplemented with Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae at 0.5 g/kg DM of feed (treatment group AS) replaced 100\% of
   berseem hay in the diet Live-weight change, rumen fermentation
   parameters, blood chemistry, carcass characteristics and intestinal
   histology were investigated. Significant (P < 0.05) interactions
   occurred between diet and period for feed conversio(n) efficiency and
   blood serum urea. Lambs in the AS treatment consumed less (P < 0.05)
   feed than lambs in the AF treatment, with no difference between the
   other treatments (P > 0.05). Lambs fed AF and AU diets had lower (P <
   0.05) feed conversion efficiency than lambs fed the AS and Control
   diets. Lambs fed AF and AS had increased (P < 0.05) volatile fatty acid
   production compared to Controls. Blood albumin and urea concentrations
   increased (P < 0.05) with lambs in AS treatment compared to lambs in the
   other treatments, while lambs fed AF had lower (P < 0.05) cholesterol
   and glucose concentrations compared to the Controls. The AS lambs had
   the highest (P < 0.05) dressing percentage. Decreased intramuscular fat
   weights were obtained with lambs fed halophytes compared to Control
   lambs. Histology of the ileum, sub mucosa and Peyer's patches were
   normal in all lambs. In conclusion, untreated halophyte mixtures of A.
   nummularia and A. saligna (at 1:1 DM) can be substituted for berseem hay
   without negative effects on performance while treatment with S.
   cerevisiae may improve performance and, like T. reesei, change certain
   biochemical responses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   into a video-rate confocal microscopy system, we successfully performed
   minimally-invasive in vivo cellular-level visualization of various
   fluorescent cells and microvasculature in the small intestinal villi.
   Also, with a transgenic mouse universally expressing photoconvertible
   protein, Kaede, we demonstrated repetitive cellular-level confocal
   endoscopic visualization of same area in the small intestinal lumen of a
   single mouse, which revealed the continuous homeostatic renewal of the

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate whether the computed
   tomography (CT) texture features of primary tumors are associated with
   the overall survival (OS) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
   undergoing definitive concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).
   Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 98 patients (83 men
   and 15 women; mean age, 61.9 8.0 years) with unresectable NSCLCs (stage
   IIIA, 45; stage IIIB, 53) underwent definitive CCRT at our institution
   from January 2006 to December 2011. Patients were followed up for 3
   years or until death. The CT texture parameters of primary tumors were
   extracted from contrast-enhanced CT images taken before CCRT using an
   in-house software program. Each texture parameter was dichotomized based
   on their optimal cutoff values obtained from receiver operating
   characteristics curve analysis. Three-year OS was compared between the
   dichotomized subgroups using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank
   test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine
   significant prognostic factors.
   Results The 3-year cumulative survival rate was 0.51. The mean 3-year OS
   was 24.0 months (95\% confidence interval, 21.5-26.6 months). There were
   no significant differences in 3-year OS according to tumor stage or
   histologic subtypes. However, entropy (P = 0.030), skewness (P = 0.021),
   and mean attenuation (P = 0.030) were shown to be significantly
   associated with 3-year OS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed
   that higher entropy (adjusted hazard ratio {[}HR],2.31; P = 0.040),
   higher skewness (adjusted HR,1.92; P = 0.046), and higher mean
   attenuation (adjusted HR,1.93; P = 0.028) were independent predictors of
   decreased 3-year OS.
   Conclusions Computed tomography texture features have the potential to
   be used as prognostic biomarkers in unresectable NSCLC patients
   undergoing definitive CCRT.}},

Title = {{Denervation of the Lacrimal Gland Leads to Corneal Hypoalgesia in a

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Some dry eye disease (DED) patients have sensitized responses
   to corneal stimulation, while others experience hypoalgesia. Many
   patients have normal tear production, suggesting that reduced tears are
   not always the cause of DED sensory dysfunction. In this study, we show
   that disruption of lacrimal innervation can produce hypoalgesia without
   changing basal tear production.
   METHODS. Injection of a saporin toxin conjugate into the extraorbital
   lacrimal gland of male Sprague-Dawley rats was used to disrupt
   cholinergic innervation to the gland. Tear production was assessed by
   phenol thread test. Corneal sensory responses to noxious stimuli were
   assessed using eye wipe behavior. Saporin DED animals were compared to
   animals treated with atropine to produce aqueous DED.
   RESULTS. Cholinergic innervation and acetylcholine content of the
   lacrimal gland were significantly reduced in saporin DED animals, yet
   basal tear production was normal. Saporin DED animals demonstrated
   normal eye wipe responses to corneal application of capsaicin, but
   showed hypoalgesia to corneal menthol. Corneal nerve fiber density was
   normal in saporin DED animals. Atropine-treated animals had reduced tear
   production but normal responses to ocular stimuli.
   CONCLUSIONS. Because only menthol responses were impaired,
   cold-sensitive corneal afferents appear to be selectively altered in our
   saporin DED model. Hypoalgesia is not due to reduced tear production,
   since we did not observe hypoalgesia in an atropine DED model. Corneal
   fiber density is unaltered in saporin DED animals, suggesting that
   molecular mechanisms of nociceptive signaling may be impaired. The
   saporin DED model will be useful for exploring the mechanism underlying
   corneal hypoalgesia.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the stability properties of interest rate rules granting an
   explicit response to stock prices in a New Keynesian DSGE model where
   the presence of non-Ricardian households makes stock prices nonredundant
   for the business cycle. We find that responding to stock prices enlarges
   the policy space for which the equilibrium is both determinate and
   E-stable (learnable). In particular, the Taylor principle ceases to be
   necessary, and determinacy/E-stability is granted also by mildly passive
   policy rules. Our results appear to be more prominent in economies
   featuring a lower elasticity of substitution across differentiated
   products and/or more rigid labor markets.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this research is to study the relationship between
   organizational cynicism and organizational trust levels among teachers.
   The research is designed as a correlational survey study. The research
   data were collected using the Organizational Cynicism Scale for Teachers
   and the Scale of Trust Culture in Organizational Atmosphere. In the
   study there were 369 participants comprising teachers from primary,
   middle and high schools. Findings suggest that the teachers
   participating in the research have a low level of cynicism and feel a
   high level of trust in the school atmosphere. The MANOVA results have
   suggested that cynicism and trust levels among teachers do not vary
   based on their gender and their length of service at their current
   school. The research results have revealed a significant relationship
   between organizational cynicism and trust levels among teachers in all
   dimensions. The multiple linear regression analysis results have, as
   anticipated, suggested that organizational cynicism predicts
   organizational trust. These results suggest that organizational cynicism
   must be paid more attention in creating an organizational trust
   atmosphere that is believed to have significant impact on school
   effectiveness, teacher performance and student success.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the generation of high-quality and high-energy micro
   electron beam in vacuum by a chirped Gaussian laser pulse in the
   presence of an axial magnetic field is numerically investigated. The
   features of energy and angular spectra, emittances, and position
   distribution of electron beam are compared in two cases, i.e., in the
   presence and absence of an external magnetic field. The electron beam is
   accelerated with higher energy and qualified in spatial distribution in
   the presence of the magnetic field. The presence of an axial magnetic
   field improves electron beam spatial quality as well as its gained
   energy through keeping the electron motion parallel to the direction of
   propagation for longer distances. It has been found that a 64 mu m
   electron bunch with about MeV initial energy becomes a 20 mu m electron
   beam with high energy of the order of GeV, after interacting with a
   laser pulse in the presence of an external magnetic field. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{Characteristics of cyclones (frequency, intensity and size) and their
   changes in the Arctic region in a warmer climate have been analyzed with
   the use of the HIRHAM regional climate model simulations with SRES-A1B
   anthropogenic scenario for the twenty first century. The focus was on
   cyclones for the warm (April-September) and cold (October-March)
   seasons. The present-day cyclonic characteristics from HIRHAM
   simulations are in general agreement with those from ERA-40 reanalysis
   data. Differences noted for the frequency of cyclones are related with
   different spatial resolution in the model simulations and reanalysis
   data. Potential future changes in cyclone characteristics at the end of
   the twenty first century have been analyzed. According to the model
   simulations, the frequency of cyclones is increasing in warm seasons and
   decreasing in cold seasons for a warmer climate in the twenty first
   century, but these changes are statistically insignificant. Noticeable
   changes were detected for the intensity and size of cyclones for the
   both seasons. Significant increase was found for the frequency of weak
   cyclones during cold season. Further, a general increase in the
   frequency of small cyclones was calculated in cold seasons, while its
   frequency decreases in warm seasons.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Phyllodes tumors are uncommon neoplasms of the breast. Data
   about their outcome is limited. This study aims to evaluate patients
   diagnosed with phyllodes tumors in terms of local recurrence, distant
   metastasis and overall survival.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 129 women
   with phyllodes tumors who referred to our center from 1999 to 2013.
   Clinical and pathological features, local and regional recurrence,
   distant metastasis and overall survival were determined. SPSS 15.0
   statistical software was used for analysis.
   Results: Mean patient age was 39 years (17-67 years). Mean size of the
   tumor was 5.38 cm. There were 105 (81.4\%) benign, 8 (6.2\%) borderline
   and 16 (12.4\%) malignant tumors. The mean follow-up period of patients
   was 28 months (6 to 128 months). The rate of local recurrence among
   benign tumors was 3.8\% (4 cases); in borderline cases the rate was
   12.5\% (1 case) and for malignant cases, it was 18.7\% (3 cases). Three
   patients each recurred twice and one patient had local recurrence for a
   third time. Two patients died of malignant tumor-related disease - one
   due to advanced regional recurrence and lung metastasis, and the other
   to wide-spread metastasis. Another patient died from an unrelated cause
   (myocardial infarction) one year after surgery. For those with malignant
   phyllodes tumors, the five-year overall survival was 77.8\% and
   disease-free survival rate was 85.7\%.
   Conclusion: Although, the prognosis for phyllodes tumors is good, the
   malignancy rate is higher in older patients and those with larger
   tumors. A higher local recurrence rate in malignant phyllodes tumors
   suggests the importance for adequate resection of margins in surgical
   management of these tumors.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the relationship between peak match speed (PMS) and
   maximal sprinting speed (MSS) in regard to age and playing positions.
   MSS and absolute PMS (PMSAbs) were collected from 180 male youth soccer
   players (U13-U17, 15.0 +/- 1.2 y, 161.5 +/- 9.2 cm, and 48.3 +/- 8.7
   kg). The fastest 10-m split over a 40-m sprint was used to determine
   MSS. PMSAbs was recorded using a global positioning system and was also
   expressed as a percentage of MSS (PMSRel). Sprint data were compared
   between age groups and between playing positions. Results showed that
   regardless of age and playing positions, faster players were likely to
   reach higher PMSAbs and possibly lower PMSRel. Despite a lower PMSAbs
   than in older groups (eg, 23.4 +/- 1.8 vs 26.8 +/- 1.9 km/h for U13 and
   U17, respectively, ES = 1.9 90\%, confidence limits {[}1.6;2.1]),
   younger players reached a greater PMSRei (92.0\% +/- 6.3\% vs. 87.2\%
   +/- 5.7\% for U13 and U17, respectively, ES = -0.8 90\% CL
   {[}-1.0;-0.5]). Playing position also affected PMSAbs and PMSRel, as
   strikers were likely to reach higher PMSAbs (eg, 27.0 +/- 2.7 vs 23.6
   +/- 2.2 km/h for strikers and central midfielders, respectively, ES =
   2.0 {[}1.7;2.2]) and PMSRel (eg, 93.6\% +/- 5.2\% vs 85.3\% +/- 6.5\%
   for strikers and central midfielders, respectively, ES = 1.0
   {[}0.7;1.3]) than all other positions. The findings confirm that age and
   playing position affect the absolute and relative intensity of
   speed-related actions during matches.}},

Title = {{A helium gas scintillator active target for photoreaction measurements}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A}},

Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{A multi-cell He gas scintillator active target, designed for the
   measurement of photoreaction cross sections, is described. The target
   has four main chambers, giving an overall thickness of 0.103 g/cm(3) at
   an operating pressure of 2MPa. Scintillations are read out by
   photomultiplier tubes and the addition of small amounts of N-2 to the
   He, to shift the scintillation emission from UV to visible, is
   discussed. First results of measurements at the MAX IV Laboratory
   tagged-photon facility show that the target has a timing resolution of
   around 1 ns and can cope well with a high-flux photon beam. The
   determination of reaction cross sections from target yields relies on a
   Monte Carlo simulation, which considers scintillation light transport,
   photodisintegration processes in He-4, background photon interactions in
   target windows and interactions of the reaction-product particles in the
   gas and target container. The predictions of this simulation are
   compared to the measured target response.}},

Title = {{Breastfeeding is protective to diabetes risk in young adults: a

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Aim It is unclear whether any breastfeeding or a certain duration of
   breastfeeding is protective against the development of diabetes in adult
   offspring.
   Methods We followed a sub-sample of 3,595 offspring born in the Mater
   Hospital in Brisbane, Australia between 1981 and 1983 and for whom we
   had doctor diagnosed self-reported diabetes at age 21 years and maternal
   reported duration of breastfeeding at 6-month post-natal follow-up.
   Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the independent
   associations of duration of breastfeeding (never breastfeed, breastfed <
   4 months and breastfed a parts per thousand yen4 months) with offspring
   diabetes by age 21 years.
   Results Of 3,595 young adults, 45 (1.25 \%) developed diabetes by age 21
   years. The odds ratio of experiencing diabetes was 0.58 (95 \% CI 0.29,
   1.16) for offspring who were breastfed < 4 months, and it was 0.29 (95
   \% CI 0.13, 0.63), for offspring who were breastfed at least 4 months
   compared to the never breastfed offspring. Adjusting for potential
   confounding and mediating factors including maternal age, education,
   pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), smoking, offspring sports, TV and
   their BMI at 21 years did not substantially alter this association.
   Conclusions Findings of this study suggest that infants who are
   breastfed for longer than 4 months have a substantial protective effect
   against the development of diabetes in young adulthood, which is
   independent of current BMI. Promoting breastfeeding for a minimum of 4
   months may be a useful strategy for the prevention of diabetes among
   young adults.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach is proposed for the interpretation of magnetic anomalies
   caused by dipping dikes. This approach is mainly based on modular neural
   network inversion for estimating the parameters of dipping dike model.
   Suitable network training examples and test data have been generated
   using forward models based on known true parameters. The training
   procedures adopt supervised learning routine using modular neural
   networks. The effect of random noise has been examined where the
   proposed technique showed stability and satisfactory results. The
   applicability of this technique has been tested on synthetic and field
   examples data. This technique is particularly applied to two field
   examples, namely magnetic anomaly over an outcropping quartz dike-like
   body in Karimnagar area, Andhra Pradesh, India, and Marcona magnetic
   anomaly, Marcona district, Peru. The results of using this technique
   showed good agreement with the measured field data compared with most
   conventional ones. Furthermore, neural networks proved to be efficient
   and flexible in the interpretation of magnetic anomaly of dipping dike.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Radioactive seed localization has been shown to be a reliable
   and safe alternative to wire localization in breast surgery, but little
   is known about the use of multiple localization seeds. This study
   evaluated the utilization of multiple seeds in the same breast.
   Methods. All patients who underwent localization of breast lesions using
   multiple I-125 seeds at three Mayo Clinic sites between January 2003 and
   June 2014 were included.
   Results. A total of 461 operations were performed during an 11.5-year
   study period. The indications for multiple seed placement in the same
   breast included multiple lesions (n = 258), bracketing (n = 110),
   multiple lesions and bracketing (n = 67), and a second inserted for more
   precise localization (n = 26). Among patients with bracketing seeds, the
   mean distance between seeds was 45 (range 8-110) mm. Removal of the
   targeted lesion was successful in all cases; 96 \% of bracketed lesions
   were removed as a single specimen, and a 98 \% retrieval rate within the
   first specimen was obtained. In total 108 of 382 (28 \%) patients had
   close or positive margin resulting in a second procedure and 60 of 177
   (34 \%) patients with bracketing procedures underwent reexcision of
   positive margins or culminated in a mastectomy. Routine intraoperative
   frozen section analysis was associated with a lower reoperation rate
   compared with a selective approach to intraoperative margin assessment.
   Conclusions. The use of multiple radioactive seeds for localizing
   multiple lesions in the same breast or bracketing lesions is feasible
   and safe. Because of the extent of disease, a substantial percentage of
   these patients require margin reexcision or conversion to mastectomy.}},

   {[}(DACH)Au(pn)]Cl-3,Cl- {[}where DACH = cis-, trans-1,2- and
   S,S-1,2-diaminocyclohexane and pn = 1,3-diaminopropane] have been
   synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic and analytical
   techniques including elemental analysis, UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy;
   solution as well as solid-state NMR measurements. The solid-state C-13
   NMR shows that 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (1,2-DACH) and 1,3-diaminopropane
   (pn) are strongly bound to the gold(III) center via N donor atoms. The
   stability of the mixed diamine ligand gold(III) was checked by UV-Vis
   spectroscopy and NMR measurements. The molecular structure of compound 1
   (containing cis-1,2-DACH) was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis.
   The structure of 1 consists of {[}(cis-DACH)Au(pn)](3+) complex ion and
   chloride counter ions. Each gold atom in the complex ion adopts a
   distorted square-planar geometry. The structural details and relative
   stabilities of the four possible isomers of the complexes were also
   estimated at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level of theoretical calculations. The
   computational study demonstrates that trans- conformations are slightly
   more stable than the cis- conformations. The antiproliferative effects
   and cytotoxic properties of the mixed ligand gold(III) complexes were
   evaluated in vitro on human gastric SGC7901 and prostate PC3 cancer
   cells using MTT assay. The antiproliferative study of the gold(III)
   complexes on PC3 and SGC7901 cells indicate that complex 3 (containing
   1S,2S-(+)-1,2-(DACH)) is the most effective antiproliferative agent. The
   IC50 data reveal that the in vitro cytotoxicity of complex 3 against
   SGC7901 cancer cells manifested similar and very pronounced cytotoxic
   effects with respect to cisplatin. Moreover, the electrochemical
   behavior, and the interaction of complex 3 with two well-known model
   proteins, namely, hen egg white lysozyme and bovine serum albumin is
   also reported.}},

Abstract = {{beta 1,4-Galactosylransferases are a family of enzymes encoded by seven
   B4GALT genes and are involved in the development of anticancer drug
   resistance and metastasis. Among these genes, the B4GALT1 shows
   significant variations in the transcript origination sites in different
   cell types/tissues and encodes an interesting dually partitioning
   beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferase protein. We identified at 5'-end of
   B4GALT1 a 1.454 kb sequence forming a transcription regulatory region,
   referred to by us as the TR1-PE1, had all characteristics of a
   bidirectional promoter directing the transcription of B4GALTI in a
   divergent manner along with its long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) antisense
   counterpart B4GALT1-AS1. The TR1-PE1 showed unique dinucleotide
   base-stacking energy values specific to transcription factor binding
   sites (TFBSs), INR and BRE, and harbored CpG Island (CGI) that showed GC
   skew with potential for R-loop formation at the transcription starting
   sites (TSSs). The 5'-regulatory axis of B4GALTI also included five more
   novel TFBSs for CTCF, GLI1, TCF7L2, GATA3 and SOX5, in addition to
   unique (TG)(18) repeats in conjunction with 22 nucleotide TG-associated
   sequence (TGAS). The five lncRNA B4GALT1-AS1 transcripts showed
   significant complementarity with B4GALT1 mRNA. In contrast, the rest of
   B4GALT genes showed fewer lncRNAs, and all lacked the (TG)(18) and TGAS.
   Our results are strongly supported by the FANTOM5 study which showed
   tissue-specific variations in transcript origination sites for this
   gene. We suggest that the unique expression patterns for the B4GALTI in
   normal and malignant tissues are controlled by a differential usage of
   5'-B4GALT1 regulatory units along with a post-transcriptional regulation
   by the antisense RNA, which in turn govern the cell-matrix interactions,
   neoplastic progression, anticancer drug sensitivity, and could be
   utilized in personalized therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Acts 13.6-12 has been viewed as highly significant in the debate about
   the historicity of Acts, since the beginnings of the Pauline mission
   among the Gentiles are supposed to be rooted here, and the story
   illustrates Paul's self-understanding as an apostle. On the other hand,
   signs of literary creativity of the author with regard to the overall
   theological concept and the controversy about miracles, magic and
   apocalyptic traditions are clearly seen in this section that seem to
   contradict the description of the beginnings of the Pauline mission.
   This paper explores the apparent contradiction in the debate about the
   historicity of Luke-Acts in general and Acts 13.6-12 in particular, and
   shows that magic and apocalypticism can be incorporated within the
   ancient understanding of historical verification.}},

Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Caregivers in the ambulatory care setting with differing
   clinical background could encounter a patient at high risk of
   deterioration. In the absence of a dedicated acute care team, the
   response to an unanticipated medical emergencies in these settings is
   likely to have a poor outcome. Objective: To describe our experience in
   implementing an intensivist-led rapid response team (RRT) in the
   outpatient settings that identified patients who needed immediate
   Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. The effect on in hospital arrests,
   mortality, and ICU outcome is not the scope of this study. Materials and
   Methods: This retrospective descriptive study was performed from January
   1, 2009 to December 31, 2011 in a tertiary hospital. Data from hospital
   records were used (none from patients records). Consent was not needed.
   Measurements: Direct ICU admissions from the outpatient areas. Results:
   There were 90 patients cared for by RRT in the outpatients settings, 76
   adult, and 14 pediatric patients. A total of12 adult patients were
   transferred directly to ICU. Among the patient who were transferred to
   the emergency department, additional four patients required to be
   transferred to ICU (total 16 patients {[}17.7\%], 15 adult, and one
   pediatric patient). Follow-up at 24 h in the ICU showed death of one
   adult oncology patient (6.25\%), and discharge of two patients (12.5\%).
   Nine patients (81\%) were still sick to require longer ICU stay.
   Conclusion: Intensivist-led RRT in outpatient settings identifies
   patients who are critically ill and in need of immediate ICU admission.
   Thus, an intensivist-led RRT policy in the outpatient settings needs to
   be implemented hospital wide.}},

Abstract = {{Scaffolding proteins play pivotal roles in the assembly of
   macromolecular machines such as the spliceosome. The adaptor protein
   CD2BP2, originally identified as a binding partner of the adhesion
   molecule CD2, is a pre-spliceosomal assembly factor that utilizes its
   glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine (GYF) domain to co-localize with
   spliceosomal proteins. So far, its function in vertebrates is unknown.
   Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we show that CD2BP2 is crucial
   for embryogenesis, leading to growth retardation, defects in
   vascularization, and premature death at embryonic day 10.5 when absent.
   Ablation of the protein in bone marrow-derived macrophages indicates
   that CD2BP2 is involved in the alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts
   from diverse origins. At the molecular level, we identified the
   phosphatase PP1 to be recruited to the spliceosome via the N-terminus of
   CD2BP2. Given the strong expression of CD2BP2 in podocytes of the
   kidney, we use selective depletion of CD2BP2, in combination with
   next-generation sequencing, to monitor changes in exon usage of genes
   critical for podocyte functions, including VEGF and actin regulators.
   CD2BP2-depleted podocytes display foot process effacement, and cause
   proteinuria and ultimately lethal kidney failure in mice. Collectively,
   our study defines CD2BP2 as a non-redundant splicing factor essential
   for embryonic development and podocyte integrity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a comprehensive study of heat
   transfer and pressure drop for the laminar flow of water in circular
   tubes with twisted-tape inserts. Three different twist ratios and tape
   thicknesses were considered. Experiments were performed for two

   under constant-wall-temperature boundary condition. The fully developed
   Nusselt number and friction factor were found to be influenced by the
   twist ratio and the tape thickness-to-diameter ratio. The Nusselt number
   increases with a decreasing twist ratio, increasing tape thickness, and
   increasing Reynolds number; whereas the friction factor increases with
   an increasing twist ratio and tape thickness. Correlations for the
   Nusselt number and friction factor are developed for a tube with
   inserted-tape inserts. The present correlations consider the effects of
   the tape thickness-to-diameter ratio and the twist ratio on the Nusselt
   number and friction factor. The thermal-hydraulic performance ratio
   decreases with an increasing Reynolds number and twist ratio, whereas
   the tape thickness has a slight effect on the thermal performance ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes a systematic characterization of lignin samples
   fractionated from industrial black liquor and an evaluation of their
   suitability as a component (50 wt.\%) in thermoplastic blends with
   polyethylene with a special emphasis on tensile and impact properties.
   Industrial softwood kraft lignin was isolated from three different
   cooking stages and subsequently fractionated by sequential acid
   precipitation. Altogether, nine lignin fractions were subjected to
   several chemical/thermal analyses to compare their structural features
   and thermal decomposition properties. Lignin samples precipitated at pH
   10.5 exhibited the highest molecular weight (M-w) and purity,
   demonstrated by the lowest content of sulfur and polysaccharides. In
   contrast, samples precipitated at a low pH in general exhibited higher
   amount of impurities and low methoxyl group content. It was found that
   lignin precipitated at low pH contained the biggest share of sulfur
   present in kraft lignin. However, about 70 \% of sulfur in these samples
   is present in non-bounded form and could be extracted with CS2.
   Additionally, low M-w lignin exhibited a significantly lower T-g value,
   which could favor material processing. A notable decrease in the thermal
   stability of the tested lignin samples was observed with a decrease in
   the molecular weight. In addition, lignin with a low M-w, high phenolic
   hydroxyl groups, and lower number of double bonds seems to be favorable
   for increased tensile strength and elastic modulus of the
   polyethylene-lignin blend materials.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the academia have been witnessing calls that universities
   regard humanities as ineffective in national growth, Instead, applied
   and vocational sciences are encouraged since they have an obvious and
   immediate impact on the work market. The study aims at contradicting
   this trend, and proving that literature, art, and the humanities can
   prove vital to economic growth and provide a good resource for national
   economy. The paper takes the example of the city of Dublin, capitol city
   of The Republic of Ireland, as a city that endorsed and capitalized on
   its literary and cultural legacy to attract literature tourism, and by
   doing that it turned around its economical doom into prosperity and
   overcame the notorious 2008 recession, to which European countries like
   Spain, Portugal, and Greece suffered greatly. Through the approach of
   cultural criticism, the paper encourages tourism planners in cities of
   the third world countries to follow the Irish paradigm and hit two birds
   with one stone: achieve economical gains and at the same time
   sustainability of their cultural treasures.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of large corneous beta-proteins of 18-43 kDa (Ac37, 39,
   and 40) in the epidermis of the lizard Anolis carolinensis is unknown.
   This study analyses the localization of these beta-proteins in different
   body scales during regeneration. Western blot analysis indicates most
   protein bands at 40-50 kDa suggesting they mix with alpha-keratin of
   intermediate filament keratin proteins. Ac37 is present in mature
   alpha-layers of most scales and in beta-cells of the outer scale surface
   in some scales but is absent in the Oberhautchen, in the setae and
   beta-layer of adhesive pads and in mesos cells. In differentiating
   beta-keratinocytes Ac37 is present over 3-4 nm thick filaments located
   around the amorphous beta-packets and in alpha-cells, but is scarce in
   precorneous and corneous layers of the claw. Ac37 forms long filaments
   and, therefore, resembles alpha-keratins to which it probably
   associates. Ac39 is seen in the beta-layer of tail and digital scales,
   in beta-cells of regenerating scales but not in the Oberhautchen (and
   adhesive setae) or in beta- and alpha-layers of the other scales. Ac40
   is present in the mature beta-layer of most scales and dewlap, in
   differentiating beta-cells of regenerating scales, but is absent in all
   the other epidermal layers. The large beta-proteins are accumulated
   among forming beta-packets of beta-cells and are packed in the
   beta-corneous material of mature beta-layer. Together alpha-keratins,
   large beta-proteins form the denser areas of mature beta-layer that may
   have a different consistence that the electron-paler areas. J. Morphol.

Abstract = {{In this study, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) algorithm
   was applied to predicting the bearing capacity of bored piles embedded
   in sand and mixed soils. Pile geometry and cone penetration test (CPT)
   results were used as input variables for prediction of pile bearing
   capacity. The data used were collected from the existing literature and
   consisted of 50 case records. The application of LSSVM was carried out
   by dividing the data into three sets: a training set for learning the
   problem and obtaining a relationship between input variables and pile
   bearing capacity, and testing and validation sets for evaluation of the
   predictive and generalization ability of the obtained relationship. The
   predictions of pile bearing capacity by LSSVM were evaluated by
   comparing with experimental data and with those by traditional CPT-based
   methods and the gene expression programming (GEP) model. It was found
   that the LSSVM performs well with coefficient of determination, mean,
   and standard deviation equivalent to 0.99, 1.03, and 0.08, respectively,
   for the testing set, and 1, 1.04, and 0.11, respectively, for the
   validation set. The low values of the calculated mean squared error and
   mean absolute error indicated that the LSSVM was accurate in predicting
   the pile bearing capacity. The results of comparison also showed that
   the proposed algorithm predicted the pile bearing capacity more
   accurately than the traditional methods including the GEP model. (C)

Abstract = {{The hippocampus is crucial for long-term episodic memory and learning.
   It undergoes structural change in aging and is sensitive to
   neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. MRS studies have seldom been
   performed in the hippocampus due to technical challenges. The
   reproducibility of MRS in the hippocampus has not been evaluated at 3 T.
   The purpose of the present study was to quantify the concentration of
   metabolites in a small voxel placed in the hippocampus and evaluate the
   reproducibility of the quantification. Spectra were measured in a 2.4 mL
   voxel placed in the left hippocampus covering the body and most of the
   tail of the structure in 10 healthy subjects across three different
   sessions and quantified using LCModel. High-quality spectra were
   obtained, which allowed a reliable quantification of 10 metabolites
   including glutamate and glutamine. Reproducibility of MRS was evaluated
   with coefficient of variation, standard errors of measurement, and
   intraclass correlation coefficients. All of these measures showed
   improvement with increased number of averages. Changes of less than 5\%
   in concentration of N-acetylaspartate, choline-containing compounds, and
   total creatine and of less than 10\% in concentration of myo-inositol
   and the sum of glutamate and glutamine can be confidently detected
   between two measurements in a group of 20 subjects. A reliable and
   reproducible neurochemical profile of the human hippocampus was obtained
   using MRS at 3 T in a small hippocampal volume. Copyright (C) 2015 John

Title = {{Rapid activation and hepatic recruitment of innate-like regulatory B

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{943-951}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are present
   within the liver and have been implicated in the development of many
   liver diseases. Upon activation by glycolipid ligands (including
   alpha-galactosylceramide; alpha GalCer), hepatic iNKT cells produce
   numerous cytokines and recruit both pro-inflammatory and regulatory
   immune cells. However, the involvement of B cells in this process is
   poorly defined.
   Methods: Wild-type (male, C57BL/6), B cell deficient, or B cell depleted
   mice were injected with alpha GalCer or vehicle, hepatic B cell
   phenotype and liver injury was subsequently determined.
   Results: iNKT cell activation resulted in liver injury and the rapid
   activation and hepatic recruitment of B cells (mainly innate-like B1 and
   MZ-like B cells) from the spleen and peritoneal cavity. B cells
   recruited to the liver produce IL-10 and TGF beta, and express cell
   surface CD73 (ectoenzyme which generates adenosine). B cell deficient
   mice developed augmented alpha GalCer-induced hepatitis, enhanced
   neutrophil recruitment and striking alterations in the hepatic cytokine
   milieu. alpha GalCer-induced hepatitis was unaltered in IL-10(-/-) mice,
   or after TGFb neutralization, but was significantly worsened in mice
   treated with a CD73 inhibitor.
   Conclusions: iNKT cell stimulation recruits innate-like regulatory B
   cells to the liver which suppress hepatic inflammation through IL-10 and
   TGF beta 1 independent mechanisms, but involve CD73 activity. These
   findings highlight an important inflammation suppressing role for B
   cells at early time points during the development of an innate immune
   response within the liver, and represent a potential therapeutic target
   for the treatment of liver disease. (C) 2015 European Association for

Abstract = {{Regional frequency analysis (RFA) deals with the estimation of
   hydrological characteristics at sites where little or no data is
   available. Recently, machine learning applications to RFA have received
   considerable attention in terms of their flexibility in modeling as well
   as superior generalization ability compared to conventional approaches.
   The proper application of machine learning techniques, however, requires
   good understanding of the available information about system's dynamics,
   i.e. system variables. This paper presents two contributions to the
   literature. First, novel ensemble architecture, using a unique two-stage
   resampling approach, is proposed. The objective of the proposed ensemble
   model is to promote diversity within the individual learners and reduce
   over fitting. Second, the application of the proposed model is
   demonstrated in RFA case study to obtain improved regional flood
   quantile estimates at ungauged sites. A jackknife validation procedure
   is used for the evaluation of the model's performance. The method is
   applied to data from the province of Quebec, Canada. The model showed
   similar performance and generalization compared to major ensemble models
   in the literature, which were investigated in previous studies using the
   same data set. The proposed model confirmed the diversity requirement in
   ensemble modeling and, in the same time, validated the proposed model
   adherence to ensemble learning theory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: This single-center study aims to investigate whether a
   significant difference exits between the survival rates of patients
   operated for adenosquamous cancer of the lung (ASCL) and patients
   operated for adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.
   Methods: A total of 2,203 patients (1,977 males, 226 females; mean age
   57.8 +/- 34.9 years; range 22 to 86 years) operated for non-small cell
   lung cancer in our hospital between January 2002 and January 2011 were
   retrospectively analyzed for pathological diagnosis, survival, and tumor
   staging.
   Results: As a result of pathological analysis, the diagnosis of
   adenosquamous cancer was confirmed in 46 out of 2,203 (2.1\%) patients.
   The median survival time was 53.6 months (range 21.1 to 68.2 months) for
   adenocarcinoma, 48.1 months (range 24.4 to 66.9 months) for squamous
   cell cancer, and 27.9 months (range 10.7 to 44.6 months) for ASCL
   (p=0.026). The median survival time was 21.6 months in the group of
   patients with predominating adenocarcinoma, 21.4 months in the group of
   patients with predominating squamous cell carcinoma, and 37.8 months in
   the group of patients with codominant cell lines (p=0.007).
   Conclusion: In our study, the survival rate of ASCL patients was lower
   than that of patients with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma.
   Further clinical studies are needed to investigate whether adjuvant
   chemoradiotherapy following surgical resection improves overall survival
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Wind fronts associated with cold-air outbreaks from the Chinese
   continent in the winter are often observed over the northern South China
   Sea and are well studied. However, wind fronts caused by another type of
   synoptic setting, the sudden increase or freshening of the north-east
   monsoon, which is caused by the merging of two anticyclonic regions over
   the Chinese continent, are also frequently encountered over the northern
   South China Sea. For the first time, such an event is investigated using
   multi-sensor satellite data, weather radar images, and a high-resolution
   atmospheric numerical model. It is shown that the wind front generated
   by the freshening of the north-east monsoon is quite similar to wind
   fronts generated by cold-air outbreaks. Furthermore, we investigate
   fine-scale features of the wind front that are visible on synthetic
   aperture radar (SAR) images through variations of the small-scale
   sea-surface roughness. The SAR image was acquired by the Advanced SAR of
   the European Envisat satellite over the South China Sea off the coast of
   Hong Kong and has a resolution of 150 m. It shows notches (dents) in the
   frontal line and also radar signatures of embedded rain cells. This
   (rare) SAR image, together with a quasi-simultaneously acquired weather
   radar image, provide excellent data with which to test the performance
   of the pre-operational version of the Atmospheric Integrated Rapid-cycle
   (AIR) forecast model system of the Hong Kong Observatory with respect to
   modelling rain cells at frontal boundaries. The calculations using a
   horizontal resolution with 3-km resolution show that the model
   reproduces quite well the position of the notches where rain cells are
   generated. The model shows further that at the position of the notches
   the vorticity of the airflow is increased leading to the uplift of
   warmer, moister air from the sea-surface to higher levels. With respect
   to the 10-km resolution model, the comparison of model data with the
   near-surface wind field derived from the SAR image shows that the AIR
   model overestimates the wind speed in the lee of the coastal mountains
   east of Hong Kong, probably due to the incorrect inclusion of the
   coastal topography.}},

Title = {{Out-of-pocket health expenditures and antimicrobial resistance in
   low-income and middle-income countries: an economic analysis}},
Journal = {{LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Introduction The decreasing effectiveness of antimicrobial agents is a
   growing global public health concern. Low-income and middle-income
   countries are vulnerable to the loss of antimicrobial efficacy because
   of their high burden of infectious disease and the cost of treating
   resistant organisms. We aimed to assess if copayments in the public
   sector promoted the development of antibiotic resistance by inducing
   patients to purchase treatment from less well regulated private
   providers.
   Methods We analysed data from the WHO 2014 Antibacterial Resistance
   Global Surveillance report. We assessed the importance of out-of-pocket
   spending and copayment requirements for public sector drugs on the level
   of bacterial resistance in low-income and middle-income countries, using
   linear regression to adjust for environmental factors purported to be
   predictors of resistance, such as sanitation, animal husbandry, and
   poverty, and other structural components of the health sector. Our
   outcome variable of interest was the proportion of bacterial isolates
   tested that showed resistance to a class of antimicrobial agents. In
   particular, we computed the average proportion of isolates that showed
   antibiotic resistance for a given bacteria-antibacterial combination in
   a given country.
   Findings Our sample included 47 countries (23 in Africa, eight in the
   Americas, three in Europe, eight in the Middle East, three in southeast
   Asia, and two in the western Pacific). Out-of-pocket health expenditures
   were the only factor significantly associated with antimicrobial
   resistance. A ten point increase in the percentage of health
   expenditures that were out-of-pocket was associated with a 3.2
   percentage point increase in resistant isolates (95\% CI 1.17-5.15;
   p=0.002). This association was driven by countries requiring copayments
   for drugs in the public health sector. Of these countries, moving from
   the 20th to 80th percentile of out-of-pocket health expenditures was
   associated with an increase in resistant bacterial isolates from 17-76\%
   (95\% CI 12.54-22.97) to 36.27\% (31.16-41.38).
   Interpretation Out-of-pocket health expenditures were strongly
   correlated with antimicrobial resistance in low-income and middle-income
   countries. This relation was driven by countries that require copayments
   on drugs in the public sector. Our data suggest cost-sharing of
   antimicrobials in the public sector might drive demand to the private
   sector in which supply-side incentives to overprescribe are probably
   heightened and quality assurance less standardised.}},

   show that, when the interior of the rotation interval contains an
   integer, then the set of periods (of periodic points of any rotation
   number) is the set of all integers except maybe 1 or 2. We exhibit
   degree 1 sigma-maps f whose set of periods is a combination of the set
   of periods of a degree 1 circle map and the set of periods of a 3-star
   (that is, a space shaped like the letter Y). Moreover, we study the set
   of periods forced by periodic orbits that do not intersect the circuit

Abstract = {{The area of reverse logistics (RL) has recently received considerable
   attention, due to a combination of environmental, economic and social
   factors. Reverse logistics refers to the series of operations that
   initiate at the consumer level with the collection of products and
   terminate with the re-processing of these products at remanufacturing
   facilities. In the current work, we propose a mixed-integer linear
   program (MILP) to address the complex network configuration of an RL
   system, which decides on the optimal selection of sites, the capacities
   of inspection centers and remanufacturing facilities. Furthermore, we
   introduce important transportation considerations, by providing the
   option of using in-house fleet as well as outsourcing option and this
   constitutes one of the main contributions of our work. In addition, we
   take into account the initial investment, which limits investments to be
   made on fleet or center expansion in subsequent time periods. The model
   is tested on a real-life case and results are reported. The current work
   holds significant practical implications, as it can provide useful
   insights to decision makers from both governmental and private entities
   regarding important strategic decisions pertaining to the design of
   reverse supply chains. (C) 2015 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the extrudability, drug
   release, and stability of fenofibrate (FF) formulations utilizing
   various hot-melt extrusion processing parameters and
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymers of various molecular weights. The
   different PVP grades selected for this study were Kollidon (R) 12 PF
   (K12), Kollidon (R) 30 (K30), and Kollidori (R) 90 F (K90). FF was
   extruded with these polymers at three drug loadings (15\%, 25\%, and
   35\% w/w). Additionally, for FF combined with each of the successfully
   extruded PVP grades (K12 and K30), the effects of two levels of
   processing parameters for screw design, screw speed, and barrel
   temperature were assessed. It was found that the FF with (K90) was not
   extrudable up to 35\% drug loading. With low drug loading, the polymer
   viscosity significantly influenced the release of FF. The crystallinity
   remaining was vital in the highest drug-loaded formulation dissolution
   profile, and the glass transition temperature of the polymer
   significantly affected its stability. Modifying the screw configuration
   resulted in more than 95\% post-extrusion drug content of the FF K30
   formulations. In contrast to FF K30 formulations, FF release and
   stability with K12 were significantly influenced by the extrusion
   temperature and screw speed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Continuation of antiplatelet medications through major
   urologic surgery may increase the risk of intraoperative and
   postoperative bleeding complications. However, withdrawal of
   antiplatelet therapy may place some patients at high risk of serious
   cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications. We assess the
   feasibility of performing robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) in patients
   maintained on aspirin or dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and
   clopidogrel.
   Material and methods: Perioperative data was collected prospectively on
   230 subjects undergoing RPN enrolled in an IRB approved quality of life
   study. We analyzed subjects who were maintained on either aspirin alone
   or both aspirin and clopidogrel throughout the operative and
   perioperative period.
   Results: Of the 230 patients, six were identified who continued
   antiplatelet medication throughout the perioperative period. Four
   patients were maintained on 81 mg of aspirin and two patients continued
   aspirin and clopidogrel. Average RENAL score was 7 with mean tumor size
   of 4.1 cm. There were no intraoperative complications and no conversions
   to open surgery. Average estimated blood loss was 242 mL. Ninety day
   complication rate was 33\%. One patient had postoperative bleeding on
   day 14 after restarting coumadin in addition to their aspirin.
   Conclusions: We present a case series demonstrating that in carefully
   selected patients, RPN on aspirin and clopidogrel is feasible and safe.
   This is the first report of patients who underwent RPN while on both
   aspirin and clopidogrel.}},

Title = {{Estimation of rainfall threshold and its use in landslide hazard mapping

Abstract = {{This paper presents rainfall-induced landslide thresholds and predicts
   landslide hazard in Kuala Lumpur metropolitan city and surrounding
   areas. Landslide events from 2000 to 2012 were collected. The long and
   short antecedent rainfall days were prepared for landslide and
   non-landslide days simultaneously. First, threshold analysis was
   conducted by using data obtained from rainfall stations located in
   highly urbanized areas of Kuala Lumpur metropolis. Six rainfall gauges
   were selected, and the study area was divided into six zones according
   to rainfall gauges: Taman Desa Station (TD-KL), Genting Klang (GK-KL),
   LDG Edinburgh Station (LDGE-KL), SG Raya Hulu Langat Station (SRHL-Slg),
   Puchong Drop Station (PD-Slg), and Bukit Antarabangsa (BTA-Slg). After
   the threshold analysis was conducted for different periods (10, 15, and
   30 days) in each station, reliability index test was conducted to
   optimize the best threshold that limits the predicted events along the
   study period for each region. Second, the threshold analysis results
   were used as input in the Poisson probability model to estimate
   landslide temporal probability (P (T)). Third, the spatial probability
   (P (S)) analysis was prepared by using the evidential belief function
   multiplied by the P (T) to obtain the hazard maps for 1-, 3-, and 5-year
   scenarios. Finally, a validation process was conducted to test the
   prediction performance of the resultant hazard map for a 1- and 2-year
   prediction by using the landslide inventory of 2012 to early 2014, which
   was not included in the modeling of the hazard map. Results showed a
   valid correlation between the high and moderate hazardous areas for the
   six zones. The predicted hazard maps indicated a quantitative assessment
   of the prone areas and proved to be a valid disaster management tool.
   The produced hazard maps may play a vital role as input component in
   risk analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We analyse the magnetic activity characteristics of the planet-hosting
   Sun-like star, HD 1237, using HARPS spectro-polarimetric time-series
   data. We find evidence of rotational modulation of the magnetic
   longitudinal field measurements that is consistent with our ZDI analysis
   with a period of 7 days. We investigate the effect of customising the
   LSD mask to the line depths of the observed spectrum and find that it
   has a minimal effect on the shape of the extracted Stokes V profile but
   does result in a small increase in the S/N (similar to 7\%). We find
   that using a Milne-Eddington solution to describe the local line profile
   provides a better fit to the LSD profiles in this slowly rotating star,
   which also affects the recovered ZDI field distribution. We also
   introduce a fit-stopping criterion based on the information content
   (entropy) of the ZDI map solution set. The recovered magnetic field maps
   show a strong (+90 G) ring-like azimuthal field distribution and a
   complex radial field dominating at mid latitudes (similar to 45
   degrees). Similar magnetic field maps are recovered from data acquired
   five months apart. Future work will investigate how this surface
   magnetic field distribution affeccts the coronal magnetic field and
   extended environment around this planet-hosting star.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) systems cannot successfully realize the notion
   of ubiquitous connectivity of everything if they are not capable to
   truly include `multimedia things'. However, the current research and
   development activities in the field do not mandate the features of
   multimedia objects, thus leaving a gap to benefit from multimedia
   content based services and applications. In this paper, we analyze this
   issue by contemplating the concept of IoT and drawing an inspiration
   towards the perspective vision of `Internet of Multimedia Things'
   (IoMT). Therein, we introduce IoMT as a novel paradigm in which smart
   heterogeneous multimedia things can interact and cooperate with one
   another and with other things connected to the Internet to facilitate
   multimedia based services and applications that are globally available
   to the users. Some applications and use-cases for IoMT are presented to
   reflect the possibilities enabled by this new paradigm. An IoMT
   architecture is then presented which is segregated into four distinct
   stages; (i) multimedia sensing, (ii) reporting and addressability, (iii)
   multimedia-aware cloud, and (iv) multi-agent systems. Instead of
   proposing specific technical solutions for each individual stage of the
   presented architecture, we survey the already existing technologies,
   providing a synthesis for the realization of the vision of IoMT.
   Subsequently, various requirements and challenges as well as the
   feasibility of existing solutions for each stage of proposed IoMT
   architecture are comprehensively discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Microalgae are well known for their biotechnological potential, namely
   with regard to bioactive lipidic componentsespecially carotenoids and
   polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), well-known for therapeutic
   applications based on their antioxidant capacity. The aim of this work
   was to evaluate the influence of four distinct food-grade solvents upon
   extractability of specific lipidic components, and on the antioxidant
   capacity exhibited against both synthetic (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
   (DPPH center dot) and 2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
   acid (ABTS(+center dot))) and biological reactive species (O-2(center
   dot-) and (NO-)-N-center dot). A eukaryotic microalga (Scenedesmus
   obliquus (M2-1)) and a prokaryotic one (Gloeothece sp.) were used as
   case studies. Concerning total antioxidant capacity, the
   hexane:isopropanol (3:2) and acetone extracts of Sc. obliquus (M2-1)
   were the most effective against DPPH center dot and ABTS(+center dot),
   respectively. Gloeothece sp. ethanol extracts were the most interesting
   scavengers of O-2(center dot-), probably due the high content of
   linolenic acid. On the other hand, acetone and hexane:isopropanol (3:2)
   extracts were the most interesting ones in (NO-)-N-center dot assay.
   Acetone extract exhibited the best results for the ABTS assay, likely
   associated to its content of carotenoids, in both microalgae. Otherwise,
   ethanol stood out in PUFA extraction. Therefore, profiles of lipidic
   components extracted are critical for evaluating the antioxidant
   performancewhich appears to hinge, in particular, on the balance between
   carotenoids and PUFAs.}},

Title = {{The diagnostic usefulness of capture assays for measuring

Journal = {{TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{127-136}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Capture assays were developed and validated for measuring the global
   pro-coagulant activity of micro-particles (MPs, mainly originated from
   platelets), or specific extravascular cellular MPs (released from
   erythrocytes, leukocytes, monocytes, endothelial cells) as those
   exposing TF (MP-TF, mainly observed in patients with some cancers).
   Conversely to Flow Cytometry methods, these capture assays measure all
   coagulant activity associated with MPs, through thrombin generation
   (MP-Activity) or Factor Xa generation (MP-TF), and therefore they bring
   a complementary information, as they are more specific for the
   pro-coagulant activity associated with MPs. Small particles (<0.40 mu)
   exposing Phosphatidyl Serine (PS) exhibit a greater pro-coagulant
   surface than larger MPs (0.40 to >1.00 mu), those preferentially
   measured with flow cytometry. Activity associated with MPs is a
   consequence of disease but can also be a cause contributing to
   pathological processes and development of thrombo-embolic events. In
   many diseases, flow cytometry and capture assays do not totally
   correlate, and have different associations with disease evolution.
   Optimized capture based assays are presented and discussed, along with
   their performance characteristics and some applications. They can be
   performed in any technically skillful hemostasis laboratory, using a
   thermostated ELISA equipment, or an incubator. Dynamic ranges for
   MP-Activity assay is from <0.1 nM to >2.5 nM Phospholipids, expressed as
   Phosphatidyl Serine (PS) equivalent, in the tested dilution. For MP-TF
   the very sensitive bio-immunoassay reported allows measuring
   concentrations from <0.10 pg/ml (TF equivalent) to >5.00 pg/ml, in the
   assayed dilution. No measurable MP-TF was found in normals, although an
   important concentration was generated from whole blood treated with
   Lipo-Poly-Saccharides. Capture based assays are then highly useful in
   the laboratory setting for measuring the activities associated with
   pro-coagulant, or specific cellular MPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
   docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have beneficial effects on human health. The
   probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle is unable to produce either
   EPA or DHA. Escherichia coil Nissle was transformed with the pfBS-PS
   plasmid carrying the EPA/DHA gene cluster, previously isolated from a
   marine bacterium. The transgenic E. coil Nissle produced EPA when grown
   at 10 degrees C (16.52 +/- 1.4 mg g(-1) cell dry weight), 15 degrees C
   (31.36 +/- 0.25 mg g(-1) cell dry weight), 20 degrees C (13.71 2.8 mg g'
   cell dry weight), 25 degrees C (11.33 +/- 0.44 mg g(-1) cell dry weight)
   or 30 degrees C (0.668 +/- 0.073 mg g(-1) cell dry weight). Although DHA
   was also produced at all these temperatures, it comprised less than
   0.2\% of total extracted fatty acids. Transcriptomic analysis using
   Reverse Transcription qPCR showed upregulation of the entire gene
   cluster in E. coil Nissle. Among EPA/DHA genes, pfaB, pfaC and pfaD were
   overexpressed (expression ratio of 181.9, 39.86 and 131.61,
   respectively) as compared to pfaA (expression ratio of 3.40) and pfaE
   (expression ratio of 4.05). The EPA/DHA-producing probiotic E. coil
   Nissle may be used as a safe, alternative and economic source for the
   industrial and pharmaceutical production of EPA and DHA.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the wave characteristics before, during and after the onset
   of the Indian summer monsoon based on data measured using the buoy
   moored at 3 locations off the central west coast of India. The study
   reveals the dramatic changes that occur in wave field due to the
   monsoon. Mean significant wave height before the onset of the monsoon
   was 0.7-0.9 m and it increased to 2.4-2.6 m during the onset of monsoon
   at the locations studied. Before the monsoon, due to the sea breeze, the
   wave height increased and reached its peak at similar to 1100 UTC.
   Variation of wave height in one day was up to 2 m with the high values (
   > 1 m) occurring during the monsoon. In contrast, the range of the peak
   wave period in one day varied up to 15 s before the monsoon due to the
   influence of the land breeze-sea breeze system. Also, before the
   monsoon, the spectral energy was in a wide range of frequencies due to
   the co-existence of swells and wind-seas, and 26\% of the total spectral
   energy was in frequencies > 0.25 Hz. Conversely, during the monsoon,
   only 7.1\% of the total energy was in frequencies > 0.25 Hz. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Mine tailings, waste rock piles, acid mine drainage, industrial
   wastewater, and sewage sludge have contaminated a vast area of
   cultivable and fallow lands, with a consequence of deterioration of soil
   and water quality and watercourses due to the erosion of contaminated
   soils for absence of vegetative cover. High concentrations of toxic
   elements, organic contaminants, acidic soils, and harsh climatic
   conditions have made it difficult to re-establish vegetation and produce
   crops there. Recently, a significant body of work has focussed on the
   suitability and potentiality of biochar as a soil remediation tool that
   increases seed emergence, soil and crop productivity, above ground
   biomass, and vegetation cover on mine tailings, waste rock piles, and
   industrial and sewage waste-contaminated soils by increasing soil
   nutrients and water-holding capacity, amelioration of soil acidity, and
   stimulation of microbial diversity and functions. This review addresses:
   i) the functional properties of biochar, and microbial cycling of
   nutrients in soil; ii) bioremediation, especially phytoremediation of
   mine tailings, industrial waste, sewage sludge, and contaminated soil
   using biochar; iii) impact of biochar on reduction of acid production,
   acid mine drainage treatment, and geochemical dynamics in mine tailings;
   and iv) treatment of metal and organic contaminants in soils using
   biochar, and restoration of degraded land.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores the trends in the deployment and integration of
   distributed generation in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The study
   concentrates on the regulation of renewable energy generation with a
   focus on grid access and connection mechanisms. The high rate of
   distributed generation penetration is mainly based on the early support
   that these countries gave to the expansion of renewable energy
   generation - mainly wind and solar - within their respective national
   policies. Germany and Denmark are the ones with the most sophisticated
   support schemes, which have shown a dynamic design over time. In terms
   of connections, Germany has the most favorable connection regime which
   provides not only priority connection but also priority grid access for
   generation units that produce electricity from renewable energy sources.
   Sweden guarantees equal treatment among different technologies (i.e. a
   non-discrimination principle). High connection costs have been observed
   specially in Germany and Denmark. The costs of network upgrades are
   usually socialised across demand customers. However, integration issues
   should be taken into consideration in order to avoid expansion of
   distributed generation in a way which unnecessarily raises total system
   costs, via high connection costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients
   infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is well established; however,
   long-term risk estimates are needed. Recently, it has been suggested
   that HBV is associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and pancreatic
   cancer (PC). The aim of this Danish nationwide cohort study was to
   evaluate the association between HBV infection and all-type cancer, HCC,
   NHL and PC. A cohort of patients infected with HBV (n=4345) and an age-
   and sex-matched population-based comparison cohort of individuals
   (n=26070) without a positive test for HBV were linked to The Danish
   Cancer Registry to compare the risk of all-type cancer, HCC, NHL and PC
   among the two groups. The median observation period was 8.0years.
   Overall, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for all-type cancer among
   HBV-infected patients was 1.1 (95\% confidence intervals (CI) 0.9-1.3).
   The IRR of HCC was 17.4 (CI 5.5-54.5), whereas the IRR of PC and NHL was
   0.9 (CI 0.3-2.5) and 1.2 (CI 0.4-3.6), respectively. HBV-infected
   patients had a 10-year risk of 0.24\% (Cl 0.12-0.44) for HCC, whereas
   the comparison cohort had a 10-year risk of 0.03\% (Cl 0.02-0.07) for
   HCC. The risk of all-type cancer, NHL and PC was not higher in the
   HBV-infected cohort compared to non-HBV infected. We found a 17-fold
   higher risk of HCC for HBV-infected individuals.}},

Journal = {{PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The possibility that a multi-host wildlife reservoir is responsible for
   maintaining transmission of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis causing
   human cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is tested by comparative
   analysis of infection progression and infectiousness to sandflies in
   rodent host species previously shown to have high natural infection
   prevalences in both sylvatic or/and peridomestic habitats in close
   proximity to humans in northeast Brazil.
   Methods
   The clinical and parasitological outcomes, and infectiousness to
   sandflies, were observed in 54 colonized animals of three species (18
   Necromys lasiurus, 18 Nectomys squamipes and 18 Rattus rattus)
   experimentally infected with high (5.5x10(6)/ml) or low (2.8x10(5)/ml)
   dose L. (V.) braziliensis (MBOL/BR/2000/CPqAM95) inoculum. Clinical
   signs of infection were monitored daily. Whole animal xenodiagnoses were
   performed 6 months post inoculation using Lutzomyia longipalpis
   originating from flies caught in Passira, Pernambuco, after this
   parasite evaluation was performed at necropsy. Heterogeneities in
   Leishmania parasite loads were measured by quantitative PCR in ear skin,
   liver and spleen tissues.
   Results
   All three rodent species proved to establish infection characterized by
   short-term self-resolving skin lesions, located on ears and tail but not
   on footpads (one site of inoculation), and variable parasite loads
   detected in all three tissues with maximum burdens of 8.1x10(3) (skin),
   2.8x10(3) (spleen), and 8.9x10(2) (liver). All three host species, 18/18
   N. lasiurus, 10/18 N. squamipes and 6/18 R. rattus, also proved
   infectious to sandflies in cross-sectional study. R. rattus supported
   significantly lower tissue parasite loads compared to those in N.
   lasiurus and N. squamipes, and N. lasiurus appeared to be more
   infectious, on average, than either N. squamipes or R. rattus.
   Conclusions
   A multi-host reservoir of cutaneous leishmaniasis is indicated in this
   region of Brazil, though with apparent differences in the competence
   between the rodent species. The results provide preliminary insights
   into links between sylvatic and peri-domestic transmission cycles
   associated with overlaps in the rodent species' ecological niches.}},

Abstract = {{Short antimicrobial peptides represent attractive compounds for the
   development of new antibiotic agents. Previously, we identified an
   ultrashort hydrophobic and phenylalanine-rich peptide, called
   temporin-SHf, representing the smallest natural amphibian antimicrobial
   peptide known to date. Here, we report on the first structure activity
   relationship study of this peptide. A series of temporin-SHf derivatives
   containing insertion of a basic arginine residue as well as residues
   containing neutral hydrophilic (serine and alpha-hydroxymethylserine)
   and hydrophobic (alpha-methyl phenylalanine and p-(t)butyl
   phenylalanine) groups were designed to improve the antimicrobial
   activity, and their alpha-helical structure was investigated by circular
   dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Three compounds
   were found to display higher antimicrobial activity with the ability to
   disrupt (permeabilization/depolarization) the bacterial membrane while
   retaining the nontoxic character of the parent peptide toward rat
   erythrocytes and human cells (THP-1 derived macrophages and HEK-293).
   Antimicrobial assays were carried out to explore the influence of serum
   and physiological salt concentration on peptide activity. Analogs
   containing D-amino acid residues were also tested. Our study revealed
   that {[}p-(BuF2)-Bu-t, R-5]SHf is an attractive ultrashort candidate
   that is highly potent (bactericidal) against Gram-positive bacteria
   (including multidrug resistant S. aureus) and against a wider range of
   clinically interesting Gram-negative bacteria than temporin-SHf, and
   also active at physiological salt concentrations and in 30\% serum.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the simultaneous estimation of an optical flow field and an
   illumination source term in a movie sequence. The particular optical
   flow equation is obtained by assuming that the image intensity is a
   conserved quantity up to possible sources and sinks which represent
   varying illumination. We formulate this problem as an energy
   minimization problem and propose a space time simultaneous
   discretization for the optimality system in saddle-point form. We
   investigate a preconditioning strategy that renders the discrete system
   well-conditioned uniformly in the discretization resolution. Numerical

Abstract = {{Fast synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography was used to image the
   injection of super-critical under subsurface conditions into a
   brine-saturated carbonate sample at the pore-scale with a voxel size of
   and a temporal resolution of 45 s. Capillary pressure was measured from
   the images by finding the curvature of terminal menisci of both
   connected and disconnected clusters. We provide an analysis of three
   individual dynamic drainage events at elevated temperatures and
   pressures on the tens of seconds timescale, showing non-local interface
   recession due to capillary pressure change, and both local and distal
   (non-local) snap-off. The measured capillary pressure change is not
   sufficient to explain snap-off in this system, as the disconnected has a
   much lower capillary pressure than the connected both before and after
   the event. Disconnected regions instead preserve extremely low dynamic
   capillary pressures generated during the event. Snap-off due to these
   dynamic effects is not only controlled by the pore topography and throat
   radius, but also by the local fluid arrangement. Whereas disconnected
   fluid configurations produced by local snap-off were rapidly reconnected
   with the connected region, distal snap-off produced much more
   long-lasting fluid configurations, showing that dynamic forces can have
   a persistent impact on the pattern and sequence of drainage events.}},

   measurements acquired during the 2009 Philippine Sea experiment and

   theory of Munk and Zachariasen {[}J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 59, 818-838
   (1976)]. The scattering mechanism is the Garrett-Munk internal wave
   spectrum scaled by metrics based on measured environmental profiles. The
   transmitter was at 1000m depth and the receivers at nominal range 107 km
   and depths 600-1600 m. The signal was a broadband m-sequence centered at
   284 Hz. Four classes of propagation paths are examined: the first class
   has a single upper turning point at about 60m depth; the second and
   third classes each have two upper turning points at roughly 250 m; the
   fourth class has three upper turning points at about 450 m.
   Log-amplitude variance for all paths is predicted to be 0.04-0.09, well
   within the regime of validity of either Born or Rytov scattering. The
   predictions are roughly consistent with the measured and Monte Carlo
   log-amplitude variances, although biased slightly low. Paths turning in
   the extreme upper ocean (near the mixed layer) seem to incorporate
   additional scattering mechanisms not included in the original theory.

Abstract = {{Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates arc an important

   KPC-Kp strains consecutively isolated during a supposed outbreak.
   Twenty-five consecutive KPC Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were
   identified and clustered by the MALDI Biotyper (Bruker, Daltonics). To
   display and rank the variance within a data set, principal component
   analysis (PCA) was performed. ClinProTools models were generated to
   investigate the highest sum of recognition capability and
   cross-validation. A Class dendrogram of isolates was constructed using
   ClinproTool. MLST was performed sequencing gapA, infB, mdh, pgi, rpoB,
   phoE and tonB genes. bla(kpc), and cps genes were typed. Phylogenetic
   analysis and genetic distance of the KPC gene were performed using the
   MEGA6 software. PCA analysis defined two clusters, I and II, which were
   identified in a dendrogram by both temporal split and different
   antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. These clusters were composed
   mostly of strains of the same sequence type (ST512), the most prevalent
   ST in Italy, and the same cps (type 2). In cluster II, blak,, genotype
   resulted more variable than in cluster I. Phylogenetic analysis
   confirmed the genetic diversity in both clusters supported by the
   epidemiological data. Our study confirms that MALDI-TOF can be a rapid
   and cost-saving method for epidemiological clustering of KPC K.
   pneumoniae isolates and its association with bla(kpc) genotyping
   represents a reliable method to recognize possible clonal strains in

Abstract = {{Adhirasam is a cereal based, doughnut shaped, deep fried dessert
   consumed in the southern regions of India. The dough used to prepare
   adhirasam is fermented and contains rice flour and jaggery. The aim of
   the present study was to characterize the cultivable bacteria associated
   with this fermented dough and to identify a suitable starter culture for
   the production of quality adhirasam. In total, one hundred and seventy
   bacterial isolates were recovered from de Man Rogosa Sharp (MRS) agar,
   nutrient agar, lysogeny agar and tryptic soy agar media. Out of the 170
   bacterial isolates, sixteen isolates were selected based on their
   ability to tolerate glucose and sucrose. All the bacterial isolates
   tolerated 15\% glucose and 30\% sucrose. Analyses of 16S rDNA gene
   sequences of the bacterial isolates showed that the dominant cultivable
   bacteria were members of the genus Bacillus. These strains were further
   used as starters and tested for their ability to ferment rice flour with
   jaggery to produce adhirasam dough. Organoleptic evaluation was carried
   out to choose the best starter strain. Adhirasam prepared from Bacillus
   subtilis isolates S4-P11, S2-G2-A1 and S1-G15, Bacillus tequilensis
   isolates S2-H16, S3-P9, S3-G10 and Bacillus siamensis isolate S2-G13
   were highly acceptable to consumers. Adhirasam prepared using these
   starter cultures had superior product characteristics such as softness
   in texture, flavor and enhanced aroma and sweet taste.}},

   method combined with the organotypic cultivation makes it possible to
   obtain quantitative information on the Young moduli of living neurons
   and cells subjected to the action of very low concentrations of ouabain.
   This substance is known to trigger in this case the intracellular
   signalization processes by transferring a molecular signal to the genome
   of a cell. The cell response is manifested in a sharp intensification of
   protein synthesis accompanied by a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and
   activation of enzyme signal pathways in a cytosol. AFM measurements of
   the images of the cell surface relief are performed using the PeakForce
   quantitative nanomechanical properties mapping PeakForce QNM mode. The
   Young moduli of control neurons and of sensory neurons under the action
   of ouabain are measured simultaneously. It is found that the activation
   of the signal-transducing function of Na+, K+-ATPhase triggers
   intracellular signal cascades, which increase the cell stiffness. The
   application of the AFM method in further studies of the mechanisms of
   intracellular molecular processes appears as promising. Its combination
   with inhibitory analysis will clarify the role of individual molecules
   (e.g., a number of ferments) in regulation of growth and development of
   living organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The article discusses the conflict between lived religion and the state
   control of poor relief in a modernizing society by analysing the case of
   Emma Makinen's private orphanage. Emma Makinen's philanthropic work
   among neglected children was motivated by her Evangelical Revivalist
   conviction. Because of her trust in the transformative power of faith,
   she considered it appropriate to establish an orphanage next to a
   shelter for `fallen' women. This decision led her onto a collision
   course with the State Inspector of Poor Relief and the general public,
   who did not share her religious views but emphasized the legislative and
   moral aspects vis-a-vis organizing social work. The conflict
   demonstrates, firstly, how the ancien regime and the traditional
   religious authority of the Evangelical Lutheran state church in
   particular was challenged by individual agency in voluntary associations
   such as the Evangelical Revivalist Free Mission. Secondly, the case of
   Emma Makinen's orphanage reflects how new kinds of boundaries were
   created by the encroaching of state control into the sphere of private
   philanthropy, followed by the strengthening role of scientific theories
   and nationalistic thinking in social work. Thirdly, the conflict opens
   up a view on border-crossings, thus emphasizing the undefined nature of
   a modernizing society.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease
   (PD) have a major impact on health-related quality of life. This is the
   first randomized controlled trial to use the NMS Scale (NMSS) as a
   primary outcome to assess treatment effects on NMS in PD.
   Methods: In this double-blind trial (NCT01300819), patients with PD and
   a total NMSS score >= 40 were randomized (2:1) to rotigotine or placebo,
   titrated over 1-7 weeks to optimal dose (<= 8 mg/24 h for patients not
   receiving levodopa, <= 16 mg/24 h for patients receiving levodopa),
   maintained for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in NMSS total
   score from baseline to end of maintenance. Secondary outcomes were the
   nine NMSS domains, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III
   (motor) and the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39).
   Results: In total, 283/349 (81.1\%) randomized patients completed the
   trial; 211 rotigotine and 122 placebo were included in the full analysis
   set. The NMSS total score decreased by 23 (rotigotine) and 19 (placebo)
   points; the treatment difference was not statistically significant
   (-3.58; 95\% confidence interval -8.43, 1.26; P = 0.147). Numerically
   greater than placebo improvements were detected in the `mood/apathy' and
   `miscellaneous' NMSS domains (P < 0.05). Treatment differences in UPDRS
   III (-2.60; -4.27, -0.92; P = 0.002) and PDQ-39 (-2.79; -5.21, -0.37; P
   = 0.024) favoured rotigotine. Adverse events reported more frequently
   with rotigotine were nausea, application site reactions, somnolence and
   headache.
   Conclusions: Rotigotine improvement in the multi-domain NMSS total score
   was not superior to placebo. A different sensitivity of individual NMSS
   domains to dopaminergic therapy and a large placebo effect may have
   contributed to these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the use of beta-blockers and to monitor heart
   rate in Mexican patients with coronary artery disease.
   Methods: CLARIFY is an outpatients registry with stable CAD. A total of
   33,283 patients from 45 countries were enrolled between November 2009
   and July 2010 from which 1342 were Mexican patients.
   Results: The mean HR pulse was 70 bpm (beats per minute). Patients in
   Mexico were compared with the remaining global CLARIFY population.
   Patients in Mexico had a higher incidence of acute myocardial infarction
   and percutaneous coronary intervention, and lower incidence of
   revascularization surgery compared with the remaining CLARIFY
   population. More often, Mexican patients presented with diabetes, but
   less often hypertension and stroke. These patients were split into three
   mutually exclusive groups of HR <= 60 (N = 263), HR 61-69 (N = 356) and
   HR >= 70 (N = 722). Patients with elevated HR had a higher incidence of
   diabetes and higher diastolic blood pressure on average than those with
   controlled HR. Regarding the use of beta-blockers, they were used in
   63.3\% of patients, 2.7\% showed intolerance or contraindication to
   treatment to monitor heart rate, and ivabradine was used in 2.3\%. Out
   of approximately 849 patients receiving treatment of beta-blockers,
   52.1\% had >= 70 bpm HR.
   Conclusions: In a large proportion of Mexican patients with stable
   coronary disease the HR remain elevated, >70 bpm, even with the use of
   beta-blockers; this requires further attention. (C) 2014 Instituto

   feldspar present in the formulation of porcelain by ornamental stones
   residue coming from the polishing process of a medium-sized company. The
   materials selected were comminuted in the wet ball mill and subsequently
   sieved through 80 mesh Fluorescence X-ray analysis, scanning electron
   microscopy and also particle size distribution were made. They were
   formulated four compositions by varying the amount of residue replacing
   feldspar. In these samples the particle size distribution analyzes were
   performed and subsequently the samples were pressed and sintered at
   temperatures ranging from 1100 to 1250 degrees C in resistive electric
   oven for 2 hours. The porcelains characterizations were made by apparent
   porosity, water absorption and apparent density by the Archimedes
   method; mechanical resistance measurements were also performed made by
   bending at three points; X-ray diffraction for the analysis of the
   phases, and scanning electron microscopy for microstructural analysis.
   The results showed that it is feasible to replace the feldspar for
   ornamental rocks polishing residue, since the physical properties of the
   porcelain as water absorption and mechanical strength and are slightly
   changed. Furthermore, the addition of residue reduces the sintering
   temperature, however, it is necessary to have greater control of this
   temperature in the production process due to the lower firing range.}},

Abstract = {{Interferon (IFN)-free regimens are needed to treat hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) infection. Combined simeprevir (SMV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) with or
   without ribavirin (RBV) results in high sustained virological response
   (SVR) rates along with minimal adverse events (AEs) in patients with
   hepatitis C genotype 1 (HCV GT1). The aim of this study was to report on
   the virological response, safety, and tolerability of SOF and SMV with
   or without RBV in compensated and decompensated patients with cirrhosis
   with HCV GT1 infection. Patients treated with standardized clinical
   protocol utilizing SMV+SOF with or without RBV at three transplant
   centers were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 119 patients (61\%
   male, 87\% white, 69\% subtype 1a, 30\% Child-Pugh-Turcott {[}CPT]-B
   liver cirrhosis {[}LC], and 82\% were treatment experienced) received
   treatment and were followed for a median of 38 weeks (range, 12-58).
   Sustained virological response (SVR) at week 12 (SVR12) was achieved in
   78\% (92 of 118) of patients (95\% confidence interval: 69-85). Lower
   pretreatment Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was a
   predictor of SVR12 (P=0.018). Baseline viral load, previous treatment
   status, RBV use, or GT1 subtype did not impact SVR 12. The majority of
   patients with SVR12 showed stability or improvement in MELD score.
   Treatment was very well tolerated with mild degrees of AEs. Conclusions:
   The regimen of SMV+SOF with or without RBV for 12 weeks was very well
   tolerated and resulted in high SVR12 rates (78\%) in HCV GT1 patients
   with LC. SVR12 was inversely related to pretreatment MELD. SVR12 had
   favorable short-term impact on MELD score. Long-term impact on disease
   stability is yet to be determined. Longer treatment duration or the use
   of different regimen may still be needed in this population. (Hepatology

Abstract = {{This article uses archival research to explore important differences in
   the discursive and institutional positioning of Mexican American and
   African American men during World War II. Through the focal point of the
   riots that erupted in Los Angeles and other major cities in the summer
   of 1943, I examine the ways in which black and Mexican ``rioters{''}
   were imagined in official and popular discourses. Though both groups of
   youth were often constructed as deviant and subversive, there were also
   divergences in the ways in which their supposed racial difference was
   discursively configured. I also consider the experiences of each group
   in the World War II military, a subject that has received little
   attention in previous work on the riots. Though both groups were subject
   to discrimination and brutality on the home front, only African
   Americans were segregated in the military-a fact that profoundly
   influenced the 1943 riots. Examining the very different conditions under
   which these men served, as well as the distinct ways in which their
   presence within the military and on the home front was interpreted and
   given meaning by press, law enforcement, and military officials, helps
   to illuminate the uneven and complex workings of racism in America,
   disrupting the common conceptualization of a definitive white/nonwhite

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{An analytical method that provides chromatographic information regarding
   gas oil resins has been developed. This method uses a high performance
   liquid chromatographic system without backflushing and a single
   hyper-cross-linked polystyrene column. The use of the latter was
   warranted as it retains aromatic model compounds more effectively than a
   typically used silica-based amino-cyano column. Moreover, there was no
   need for extra solvent drying techniques because a retention time
   reproducibility of 2.9\% RSD over 6 months was achieved. Using this
   method, gas oil resins were separated into seven chromatographic regions
   in 35 min on the hyper-cross-linked polystyrene column using a
   four-solvent-gradient procedure (hexane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran,
   and methanol). On the basis of model compounds, separation was achieved
   between aromatics, sulfur-containing, and nitrogen-containing compounds.
   Determining composition has a large effect on the characteristics,
   conversion, and uses of the petroleum feedstock. As resins comprise a
   significant component of petroleum feedstock-up to 54\% of the source
   material-the detailed characterization of resins using this method is
   expected to assist in improving the valorization of petroleum products.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design and simulation of a single and
   multi-band perfect metamaterial absorber (MA) in the THz region base on
   Jerusalem cross (JC) and metamaterial load in unit cells. The structures
   consist of dual metallic layers for allowing near-perfect absorption
   with absorption peak of more than 99\%. In this novel design,
   four-different shape of Jerusalem cross is presented and by adding L, U
   and W shape loaded to first structure, we tried to achieve a dual-band
   absorber. In addition, by good implementation of these loaded, we are
   able to control the absorption resonance at second resonance at 0.9, 0.7
   and 0.85 THz respectively. In the other hand, we achieved a semi stable
   designing at first resonance between 0.53 and 0.58 THz. The proposed
   absorber has broadband polarization angle. The surface current modeled
   and proved the broadband polarization angle at prototype MA. The LC
   resonance of the metamaterial for Jerusalem cross and modified
   structures are extracting from equivalent circuit. As a result, proposed
   MA is useful for THz medical imaging and communication systems and the
   dual-band absorber has applications in many scientific and technological
   areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Contextual memory implies recognition based on the association between
   past and present events experienced. It is important for daily
   functioning and dysfunctional in many neuropsychological disturbances.
   The network related to this memory is still open for debate, even though
   it has been associated with medial temporal lobe regions, including the
   perirhinal, entorhinal and temporal association cortices, as well as the
   hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Our work tries to elucidate whether a
   change in the context, such as differences in the amount of stimuli
   presented on the walls and floor of an open field during object
   exploration, affects the recognition of an object that has been
   experienced before, and whether this context manipulation could be
   linked to changes in c-Fos expression. For this purpose, we used a
   one-trial novel-object recognition task. The animals were divided into
   two different experimental conditions; in the OR-NORMAL group, the
   sample and probe test were performed in the same context. However, in
   the OR-CONTEXT group, the probe test was performed in a different
   context. Our results showed that the OR-NORMAL group presented a greater
   exploration of objects than the OR-CONTEXT group. However, both groups
   presented significant exploration of the novel object. To label the
   brain regions involved in novel-object recognition under these
   conditions, we marked the expression of c-Fos protein. Results suggest
   that a neural circuit that includes the hippocampus, entorhinal and
   temporal association cortices is involved in the recognition of the
   novel-object in a novel context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objectives: Obstructive respiratory events often terminate with an
   associated respiratory-related leg movement (RRLM). Such leg movements
   are not scored as periodic leg movements (periodic limb movements during
   sleep, PLMS), although the criteria for distinguishing RRLM from PLMS
   differ between the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and the
   World Association of Sleep Medicine (WASM)/International Restless Legs
   Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) scoring manuals. Such LMs may be
   clinically significant in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   The prevalence and correlation of RRLM in men with OSA were examined.
   Methods: A case-control sample of 575 men was selected from all men with
   an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, >= 3\% desaturation criteria) >= 10 and
   good data from piezoelectric leg movement sensors at the first in-home
   sleep study in the MrOS cohort (mean age = 76.8 years). Sleep studies
   were rescored for RRLMs using five different RRLM definitions varying in
   both latency of leg movement onset from respiratory event termination
   and duration of the leg movement. The quartile of RRLM\% (the number of
   RRLM/the number of hypopneas + apneas) was derived.
   Results: The nonparametric densities of RRLM\% were most influenced by
   alterations in the latency rather than the duration of the LM. The most
   liberal RRLM definition (latency 0-5 s, duration 0.5-10 s) led to a
   median RRLM\% of 23.4 (interquartile range 12.41, 37.12) in this sample.
   The average AHI and arousal index increased as the quartile of RRLM\%
   increased, as well as the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease (COPD). The prevalence of those with a history of hypertension
   decreased as RRLM\% increased. The non-Caucasian race was associated
   with lower RRLM\%.
   Conclusion: Within an elderly sample with moderate to severe OSA,
   piezoelectric-defined RRLM\% is associated with a number of
   sleep-related and demographic factors. Further study of the optimal
   definition, predictors, and consequences of RRLM is warranted. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a common
   disorder of the growing hip; however, its etiology remains unknown.
   Vitamin D (25-OH) is a major regulator of bone homeostasis and calcium
   metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency is one of the major causes of rickets,
   and rickets has been associated with SCFE. Increased body mass index
   (BMI) has been linked to SCFE and obese children are known to have lower
   vitamin D levels. Therefore, we hypothesize that children who develop
   SCFE may have subclinical rickets predisposing them to the development
   of physeal disease.
   Methods: This was a pilot, prospective study designed to determine the
   relationship between vitamin D, bone, muscle, and fat in patients with
   SCFE. We enrolled 20 consecutive patients with idiopathic SCFE aged 9 to
   14 years. Upon diagnosis, vitamin D, PTH, T4, and thyroid-stimulating
   hormone blood levels were obtained. A single-slice computed tomography
   was used to measure cortical bone density (CBD) of the femur.
   Demographics, BMI, and the results obtained were compared to generate a
   relationship between vitamin D levels and SCFE.
   Results: Twenty patients were enrolled, 13 males and 7 females, at an
   average age of 12 years (range, 9 to 14 y), and mean BMI\% was 93.9
   (range, 81.3 to 99.5). There were 15 stable and 5 unstable SCFE.
   Overall, mean and SD values for vitamin D, 25-OH were within the normal
   range (43.9 +/- 13.5). We found no difference in values in vitamin D
   between nonobese (BMI<95\%) and obese (BMI >= 95\%) subjects (34.8 +/-
   16.8 vs. 51.6 +/- 22.4, P= 0.144). Moreover, we found no difference in
   CBD between these 2 groups (1126 +/- 33.1 vs. 1147 +/- 41.2, P= 0.333).
   There was no relation between blood values of vitamin D and measures of
   CBD.
   Conclusions: Although obese children are known to have lower levels of
   vitamin D and a higher prevalence of SCFE, we found no correlation
   between low vitamin D and the development of SCFE in this subset of
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: the aim of this study was to compare an Intensive Lifestyle
   Intervention against Traditional Treatment for obesity management in the
   primary care setting.
   Subjects and methods: interventional randomized controlled study with
   participation of 42 obese adults. Subjects assigned to the Intensive
   Lifestyle Intervention received a validated behavior change protocol
   ``Group Lifestyle Balance{''} in 12 sessions, weekly consultations by a
   nutritionist and meal replacements. Traditional Treatment consisted of
   monthly consultations with a nutritionist that provided nutritional
   assessment and physical activity.
   Results: almost all study participants (97\%) were measured after 3
   months of intervention. Intensive Lifestyle Intervention and Traditional
   Treatment subjects showed the following changes in body weight: (Median
   {[}25-75th percentile]) (-4.7 kg {[}-6.5, -3.1]) vs. (+0.4 kg {[}-0.3,
   1.3]). Sixty two percent of Intensive Lifestyle Intervention group
   participants lost more than 5 \% body weight vs. 0 \% in the traditional
   treatment group (p <0.001).
   Conclusions: this preliminary evidence showed that an Intensive
   Lifestyle Intervention can be an effective strategy for obesity

Abstract = {{A new digital bathymetric model (DBM) for the Northeast Greenland (NEG)
   continental shelf (74 degrees N-81 degrees N) is presented. The DBM has
   a grid cell size of 250 m x 250 m and incorporates bathymetric data from
   30 multibeam cruises, more than 20 single-beam cruises and first
   reflector depths from industrial seismic lines. The new DBM
   substantially improves the bathymetry compared to older models. The DBM
   not only allows a better delineation of previously known seafloor
   morphology but, in addition, reveals the presence of previously unmapped
   morphological features including glacially derived troughs, fjords,
   grounding-zone wedges, and lateral moraines. These submarine landforms
   are used to infer the past extent and ice-flow dynamics of the Greenland
   Ice Sheet during the last full-glacial period of the Quaternary and
   subsequent ice retreat across the continental shelf. The DBM reveals
   cross-shelf bathymetric troughs that may enable the inflow of warm
   Atlantic water masses across the shelf, driving enhanced basal melting
   of the marine-terminating outlet glaciers draining the ice sheet to the
   coast in Northeast Greenland. Knolls, sinks, and hummocky seafloor on
   the middle shelf are also suggested to be related to salt diapirism.
   North-south-orientated elongate depressions are identified that probably
   relate to ice-marginal processes in combination with erosion caused by
   the East Greenland Current. A single guyot-like peak has been discovered
   and is interpreted to have been produced during a volcanic event
   approximately 55 Ma ago.}},

Abstract = {{With aging populations, European countries face difficult challenges. In
   2002, France implemented a public allowance program (APA) offering
   financial support to the disabled elderly for their long-term care (LTC)
   needs. Although currently granted to 1.2 million people, it is suspected
   that some of those eligible do not claim it-presenting a non-take-up
   behavior. The granting of APA is a decentralized process, with 94 County
   Councils (CC) managing it, with wide room for local interpretation. This
   spatial heterogeneity in the implementation of the program creates the
   conditions for a ``quasi-natural experiment{''}, and provides the
   opportunity to study the demand for APA in relation to variations in
   CCs' ``generosity{''} in terms of both eligibility and subsidy rate for
   LTC. We use a national health survey and administrative data in a
   multilevel model controlling for geographical, cultural and political
   differences between counties. The results show that claiming for APA is
   associated with the ``generosity{''} of CCs: the population tends to
   apply less for the allowance if the subsidy rate is in average lower.
   This pecuniary trade-off, revealed by our study, can have strong
   implications for the well-being of the elderly and their relatives. (C)

Abstract = {{As part of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation
   Budget (ICARB) conducted under the Geosphere Biosphere Programme of
   Indian Space Research Organisation, ship-based aerosol sampling was
   carried out over the marine environment of Bay of Bengal (BoB) during
   the northern winter months of December 2008 to January 2009. About 101
   aerosol samples were collected, covering the region from 3.4 degrees to
   21 degrees N latitude and 76 degrees to 98 degrees E longitude-the
   largest area covered-including the south east (SE) BoB for the first
   time. These samples were subjected to gravimetric and chemical analysis
   and the total aerosol loading as well the mass concentration of the
   ionic species namely F-, Cl-, Br-, NO2-, NO3-, PO42-, SO42-, NH4+, etc.
   and the metallic species, Na, Mg, Ca, K, Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Pb were
   estimated for each sample. Based on the spatial distribution of
   individual chemical species, the air flow pattern, and airmass back
   trajectory analysis, the source characteristics of aerosols for
   different regions of BoB were identified. Significant level of
   continental pollution was noticed over BoB during winter. While
   transport of pollution from Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) contributed to
   aerosols over north BoB, those over SE BoB were influenced by SE Asia. A
   quantitative study on the wind-induced production of sea salt aerosols
   and a case study on the species dependent effect of rainfall are also
   presented in this paper.}},

   the accident frequency and severity are estimated for different
   scenarios of transportation, and they are used to classify the scenarios
   by a new structure of decision tree (DT), which is proposed to select
   branching variables at the primary levels according to the experts'
   perception. The outputs of the DT are stated in the form of if-then
   rules trained by a multilayer perceptron neural network to generalize
   the safe programs for Hazmat transportation. To illustrate the
   performance of this approach, the UK road accident data set is used.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the prevalence, reasons and predictors for home
   birth in a rural community.
   Method: Descriptive cross sectional study which utilised a pretested
   interviewer administered semistructured questionnaire to assess the
   place of delivery in their last childbirth among 410 pregnant women
   attending antenatal care in Birnin Kudu, Nigeria. Logistic regression
   analysis was used to assess the relative effect of determinants.
   Result: Prevalence: Of the 410 women, 248 (60.5\%) delivered at home in
   their last childbirth. Self reported reasons: Home birth was opted for
   because of: lack of transportation 113 (45.6\%), onset of labour was at
   night 104 (41.9 \%), preferred birthing position 72 (29.0\%), tradition
   60 (24.2\%), fear of surgery 42 (16.9\%) and poor attitude of health
   workers 32 (12.9\%).
   Predictors: The odds of giving birth at home was 3.88 times higher in
   women with informal education (adjusted OR 3.88; 95\% Cl: 2.51, 6.00)
   and the odds of giving birth at home was 0.27 for women with less than 5
   deliveries compared with women with 5 or more deliveries (adjusted OR
   0.27; 95\% Cl: 0.15, 0.49) after controlling for confounders.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of home birth is high in Birnin Kudu and
   according to our respondents the main reasons for this practice are
   onset of labour late at night with lack of transportation and a limited
   choice of birthing positions. Provision of training and retraining of
   skilled birth attendants to assist women birthing in squatting positions
   would encourage women to deliver in the hospitals. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The impact of ship motion on bubbly flow was emulated using a swell
   simulator to expose flow structure changes emerging in bubble columns
   relevant to offshore floating applications. Roll, roll+pitch, yaw, heave
   and sway were implemented at various frequencies and changes in bubbly
   flow resulting from the imposed motions were monitored for the first
   time by means of a dual capacitance wire mesh sensor to measure local
   gas holdup and velocity. Visualizations of the two-phase flow revealed
   that roll, roll+pitch, and high-frequency sway were the most impactful
   in terms of bubble zigzag and swirl, and bubble-clustering and
   segregation due to vessel dynamic inclinations. As a consequence of
   these motions, lateral migration of bubbles and their clustering
   enhanced liquid recirculation and local streamwise gas velocity.
   Compared to static vertical bubble column, bubbly flow pattern was
   barely altered by yaw and low-frequency sway except the heave
   displacements which tended to slowdown the bubble rise. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Below-average reading performances have been reported in individuals
   with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), but literacy problems in these
   subjects have yet to be characterized. In this study, the presence and
   characteristics of literacy deficits in boys with DMD were investigated
   through a comparison with typically developing children and with
   children affected by developmental dyslexia, with the aim of clarifying
   whether DMD and developmental dyslexia have overlapping profiles of
   literacy deficits and whether these deficits are associated, as in
   children with dyslexia, with impairments in phonological processing and
   rapid lexical access.
   The results confirmed the high incidence of literacy problems in boys
   with DMD and revealed a profile less severe than, but qualitatively
   similar to, that of Italian children with developmental dyslexia. Both
   groups showed specific difficulties in reading and writing words and a
   reduced rapid automatized naming (RAN) speed. This is the first time
   that a RAN speed deficit has been documented in DMD. Moreover, the boys
   with DMD and the subgroup of dyslexic children with a previous language
   delay showed additional deficits in phonological processing.
   The impairments highlighted in this study could explain the reading
   difficulties observed in boys with DMD and suggest that there is a need
   for targeted preschool interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Knowing 4-Coumarate: coenzyme A ligase (4CL) is one of the important
   enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of phenylpropanoid, we studied the
   gene expression profiles of 4CL and determined the production of
   selected flavonoids in different parts of Boesenbergia rotunda. The
   optimal growth conditions for B. rotunda cells were also investigated.
   In this study, we found that the 4CL transcript was expressed in leaves,
   rhizomes, and roots with highest expression level found in roots. In
   contrast, HPLC results showed that the highest total flavonoid contents
   (pinostrobin, pinocembrin and panduratin A) were recorded in rhizome
   followed by root and leaf samples. Since rhizome has been found to be a
   suitable source of explants for in vitro propagation, thus, we initiated
   sprout from rhizome in order to establish cell suspension cultures. Our
   study showed that cells grown in full strength Murashige and Skoog basal
   medium (pH 5.8) containing 1 mg/l 1-napththylacetic acid, 1 mg/l
   6-benzyladenine, and 3 \% sucrose produced maximal cell biomass and
   total flavonoid contents. We also found that the 4CL transcript levels
   for 14- and 10-day old phenylalanine-treated cultures were up-regulated
   for 22- and 17-fold, respectively, compared to 0-day, indicating the
   promotive effect of phenylalanine in enhancing the 4CL gene expression.
   This study provides necessary baseline data for 4CL gene expression
   profiles and optimal cell culture conditions for the flavonoid
   production.}},

Abstract = {{We examine a fund manager's alleged manipulation of platinum and
   palladium futures settlement prices. Using benchmarks from parallel
   electronic markets, we find that the manager's market-on-close trading
   causes significant settlement price artificiality. Defying predictions
   that competition among floor traders should limit any artificiality, the
   artificiality increases in the second half of the alleged manipulation
   period. Between 35\% and 52\% of the latter-period artificiality is
   directly attributable to noncompetitive floor prices. Inflated floor
   volume contributes a similar proportion to artificiality via the
   exchange's trade-weighted settlement price formula. We estimate that
   floor counterparties reaped more than \$6.0 million in excess profits.

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate why nonurgent patients present
   to the Emergency Department (ED) despite availability of alternative
   services; also to assess impact of the UK Choose Well Campaign. A
   convenience sample of nonurgent ED attenders was surveyed in North
   Wales, UK. More than half of patients sought advice from friends,
   family, carer or GP before attending ED. Of the one-third of patients
   who had not tried an alternative service before presenting to ED,
   reasons given included patients thinking that they might need a
   radiograph (46\%), believing that GP would be unable to help (29\%) or
   stating that GP was not available (19\%). Twenty per cent of patients
   reported they would have changed their decision about attending ED if
   they had known more about alternatives. Only 12\% were aware of Choose
   Well. Analysis suggests that though Choose Well effectively provides
   information on alternatives, it does not translate into more appropriate
   attendance.}},

   method. Long-term stability of the capacitor has also been tested by CV
   method, and the results indicated that, after 500 cycles, the specific
   capacitance of PANI/CuO nanocomposite film is 81.82 \% of the initial
   capacitance. An equivalent circuit model of R (s)(C (dl)(R (1)(Q(R (2)

Abstract = {{A framework for the inflation of micro-CT and histology data using
   intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images, is presented. The proposed
   methodology consists of three steps. In the first step the
   micro-CT/histological images are manually co-registered with IVUS by
   experts using fiducial points as landmarks. In the second step the lumen
   of both the micro-CT/histological images and IVUS images are
   automatically segmented. Finally, in the third step the
   micro-CT/histological images are inflated by applying a transformation
   method on each image. The transformation method is based on the IVUS and
   micro-CT/histological contour difference. In order to validate the
   proposed image inflation methodology, plaque areas in the inflated
   micro-CT and histological images are compared with the ones in the IVUS
   images. The proposed methodology for inflating micro-CT/histological
   images increases the sensitivity of plaque area matching between the
   inflated and the IVUS images (7\% and 22\% in histological and micro-CT
   images, respectively). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Effectiveness}},
Journal = {{AERA OPEN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{As educational policy makers seek strategies to improve the teacher
   workforce, the early career period represents a unique opportunity to
   identify struggling teachers, examine the likelihood of future
   improvement, and make strategic pretenure investments in development or
   dismissals. It is also a useful time to identify particularly promising
   teachers for development and focus on high-needs areas. This article
   asks how much teachers vary in performance improvement during their
   first 5 years of teaching and to what extent initial job performance
   predicts later performance. We find that, on average, initial
   performance is quite predictive of future performance, far more so than
   typically measured teacher characteristics. This is particularly the
   case in math, while predictions about future English language arts (ELA)
   performance based on initial ELA value added are less precise.
   Predictions are most powerful at the extremes. We use these predictions
   to explore the likelihood that personnel actions based on initial
   performance would lead to inappropriate distinctions between teachers
   who would be high or low performing in future years. We also examine the
   much less discussed costs of failure to distinguish performance when
   meaningful differences exist. The results point to the potential of
   policies that make use of teachers' initial performance to infirm
   personnel decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is of commercial importance,
   conservation concern, and is a representative of one of the oldest
   lineages of ray-finnedfish, the Osteoglossomorpha. Toaddto genomic
   knowledge of this species and the evolutionof teleosts, the genome of a
   Malaysian specimen of arowana was sequenced. Adraft genome is presented
   consisting of 42,110 scaffoldswith a total size of 708Mb (2.85\% gaps)
   representing 93.95\% of core eukaryotic genes. Using a k-mer-based
   method, a genome size of 900Mbwas also estimated. Wepresent an update on
   the phylogenomics of fishes based on a total of 27 species (23 fish
   species and 4 tetrapods) using 177 orthologous proteins (71,360 amino
   acid sites), which supports established relationships except that
   arowana is placed as the sister lineage to all teleost clades (Bayesian
   posterior probability 1.00, bootstrap replicate 93\%), that evolved
   after the teleost genome duplication event rather than the eels
   (Elopomorpha). Evolutionary rates are highly heterogeneous across the
   tree with fishes represented by both slowly and rapidly evolving
   lineages. A total of 94 putative pigment geneswere identified, providing
   the impetus for development of molecular markers associated with the
   spectacular colored phenotypes found within this species.}},

   Small Modular Reactors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND RADIATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, several small modular reactor (SMR) designs have been
   developed. These nuclear power plants (NPPs) not only offer a small
   power size (less than 300 MWe), a reduced spatial footprint, and
   modularized compact designs fabricated in factories and transported to
   the intended sites, but also passive safety features. Some light water
   (LW)-SMRs have already been granted by Department of Energy: NuScale and
   mPower. New LW-SMRs are mainly inspired by the early LW-SMRs (such as
   process-inherent ultimate safety (PIUS), international reactor
   innovative and secure (IRIS), and safe integral reactor (SIR)). LW-SMRs
   employ significantly fewer components to decrease costs and increase
   simplicity of design. However, new physical challenges have appeared
   with these changes. At the same time, advanced SMR (ADV-SMR) designs
   (such as PBMR, MHR Antares, Prism, 4S, and Hyperion) are being developed
   that have improved passive safety and other features. This paper
   quantitatively and qualitatively compares most of the LW-and ADV-SMRs
   with respect to reactors, nuclear fuel, containment, reactor coolant
   systems, refueling, and emergency coolant systems. Economic and
   financing evaluations are also included in the paper. The detailed
   comparisons in this paper elucidate that one reactor is not superior to
   the others analyzed in this study, as each reactor is designed to meet
   different needs.}},

Abstract = {{We develop several models to examine possible predictors of the return

   alternative predictive models, we show that the dynamic model averaging

   (such as the random walk) as well as the Bayesian model averaging (BMA)
   model. The DMS is the best predictive model overall across all forecast
   horizons. Generally, all the predictors show strong predictive power at
   one time or another though at varying magnitudes, while the exchange
   rate factor and the Kansas City Fed's financial stress index appear to
   be strong at almost all horizons and sub-periods. However, the

Abstract = {{This study aimed presenting a case of a 64-year-old woman with a rare
   diagnosis of myofibroblastoma (MFB). MFB is one of the rare, benign,
   spindle-like stromal tumors arising from the connective tissue of the
   breast. MFBs are often confused with fibroadenomas and hamartomas
   because of their benign characteristic appearance on breast imaging and
   are diagnosed after excisional biopsies. Their differential diagnosis
   with malignant neoplasia of the breast is important because of their
   wide morphological spectrum. Our case also demonstrated a breast mass
   with benign imaging characteristics and a needle core biopsy revealing a
   benign, spindle-like stromal tumor. The pathological examination

   have been prepared by solution cast technique. The transmittances of the
   samples are decreased with increasing Al powder concentration. The
   absorption spectra of the samples are shifted to higher wavelengths
   which indicate their importance for shielding. The increase of
   absorption intensity in UV region was observed. The clear shift of
   absorption edge upon the addition of Al powder content indicated the
   decrease of energy band gap. The increase of extinction coefficient at
   high wavelengths for the samples containing Al powder revealed the loss
   of photon energy. The refractive indexes of the doped samples are
   increased compared to that of pure PVA. The linear relationship between
   the refractive index and volume fraction indicates a good dispersion of
   Al powder in PVA host polymer. The direct optical band gap measured from
   the plot of (alpha h upsilon)(2) versus photon energy (h upsilon) showed
   a decreasing trend with increase of Al content. The Urbach energy was

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Placenta-mediated diseases (PMDs) including preeclampsia and
   fetal growth restriction are often characterized by shallow trophoblast
   invasion and incomplete spiral artery remodeling leading to impaired
   placental perfusion. In this context, umbilical artery (UA) Doppler can
   be used to detect high resistance to flow characteristic of very
   late-stage placental disease. We propose that evaluation of
   intraplacental villous artery (IPVA) resistance can provide earlier
   detection of increased resistance in placental flow.
   STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-five patients were recruited from the Ottawa
   Hospital. All had scans at 18 to 20, 28 and 34 weeks of gestation. IPVAs
   arising perpendicular to the chorionic plate in three regions (placental
   tips 4 cm away from cord insertion and within 1 cm from cord insertion)
   were sampled at each gestational age for resistance index (RI) and
   pulsatility index (PI). UA Doppler was also obtained from a free loop of
   cord. Pregnancy outcomes were collected from a chart review. Data were
   analyzed using SAS version 9.4 and standard statistic tests (mean +/-
   s.d., Student's t-test, mixed-effects modeling).
   RESULT: A total of 53 patients completed the study. Of these, 38 had
   normal pregnancy outcomes (controls) and 15 (cases) developed PMD
   (preeclampsia, n = 8 and low birth weight/intrauterine growth
   restriction, n = 7). Mean birth weight in the study group was 2482.1 +/-
   518.85 g. At 18 to 20, 28 and 34 weeks gestation, the mean IPVA
   resistance indices in the control group were 0.86 +/- 0.16, 0.81 +/-
   0.12 and 0.71 +/- 0.12 for PI and 0.57 +/- 0.07, 0.55 +/- 0.06 and 0.49
   +/- 0.06 for RI, respectively. However, in the cases developing PMDs,
   the PIs were 1.09 +/- 0.17, 0.95 +/- 0.21 and 0.78 +/- 0.07 and RIs 0.66
   +/- 0.07, 0.60 +/- 0.07 and 0.54 +/- 0.04, respectively (P<0.05). UA PI
   and RI Doppler did not differ between the groups as early as 18 to 20
   weeks gestation.
   CONCLUSION: Doppler measures of IPVA appear superior to UA in detecting
   early changes related to PMD. IPVA PI and RI Doppler may be useful in
   the early identification of patients at risk of PMD.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: A conventional urodynamic study (UDS) is considered
   invasive while uroflowmetry is considered inadequate in the evaluation
   of children with lower urinary tract dysfunction. The aims of this study
   were to identify the role of uroflowmetry with electromyography (UFEMG)
   in this group. Methods: A cohort of 121 children (age 5u12 years; M:F =
   2:3) with symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction underwent a
   detailed voiding history and clinical assessment. Those with evidence of
   neurological abnormality, obstructive uropathy or active urinary tract
   infection were not included. They were prospectively studied using UFEMG
   first, followed by UDS on the same day. Results: A total of 76 (63\%)
   children had abnormality on UFEMG while only 12 (10\%) had abnormality
   on UDS. UFEMG was significantly superior in picking up abnormality (P =
   0.03). Three types of UFEMG abnormalities were identified: (1)
   dysfunctional voiding (prolonged staccato trace with active pelvic floor
   and normal voided volume: n = 42), (2) idiopathic detrusor overactivity
   (shortened trace with quiet pelvic floor and reduced voided volume: n =
   16) and (3) detrusor underutilization disorder (prolonged flat trace
   with quiet pelvic floor and large voided volume: n = 18). Conclusions:
   UFEMG is ideal non-invasive test in children with lower urinary tract
   dysfunction. It helps in identifying the different patterns and the
   appropriate treatment modality.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Cabergoline is an ergot derivative with high affinity for the D-2
   dopamine receptors whose dopaminergic effects cause inhibition of
   prolactin (PRL) secretion; thus, it could be considered a molecule that
   acts as a potential dry-off facilitator. One hundred ninety-nine
   Holstein cows (102 primiparous; 97 multiparous) producing >= 18 kg/d at
   dry-off were split in 2 treatments to evaluate the effects of
   diminishing PRL secretion at dry-off (between 70 and 50 d from the
   expecting calving date) on udder engorgement, milk leakage, and cow
   well-being after dry-off. Treatments consisted of a single i.m.
   injection of 5 mL of a solution containing 5.6 mg of cabergoline (CAB;
   Velactis, Ceva Sante Animal, Libourne, France) or 5 mL of saline
   solution as a placebo (CTRL). Each animal was evaluated for presence or
   absence of milk leakages during the 4 d following dry-off and udder
   engorgement was determined using a digital algometer. Lying behavior was
   recorded during 10 d after dry-off. Twenty-five cows from each treatment
   were randomly chosen and blood sampled at 3 and 15 d after dry-off, and
   again at 5 and 3 d before the expected calving date to determine serum
   PRL concentrations. Cows on CAB had lower serum PRL concentrations than
   cows on CTRL at 3 and 15 d after dry-off. Average udder engorgement was
   lower for cows on CAB than for cows on CTRL following dry-off, and it
   decreased as days after dry-off increased. The overall incidence of milk
   leakage in cows on CAB (3.1 +/- 0.88\%) was 73.5\% of that obtained in
   cows on CTRL (11.7 +/- 1.64\%); cows on CAB had 0.2 lower odds of
   incurring milk leakage than cows on CTRL. The day following dry-off, CAB
   cows lied about 1.5 h/d more than cows on CTRL. We conclude that i.m.
   administration of 5.6 mg of cabergoline at dry-off effectively reduces
   PRL secretion, udder engorgement, and milk leakages, and improves lying
   time the day following dry-off.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) 4-6 have important
   roles as modulators of IGF actions. IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-6 predominantly
   inhibit IGF actions, whereas IGFBP-5 may enhance these actions under
   some circumstances. IGFBP-6 is unique among the IGFBPs for its marked
   IGF-II binding preference. IGFBPs 4-6 are found in the circulation as
   binary complexes with IGFs that can enter tissues. Additionally, about
   half of the circulating IGFBP-5 is found in ternary complexes with IGFs
   and an acid labile subunit; this high molecular complex cannot leave the
   circulation and acts as an IGF reservoir. IGFBPs 4-6 also have
   IGF-independent actions. These IGFBPs are regulated in a cell-specific
   manner and their dysregulation may play a role in a range of diseases
   including cancer. However, there is no clear clinical indication for
   measuring serum levels of these IGFBPs at present. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Low levels of genetic variability, inbreeding, and limited gene flow are
   three possible threats to small, isolated plant populations as
   exemplified by Quercus hinckleyi C.H. Mull. This scrub oak species has
   survived over the past 10,000 years in a region in which the climate has
   become increasingly xeric. While more prevalent after the last ice age,
   its US range is now limited to a handful of populations in one county in
   West Texas. This study examines the genetic diversity of the relict
   metapopulation and resultant conservation implications. We used
   microsatellites to genotype a total of 204 ramets collected from three
   locations in Presidio County, TX, that represent all known occurrences
   of Q. hinckleyi. Analyses of eight loci were used to determine levels of
   genetic variability, population structure and clonal growth. Genetic
   diversity for the sampled plants was high: for the total metapopulation,
   the mean number of alleles (Na) was 17.875; the mean observed
   heterozygosity (H-o) was 0.807; and the mean expected heterozygosity
   (H-e) was 0.853. Allelic richness by locus and sample (Rs) ranged from
   5.15 to 14.73. We found no evidence of inbreeding as measured by the
   fixation index, F-IS. Population structure analyses showed two distinct
   subpopulations with significant differentiation, as shown by G(ST)
   (0.033, Bonferroni corrected P = 0.001) and D-JOST (0.451, Bonferroni
   corrected P = 0.001), unique alleles and genetic clustering. High
   clonality was discovered at the two smallest sites, with only seven
   unique genotypes among 58 ramets sampled. One clone was over 30 m
   across. Sexual reproduction appears to be present at the other sites, as
   indicated by less extensive cloning. Overall, we found that Q. hinckleyi
   is not genetically depauperate despite its rarity, although unique
   genets are reduced because of cloning. Asexual reproduction may in fact
   have allowed the small relict populations to survive extreme
   environmental change as their range has dwindled. The level of genetic
   diversity and differentiation among the remaining Q. hinckleyi sites
   warrants protection and preservation of all.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe the demographic and clinical features of females
   presenting with breast malignancies at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial
   Cancer Hospital and Research Center (SKMCH \& RC), Lahore, Pakistan.
   Study Design: An observational study.
   Place and Duration of Study: SKMCH and RC, Lahore, from January 2008 to
   December 2012.
   Methodology: Demographic and clinical features of female breast cancer
   patients, registered at SKMCH and RC, were studied. Mean values, counts,
   and percentages were obtained.
   Results: Four-thousand, three-hundred and sixty-six female breast
   malignancies were recorded. Nearly 80.4\% of the patients belonged to
   Punjab. Mean age at presentation was 48.6 +/- 12.2 years, at menarche
   was 13.2 +/- 1.2 years, and at first childbirth was 23.7 +/- 4.8 years.
   Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 29.0 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2). In 60.1\%, history
   of breast feeding was positive. In 55.7\%, there was no history of use
   of any Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCP)/Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).
   Nearly 42.7\% were postmenopausal, 85.2\% had infiltrating ductal
   carcinoma, 49.6\% had grade 3 tumor, 60.7\% had stage II disease, and
   37.3\% were Estrogen Receptor (ER)/Progesterone Receptor (PR)+, Human
   Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-. Family history of breast
   cancer was positive in 16.9\% of the cases.
   Conclusion: The mean presenting age is lower than what has been recorded
   in the West. It may be worthwhile collating results from different
   institutions in order to study the epidemiology of the disease more
   extensively and develop cancer control and early detection programs.}},

   Through direct observation and blogs, the results show that participants
   have an important domain in the pedagogical and technological
   interaction. Despite the perception of the technical difficulties of
   using platforms, students emphasize that the experience has been

Abstract = {{Clinical assessment and classification of shock is extremely difficult
   to conduct on critically ill patients especially upon arrival at the
   emergency department. Resuscitative point-of-care ultrasound could be
   used for rapid initial diagnosis and better management. In this study,
   the results of using the RUSH (Rapid Ultrasound in Shock) exam to
   determine the type of shock in the emergency department are compared to
   the final diagnosis of patients. This was a single-center prospective
   study in which all patients with an unknown type of shock and no prior
   treatment were included. Parallel to the standard resuscitative
   management and diagnosis of the emergency team, the RUSH exam was
   performed blindly on the patient by an emergency medicine staff who was
   not part of the patient's caregiving team. The results of the RUSH exam
   were then compared to the final diagnosis of the patients and the 48-h
   outcome. Twenty-five patients were enrolled in this study. The overall
   kappa correlation of the RUSH exam compared with the final diagnosis was
   0.84 which is an almost perfect agreement. The overall sensitivity of
   the RUSH exam was 88 \% and the specificity was 96 \%. Although the
   mortality rate was 64 \%, there was not a significant relationship
   between mortality and the protocol used for diagnosis. The RUSH exam
   could be used in emergency wards to detect types of shock.}},

Abstract = {{The vinegar fly, Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae), is a
   recent invader in North America that has become a serious threat to
   small fruit production. It was first detected in California in 2008 and
   in Washington state in 2009. In this study, D. suzukii populations from
   the area of the original detection on California's central coast and
   from eastern Washington, the United States, were sampled over a 3-year
   period to determine genetic variation in both using microsatellite
   markers. Six different loci were successfully amplified and included in
   the analysis. These loci included nanos, elf1, antennapedia, mastermind,
   z600, and tenA. The population from eastern Washington was highly
   monomorphic with one locus, mastermind, having multiple alleles. There
   was greater genetic variation in the coastal California population with
   all loci having multiple alleles, with the exception of tenA. Owing to
   the relatively low levels of genetic variation in the eastern Washington
   population compared with the coastal California population, it appears
   that the D. suzukii population in the eastern Washington region has
   undergone a significant bottleneck.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction In health care simulation, simulation technicians perform
   multiple tasks to support various educational offerings. Technician
   responsibilities and the tasks that accompany them seem to vary between
   centers. The objectives were to identify the range and frequency of
   tasks that technicians perform and to determine if there is a
   correspondence between what technicians do and what they feel their
   responsibilities should be. We hypothesized that there is a core set of
   responsibilities and tasks for the technician position regardless of
   background, experience, and type of simulation center.
   Methods We conducted a prospective, survey-based study of individuals
   currently functioning in a simulation technician role in a simulation
   center. This survey was designed internally and piloted within 3
   academic simulation centers. Potential respondents were identified
   through a national mailing list, and the survey was distributed
   electronically during a 3-week period.
   Results A survey request was sent to 280 potential participants, 136
   (49\%) responded, and 73 met inclusion criteria. Five core tasks were
   identified as follows: equipment setup and breakdown, programming
   scenarios into software, operation of software during simulation,
   audiovisual support for courses, and on-site simulator maintenance.
   Independent of background before they were hired, technicians felt
   unprepared for their role once taking the position. Formal training was
   identified as a need; however, the majority of technicians felt
   experience over time was the main contributor toward developing
   knowledge and skills within their role.
   Conclusions This study represents a first step in defining the
   technician role within simulation-based education and supports the need
   for the development of a formal job description to allow recruitment,
   development, and certification.}},

Abstract = {{Some studies have shown that the early life stages of salmonids are
   particularly sensitive to elevated concentrations of total dissolved
   solids (TDS). We evaluated the effect of TDS released in treated
   effluent into Snap Lake (Northwest Territories, Canada) by the Snap Lake
   Diamond Mine on two salmonids native to Snap Lake: Salvenius namaycush
   (lake trout) and Thymallus arcticus (Arctic grayling). Exposures
   encompassed the embryo-alevin-fry early life stages and extended to 142
   days for lake trout and 69 days for Arctic grayling. Such extended
   testing is uncommon with these two species. Two exposures were conducted
   with each species, one initiated prior to fertilization, and the other
   subsequent to fertilization. Fertilization, survival, and growth were
   not adversely affected for either species by TDS at concentrations >
   1400 mg/L, with the exception of survival of lake trout, which produced
   an LC20 of 991 mg/L in one test, and > 1484 mg/L in the second test. For
   the specific TDS composition tested, which was dominated by chloride (45
   \%-47 \%) and calcium (20 \%-21 \%), the early life stages of these two
   fish species were relatively insensitive. Although some authors have
   suggested lower TDS regulatory limits for salmonid early life stages,
   our study indicates that this is not necessary, at least for these two
   fish species and for the specific ionic composition tested.}},

Abstract = {{Symmetric surface acoustic wave (SAW) atomizer was used to deposit
   graphene oxide (GO) nanofilms from microdroplets of the aqueous GO
   dispersion onto the surface of the SAW humidity sensors. The sensors
   with the deposited GO films were tested in a wide range of relative
   humidity and showed the amplitude of the response in the range of 1-40
   kHz sufficient for the majority of applications. The kinetics of the
   adsorption of water molecules was modeled using the assumption that two
   independent first order adsorption processes take place. Saturation
   amplitudes and rate coefficients for both processes were experimentally
   evaluated using LSQ fitting of the sensor response in the time domain
   for the films obtained by different number of depositions. The mechanism
   of the adsorption of water molecules to the GO flakes is proposed and
   discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erosion is one of the serious issues threatening the environment.
   This degrading phenomenon deteriorates the soil fertility and
   drastically affects the agricultural practices. As a consequence, the
   productivity of soil is affected unquestionably. In this regard, there
   is a need to take up conservation and management measures which can be
   applied to check further soil erosion. Even though, soil erosion is a
   mass process spread across the watershed, it is not economically viable
   to implement conservation techniques to the entire watershed. However, a
   method is a pre-requisite to identify the most vulnerable areas and
   quantify the soil erosion. In this context, Revised Universal Soil Loss
   Equation (RUSLE) has been adopted to estimate soil erosion in the
   semi-arid Andipatti Watershed of Tamil Nadu, India. This model takes
   into consideration the parameters including runoff-rainfall erosivity
   factor (R), soil erodability Factor (K), topographic factor (LS),
   cropping management factor (C), and support practice factor (P). All
   these layers are prepared in a geographical information system (GIS)
   platform using various data sources and data preparation methods. The
   results of the study indicate that the annual average soil loss within
   the watershed is about 6 t/ha/yr (metric ton per hectare per year).
   Higher soil erosion is observed in the landuse classes of gullied
   wasteland, open scrub forest and degraded plantation. The soil erosion
   risk is extremely higher on the steep slopes and adjoining foot hills.
   Based on the average soil erosion values of different landuse classes
   and characteristics of land, a proposed landuse map was prepared. The
   estimated soil erosion and the proposed landuse map could be an
   effective input for drawing sustainable watershed development measures.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate sarcoma is an aggressive malignancy. Because the disease has
   poor outcomes when treated with surgery alone, we evaluated the effect
   of neoadjuvant chemoradiation on survival. Compared with surgery alone,
   patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation had improved overall,
   cancer-specific, and recurrence-free survival. These preliminary data
   support the continued investigation of neoadjuvant therapy in patients
   with prostate sarcoma.
   Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of
   neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with prostate sarcoma treated at
   our institution and report oncological outcomes. Materials and Methods:
   The records of patients with intermediate-or high-grade prostate sarcoma
   treated with curative intent at our institution from 1993 to 2013 were
   reviewed. Patient demographic information, tumor characteristics, and
   treatment modalities used were assessed. Overall survival (OS),
   cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were
   calculated. Results: Eight patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age
   at presentation was 64 years, and urinary obstruction was the most
   common presenting symptom. All patients underwent surgical resection and
   neoadjuvant radiation and 6 had concurrent chemotherapy. Four patients
   received intraoperative radiation. With a median follow-up of 36 months,
   there were no local recurrences, 6 metastases, 4 deaths from disease,
   and no deaths from other causes. The median OS and CSS was 67.8 months,
   with actuarial OS and CSS rates of 100\% at 1 year, 75\% at 2 years,
   62.5\% at 3 years, and 62.5\% at 5 years. Median RFS was 14.2 months,
   with actuarial RFS rate of 75\% at 1 year, 37.5\% at 2 years, and 25\%
   at 3 years. Conclusion: Prostate sarcomas are rarely cured using
   surgical resection alone. Our cohort treated with a multimodality
   approach had favorable CSS and RFS compared with historic and
   contemporary series of surgery alone and no local recurrences. Most
   patients developed metastatic recurrence, highlighting the aggressive
   nature of this disease (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cannabis is an increasingly popular and controversial drug used
   worldwide. Cannabis use often begins during adolescence, a highly
   susceptible period for environmental stimuli to alter functional and
   structural organization of the developing brain. Given that adolescence
   is a critical time for the emergence of mental illnesses before
   full-onset in early adulthood, it is particularly important to
   investigate how genetic insults and adolescent cannabis exposure
   interact to affect brain development and function. Here we show for the
   first time that a perturbation in disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)
   exacerbates the response to adolescent exposure to
   delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), a major psychoactive
   ingredient of cannabis, consistent with the concept that
   gene-environment interaction may contribute to the pathophysiology of
   psychiatric conditions. We found that chronic adolescent treatment with
   Delta(9)-THC exacerbates deficits in fear-associated memory in adult
   mice that express a putative dominant-negative mutant of DISC1
   (DN-DISC1). Synaptic expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) is
   down-regulated in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala,
   critical brain regions for fear-associated memory, by either expression
   of DN-DISC1 or adolescent Delta(9)-THC treatment Notably, elevation of
   c-Fos expression evoked by context-dependent fear memory retrieval is
   impaired in these brain regions in DN-DISC1 mice. We also found a
   synergistic reduction of c-Fos expression induced by cue-dependent fear
   memory retrieval in DN-DISC1 with adolescent Delta(9)-THC exposure.
   These results suggest that alteration of CB1R-mediated signaling in
   DN-DISC1 mice may underlie susceptibility to detrimental effects of
   adolescent cannabis exposure on adult behaviors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Using Bourdieu's theoretical model as a lens for analysis, we sought to
   understand how students experience the undergraduate medical education
   (UME) milieu, focusing on how they navigate transitions from the
   preclinical phase, to the major clinical year (MCY), and to the
   preparation for residency phase. Twenty-two medical students
   participated in this longitudinal case study. Students had similar
   preclinical and post-MCY experiences but different MCY experiences
   (rotational vs. longitudinal tracks). We interviewed students every 6
   months in the preclinical phase, mid-way through MCY, and 7-8 months
   before graduation (101 total interviews). We inductively created codes,
   iteratively revised codes to best-fit the data, and thematically
   clustered codes into Bourdieu-informed categories: field (social
   structures), capital (resources) and habitus (dispositions). We found
   that students acclimated to shifts in the UME field as they moved
   through medical school: from medical school itself to the health system
   and back. To successfully navigate transitions, students learned to
   secure capital as medical knowledge and social connections in the
   preclinical and preparation for residency phases, and as reputable
   patient care and being noticed in the clinical phase. To obtain capital,
   and be well-positioned for the next phase of training, students
   consistently relied on dispositions of initiative and flexibility. In
   summary, students experience the complex context of medical school
   through a series of transitions. Efforts to improve UME would be
   well-served by greater awareness of the social structures (field) that
   students encounter, the resources to which they afford value (capital),
   and the dispositions which aid acquisition of these resources (habitus).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents particle-based optical pressure sensors for in-flow
   pressure sensing, especially for microfluidic environments. Three
   generations of pressure sensitive particles have been developed-flat
   planar particles, particles with integrated retroreflectors and
   spherical microballoon particles. The first two versions suffer from
   pressure measurement dependence on particles orientation in 3D space and
   angle of interrogation. The third generation of microspherical particles
   with spherical symmetry solves these problems making particle-based
   manometry in microfluidic environment a viable and efficient
   methodology. Static and dynamic pressure measurements have been
   performed in liquid medium for long periods of time in a pressure range
   of atmospheric to 40 psi. Spherical particles with radius of 12 mu m and
   balloon-wall thickness of 0.5 mu m are effective for more than 5 h in

Abstract = {{India is very important but relatively unexplored region in terms of
   carbon studies, where significant environmental changes have occurred in
   the 20th century that can alter terrestrial net primary productivity
   (NPP). Here, we used a process-based, Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model
   (DLEM), driven by land cover and land use change (LCLUC), climate
   change, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, atmospheric nitrogen
   deposition (NDEP), and tropospheric ozone (O-3) pollution to estimate
   terrestrial NPP in India during 1901-2010. Over the country, terrestrial
   NPP showed significant inter-annual variations ranging 1.2 Pg C year(-1)
   to 1.7 Pg C year(-1) during the 1901-2010. Overall, multiple
   environmental changes have increased terrestrial NPP by 0.23 Pg C
   year(-1). Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased NPP by
   0.29 Pg C; however climate change has offset a portion of terrestrial
   NPP (0.11 Pg C) during this study period. On an average, terrestrial NPP
   reduced by 0.12 Pg C year(-1) in drought years; when precipitation was
   100 mm year(-1) lower than long term average, suggesting that
   terrestrial carbon cycle in India is strongly linked to climate change.
   LCLUC, including land conversions and cropland management practices,
   increased terrestrial NPP by 0.043 Pg C year(-1) over the country.
   Tropospheric O-3 pollution reduced terrestrial NPP by 0.06 Pg C year(-1)
   and the decrease was comparatively higher in croplands than other biomes
   after the 1980s. Our results have shown that climate change and
   tropospheric O-3 pollution may partially offset terrestrial NPP increase
   caused by elevated CO2 concentration, LCLUC, and NDEP over India.}},

   to attain Pareto optimal allocations. We first consider the case of
   simple strategies and then, in analogy to the construction of stochastic

Abstract = {{We sought to determine the relation between technical charges for
   transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) and total time for study completion
   (TT), identify factors associated with high TT, and create a scoring
   system to predict high TT studies. We analyzed a quality improvement
   database that prospectively tracked patient flow through TTEs in our
   laboratory for 3 consecutive months. The performing sonographer or
   fellow recorded TT and its components for every study. Patient and scan
   characteristics were abstracted from the clinical database and technical
   charges from the financial database. Factors independently associated
   with high TT (top quartile >= 85 minutes) were identified in 1,686
   studies and validated in the remaining 847 studies. Median age was 7.8
   years (0 to 77.9) and median TT was 65 minutes (14 to 370 minutes).
   Charges correlated poorly with TT (r = 0.2). Multivaiiate analysis
   identified several independent factors associated with high TT. The
   final model had an area under the curve of 0.78 in the development
   sample and 0.75 in the validation sample. On the basis of the final
   model, we developed a risk score for TT >= 85 minutes. The prevalence of
   high TT was 15\% in low-score studies, 51\% in medium-score studies, and
   81\% in high-score studies. In conclusion, this is the first study to
   demonstrate poor correlation between technical charges for
   pediatric/congenital echocardiography and TT, identify risk factors for
   high TT, and develop a high TT risk scoring system. These data may
   assist in resource allocation for pediatric/congenital echocardiograms
   and inform reimbursement systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   probability measures using a least-squares method, and point out the
   limitation of the existing computational algorithms for this particular

   feasibility of our proposed methods by numerical results obtained for
   both simulated data and experimental data for inorganic glass when
   considering the resonance wavenumber as a distributed parameter.
   Finally, in the case where the distributed parameter is taken as the

Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of teachers' learning styles on their
   classroom teaching and learning practices. The reported mixed method
   study was conducted in various school districts in a large province in
   South Africa. The data was collected with the use of questionnaires
   administered to primary school natural science teachers and classroom
   observations made during a science lesson. The study examined the
   preferred learning styles of primary school science teachers. It then
   investigated how they taught natural science and attempted to establish
   if their learning styles influenced teaching and learning in their
   classrooms. Findings from the questionnaires showed that most teachers
   preferred or learned better partly through visual, active, sequential
   and intuitive learning styles. However, analyses of classroom
   observations revealed a contradiction as the teachers' proclaimed
   learning styles were not emulated, translated into or visible in their
   classroom teaching practices. The researcher argues and concludes that
   the teachers' learning styles do not necessary shape or influence their
   classroom teaching practices.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{49-55}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, in consideration of suddenly increasing of the glycerol
   and alkali, we propose a nonlinear impulsive system to describe the
   fed-batch culture of glycerol bioconversion to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD)
   induced by ICiebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia). To maximize the
   concentration of 1,3-PD at the terminal time, we present an impulsive
   optimal control problem in which the final 1,3-PD yield is taken as the
   cost function, while the feeding volumes of glycerol and the feeding
   time points are taken as decision variables. Continuous state inequality
   constraints are imposed to ensure that the concentrations of biomass,
   glycerol, and reaction products lie within specified limits. We use the
   time scaling method to handle the variable feeding time points. The
   impulsive optimal control problem is approximated as a sequence of
   nonlinear optimization sub-problems through the application of the
   penalty function and barrier function method. A hybrid algorithm by
   integrating a particle swarm optimization with gradient-based
   optimization algorithm is proposed to seek the optimal feeding strategy.
   From extensive simulation study, it is observed that the obtained
   optimal strategy is highly satisfactory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The hardware Trojan threat has motivated development of Trojan detection
   schemes at all stages of the integrated circuit (IC) lifecycle. While
   the majority of existing schemes focus on ICs at test-time, there are
   many unique advantages offered by post-deployment/run-time Trojan
   detection. However, run-time approaches have been underutilized with
   prior work highlighting the challenges of implementing them with limited
   hardware resources. In this paper, we propose three innovative
   low-overhead approaches for run-time Trojan detection which exploit the
   thermal sensors already available in many modern systems to detect
   deviations in power/thermal profiles caused by Trojan activation. The
   first one is a local sensor-based approach that uses information from
   thermal sensors together with hypothesis testing to make a decision. The
   second one is a global approach that exploits correlation between
   sensors and maintains track of the ICs thermal profile using a Kalman
   filter (KF). The third approach incorporates leakage power into the
   system dynamic model and apply extended KF (EKF) to track ICs thermal
   profile. Simulation results using state-of-the-art tools on ten publicly
   available Trojan benchmarks verify that all three proposed approaches
   can detect active Trojans quickly and with few false positives. Among
   three approaches, EKF is flawless in terms of the ten benchmarks tested
   but would require the most overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of anadromous Alosa alosa (Clupeidae) (n = 163) and Alosa fallax
   (Clupeidae) (n = 223), caught in Western Iberian Peninsula Rivers from
   2008 to 2013, were examined for buccal, branchial and internal
   macroparasites, which were identified using morphological and molecular
   methods. Alosa alosa were infected with Anisakis simplex s.s., Anisakis
   pegreffii, Hysterothylacium aduncum, Rhadinorhynchus pristis, Mazocraes
   alosae, Hemiurus appendiculatus, Ceratothoa italica and an unidentified
   ergasilid copepod. Ceratothoa italica represents a new host record for
   A. alosa. Alosa fallax were infected with A. simplex s.s., A. pegreffii,
   H. aduncum, H. appendiculatus, Clavellisa emarginata and an unidentified
   cymothoid isopod. This is the first report of C. italica, C. emarginata
   and M. alosae in the Iberian Peninsula. The phylogenetic positions of M.
   alosae, H. appendiculatus and C. emarginata were assessed using 18S and
   28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA); our contributions provide a better
   understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within their groups.
   Qualitative and quantitative differences in the parasite faunas of these
   two shad species are consistent with different feeding strategies. The
   results provide information about host migration behaviour and
   transmission pathways through diet during the marine trophic phase of
   the shad's life cycle and their roles as paratenic or final hosts and
   transporters of parasites between seawater and freshwater environments.
   The zoonotic parasites A. simplex s.s. and A. pegreffii pose a risk for
   consumers or riverine mammals (e.g. European otter). The use of
   parasites as biological tags for shad stocks in Western Iberian Rivers
   could be a useful approach in multidisciplinary studies concerning fish
   stock delimitation and characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Variation of the stress-induced magnetic field of the U75V rail steel
   under tension was investigated in this research. Various magnetic
   responses were registered by a magnetometer in the elastic and plastic
   deformation stages, which can be explained by the microstructural
   changes in magnetic domains. Two types of defective specimens were also
   tested to correlate the stress concentration with the magnetic field. It
   is found that the tangential component of the magnetic field B-x is much
   more sensitive to local stress concentration than the normal component
   B-z. The tangential component B-x reaches a peak value at the rupture
   position, and the peak magnitude is proportional to the concentrated
   stress caused by the defect. This observation is different from the Q235
   steel, whose tangential component B-x and the normal component B-z are
   equally effective. Such discrepancy might be due to that U75V fails in a
   more brittle pattern than the Q235 steel. The average value of the B-x
   along the loading axis can determine the overall stress state of the
   structure, while the peaks in the B-x curve tell the local stress
   concentration caused by cracks and dislocation.}},

Abstract = {{The widely acknowledged `RNA world' theory pertains to how life might
   have chemically originated on early Earth. It presumes the existence of
   catalytic RNAs, which were also capable of storing and propagating
   genetic information. Substantial research has gone into understanding
   how enzyme-free reactions of nucleic acids might have led to the
   formation of such catalytic RNA polymers. However, most of these studies
   involved reactions that were performed in aqueous systems devoid of any
   ``background{''} molecules. This scenario is not a true representation
   of the complex chemical environment that might have been prevalent on
   prebiotic Earth. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of
   co-solutes ({''}background{''} molecules) on the rate and accuracy of
   template-directed nonenzymatic replication of RNA, in a putative RNA
   world. Our results suggest that presence of co-solutes in the reaction
   affects the addition of purine monomers across their cognate template
   base. Reduction in the rate of these `fast' cognate addition reactions
   resulted in an apparent increase in the frequency of mismatches in the
   presence of co-solutes. However, reactions that involved the addition of
   a mismatched base were not notably affected. Such a scenario could have
   led to an accrual of mutations during the propagation of functional
   sequences on early Earth, unless the relevant sequences were separated
   from the bulk reaction milieu by some limiting boundary structure (e.g.,
   a membrane). In general, our results suggest that the presence of
   co-solutes could have affected certain prebiotic reaction rates to a
   larger extent than others. Even modest changes in nonenzymatic
   replication reaction rates could have eventually resulted in the
   accumulation of greater variation in RNA sequences over prolonged time
   periods. It, therefore, is pertinent to account for the chemical
   complexity intrinsic to prebiotic environments while studying relevant
   nonenzymatic reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, Cloud computing has emerged as a market where computing
   related resources are treated as a utility and are priced. There is a
   big competition among the Cloud service providers and therefore, the
   providers offer the services strategically. Auction, a market based
   resource allocation strategy, has received the attention among the Cloud
   researchers recently. The auction principal of resource allocation is
   based on demand and supply. This work proposes a multi-attribute
   combinatorial double auction for the allocation of Cloud resources,
   which not only considers the price but other quality of service
   parameters also. Auctioneer extends some of the parameters to the
   offered bids from the bidders in order to provide fairness and
   robustness. In case of not meeting the assured quality, a penalty is
   imposed on the provider and customer is compensated. The reputation of
   the provider also diminishes in the forthcoming rounds. Performance
   study of the proposed model is done by simulation which reflects the
   usefulness of the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   implementing TDM policies and strategies, in particular, necessitate
   careful examination and detailed analysis of commuter behavior and
   tendencies. Providing traffic condition information via radio to guide
   drivers through less congested paths is one common method of low-cost
   TDM in developing countries. The objective of this paper is to study the
   different behaviors between men and women in responding to traffic
   information that they receive by radio, as a part of advanced in-vehicle
   systems. In order to conduct this study, a random sample of drivers was
   surveyed to investigate their travel behaviors and responses while they
   were exposed to traffic information obtained through radio. Each gender
   response was studied separately to examine any possible differences in
   their propensity to use traffic information. In doing so, the ordered
   logit model was designated and NLOGIT package was used. The final
   results showed that age, driving time, listening to radio traffic
   information, preferred arrival time at workplace, and delay time
   variables in both men's and women's models were in common, but education
   and occupation were identified as significant in the females' behavior
   only, and income and car ownership were significant for males. It is
   expected that appropriate decisions in recognition of these study
   results should be made to develop more effective traffic information for
   different users.}},

Abstract = {{Mothers are expected to use environmental cues to modify maternal
   investment to optimize their fitness. However, when the environment
   varies unpredictably, cues may not be an accurate proxy of future
   conditions. Under such circumstances, selection favors a diversifying
   maternal investment strategy. While there is evidence that the
   environment is becoming more uncertain, the extent to which mothers are
   able to respond to this unpredictability is generally unknown. In this
   study, we test the hypothesis that Daphnia magna increase the variance
   in maternal investment in response to unpredictable variation in
   temperature consistent with global change predictions. We detected
   significant variability across temperature treatments in brood size,
   neonate size at birth, and time between broods. The estimated
   variability within-brood size was higher (albeit not statistically
   significant) in mothers reared in unpredictable temperature conditions.
   We also detected a cross-generational effect with the temperature
   history of mothers modulating the phenotypic response of F1's. Notably,
   our results diverged from the prediction that increased variability
   poses a greater risk to organisms than changes in mean temperature.
   Increased unpredictability in temperature had negligible effects on
   fitness-correlated traits. Mothers in the unpredictable treatment,
   survived as long, and produced as many F1's during lifetime as those
   produced in the most fecund treatment. Further, increased
   unpredictability in temperature did not affect the probability of
   survival of F1's. Collectively, we provide evidence that daphnia respond
   effectively to thermal unpredictability. But rather than increasing the
   variance in maternal investment, daphnia respond to uncertainty by being
   a jack of all temperatures, master of none. Importantly, our study
   highlights the essential need to examine changes in variances rather
   than merely on means, when investigating maternal responses.}},

   result, the scintillation index should be reduced. There are a number of

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Although the Patient Centered Medical Home is a considered an optimal
   model for care, some children still do not receive care in this model.
   Beyond the clinical and practitioner factors known to affect having a
   medical home, family and environmental risks {[}referred to as adverse
   childhood experiences (ACE)] may also be associated with having a
   medical home. This study's purpose was to examine whether family and
   environment risks are associated with children having a medical home.
   Data from the nationally representative, cross-sectional 2011-2012
   National Survey of Children's Health telephone survey were used (N =
   95,677). Analyses were conducted to describe the sample characteristics
   and determine the association between family and environmental risks and
   whether a child has a medical home. A subset of risks were modeled from
   the seminal study of ACEs.
   Nearly one-quarter of parents reported that their children experienced
   at-least one ACE. Compared to children who experienced no ACEs, children
   who experienced at least one ACE, or other family and environmental
   risks, had lower odds of having a medical home than those whom did not.
   Logistic regressions showed that cumulative ACEs (odds ratio (OR) 0.76;
   95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.90) as well as other family and
   environmental risks (OR 0.36, 95 \% CI 0.26-0.51) were related to lower
   odds of having a medical home.
   This study suggests that family and environmental risks, including ACEs,
   impact parental report of a child having a medical home and that a
   dosage effect may exist. ACEs and other risk factors must be considered
   when providers care for children at-risk of experiencing negative
   events, particularly multiple negative events.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of the study. The main objective of this study was to assess
   employees' perceptions of their occupational health service (OHS), and
   to identify ways to improve the overall quality of these services and
   the feelings of the employees.
   Methods. This is a multicenter descriptive cross-sectional study in a
   OHS. Three hundred questionnaires were distributed anonymously to
   employees attending a medical visit whatever the type. The questionnaire
   consisted in four sections investigating the socio-professional data of
   the employees, their health, their opinions about the organization of
   occupational medicine and the various types of medical visits, and
   finally a section about the services offered by OHS and well-being at
   work.
   Results. Two hundred and sixty questionnaires were fully completed and
   analyzed. Sixty percent of the respondents were women. Nearly half were
   employees, the others belonged to executive, middle management and
   workers categories. The pre-recovery visit was perceived as the less
   useful type of visit by the employees. Nearly one of two employees
   considering themselves too infrequently examined by the occupational
   physician had an unfavorable opinion of the OHS. Three-quarters of the
   employees of the smaller companies reported not knowing the actions of
   formation and/or sensitization that could be provided by the OHS. The
   vast majority of employees surveyed (93.5\%) attributed a satisfaction
   score greater than or equal to 5/10 towards their SST.
   Conclusion. Employees have a generally positive view of occupational
   medicine. Questions remain, however, to improve the information about
   the missions of the OHS:its competences and means of action. In
   addition, employees complain about too long waiting times and often
   insufficient clinical examinations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Ischemic stroke can cause striatal dopamine efflux that contributes to
   cell death. Since K(v)7 potassium channels regulate dopamine release, we
   investigated the effects of their pharmacological modulation on dopamine
   efflux, measured by fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV), and neurotoxicity, in
   Wistar rat caudate brain slices undergoing oxygen and glucose
   deprivation (OGD). The K(v)7 activators retigabine and ICA27243 delayed
   the onset, and decreased the peak level of dopamine efflux induced by
   OGD; and also decreased OGD-induced damage measured by
   2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Retigabine also
   reduced OGD-induced necrotic cell death evaluated by lactate
   dehydrogenase activity assay. The K(v)7 blocker linopirdine increased
   OGD-evoked dopamine efflux and OGD-induced damage, and attenuated the
   effects of retigabine. Quantitative-PCR experiments showed that OGD
   caused an similar to 6-fold decrease in K(v)7.2 transcript, while levels
   of mRNAs encoding for other K(v)7 subunits were unaffected; western blot
   experiments showed a parallel reduction in K(v)7.2 protein levels.
   Retigabine also decreased the peak level of dopamine efflux induced by
   L-glutamate, and attenuated the loss of TTC staining induced by the
   excitotoxin. These results suggest a role for K(v)7.2 in modulating
   ischemia-evoked caudate damage.}},

Abstract = {{A novel grading system based on the counting of poorly differentiated
   clusters (PDC) of neoplastic cells at the invasive margin and in the
   tumour stroma was recently introduced among the histological parameters
   predictive of adverse clinical outcome in colorectal cancer (CRC). The
   aim of this study was to correlate the histological grade based on PDC
   and the mutational status of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes in 175
   consecutive CRCs. The highest PDC count under the objective lens of a
   x20 microscopic field in each tumour was considered for grading
   assessment, so that PDC counts <5, 5-9 and >= 10 PDCs were defined grade
   1, grade 2 and grade 3, respectively. Hotspots mutations were identified
   using the MassArray platform. Overall, there were 42 (24\%) mutated
   tumours. Mutational status was significantly associated with high pT
   stage (p = 0.0021), advanced pTNM stage (p = 0.0018), nodal metastases
   (p = 0.006), tumour budding (p = 0.022) and high PDC grade (p = 0.0022).
   KRAS mutations were significantly associated with PDC grade (p =
   0.0379), while BRAF mutations were associated with PDC-G3 although
   statistical significance was not reached. No significant associations
   were found between NRAS and PDC. The significant association between
   mutated KRAS and PDC grade suggests that KRAS mutations may be involved
   in the formation of PDC.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing remains
   controversial, with most guidelines recommending shared decision making.
   This study describes men's PSA screening preferences before and after
   viewing a decision aid and relates these preferences to subsequent
   clinician visit content.
   Methods: Men were recruited from two health systems in 2009-2013.
   Participants answered a questionnaire before and after decision aid
   viewing addressing PSA screening preferences and five basic knowledge
   questions. At one health system, participants also answered a survey
   after a subsequent clinician visit. Data were analyzed in 2014.
   Results: One thousand forty-one predominantly white, well-educated men
   responded to the pre- and post-viewing questionnaire (25\% and 29\%
   response rates at the two sites). After viewing, the proportion of
   patients leaning away from PSA screening increased significantly (p <
   0.001), with 386 (38\%) leaning toward PSA screening versus 436 (43\%)
   before viewing; 174 (17\%) unsure versus 319 (32\%) before; and 448
   (44\%) leaning away versus 253 (25\%) before. Higher knowledge scores
   were associated with being more likely to lean against screening and
   less likely to be unsure (p < 0.001). Among 278 men who also completed a
   questionnaire after a subsequent clinician visit, participants who
   planned to discuss PSA screening with their clinicians were
   significantly more likely to report such discussions than participants
   who did not (148/217 {[}68\%] vs 16/46 {[}35\%], respectively {[}p <
   0.001]).
   Conclusions: A decision aid reduces men's interest in PSA screening,
   particularly among the initially unsure. Men who plan to discuss PSA
   screening with their clinician after a decision aid are more likely to
   do so. (C) 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine}},

Title = {{Inverse-Compton emission from clusters of galaxies: Predictions for
   ASTRO-H}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{582}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The intra-cluster medium of several galaxy clusters hosts large-scale
   regions of diffuse synchrotron radio emission, known as radio halos and
   relics, which demonstrates the presence of magnetic fields and
   relativistic electrons in clusters. These relativistic electrons should
   also emit X-rays through inverse-Compton scattering off of cosmic
   microwave background photons. The detection of such a non-thermal X-ray
   component, together with the radio measurement, would permit the
   magnetic field to be clearly separated from the relativistic electron
   distribution because the inverse-Compton emission is independent of the
   magnetic field in the cluster. However, non-thermal X-rays have not been
   conclusively detected from any cluster of galaxies so far. In this
   paper, for the first time, we model the synchrotron and inverse-Compton
   emission of all clusters hosting radio halos and relics for which the
   spectral index can be determined. We provide constraints on the
   volume-average magnetic field by comparing with current X-ray
   measurements. We then estimate the maximum volume-average magnetic field
   that will allow detection of inverse-Compton hard X-rays by the ASTRO-H
   satellite. We find that several clusters are good targets for ASTRO-H to
   detect their inverse-Compton emission, in particular for what
   corresponds to radio relics, so we propose a list of promising targets
   for which ASTRO-H can test >= 1 mu G magnetic fields. We conclude that
   the already operating NuSTAR and the soon-to-be-launched ASTRO-H
   definitely have the potential of shedding light on the long-sought
   non-thermal hard-X-ray emission in clusters of galaxies.}},

Abstract = {{Marketers in the modern times are increasingly viewing globalization of
   the sports market as a huge opportunity to enter unchartered territories
   by riding on the popularity of a game. The enduring motivation of the
   sports consumers to connect with their favourite sport comes with an
   advantage for marketers who can create stronger product/brand
   associations with the sport. Researches establishing the relationship
   between the sports fanship and related consumption reinforce the belief.
   The present study in an exploratory attempt to understand the impact of
   sports enthusiasm and related consumption in the context of an emerging
   market uses a mixed method approach with qualitative focus group
   discussion and a quantitative analysis of the dataset of 226 actual
   buyers of football ancillary from the National Capital Region of Delhi
   in India. Consequently, a factor analysis of the key motivators for
   football ancillaries buying behaviour identified three drivers; namely,
   social approval, individual passion and utilitarian motivation, for the
   urban Indian sports enthusiasts. Further, segment-wise product decisions
   and purchase decisions were reported along with the relative importance
   of purchasing football ancillaries. The significant influence of
   football connectedness among urban Indian consumers despite cricket
   being the most followed sport added a whole new dimension to the study
   of sports market consumers in the emerging Indian market giving
   directions for future research and marketing practices in the domain.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: A daily Rapid-Access TIA Clinic was introduced in 2008, where
   symptomatic patients were started on 75 mg aspirin + 40 mg simvastatin
   by the referring doctor, before attending the clinic. Following clinic
   assessment, patients with 50-99\% stenoses were transferred to the
   vascular unit for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). In two audits (n = 212
   patients), the median delay from transfer to the vascular unit to
   undergoing CEA was 3 days, during which time 28 patients (13\%) suffered
   recurrent neurological events. It was hypothesized that early
   introduction of dual antiplatelet therapy (by adding clopidogrel 75 mg
   once parenchymal haemorrhage was excluded in the TIA clinic) might
   significantly reduce recurrent events between transfer to the surgical
   unit and undergoing CEA.
   Methods: Prospective audit in 100 consecutive, recently symptomatic
   patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. Endpoints were: prevalence
   of recurrent events between transfer from the TIA clinic and undergoing
   CEA; rates of spontaneous embolization prior to undergoing CEA; and
   prevalence of haemorrhagic complications
   Results: The median delay from symptom to CEA was 8 days (IQR 5-15). The
   median delay between transfer from the TIA clinic to CEA was 3 days (IQR
   2-5), during which time three patients (3\%) suffered recurrent TIAs.
   This represents a fivefold reduction compared with previous audit data
   (OR 4.9, 95\% Cl 1.5-16.6, p = .01) and was matched by a fourfold
   reduction in the prevalence of spontaneous embolization from 39/189
   (21\%) previously to 5/83 (5\%) in the current audit (OR 4.1, 95\% Cl
   1.5-10.7, p = .0047). The 30-day death/stroke rate was 1\%. There were
   three haemorrhagic complications: stroke caused by haemorrhagic
   transformation of an infarct; exploration for neck haematoma; and
   debridement and skin grafting for spontaneous shin haematoma.
   Conclusion: Early introduction of dual antiplatelet therapy was
   associated with a significant reduction in recurrent neurological events
   and spontaneous embolization prior to CEA, without incurring a
   significant increase in major pen-operative bleeding complications. (C)

Abstract = {{Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of
   the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using
   the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting
   functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in
   this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula
   and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from
   which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be
   evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate
   criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization
   functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the
   structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or
   REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents
   such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of
   these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized

Title = {{Impact of dewatering technologies on specific methanogenic activity}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{78-85}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Dewatering methods for recuperative thickening and final dewatering can
   potentially impact methanogenic activity and microbial community. This
   influences both the feasibility of recuperative thickening to increase
   solids residence time within a digester, and the utilisation of
   dewatered digestate as inoculum for new digesters. Thickening technology
   can reduce methanogenic activity through either air contact (rotary
   drum, DAP, or belt filter press), or by lysing cells through shear
   (centrifuge). To assess this, two plants with recuperative thickening
   (rotary drum) in their anaerobic digester, and five without recuperative
   thickening, had specific methanogenic activity tested in all related
   streams, including dewatering feed, thickened return, final cake, and
   centrate. All plants had high speed centrifuges for final dewatering.
   The digester microbial community was also assessed through 16s pyrotag
   sequencing and subsequent principal component analysis (PCA). The
   specific methanogenic activity of all samples was in the expected range
   of 0.2 -0.4 gCOD gVS(-1)d(-1). Plants with recuperative thickening did
   not have lower digester activity. Centrifuge based dewatering had a
   significant and variable impact on methanogenic activity in all samples,
   ranging between 20\% and 90\% decrease but averaging 54\%. Rotary drum
   based recuperative thickening had a far smaller impact on activity, with
   a 0\% per-pass drop in activity in one plant, and a 20\% drop in
   another. However, the presence of recuperative thickening was a major
   predictor of overall microbial community (PC1, p = 0.0024). Microbial
   community PC3 (mainly driven by a shift in methanogens) was a strong
   predictor for sensitivity in activity to shear (p = 0.0005, p = 0.00001
   without outlier). The one outlier was related to a plant producing the
   wettest cake (17\% solids). This indicates that high solids is a
   potential driver of sensitivity to shear, but that a resilient microbial
   community can also bestow resilience. Sensitivity of methanogens to
   centrifuging does not rule out centrifuges for recuperative thickening
   (particularly where hydrolysis is rate-limiting), but may impose a
   maximum return rate to avoid digester failure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of tracking a moving target by means
   of a network of geographically dispersed nodes with Doppler sensing,
   communication, and processing capabilities. The problem is addressed
   both in a hierarchical setting, i.e., in the presence of a fusion center
   that can fuse data from all the local nodes, and in a peer-to-peer
   setting wherein each node (peer) has to locally estimate the target
   kinematic state only on the grounds of local measurements and of data
   received from its neighbors. A suitable nonlinear observability
   decomposition is introduced in order to single out state coordinates
   that can be fully observed from a single Doppler sensor. Based on such a
   decomposition, a novel dual-stage filtering approach to distributed
   Doppler-only tracking is developed. In particular, it is shown how the
   proposed approach can be adopted both in the presence of a fusion center
   by means of covariance intersection and in the peer-to-peer case by
   exploiting consensus algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithms is evaluated via computer simulations.}},
