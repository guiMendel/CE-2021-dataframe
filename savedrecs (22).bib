Abstract = {{Virtually every institution with international development as its focus
   pays tribute to the importance of women in their efforts. Strategy and
   vision statements promote the empowerment of women; education of girls
   is cited as a priority of priorities; and both the vulnerabilities and
   the potential power of the ``girl child{''} are key elements in
   narratives about development. Transformation from traditional to modern
   societies requires new roles for women and girls and equality between
   women and men. Barack Obama noted this trend in his Cairo speech
   addressing majority-Muslim societies in June, 2009: ``I am convinced
   that our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons.
   Our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity-men and
   women-to reach their full potential.{''}(1)}},

Abstract = {{Vegetable oils (Vo) are an alternative to fish oil (Fo) in aquaculture
   feeds. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary soybean oil
   (Vo diet), rich in linoleic acid, and of dietary fish oil (Fo diet) on
   the development of spinal deformities under bacterial lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS)-induced chronic inflammation conditions in Atlantic salmon, Salmo
   salar L. Fish {[}25 g body weight (BW)] were fed the experimental diets
   for 99 days. On day 47 of feeding (40 g BW), fish were subjected to four
   experimental regimes: (i) intramuscular injections with LPS, (ii)
   sham-injected phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), (iii) intraperitoneally
   injected commercial oil adjuvant vaccine, or (iv) no treatment. The fish
   continued under a common feeding regime in sea water for 165 more days.
   Body weight was temporarily higher in the Vo group than in the Fo group
   prior to immunization and was also affected by the type of immunization.
   At the end of the trial, no differences were seen between the dietary
   groups. The overall prevalence of spinal deformities was approximately
   14\% at the end of the experiment. The Vo diet affected vertebral shape
   but did not induce spinal deformities. In groups injected with LPS and
   PBS, spinal deformities ranged between 21\% and 38\%, diet independent.
   Deformed vertebrae were located at or in proximity to the injection
   point. Assessment of inflammatory markers revealed high levels of plasma
   prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) in the Vo-fed and LPS-injected groups,
   suggesting an inflammatory response to LPS. Cyclooxigenase 2 (COX-2)
   mRNA expression in bone was higher in fish fed Fo compared to Vo-fed
   fish. Gene expression of immunoglobulin M (IgM) was up-regulated in bone
   of all LPS-injected groups irrespective of dietary oil. In conclusion,
   the study suggests that Vo is not a risk factor for the development of
   inflammation-related spinal deformities. At the same time, we found
   evidence that localized injection-related processes could trigger the
   development of vertebral body malformations.}},

Abstract = {{Problems from plastic analysis and optimal plastic design are based on
   the convex linear or linearised yield/strength condition and the linear
   equilibrium equation for the stress (state) vector In practice one has
   to take into account stochastic variations of several model parameters
   Hence in order to get robust optimal decisions the structural
   optimisation problem with random parameters must be replaced by an
   appropriate deterministic substitute problem A direct approach is
   proposed based on the primary costs (weight volume costs of construction
   costs for missing carrying capacity etc) and the recourse costs (e g
   costs for repair compensation for weakness within the structure damage
   failure etc) Based on the mechanical survival conditions of plasticity
   theory a quadratic error/loss criterion is developed The minimum
   recourse costs can be determined then by solving an optimisation problem
   having a quadratic objective function and linear constraints For each
   vector a( ) of model parameters and each design vector x one obtains
   then an explicit representation of the best internal load distribution F
   Moreover also the expected recourse costs can be determined explicitly
   Consequently an explicit stochastic non-linear program results for
   finding a robust optimal design x a maximal load factor The analytical
   properties and possible solution procedures are discussed (C) 2008

Abstract = {{An increasing part of funding in research comes from industries. Many
   studies show that the source of funding has a strong impact on the
   results and the presentation of the studies, in all the fields of
   biomedical research. There are multiple, nonexclusive, mechanisms,
   including the questions addressed by the studies, the study quality, and
   publication biases. This first phenomenon is amplified by the impact of
   the funding source on the citation rate, through various citation
   biases. However, the studies do not rule out the veracity of the
   published facts, but highlight the issues of the pertinence of the
   addressed questions, the communication, and the perception of the
   results. Since around 10 years, most of the expertise agencies
   implemented stringent rules for the management of competing interests
   and many proposals have been made for research. A part of the solution
   comes from a better knowledge of this phenomenon and its management at
   all the levels of the development and use of scientific research.}},

Abstract = {{The Ba2TiSi2O8 (BTS) is a well known piezoelectric, ferroelectric and
   non-linear crystal. In this work, nanocrystals of BTS have been obtained
   by different thermal treatments of precursor glasses. The glasses were
   fabricated from BaO-TiO2-SiO2 and doped with Dy2O3 using the melt
   quenching method. Thermal treatment in an electrical furnace at 740
   degrees C was used to obtain transparent glass ceramic samples, which
   are formed by an amorphous matrix containing BTS nanocrystals, with an
   average size of 35 nm confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Moreover, a
   localized area in the precursor glass has been irradiated by continuous
   wave (c.w.) Ar-laser or femtosecond (fs) pulsed laser. Evidence of the
   changes induced by laser irradiation is confirmed by spectroscopic
   comparison of irradiated regions with the precursor glass and glass
   ceramic samples. The emission spectra corresponding to the Dy3+:
   F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) (578 nm), F-4(9/2) -> H-6(1/12) (670 nm) and
   F-4(9/2) -> H-6(9/2) (757 nm) transitions were obtained under laser
   excitation at 473 nm. These measurements confirm the incorporation of
   the Dy3+ ions into the BTS nanocrystals which produces an enhancement of
   luminescence and makes it an attractive material for optical
   amplification. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   xron(l)], where x = 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8, were prepared and studied by
   electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy in frozen
   water-methanol solutions to observe the effects of different copper(II)
   salts and varying neutral ligand concentration on the formation of
   resulting complexes in solution. The trend in g-values (g (||) > g(1) >
   2.0023) indicates that the unpaired electron on the copper ion is
   localized in the d(x2-y2) orbital. The detailed analysis of the
   second-derivative Cu(II) EPR spectra has shown well-resolved N-14
   superhyperfine splitting in the perpendicular part of the axially
   symmetric spectra. The resolution of nitrogen superhyperfine multiplet
   patterns increased with increase in the ronicol concentration
   (ligand-to-metal ratio x). The number of superhyperfine lines was found
   to be constant (nonet) when x > 4 for system I and x >= 4 for system II.
   This fact indicates that for these x-values four equivalent nitrogen
   atoms could be coordinated to the central copper atom in the equatorial
   plane of both systems.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research was to study the motives for sports
   participation, general health status, attitudes to sport, general
   satisfaction with life and self-motivation. Factorial structure of the
   sport participation motives, the differences of the incentive systems
   among the employees and the correlation between the incentive systems
   and other variables were also in the focus of interest. The
   Participation Motivation Questionnaire (PMQ), Satisfaction With Life
   Scale (SWLS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Self-motivation
   Inventory (SMI) and the Questionnaire of Attitudes Towards Sport (SS)
   were used. Employees of the Slovenian army (N=137; 73 soldiers, 36
   non-commissioned officers and 28 officers) collaborated in the research.
   A positive attitude to sport of the army employees was obtained. They
   mainly do sports in order to develop and maintain their physical
   abilities, to remain healthy and in good physical condition. They like
   taking up activities which they are good at. As the least motivating
   factors they indicated the wishes of their parents and close friends,
   who liked to watch their performance, and the desire to be popular. The
   level of self-motivation of the employees in the Slovenian Armed Forces
   was high as well; the highest being among the commissioned officers. The
   study has shown above-average levels of general health status and
   satisfaction with life. The non-commissioned officers expressed the
   highest level of satisfaction with life among the respondents. Factor
   analysis gave 7 incentives. The employees, who valued the motives of a
   group atmosphere and productivity motives, also had a more positive
   attitude to sports. The employees who valued health, competence and
   professional promotion motives, along with the group atmosphere motives,
   were more self- motivated. One discriminant function was obtained by the
   discriminant analysis and was named intrinsic motivation and
   satisfaction with life. The highest level of discrimination of the
   discriminant function occurred between the non-commissioned and
   commissioned officers (expressed as high), on one hand, and soldiers on
   the other (expressed as low).}},

Abstract = {{Phytoplankton dynamics in the lower euphotic zone were observed by
   tracking a subsurface water released at 20-m depth from Takumi, an
   artificial upwelling device. Takumi continually discharged seawater
   pumped up from a depth of 205 m: this water was mixed with 5-m depth
   water to adjust the density to that of 20-m depth water of Sagami Bay,
   Japan. The discharged water was pulse-labeled at Takumi with uranine and
   tracked for 63.9 h with a drifting buoy equipped with a drogue at 20-m
   depth. We present a simple model to estimate in situ phytoplankton net
   growth rates from temporal changes in phytoplankton abundance in the
   discharged water with correction for the influence of water exchange
   between the discharged water and neighboring layers. Lagrangian
   observation showed active growth of pico- and nanophytoplankton,
   especially cryptophytes and Synechococcus (Cyanobacteria), in the
   subsurface layer. In contrast, diatoms grew little in spite of
   micromolar concentrations of nutrients. The active growth of pico- and
   nanophytoplankton was in good agreement with shipboard serial dilution
   culture experiments. The low growth activity of diatoms was suggested to
   be related to low light availability in the subsurface layer.}},

Abstract = {{(A) To examine the impact of serious mental illness on female sexual
   functioning; (B) To determine personal and contextual barriers in sexual
   health of women with DSM-IV Axis-I disorders. A mixed-method study
   explores perceived sexual health in cross-section of 44 consentable
   women with serious mental illnesses (SMI). Subscales of sexual activity
   are used as measurable outcomes. History of sexual abuse (59\%),
   long-term sex abstinence (72.7\%), client-provider poor communications
   (86.3\%), and lack of awareness (79.6\%) are related to suboptimal
   sexual health of women with SMI. Satisfaction and pleasure from sexual
   experience are predominantly affected symptoms that confer higher means
   of psychotropic medications (4.8 +/- 6.3), length of treatment (10.8 +/-
   9.1) and are partially mediated by the body-mass index, impaired
   interpersonal skills, and emotional lability. The defined barriers in
   sexual health inform that the needs of women with SMI in terms of sexual
   expression and intimacy are in practice ignored or poorly seen as
   problems. Taking a sexual history should be an integral part of
   psychiatric assessment.}},

Abstract = {{With all the results now obtained by global helioseismology, it is clear
   that we have to go beyond the classical spherical modelling of the Sun.
   In this way, it is now necessary to draw a picture that takes into
   account internal dynamical processes such as rotation, magnetic field,
   and waves from the core to the surface. This is a challenging task since
   such mechanisms involve length and time-scales that differ from several
   orders of magnitude and impact on the solar behaviour both on dynamical
   and secular times. In this review, I will thus describe the present
   state of the art in the modelling of the internal dynamics of the Sun.

Abstract = {{Controlled sex-, stage- and tissue-specific expression of antipathogen
   effector molecules is important for genetic engineering strategies to
   control mosquito-borne diseases. Adult female salivary glands are
   involved in pathogen transmission to human hosts and are target sites

   a and 30K b genes are expressed exclusively in adult female salivary
   glands and are transcribed divergently from start sites separated by 263
   nucleotides. The intergenic, 5'- and 3'-end untranslated regions of both
   genes are sufficient to express simultaneously two different transgene
   products in the distal-lateral lobes of the female salivary glands. An
   antidengue effector gene, membranes no protein (Mnp), driven by the 30K
   b promoter, expresses an inverted-repeat RNA with sequences derived from
   the premembrane protein-encoding region of the dengue virus serotype 2
   genome and reduces significantly the prevalence and mean intensities of

Abstract = {{Gas in an infected organ generally indicates a severe infection, often
   requiring surgery; however, data are lacking as to post-cesarean
   gas-forming uterine infection. A 27-year-old Japanese primigravida
   underwent a difficult cesarean section, after which a high fever
   continued. Computed tomography (CT) revealed marked gas in the uterine
   anterior myometrium. Diagnosing this condition as post-cesarean uterine
   scar infection, we recommended surgical intervention, that is,
   hysterectomy or at least drainage; however, the patient refused it.
   Considering the patient's desire and lack of organ-failure signs, we
   employed intensive antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks. Serial CT indicated
   a gradual decrement in the gas amount and she recovered completely after
   8 weeks. This case suggests that surgical procedure may not always be
   necessary for post-cesarean gas-forming uterine infection and CT may be

Abstract = {{The construction of synthetic biological systems involving millions of
   nucleotides is limited by the lack of high-quality synthetic DNA.
   Consequently, the field requires advances in the accuracy and scale of
   chemical DNA synthesis and in the processing of longer DNA assembled
   from short fragments. Here we describe a highly parallel and
   miniaturized method, called megacloning, for obtaining high-quality DNA
   by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology as a preparative
   tool. We demonstrate our method by processing both chemically
   synthesized and microarray-derived DNA oligonucleotides with a robotic
   system for imaging and picking beads directly off of a high-throughput
   pyrosequencing platform. The method can reduce error rates by a factor
   of 500 compared to the starting oligonucleotide pool generated by
   microarray. We use DNA obtained by megacloning to assemble synthetic
   genes. In principle, millions of DNA fragments can be sequenced,
   characterized and sorted in a single megacloner run, enabling
   constructive biology up to the megabase scale.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study reports on effectiveness trial outcomes of Health
   in Motion a computer tailored multiple behavior intervention for
   adolescents
   Methods Using school as level of assignment students (n = 1800) from
   eight high schools in four states (RI TN MA and NY) were stratified and
   randomly assigned to no treatment or a multi-media intervention for
   physical activity fruit and vegetable consumption and limited TV viewing
   between 2006 and 2007
   Results Intervention effects on continuous outcomes on movement to
   action and maintenance stages and on stability within action and
   maintenance stages were evaluated using random effects modeling Effects
   were most pronounced for fruit and vegetable consumption and for total
   risks across all time points and for each behavior immediately post
   intervention Co-variation of behavior change occurred within the
   treatment group where individuals progressing to action or maintenance
   for one behavior were 1 4-42 times more likely to make similar progress
   on another behavior
   Conclusion Health in Motion is an innovative multiple behavior obesity
   prevention intervention relevant for all adolescents that relies solely
   on interactive technology to deliver tailored feedback The outcomes of
   the effectiveness Mal demonstrate both an ability to initiate behavior
   change across multiple energy balance behaviors simultaneously and

Abstract = {{Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are the etiological agents responsible for
   botulism, a disease characterized by peripheral neuromuscular blockade
   and a characteristic flaccid paralysis of human. BoNT/A is the most
   toxic protein known to man and has been classified by the Centers of
   Disease Control (CDC) as one of the six highest-risk threat agents for
   bioterrorism. Of particular concern is the apparent lack of clinical
   interventions that can reverse cellular intoxication. Efforts to uncover
   molecules that can act within an intoxicated cell so as to provide
   symptomatic relief to BoNT/A are paramount. Aminopyridines have shown
   clinical efficacy for multiple sclerosis treatment as well as BoNT/A
   intoxication; yet, aminopyridines for BoNT/A treatment has been
   abandoned because of blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration producing
   undesired neurotoxic side effects. Two aminopyridines (5 and 11)
   exhibited inhibitory activity toward Shaker-IR voltage-gated potassium
   (K(V)1.x) channels with potencles similar to that of the previous
   ``gold-standard{''}, 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), including reversal
   of symptoms from BoNT-induced paralysis in phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm
   preparations. Importantly, pharmacokinetic experiments revealed a lack
   of BBB penetration of 5, which is a significant advancement toward
   resolving the neurotoxiciy issues associated with prolonged 3,4-DAP
   treatments. Finally, 5 was found to be as effective as 3,4-DAP in
   rescuing. BoNT-poisoned mice in the mouse lethality assay, signifying an
   optimized balance between the undesired permeability across the BBB and
   the required permeability across lipid cellular membranes. The results
   demonstrate that 5 is the most promising small molecule. K+ channel

Title = {{Effects of Fisheries Closures and Gear Restrictions on Fishing Income in
   a Kenyan Coral Reef}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The adoption of fisheries closures and gear restrictions in the
   conservation of coral reefs may be limited by poor understanding of the
   economic profitability of competing economic uses of marine resources.
   Over the past 12 years, I evaluated the effects of gear regulation and
   fisheries closures on per person and per area incomes from fishing in
   coral reefs of Kenya. In two of my study areas, the use of small-meshed
   beach seines was stopped after 6 years; one of these areas was next to a
   fishery closure. In my third study area, fishing was unregulated.
   Fishing yields on per capita daily wet weight basis were 20\% higher
   after seine-net fishing was stopped. The per person daily fishing income
   adjacent to the closed areas was 14 and 22\% higher than the fishing
   income at areas with only gear restrictions before and after the
   seine-net restriction, respectively. Incomes differed because larger
   fish were captured next to the closed area and the price per weight
   (kilograms) increased as fish size increased and because catches
   adjacent to the closure contained fish species of higher market value.
   Per capita incomes were 41 and 135\% higher for those who fished in
   gear-restricted areas and near-closed areas, respectively, compared with
   those who fished areas with no restrictions. On a per unit area basis
   (square kilometers), differences in fishing income among the three areas
   were not large because fishing effort increased as the number of
   restrictions decreased. Changes in catch were, however, larger and often
   in the opposite direction expected from changes in effort alone. For
   example, effort declined 21\% but nominal profits per square kilometer
   (not accounting for inflation) increased 29\% near the area with gear
   restrictions. Gear restrictions also reduced the cost of fishing and
   increased the proportion of self-employed fishers.}},

Journal = {{ICARUS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{210}},

Abstract = {{We present measurements of the altitude and eastward velocity component
   of mesospheric clouds in 35 imaging sequences acquired by the Mars
   Odyssey (ODY) spacecraft's Thermal Emission Imaging System visible
   imaging subsystem (THEMIS-VIS). We measure altitude by using the
   parallax drift of high-altitude features, and the velocity by exploiting
   the time delay in the THEMIS-VIS imaging sequence.
   We observe two distinct classes of mesospheric clouds: equatorial
   mesospheric clouds observed between 0 degrees and 180 degrees L-s: and
   northern mid-latitude clouds observed only in twilight in the 200-300
   degrees L-s period. The equatorial mesospheric clouds are quite rare in
   the THEMIS-VIS data set. We have detected them in only five imaging
   sequences, out of a total of 2048 multi-band equatorial imaging
   sequences. All five fall between 20 degrees south and 0 degrees
   latitude, and between 260 degrees and 295 degrees east longitude. The
   mid-latitude mesospheric clouds are apparently much more common; for
   these we find 30 examples out of 210 northern winter mid-latitude
   twilight imaging sequences. The observed mid-latitude clouds are found,
   with only one exception, in the Acidalia region, but this is quite
   likely an artifact of the pattern of THEMIS-VIS image targeting.
   Comparing our THEMIS-VIS images with daily global maps generated from
   Mars Orbiter Camera Wide Angle (MOC-WA) images, we find some evidence
   that some mid-latitude mesospheric cloud features correspond to cloud
   features commonly observed by MOC-WA. Comparing the velocity of our
   mesospheric clouds with a GCM, we find good agreement for the northern
   mid-latitude class, but also find that the GCM fails to match the strong
   easterly winds measured for the equatorial clouds.
   Applying a simple radiative transfer model to some of the equatorial
   mesospheric clouds, we find good model fits in two different imaging
   sequences. By using the observed radiance contrast between cloud and
   cloud-free regions at multiple visible-band wavelengths, these fits
   simultaneously constrain the optical depths and particles sizes of the
   clouds. The particle sizes are constrained primarily by the relative
   contrasts at the available wavelengths, and are found to be quite
   different in the two imaging sequences: r(eff) = 0.1 mu m and r(eff) =
   1.5 mu m. The optical depths (constrained by the absolute contrasts) are
   substantial: 0.22 and 0.5, respectively. These optical depths imply a
   mass density that greatly exceeds the saturated mass density of water
   vapor at mesospheric temperatures, and so the aerosol particles are
   probably composed mainly of CO2 ice. Our simple radiative transfer model
   is not applicable to twilight, when the mid-latitude mesospheric clouds
   were observed, and so we leave the properties of these clouds as a
   question for further work. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When healthcare resources become overwhelmed in medical disasters, as

   This article provides an ethical framework for the responsible
   management of medical disasters in which the ``What then?{''} question
   must be asked. The framework begins with a critique of existing guidance
   from professional associations of physicians and then argues for an
   alternative approach that qualifies the obligation to preserve life,
   takes seriously the ethical challenges of overwhelmed healthcare
   resources, and countenances physician-assisted suicide as a last resort.}},

Abstract = {{I argue that the strongest form of consequentialism is one which rejects
   the claim that we are morally obliged to bring about the best available
   consequences, but which continues to assert that what there is most
   reason to do is bring about the best available consequences. Such an
   approach promises to avoid common objections to consequentialism, such
   as demandingness objections. Nevertheless, the onus is on the defender
   of this approach either to offer her own account of what moral
   obligations we do face, or to explain why offering such a theory is
   ill-advised. I consider, and reject, one attempt at the second sort of
   strategy, put forward by Alastair Norcross, who defends a `scalar'
   consequentialism which eschews the moral concepts of right, wrong and
   obligation, and limits itself to claims about what is better and worse.
   I go on to raise some considerations which suggest that no systematic
   consequentialist theory of our moral obligations will be plausible, and
   propose instead that consequentialism should have a more informal and
   indirect role in shaping what we take our moral obligations to be.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of computer speech recognition as an objective measure
   of intelligibility was explored. A commercially available program was
   assessed following the manufacturer's protocol to analyze speech samples
   from three speakers without neurogenic speech disorders, one speaker
   with moderate spastic dysarthria, and a synthesized speech sample. The
   system identified the synthesized speech most accurately, and the speech
   of the speaker with dysarthria least accurately. To improve clinical
   relevance, a variation of the recommended protocol was performed. The
   first author provided a referent speech sample, and typically used
   intelligibility tests produced by three speakers with dysarthria were
   assessed. These results were compared with intelligibility judgments
   from a large number of everyday listeners. Compared to the everyday
   listener results, the software judged all samples much less accurately.
   Single word intelligibility was particularly disparate because of the
   prediction model used by the recognition system. In addition,
   replicability was poorer than expected, again, due to the prediction
   model. Further work, modifying the software's referent sample as well as
   assessing other recognition programs, is proposed. These programs have
   the potential for providing reliable pre-post therapy analysis and a
   stable point of comparison across clinicians and settings.}},

Abstract = {{Participation in family meals has been associated with benefits for
   health and social development of children. The objective of the study
   was to identify the impact of mothers' work of caring through planning
   regularly scheduled meals, shopping and cooking, on children's
   participation in family meals. Parents of children aged 9-11 or 13-15
   years from 300 Houston families were surveyed about parents' work, meal
   planning for and scheduling of meals, motivations for food purchases,
   importance of family meals, and children's frequency of eating dinner
   with their families. The children were interviewed about the importance
   of eating family meals. Hypotheses were tested using path analysis to
   calculate indirect and total effects of variables on the outcome
   variable of frequency of children eating dinner with their family.
   Mothers' belief in the importance of family meals increased likelihood
   of children eating dinner with families by increasing likelihood that
   mothers planned dinner and that dinners were regularly scheduled.
   Mothers' perception of time pressures on meal preparation had a
   negative, indirect effect on the frequency of children's participation
   in family dinners by reducing mothers' meal planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: Primary care may be an effective venue for delivering
   behavioral interventions for sexual safety among HIV-positive men who
   have sex with men (MSM); however, few studies show efficacy for such an
   approach. We tested the efficacy of the Treatment Advocacy Program
   (TAP), a 4-session, primary-care-based, individual counseling
   intervention led by HIV-positive MSM ``peer advocates{''} in reducing
   unprotected sex with HIV-negative or unknown partners (HIV transmission
   risk). Method: We randomized 313 HIV-positive MSM to TAP or standard
   care. HIV transmission risk was assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12
   months (251 participants completed all study waves). We conducted
   intent-to-treat analyses using general estimating equations to test the
   interaction of group (TAP vs. standard care) by follow-up period.
   Results: At study completion, TAP participants reported greater
   transmission risk reduction than did those receiving standard care,
   chi(2)(2, N = 249) = 6.6, p = .04. Transmission risk among TAP
   participants decreased from 34\% at baseline to about 20\% at both 6 and
   12 months: Transmission risk ranged from 23\% to 25\% among comparison
   participants. Conclusions: TAP reduced transmission risk among
   HIV-positive MSM, although results are modest. Many participants and
   peer advocates commented favorably on the computer structure of the
   program. We feel that the key elements of TAP-computer-based and
   individually tailored session content, delivered by peers, in the
   primary care setting-warrant further exploration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares two of the leading techniques for session
   variability compensation in the context of support vector machine (SVM)
   speaker verification using Gaussian mixture model (GMM) mean
   supervectors: joint factor analysis (JFA) modeling and nuisance
   attribute projection (NAP). Motivation for this comparison comes from
   the distinctly different domains in which these techniques are
   employed-the probabilistic GMM domain versus the discriminative SVM
   kernel. A theoretical analysis is given comparing the JFA and NAP
   approaches to variability compensation. The role of speaker factors in
   the factor analysis model is also contrasted against the scatter
   difference NAP objective of retaining speaker information in the SVM
   kernel space. These methods for retaining speaker variation are found to
   provide improved verification performance over the removal of channel
   effects alone. Overall, experimental results on the NIST 2006 and 2008
   SRE corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of both JFA and NAP techniques
   for reducing the effects of variability. However, the overheads
   associated with the implementation of JFA may make NAP a more attractive
   technique due to its simple yet effective approach to variability
   compensation.}},

Abstract = {{The neural and psychological mechanisms underlying vulnerability to drug
   addiction are poorly understood. Although a number of animal models have
   been developed to investigate vulnerability to stimulant addiction, few
   have considered how vulnerability traits such as impulsivity predict
   hallmark features of heroin addiction including the escalation of drug
   intake and increased propensity for relapse following protracted
   abstinence.
   The aim of this study was to investigate whether high impulsivity in
   rats predicts the propensity to escalate intravenous heroin
   self-administration and to relapse following an extended withdrawal
   period from heroin.
   High (HI)- and low (LI)-impulsive rats, defined by the extent of
   premature responding on the 5-choice serial reaction time test
   (5-CSRTT), were catheterized and allowed to self-administer heroin (40
   mu g/100 mu l/infusion). After 5 days of short access (1 h/day) to
   heroin, rats were then given extended (6 h/day) access to heroin for 18
   consecutive days.
   High impulsivity predicted neither a greater tendency to acquire heroin
   SA nor an increased escalation of heroin self-administration. Moreover,
   high impulsivity was not associated with an increased propensity to
   relapse after protracted withdrawal from heroin. Nevertheless, marked
   inter-individual differences in the escalation of heroin
   self-administration were observed.
   Although high impulsivity on the 5-CSRTT has been shown to predict loss
   of control over cocaine intake, this does not generalize to a loss of
   control over heroin self-administration. These findings suggest
   important distinctions in vulnerability mechanisms underlying cocaine
   and heroin addiction with trait-like impulsivity playing a role in
   stimulant but not opiate addiction.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Few descriptive epidemiologic studies of injury in soccer
   are of community-level players. Although many sports injury surveillance
   systems have been described in the scientific literature, only 1 has
   been implemented in community-level soccer and that was restricted to
   adolescent players in a single club.
   Purpose: The objective of this study was to develop a method for
   undertaking routine surveillance of injury in community-level soccer.
   Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
   Methods: A cohort of 880 community-level players aged 13 years and over
   was followed over 1 winter competitive season. Each week, each player
   was contacted by telephone and an interview conducted to collect data on
   participation in matches and training sessions, injuries, and adherence
   to injury prevention measures.
   Results: Seventy-five percent (n = 510) of the cohort was male and the
   median age was 16 years. Data were collected on 11 268 player-matches
   totaling 13 483 player-match hours and 11 540 player-training sessions
   totaling 16 031 player-training hours. A total of 677 match injury
   events were reported, giving overall incidence rates of 50.2 injury
   events per 1000 player-match hours and 6.0 injury events per 100
   player-matches. The incidence rate for match injury events was
   significantly higher for females than for males (63.9 vs 46.9). A total
   of 145 training injury events were reported, giving overall incidence
   rates of 9.0 injury events per 1000 player-training hours and 1.3 injury
   events per 100 player-training sessions. The most common injuries were
   sprains and strains of the lower limb, and tackling was the most common
   cause of injury.
   Conclusion: This study has shown that routine injury surveillance, using
   a cohort design with exposure measurement, can be successfully
   implemented in community-level soccer.}},

   to persevere or gain wider implementation. The history of efforts to
   categorize hospital (and ED) emergency services demonstrates recognition
   of the potential benefits of categorization, but reflects repeated
   failures to implement full categorization systems or limited excursions
   into categorization through licensing of EDs or designation of receiving

   ED categorization could better inform current efforts to develop
   categorization schemes and processes.

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess whether Swiss residents aged 15-24 years follow
   current nutritional guidelines and whether differences exist according
   to gender and weight status.
   Design: Cross-sectional national survey.
   Setting: Switzerland.
   Subjects: The 1786 participants (48.4\% women) were divided into
   overweight, normal weight and underweight. We used traditional BMI
   cut-offs for people >= 18 years of age (underweight = BMI < 18.5kg/m(2),
   normal weight = BMI >= 18.5kg/m(2) and < 25 kg/m(2), overweight = BMI >=
   25 kg/m(2)) and age-and gender-appropriate tables for people aged < 18
   years, with BMI calculated from self-reported weight and height. We
   performed bivariate analyses by gender, and then bivariate and
   multivariate analyses comparing overweight to normal weight people
   (excluding underweight, n 129, 71.6\% women) regarding adherence to
   recommendations for fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and dairy products;
   physical activity; attitude towards body weight; depression, smoking and
   alcohol consumption.
   Results: Overall, adherence to nutritional guidelines was low,
   particularly for vegetables and dairy products. Women had a higher
   adherence than men except for fish and dairy products. In the
   multivariate analyses, overweight women had a lower vegetable intake,
   were less satisfied with body weight and had more often been on a diet,
   whereas overweight men were less satisfied with body weight and wanted
   to lose weight more often than their normal weight peers. There were no
   significant differences for physical activity.
   Conclusions: Overweight prevention programmes should target youth
   specifically by gender and promote an appropriate self-perception.
   Overweight women should be encouraged to eat more vegetables and men to
   be more sensitised on healthy food. Further research is needed to assess
   how to make nutritional guidelines more adaptable to young people's
   daily life.}},

Abstract = {{The present study compared losses of weight and length in specimens of
   Atherinella brasiliensis (Quoy \& Gaimard, 1825) after fixation in
   formalin 10\% during ten days, and posterior preservation in ethanol
   70\% for 45 days, in two solvents: freshwater and marine water.
   Additionally, correction factors were proposed to calculate the
   correction for weight and length from preserved specimens. The specimens
   were weighted and measured after collection (fresh), and with 10, 20,
   27, 34, 41 and 55 days of fixation plus preservation. The largest losses
   in weight occurred during the first 20 days (10.35 +/- 0.31\%
   freshwater; 11.29 +/- 0.44\% marine water), continuing with lesser
   intensity up to the 27(th) day in freshwater dilution, and up to the
   34(th) day in marine water dilution. Weight losses stabilized by the
   34(th) day for both freshwater (11.77 +/- 0.33\%) and marine water
   (13.62 +/- 0.41\%). The largest losses in the total length for the two
   methods were also observed in the first 20 days (7.42 +/- 0.27\%
   freshwater; 9.76 +/- 0.26 - marine water), stabilizing after the 27(th)
   day in freshwater (8.60 +/- 0.26\%) and 20(th) day in marine water (9.76
   0.26\%). The losses of weight and total length were significantly
   dependent on fish size, with smaller individuals suffering the most
   significant losses. Complete regression equations were proposed for the
   retro-calculation of fresh weight and total length from the preserved
   specimens for freshwater (W-fresh = 1.0536W(p) + 0.0416; TLfresh =
   0.9588TL(p) + 5.8437) and marine water (W-fresh = 1.0868W(p) + 0.0451;

Abstract = {{Th17 cells promote a variety of autoimmune diseases, including
   psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory
   bowel disease. TGF-beta is required for conversion of naive T cells to
   Th17 cells, but the mechanisms regulating this process are unknown.
   Integrin alpha v beta 8 on DCs can activate TGF-beta, and this process
   contributes to the development of induced Tregs. Here, we have now shown
   that integrin alpha v beta 8 expression on DCs plays a critical role in
   the differentiation of Th17 cells. Th17 cells were nearly absent in the
   colons of mice lacking alpha v beta 8 expression on DCs. In addition,
   these mice and the DCs harvested from them had an impaired ability to
   convert naive T cells into Th17 cells in vivo and in vitro,
   respectively. Importantly, mice lacking alpha v beta 8 on DCs showed
   near-complete protection from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
   Our results therefore suggest that the integrin alpha v beta 8 pathway
   is biologically important and that alpha v beta 8 expression on DCs
   could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of Th17-driven
   autoimmune disease.}},

Abstract = {{The pregnane-X-receptor ( PXR) is master gene overseeing detoxification
   of wide number of xenobiotics anti is critical for maintenance of
   intestinal integrity The intestinal expression of genes Involved in
   cellular detoxification is clown-regulated in patients with inflammatory
   bowel diseases (IBD) Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic endowed
   with a PXR agonistic activity In the present study we have investigated
   whether rifaximin activates PXR in primary human colon epithelial cells
   and human colon biopsies and assessed whether this antibiotic
   antagonizes the effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha on
   expression of PXR and PXR-related genes Present results demonstrate that
   primary colon epithelial cells express PXR and that their exposure to
   rifaximin induces the expression of genes involved in cellular
   detoxification Exposure to TNF alpha reduces the expression of PXR mRNA
   as well as expression of its target genes This inhibitory effect was
   prevented by that co-treatment with rifaximin. Knocking down the
   expression of PXR in colon epithelial cells by an anti-PXR si RNA,
   abrogated the counter-regulatory effects exerted by rifaximin on cell
   exposed to TNF alpha Finally, ex vivo exposure of colon biopsies
   obtained from ulcerative colitis patients to rifaximin increased the
   expression of genes involved in xenobiotics metabolism In aggregate,
   these data illustrate that rifaximin increases the expression of PXR and
   PXR-regulated genes Involved in the metabolism and excretion of
   xenobiotics and antagonizes the effects of TNF alpha in intestinal
   epithelial cells and colon biopsies These non-antibiotic effects of
   rifaximin could contribute to the maintenance of the intestinal barrier
   integrity against xenobiotics and products generated by luminal bacteria

   incidence, and corruption rents. We present a theoretical model of
   bribery and investment in which these measures of corruption are defined
   and compared. We then study the changes that arise when key parameters
   of the model change and show that, under identical circumstances, the
   behavior of any particular corruption measure can differ completely from
   the behavior of the other measures. Furthermore, in our model high and
   low corruption lead to two types of equilibria. We show that the
   behavior of all three measures can vary substantially when the type of

Abstract = {{Purpose To investigate the observed high prevalence of spontaneous

   Patients and methods A cross sectional survey of the occurrence of SCH
   was carried out in 248 patients using steroid eye drops and in a
   comparison group of 113 patients using topical glaucoma medication.
   Results Twenty-four patients with uveitis (10\% of total) experienced
   single or recurrent SCH. Of these 71\% used prednisolone acetate 1\%
   (compared with 75\% for those unaffected). None of 113 glaucoma patients
   were affected.
   Conclusions The long-term use of topical steroid for chronic uveitis
   substantially increases the prevalence of spontaneous or minimal-trauma
   SCH. Steroid-induced vascular fragility is the likely cause. Eye (2010)

Abstract = {{Rationale: This phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum
   tolerated dose (MTD) of erlotinib, an oral epidermal growth factor
   receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with
   5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) in patients with
   advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Bevacizumab was later included as
   standard of care at the MTD. Patients and Methods: Patients received
   FOLFOX4 with escalating doses of erlotinib: dose level (DL) 1, 50 mg; DL
   2, 100 mg; and DL 3, 150 mg once daily continuously. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg
   days 1 and 15 was added at the MTD upon Food and Drug Administration
   approval. Correlative studies included pharmacokinetics,
   pharmacodynamics was assessed in paired skin biopsies, and
   fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans. Results: Fifteen
   patients received 60 cycles (120 FOLFOX treatments). Two dose-limiting
   toxicities (DLTs) were seen at DL 3: intolerable grade 2 rash (Common
   Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 2) lasting > 1 week, and
   grade 4 neutropenia. Dose level 2 was expanded to 6 more patients, this
   time adding bevacizumab, and 1 DLT of grade 3 mucositis occurred. As
   expected, the primary toxicities were cytopenias, diarrhea, rash, and
   fatigue. There were 2 occurrences of pneumatosis. One patient
   experienced an unrelated grade 4 myocardial infarction before starting
   chemotherapy. No pharmacokinetic drug interactions were observed. The
   Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response rate was 11 of 14
   (78\%), median progression-free survival was 9.5 months, and median
   overall survival was 30 months. Three patients are currently alive > 3
   years, with 1 having no evidence of disease. Conclusion: The MTD of
   erlotinib with FOLFOX4 with or without bevacizumab is 100 mg daily. The
   regimen appeared to increase toxicity but showed activity in patients
   with CRC.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This paper is a report of a study of the effects of
   breastfeeding education on the breastfeeding success and breastfeeding
   characteristics of mothers in a Turkish context.
   Methods The research was' designed as quasi-experimental. The sample
   consisted of 93 mothers who participated in (n=46) and did not
   participate in childbirth education classes (n=47). The date was
   collected between 2005 and 2007. The childbirth education class
   comprised 16 hours in total. Two hours of this class involved
   breastfeeding education. The course was carried out with the principles
   of adult education principles. Data on mothers' breastfeeding were
   collected in the sixth week postpartum.
   Results The majority of the mothers (63.4\%) were university graduates.
   No difference was found between breastfeeding frequency in the control
   and experimental groups and starting supplemental food. It was found
   that 80.4\% of the women in the experimental group breastfed in line
   with the techniques. This rate was found to be 48.9\% in the control
   group. It was documented that the first breastfeeding times were earlier
   in the experimental group, their babies slept longer after being fed,
   their perceived spouse support was higher, and had even higher perceived
   breastfeeding success.
   Conclusions On the basis of the study results it could be argued that
   attending childbirth preparation class with the husband has a positive
   effect over breastfeeding. Childbirth education classes will greatly
   contribute to the health of the society by affecting breastfeeding
   positively. {[}Asian Nursing Research 2010;4(4):216-226]}},

Abstract = {{In a prior issue of Developing World Bioethics, Cheryl Macpherson and
   Ruth Macklin critically engaged with an article of mine, where I
   articulated a moral theory grounded on indigenous values salient in the
   sub-Saharan region, and then applied it to four major issues in
   bioethics, comparing and contrasting its implications with those of the
   dominant Western moral theories, utilitarianism and Kantianism. In
   response to my essay, Macpherson and Macklin have posed questions about:
   whether philosophical justifications are something with which
   bioethicists ought to be concerned; why something counts as `African';
   how medicine is a moral enterprise; whether an individual right to
   informed consent is consistent with sub-Saharan values; and when thought
   experiments help to establish firm conclusions about moral status. These
   are important issues for the field, and I use this reply to take
   discussion of them a step or two farther, defending my initial article
   from Macpherson's and Macklin's critical questions and objections.}},

Abstract = {{Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and Src have been reported to regulate tumor
   growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. The present study aimed
   to evaluate by immunohistochemistry the clinical significance of FAK and
   Src expression in 108 patients with benign and malignant thyroid
   lesions. Total FAK expression provided a distinct discrimination between
   malignant and benign (p= 0.00001), as well as between papillary
   carcinoma and hyperplastic nodules thyroid lesions (p=0.00005), being
   also associated with follicular cells' proliferative capacity
   (p=0.0003). In malignant thyroid lesions, total FAK expression was
   associated with tumor size (p=0.0455), and presence of capsular
   (p=0.0102) and lymphatic (p= 0.0173) invasion. Total Src expression was
   borderline increased in cases of papillary carcinoma compared to
   hyperplastic nodules (p=0.0993), being also correlated with tumor size
   (p=0.0169). FAK and Src expression was ascribed to a significant extent
   to the phosphorylated forms of the enzymes, which provided a better
   discrimination between malignant and benign thyroid lesions. The current
   data revealed that FAK and to a lesser extent Src expression could be
   considered of clinical utility in thyroid neoplasia with potential use
   as therapeutic targets.}},

Abstract = {{The shrublands of the Convolvuletalia boissieri order have been known

   of Sierra Nevada (south of Spain). Despite their enormous floristic and
   ecological originality, the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC does not
   mention them as priority habitats. This omission is striking given the
   particular attention paid by this Directive to other habitats which,
   like this one, are associated with special substrates. The shrublands of
   the Gypsophiletalia order, i.e. habitat 1520 of the above mentioned
   Directive corresponding to gypsophilous vegetation, are a particular
   case in the Iberian Peninsula. The extensive study of both habitats and
   their flora over recent years has provided a magnificent opportunity for
   us to compare them, review their current state of preservation and
   demand that more serious attention be paid to dolomites.}},

Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{1-3}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alteration of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) may contribute to the pathophysiology of
   alcoholism and major depressive disorder (MDD). Among glial cells,
   astrocytes are mostly responsible for recycling synaptic glutamate by
   uptake through excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2 (EAAT1 and
   EAAT2), and conversion to glutamine with glutamine synthetase (GS). Low
   density of astrocytes in the PFC of ``uncomplicated' alcoholics and MOD
   subjects may parallel altered glutamate transporters and GS in the PFC.
   Methods: Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting for glutamate
   transporters, GS and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were applied
   to postmortem tissue of the left orbitofrontal cortex from 13 subjects
   with MOD, 13 with alcoholism, 10 with comorbid alcoholism plus MDD
   (MDA), and 13 non-psychiatric controls. Area fraction of
   immunoreactivity was measured in sections, and protein levels in Western
   blots.
   Results: EAAT2 immunoreactivity was significantly lower in MOD and MDA
   subjects than in controls. EAAT1 levels were lower in MDA and MDD
   subjects as compared to controls, while GS levels in MDA were
   significantly lower than in alcoholics and controls, and lower in MDD
   subjects than in alcoholics. Area fraction of GFAP was lower in MDD, but
   not in MDA subjects as compared to controls or alcoholics.
   Limitations: High variability of protein levels in some groups and
   effects of antidepressant treatment, although appearing to be limited,
   cannot be fully evaluated.
   Conclusions: There are differential changes in the expression of glial
   glutamatergic markers in depression and alcoholism, suggesting a
   depletion of certain aspects of glutamatergic processing in depression.

Abstract = {{Games together with manga and anime as represented by Japanese
   technological advances are highly evaluated in other countries. In
   recent years, games have been developing at a fast rate and a deep
   understanding of the game development procedures is needed in order to
   keep up with the advancements in technology. Yet, there has been no
   consistent education program designed specifically for game production
   in the Japanese higher education institutions. In contrast to this, game
   education is on the rise among American and European Universities. A
   curriculum framework has even been created by the International Game
   Developers Association (IGDA) with positive progress shown by
   cooperating with the industry.
   As very few efforts have been made so far in Japan to develop an
   education program for game development, there was no common ground where
   production methodology could be designed and taught. Due to this the
   industry developed its own unique production styles, and production
   methods became a trade secret, complicating the relationship between the
   universities and the industry. Current game development education in
   Japan consists mostly of lectures conducted by part-time teaching staff
   hired by several colleges.
   In response to this, at the Tokyo University of Technology (TUT), we
   have designed a curriculum in collaboration with Premium Agency, Inc.
   that aims to offer training in the practical aptitudes that are demanded
   by the game development industry. We have added lessons to the
   traditional faculty curriculum, combining lectures and exercises in a
   game development context, leading to the number of students that are
   acquiring knowledge in game development skills such as programming, CG
   and planning to grow year by year. As a result, the development of this
   game oriented curriculum has been strongly welcomed by the game
   industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   The procedure performed was cross-linking treatment with corneal
   deepithelization 8 mm in diameter, application of riboflavin and UVA
   irradiation 3mW/cm(2). Before and after treatment besides a complete
   ophthalmologic examination with uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and
   best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) also listed examinations were
   performed: corneal computerized topographic examination, pentacam
   examination where we measured corneal thickness and intraocular pressure
   (IOP) evaluation. Parameters analyzed were: UCVA, BCVA, corneal
   thickness, average keratometry readings, spherical equivalent (SE) and
   amount of astigmatism.
   Results: In statistical analysis we proved that in the three parameters
   analyzed there was statistical significant difference as before
   treatment: uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity and
   corneal thickness. In other paramethers analyzed - mean keratometry
   readings, spherical equivalent and amount of astigmatism there was no
   statistical significant difference in comparison before and after
   treatment. With the method of linear regression we proved that on the
   best corrected visual acuity after the treatment the most influence was
   in best corrected visual acuity before treatment and the degree of
   keratoconus, other parameters before treatment haven't influenced so
   much on the postoperative best corrected visual acuity
   Conclusions: In keratoconus eyes treated with corneal collagen
   cross-linking results indicate stabilization and improvement. Thus,
   collagen cross-linking is an effective therapeutically option for
   progressive keratoconus. This is an ongoing research and longer follow
   up with higher number of cases are necessary to confirm a definite
   conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Geospatial video, also known as mobile mapping or spatial video, is an
   emerging technology that combines Global Positioning Systems (GPS) with
   video. This approach enables increased efficiency in field data
   collection, as well as the ability to survey locations over multiple
   time periods in order to analyze spatiotemporal phenomena. In addition,
   unlike existing survey methods, this approach generates archival data so
   that places can be revisited through the video. This archival aspect
   allows the data to be used for subsequent investigations, even for
   studies not related to the initial research question. The integration of
   spatial video into a Geographic Information System (GIS) enables these
   data to be used as a source for mapping diverse environments. This paper
   introduces spatial video technology and then provides case studies of
   its applications from post-disaster recovery. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the acute-phase proteins produced
   predominantly by hepatocytes in response to inflammation, and it has
   been widely reported that CRP genetic polymorphism is a risk factor for
   cardiovascular disease and ischemic stroke. In addition, we previously
   showed that the CRP 1846T/T genotype is related to lymph node metastasis
   in patients with esophageal cancer. In the present study, we
   investigated the correlation between CRP 1846C > T polymorphism and the
   clinicopathological characteristics of non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC). The study participants were 146 Japanese patients who underwent
   curative surgery for NSCLC. DNA was extracted from tumor samples, and
   CRP1846C > T polymorphism was investigated using the polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. We then
   correlated genotype with known clinicopathological factors. Five-year
   overall survival among patients with the CRP 1846T/T genotype was
   significantly lower than among those with the 1846C/C or C/T genotype (p
   = 0.002, p = 0.001; log-rank test). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard
   analysis revealed age, sex, pathological stage III, and 1846T/T (hazard
   ratio, 1.76; 95\% confidence interval, 1.003-3.16; p = 0.049) to be
   independent factors affecting 5-year overall survival. These findings
   suggest the CRP 1846T/T genotype is an independent predictor of a poor
   prognosis in patients with NSCLC.}},

Abstract = {{Fertility patches under woody plant canopies in desert ecosystems may
   occur because the extended root systems of trees and shrubs absorb
   nutrients and deposit them below plant canopies during litterfall. The
   final effect of woody plants on soil fertility depends on different
   processes that transform litter and liberate nutrients to the soil. The
   woody legume Prosopis flexuosa D.C. produces the highest amount of
   litter in the Monte desert, generating islands of fertility under its
   canopy. In this study, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of litter mass
   fell under P flexuosa and experimentally relocalized in different
   microsites (under P flexuosa, under the shrub Larrea divaricata, in the
   previous canopy area of cut P. flexuosa trees, and in exposed areas). We
   found the highest decrease of litter mass in winter, similar for all
   microsites, and a lower decrease and higher spatial heterogeneity in
   spring and summer. Our results suggest that litter dynamics in the Monte
   desert is mainly controlled by litter quality, because the highest
   litter mass loss occurred immediately after the addition of litter, even
   under environmental conditions not favorable for biologic activity
   (i.e., cold and dry winter). Although the different microsites showed
   differences in litter mass dynamics, the total magnitude of litter mass
   changes was similar for all microsites, indicating that spatial
   heterogeneity in litter mass loss is not an important factor in
   generating spatial heterogeneity of soil fertility. Moreover, other
   factors, as litter relocalization by arthropods observed in our study
   and possibly wind and water, seem to play an important role in
   moderating the spatial differences of litterfall patterns caused by
   woody plants.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition that forestry provides a low cost and
   robust means of climate change abatement through carbon sequestration
   and substitution. However, current understanding of forest ecosystem
   carbon exchange and forest-atmosphere interactions are often
   inadequately characterized by existing empirical growth models with
   resulting poor representation for regional extrapolations. In this
   paper, we describe the parameterisation and independent validation,
   against both eddy covariance and forest growth experimental data, of a
   process-oriented model 3PGN to provide assessments of carbon
   sequestration of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriere)
   plantations across Scotland. In comparison with eddy covariance
   measurements, the model predicted all of the major annual carbon fluxes,
   i.e., gross primary production (P-G), net ecosystem production (P-E),
   and ecosystem respiration (R-E), with biases lower than 10\%. At a
   monthly time step, only P-G and P-E were accurately estimated, whereas
   R-E was not. At longer time scales (i.e., several decades), the model
   reliably represented the major patterns of the carbon balance. Soil type
   was identified as the important factor influencing site productivity;
   fertilization practices did not alter long-term site nutritional status.
   The analyses also highlighted the potential impact of carbon loss from
   carbon-rich soils, which can result in differences between optimal
   rotation length for carbon sequestration and for timber production.}},

Abstract = {{U-238, Th-232, Rn-222 and Rn-220 concentrations were measured inside
   various Moroccan black soap samples widely used by the Moroccan
   population in traditional baths (Hammans) by using both CR-39 and LR-115
   type II solid state nuclear track detectors. The measured U-238, Th-232,
   Rn-222 and Rn-220 concentrations, respectively, ranged from (3.7 +/-
   0.2) to (11.7 +/- 0.7) mBq kg(-1), (0.11 +/- 0.01) to (0.32 +/- 0.02)
   mBq kg(-1), (3.8 +/- 0.2) to (11.6 +/- 0.6) Bq kg(-1) and (0.10 +/-
   0.01) to (0.31 +/- 0.02) Bq kg(-1) for the Moroccan black soap samples
   studied. The influence of pollution on the concentrations of these
   radionuclides inside the considered Moroccan black soap was
   investigated. A new dosimetric model for evaluating annual committed
   effective doses due to U-238, Th-232 and Rn-222 to the skin of different
   age groups of the Moroccan populations from the application of the black
   soap samples studied was developed. The maximum total committed
   effective dose to the skin due to U-238, Th-232 and Rn-222 from the
   application of unpolluted black soap samples 20 min per week by the
   Moroccan populations was found to be equal to (0.88 +/- 0.05) mu Sv
   y(-1) cm(-2).}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To describe experience with an outpatient vascular
   interventional radiology (IR) practice with respect to number of
   patients seen, number of procedures performed, and number of imaging
   studies ordered in follow-up.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The outpatient vascular IR practice at the
   authors' institution was established in 2001 with two physicians
   spending one half-day per week; a third physician joined in 2004. A
   retrospective review was done of all patients seen by an interventional
   radiologist from 2001 to July 2008. The following data were collected
   for each physician per year: the number of new and established patients
   seen, the number and type of procedures performed, and the number and
   type of imaging studies ordered. Data are presented as mean +/- standard
   deviation per physician per year and total number.
   RESULTS: In 2001, the average number of new patients seen was 61 +/- 11
   (total number = 122), which peaked in 2006 at 127 +/- 28 (total number =
   380). A similar trend occurred with the established patients. In 2001,
   the procedure performed with the greatest frequency was abdominal
   aortogram with stent placement, which started at 18 +/- 2 (total number
   = 35) and peaked by 2006 at 37 +/- 23 (total number = 122). The number
   of ancillary imaging studies ordered by each physician increased each
   year and by 2006 was nearly 93 +/- 77 (total number = 278).
   CONCLUSIONS: A robust outpatient IR practice in vascular disease can be
   developed in 3-5 years with downstream imaging studies being ordered for
   the radiology department.}},

   addition to providing an overview of the evolution of glucosinolate
   biochemical diversity within the core Brassicales there were three main
   findings Firstly the glucosinolate content of some orphan taxa of the
   Brassicales such as Setchellanthus and Emblingia were consistent with
   recent phylogentic analyses based upon DNA sequence comparisons while
   further analyses of Tirania and Stixis is required Secondly methyl
   glucosinolate is found within the Capparaceae and Cleomaceae but also
   unexpectedly within Forchhammeria with implications for the biochemical
   and evolutionary origin of methyl glucosinolate and the phylogenetic
   relationships of Forchhammeria Thirdly whereas Old World Capparaceae
   contain methyl glucosinolate New World Capparaceae including New World
   Capparis either contain methyl glucosinolates or glucosinolates of
   complex and unresolved structures indicative of continued innovation in

Abstract = {{This work was aimed at evaluating the performance of bubble breakage and
   coalescence models in bubble column simulations. A total of five
   different models were considered (two for breakage and three for
   coalescence). These selected models had their parameters estimated using
   experimental data of bubble size distributions for the air-water system
   in an isothermal bubble column. Bubble sizes were measured with a
   photographic technique for two gas superficial velocities at three
   bubbling heights. Model parameters were estimated using the maximum
   likelihood technique applied to a one dimensional population balance
   model, which was solved by the method of classes. The results allowed to
   conclude, within the experimental uncertainty, that it was necessary to
   adjust the parameters of some of the models according to the operational
   conditions. For other models, the same parameter values could be used to
   represent different operational conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{What is known and objective: Total knee and hip joint replacement has a
   high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and steroid cover
   is used for cases associated with autoimmune diseases. Our aim is to
   evaluate the antiemetic efficacy of methylprednisolone as steroid cover
   in patients undergoing the surgery.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study design was used. Sixty-eight
   patients, aged between 20 and 80 years, were scheduled for a
   standardized general anaesthetic technique. Patients who were given
   methylprednisolone were assigned as the steroid cover group, and those
   who were not given methylprednisolone formed the non-steroid cover
   group. PONV were assessment by direct questioning or spontaneous
   complaints by patients 1 week after surgery. Postoperative pain was
   evaluated using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 1 and 3 days after surgery.
   Results and discussion: The incidence of nausea in the steroid cover
   group was significantly less than that in the non-steroid cover group
   (adjusted odds ratio, 0.17, P = 0.021), but there was no significant
   difference in vomiting between the two groups. Postoperative pain VAS
   score was not significantly different between groups.
   What is new and conclusion: In total knee and hip arthroplasty,
   methylprednisolone is effective in preventing postoperative nausea;
   however, higher doses of methylprednisolone may be needed to prevent
   vomiting.}},

   flow near the open end of a shock tube. Three incident shock Mach
   numbers were examined so that the BOS measurements could be compared
   with results given in the literature of particle-image velocimetry (PIV)
   measurements. Using the HiBOS technique, we were able to clearly view
   developing, compressible vortex rings and diffracted shock waves
   discharged from the open end of the shock tube. From the BOS images, we
   extracted the history of the propagation velocity, the diameter of the
   vortex ring, and the diameter of the vortex core, all of which agree
   with the corresponding PIV values reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The poxvirus anaphase promoting complex regulator (PACR) promotes viral
   replication by manipulating the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome
   (APC/C), a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase complex with essential roles in
   cell cycle regulation PACR has sequence similarities to APC/C subunit 11
   (APC11) and associates with APC/C subunits However, unlike APC11,
   expression of PACR disrupts APC/C functions Here, we further
   investigated the interaction of PACR with APC/C Following knockdown of
   APC1, the subunit linking APC11/APC2 to the rest of APC/C, PACR remained
   bound to APC2 but not to other, distal, subunits of the complex,
   suggesting PACR associates with APC/C via APC2 This was supported by the
   demonstration, in vitro, of a direct interaction between PACR and APC2
   Moreover, the presence of PACR interfered with interactions between both
   APC11 and APC2 Based on these observations we propose that PACR competes
   with APC11 for the incorporation into APC/C}},

Abstract = {{Hidden salting in digital media involves the intentional addition or
   distortion of content patterns with the purpose of content filtering. We
   propose a method to detect portions of a digital text source which are
   invisible to the end user, when they are rendered on a visual medium
   (like a computer monitor). The method consists of ``tapping{''} into the
   rendering process and analyzing the rendering commands to identify
   portions of the source text (plaintext) which will be invisible for a
   human reader, using criteria based on text character and background
   colors, font size, overlapping characters, etc. Moreover, text deemed
   visible (covertext) is reconstructed from rendering commands and then
   the character reading order is identified, which could differ from the
   rendering order. The detection and resolution of hidden salting is
   evaluated on two e-mail corpora, and the effectiveness of this method in
   spam filtering task is assessed. We provide a solution to a relevant
   open problem in content filtering applications, namely the presence of
   tricks aimed at circumventing automatic filters.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of using nanofluids on heat transfer and fluid flow
   characteristics in rectangular shaped microchannel heat sink (MCHS) is
   numerically investigated for Reynolds number range of 100-1000. In this
   study, the MCHS performance using alumina-water (Al(2)O(3)-H(2)O)
   nanofluid with volume fraction ranged from 1\% to 5\% was used as a
   coolant is examined. The three-dimensional steady, laminar flow and heat
   transfer governing equations are solved using finite volume method. The
   MCHS performance is evaluated in terms of temperature profile, heat
   transfer coefficient, pressure drop, friction factor, wall shear stress
   and thermal resistance. The results reveal that when the volume fraction
   of nanoparticles is increased under the extreme heat flux, both the heat
   transfer coefficient and wall shear stress are increased while the
   thermal resistance of the MCHS is decreased. However, nanofluid with
   volume fraction of 5\% could not be able to enhance the heat transfer or
   performing almost the same result as pure water. Therefore, the presence
   of nanoparticles could enhance the cooling of MCHS under the extreme
   heat flux conditions with the optimum value of nanoparticles. Only a
   slight increase in the pressure drop across the MCHS is found compared
   with the pure water-cooled MCHS. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremia has been known to provoke a
   plethora of autoimmune syndromes referred to as extrahepatic
   manifestations of chronic HCV infection. Aim of the current study was to
   assess the prevalence of rheumatologic manifestations among Egyptians
   with hepatitis C infection and its' association with cryoglobulin
   profile. The current research represents a cross-sectional study where
   patients with chronic HCV infection attending the outpatient clinic of
   the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute over a
   period of 1 year were interviewed. Patients with decompensated liver
   disease, on interferon therapy, having end-stage renal disease or
   coexisting viral infection like hepatitis B surface antibody positive
   patients were all excluded from the research. Laboratory investigations
   as well as serological assay including cryoglobulin profile, rheumatoid
   factor, antinuclear antibody, HCV-PCR were performed. Three hundred and
   six patients having chronic HCV infection were interviewed in this
   research. The overall estimated prevalence of rheumatologic
   manifestations in the current research was 16.39\%, chronic fatigue
   syndrome 9.5\%, sicca symptoms 8.8\%, arthralgia 6.5\%, fibromyalgia
   1.9\%, myalgia 1.3\%, arthritis 0.7\%, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis
   0.7\%, autoimmune hemolytic anemia 0.7\%, thrombocytopenia 0.7\%.
   Xerophthalmia was significantly present in male population (p=0.04),
   whereas fibromyalgia, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, arthritis, and
   autoimmune hemolytic anemia were significantly present in female
   population under study (p<0.05). In chronic HCV genotype 4 infection,
   the prevalence of rheumatologic manifestations was 16.3\% with chronic
   fatigue syndrome and sicca sysmptoms being the most common with no
   significant correlation to the degree of elevation of liver disease or

Abstract = {{Recent studies have attempted to extract impervious surfaces from
   high-resolution satellite imageiy such as Ikonos and Quick Bird. These
   images, however, often lack necessary spectral information due to
   technological limitations. This study integrates spectral information
   (temperature and moisture) derived from Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery with
   Ikonos imagery to derive high-resolution impervious surface information.
   Furthermore, three popular methods, including linear regression
   modeling, artificial neural network, and regression tree have been
   developed and compared using paired t-test statistic. Analysis of
   results reveal that Tasseled Cap components particularly greenness and
   wetness of Ikonos imagery are most important in estimating sub-pixel
   imperviousness. Also, to some extent the brightness temperature derived
   from Landsat-7 ETM+ image helps in better estimation of impervious
   surfaces. Moreover, a comparative analysis indicates that the non-linear
   approaches yielded statistically better results. Particularly, the
   regression tree model generated best results with highest Pearson's r
   (0.939) and lowest mean absolute error (8.307).}},

Abstract = {{In a continuous casting of wire rod production, a cast bar, which is
   formed in a rotating wheel mould, is subsequently rolled by a set of
   rolls to form wire rod. To improve fundamental understanding of
   wheel-belt continuous bar casting process, a two dimensional transient
   thermal model has been formulated based on finite element method.
   Temperature of cast bar predicted by model has been verified by actual
   temperature measurement during casting at different operating
   conditions. Simulation results show the influence of various operating
   parameters on temperature distribution of cast bar.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: the diagnostic impact of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was
   evaluated in serum and CSF of cancer and control patients.
   Methods: 97 analyses of CEA in CSF and serum from 83 cancer patients
   were compared with 41 cases without malignancy. CEA diffusion dynamics
   were evaluated with IgA CSF/serum quotients (Q 10). Intrathecal
   synthesis of CEA was analysed both by calculating an index Q CEA/Q IgA
   and within the IgA-diagram.
   Results: in 73 samples without synthesis of IgA or CEA, both quotients
   correlated well with a mean Q CEA/Q IgA of 1.1 (95\% CI 0.97-1.2). The Q
   CEA/Q IgA was significantly higher in metastasizing adenocarcinomas than
   in controls or other malignancies. In leptomeningeal disease from
   adenocarcinoma, Q CEA/Q IgA was significantly higher than in controls,
   while patients with CNS and/or bone metastases had intermediate values.
   The sensitivity to detect leptomeningeal disease was 91\% and 69\% for
   brain metastases. Q CEA/Q IgA and CEA synthesis assessed with the IgA
   diagram were equally sensitive.
   Conclusions: evaluation of CEA in the IgA diagram is feasible and of
   clinical value. The consideration of intrathecal CEA synthesis
   correlates better with the clinical status than absolute CSF-CEA or the
   correlation with albumin.}},

Abstract = {{In thyrotoxicosis GH responses to stimuli are diminished and the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is hyperactive. There are no data on
   ghrelin or GHRP-6-induced GH, ACTH and cortisol release in treated
   hyperthyroidism. We, therefore, evaluated these responses in 10
   thyrotoxic patients before treatment and in 7 of them after treatment.
   GHRH-induced GH release was also studied. Peak GH (mu g/L; mean +/- A
   SE) values after ghrelin (22.6 +/- A 3.9), GHRP-6 (13.8 +/- A 2.3) and
   GHRH (4.9 +/- A 0.9) were lower in hyperthyroidism before treatment
   compared to controls (ghrelin: 67.6 +/- A 19.3; GHRP-6: 25.4 +/- A 2.7;
   GHRH: 12.2 +/- A 2.8) and did not change after 6 months of euthyroidism
   (ghrelin: 32.7 +/- A 4.7; GHRP-6: 15.6 +/- A 3.6; GHRH: 7.4 +/- A 2.3),
   although GH responses to all peptides increased in similar to 50\% of
   the patients. In thyrotoxicosis before treatment ACTH response to
   ghrelin was two fold higher (107.4 +/- A 26.3) than those of controls
   (54.9 +/- A 10.3), although not significantly. ACTH response to GHRP-6
   was similar in both groups (hyperthyroid: 44.7 +/- A 9.0; controls: 31.3
   +/- A 7.9). There was a trend to a decreased ACTH response to ghrelin
   after 3 months of euthyroidism (35.6 +/- A 5.3; P = 0.052), but after 6
   months this decrease was non-significant (50.7 +/- A 14.0). After 3
   months ACTH response to GHRP-6 decreased significantly (20.4 +/- A 4.2),
   with no further changes. In hyperthyroidism before treatment, peak
   cortisol (mu g/dL) responses to ghrelin (18.2 +/- A 1.2) and GHRP-6
   (15.9 +/- A 1.4) were comparable to controls (ghrelin: 16.4 +/- A 1.6;
   GHRP-6: 13.5 +/- A 0.9) and no changes were seen after treatment. Our
   results suggest that the pathways of GH release after ghrelin/GHRP-6 and
   GHRH are similarly affected by thyroid hormone excess and hypothalamic
   mechanisms of ACTH release modulated by ghrelin/GHSs may be activated in
   this situation.}},

Abstract = {{Emergency management of tsunami floods in Chile was studied in the urban
   area of Puerto Saavedra, Araucania Region. This procedure consisted of
   three stages: (1) risk assessment and zoning based on the methodology
   proposed by the United Nations (UN), (2) implementation of citizen
   participation workshops, according to the AIDEP methodology, and (3)
   implementation of maps indicating safety areas and evacuation routes.
   The results showed two risk categories: maximum, associated to the urban
   area, and no risk, associated to mountain range. The community did not
   perceive the risk of flooding due to tsunami as a maximum, which
   depended on the location of housing developments and the prioritization
   of the most immediate risks. The approach of this study is useful for
   updating civil protection plans in coastal areas, an experience that can
   be replicated in the coastal districts of the country and the rest of
   Latin America.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in terrigenous-transfer patterns from North America toward the
   Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River during the Holocene were
   investigated using mineralogical and geochemical records from the
   northern Gulf of Mexico (Pigmy Basin). Clay mineralogy (smectite/illite
   + chlorite) and geochemical signatures (K and Ti intensities) indicate
   fluctuations in the detrital sedimentation during the Holocene in the
   Pigmy Basin. They likely reflect alternations between at least two
   dominant terrigenous sources: the smectite-rich NW Mississippi
   watershed, and the illite- and chlorite-rich Great Lakes province and NE
   Mississippi watershed. These recurring and rapid modifications of
   erosional processes over this period suggest changes in the hydrological
   regime via rainfall patterns. Such a modification during the Holocene is
   likely linked with the rapid atmospheric reorganization following the
   final collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Indeed, mineralogical and
   geochemical proxies indicate east-to-west migrations of the main
   detrital source (from the Great Lakes and northeastern province toward
   the northwestern province) associated with Mississippi River megaflood
   episodes. These modifications of the main detrital sources likely record
   migrations of the precipitation belt, which are constrained by
   atmospheric configuration (Jet Stream, Bermuda High and Intertropical
   Convergence Zone position) and subtropical oceanic hydrological
   properties (meridional extension of the Atlantic Warm Pool). In the
   frame of previously published rainfall patterns over the Caribbean and
   North America, our results highlight some marked modifications of
   moisture transfer throughout the Holocene. These changes are interpreted
   as resulting from two atmospheric configurations that have driven
   alternately the precipitation distribution over North America for the
   last 10 ka with an apparent cyclicity of similar to 2.5 ka. The coherent
   common cyclicity between the Gulf of Mexico detrital parameters and
   Greenland atmospheric proxies over the Holocene suggests that the
   initial external forcing was rapidly transferred latitudinally through
   atmospheric processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the resource reservation problem in a packet
   switching network. REBOOK, the presented algorithm, provides
   deterministic, fast (real-time) dynamic resource allocation and release.
   Based on a stateful approach, it handles faults and network errors, and
   recovers from route changes and unexpected flows shutdown. The
   distributed scheme used to store flows information avoids the need of
   searching for entries within the routers' control memory when packets
   are received and guarantees constant complexity. REBOOK can be
   implemented in hardware and is compatible with any packet switching
   network. In the Internet, it can be integrated in TCP or used with UDP
   to make it network friendly. Moreover, a slightly extended
   implementation of RSVP can be used as signalling and hosting protocol. A
   software implementation as standalone protocol has been developed to
   prove its effectiveness, robustness, and performance.}},

Title = {{Alternative Strategies for Gene Therapy of Hemophilia}},
Journal = {{HEMATOLOGY-AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY EDUCATION PROGRAM}},
Year = {{2010}},
Pages = {{197-202}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Hemophilia A and B are monogenic disorders that were felt to be ideal
   targets for initiation of gene therapy. Although the first hemophilia
   gene therapy trial has been over 10 years ago, few trials are currently
   actively recruiting. Although preclinical studies in animals were
   promising, levels achieved in humans did not achieve long-term
   expression at adequate levels to achieve cures. Transplantation as a
   source of cellular replacement therapy for both hemophilia A and B have
   been successful following liver transplantation in which the recipient
   produces normal levels of either factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX).
   Most of these transplants have been conducted for the treatment of liver
   failure rather than for ``curing{''} hemophilia. There are a variety of
   new strategies for delivering the missing clotting factor through
   ectopic expression of the deficient protein. One approach uses
   hematopoietic stem cells using either a nonspecific promoter or using a
   lineage-specific promoter. An alternative strategy includes enhanced
   expression in endothelial cells or blood-outgrowth endothelial cells. An
   additional approach includes the expression of FVIII or FIX
   intraarticularly to mitigate the intraarticular bleeding that causes
   much of the disability for hemophilia patients. Because activated factor
   VII (FVIIa) can be used to treat patients with inhibitory antibodies to
   replacement clotting factors, preclinical gene therapy has been
   performed using platelet-or liver-targeted FVIIa expression. All of
   these newer approaches are just beginning to be explored in large animal
   models. Whereas improved recombinant replacement products continue to be
   the hallmark of hemophilia therapy, the frequency of replacement therapy
   is beginning to be addressed through longer-acting replacement products.
   A safe cure of hemophilia is still the desired goal, but many barriers
   must still be overcome.}},

Abstract = {{To develop a method for drawing statistical inferences from differences
   between multiple experimental pair distribution function (PDF)
   transforms of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data.
   The appropriate treatment of initial PXRD error estimates using
   traditional error propagation algorithms was tested using Monte Carlo
   simulations on amorphous ketoconazole. An amorphous felodipine:polyvinyl
   pyrrolidone:vinyl acetate (PVPva) physical mixture was prepared to
   define an error threshold. Co-solidified products of felodipine:PVPva
   and terfenadine:PVPva were prepared using a melt-quench method and
   subsequently analyzed using PXRD and PDF. Differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) was used as an additional characterization method.
   The appropriate manipulation of initial PXRD error estimates through the
   PDF transform were confirmed using the Monte Carlo simulations for
   amorphous ketoconazole. The felodipine:PVPva physical mixture PDF
   analysis determined +/- 3 sigma to be an appropriate error threshold.
   Using the PDF and error propagation principles, the felodipine:PVPva
   co-solidified product was determined to be completely miscible, and the
   terfenadine:PVPva co-solidified product, although having appearances of
   an amorphous molecular solid dispersion by DSC, was determined to be
   phase-separated.
   Statistically based inferences were successfully drawn from PDF
   transforms of PXRD patterns obtained from composite systems. The
   principles applied herein may be universally adapted to many different
   systems and provide a fundamentally sound basis for drawing structural
   conclusions from PDF studies.}},

Abstract = {{This work aimed to analyze the effect of low-intensity exercise training
   on ultrastructural and molecular aortic remodeling. Male Wistar-Kyoto
   rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were allocated into
   four groups: sedentary WKY (SED-WKY), exercised WKY (EX-WKY, 1 h/day, 5
   days/week treadmill exercise training), sedentary SHR (SED-SHR), and
   exercised SHR (EX-SHR). EX-SHR showed blood pressure reduction of 26\%
   in comparison to SED-SHR after 1 month of exercise (P<0.05). At the 20th
   week. BP level was not different between EX-SHRs and WKYs.
   Circumferential wall tension (CWT) was higher by 77\% in SED-SHRs than
   in SED-WKYs (P<0.001). Exercise training reduced CWT by 30\% in EX- vs.
   SED-SHR (P<0.001). In SED-SHRs, endothelial cells showed large and
   numerous cytoplasmatic vacuoles, fragmented inner elastic lamina and
   scarce elastin and fibrillin, while exercise training ameliorated it in
   EX-SHR group. The highest eNOS immunodensity was observed in EX-SHR,
   which was 50\% higher than EX-WKY (P<0.01) and 120\% higher than SED-SHR
   (P<0.0001). In conclusion, present findings indicate beneficial effects
   of exercise training in hypertensive rats since it increased elastin,
   fibrillin and eNOS content in the aortic wall. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

   (particulate matter {[}PM] <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter)
   concentrations over 80 mu g/m(3) have been reached frequently since
   1998. Despite several regulations introduced over the past 20 yr to
   improve the air quality, PM concentration levels remain high. In this
   work, sampling in downtown Santiago was conducted from April 1998 to
   August 2007 for PM2.5 and from October 2003 to March 2006 for PM10-2.5
   (PM between 2.5 and 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) with dichotomous
   samplers. Elemental analysis was performed on the samples with X-ray
   fluorescence. The resulting series of 859 samples and 216 elements
   identified were divided into semiannual periods and analyzed with factor
   analysis. Five factors are clearly discerned: soil, motor vehicles,
   residual oil, marine aerosols, and secondary sulfates. The soil factor
   in the fine fraction shows a clear increase from 2002 to 2006, whereas
   the coarse fraction of this factor shows a stable trend. The most
   probable cause for this trend is the growth in the number of vehicles in
   Santiago (6.5\%/yr), which increases the resuspension of particles from
   the ground. Another cause for the increase is the growth in the
   construction activity (4.2\%/yr). The motor vehicle factor in the fine
   fraction shows a decrease between 1998 and 2006. The decrease in the
   apportionment of this factor can be explained by the improvement in the
   vehicle fleet. In Santiago, the number of noncatalytic vehicles has been
   reduced from 389,000 in 2001 to 275,000 in 2006. The residual oil factor
   also shows a decrease between 1998 and 2006. The decrease could be
   attributed to the adoption of cleaner technologies and norms regarding
   gasoline and diesels.}},

   specifically, on the body surface and head of the critically endangered
   largetooth sawfish (commonly referred to as the freshwater sawfish in
   Australia), Pristis microdon Latham, 1794 (Elasmobranchii, Pristidae),
   in brackish tidal waters of the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley region of
   Western Australia and the Leichhardt River in the Gulf of Carpentaria in
   northern Queensland. This represents a geographic range extension of
   similar to 8000 km for this parasite. Further, it is only the second
   member of the genus Caligus to be found on an elasmobranch host in
   Western Australia and it is the first time this species has been
   reported from the Southern Hemisphere. Male biased dispersal of P
   microdon may be the vector in which the parasite has dispersed from
   India across to northern Australia, or vice versa. A decline in
   populations of the critically endangered P microdon (and possibly other
   pristid species) in these regions may lead to a concomitant decline in
   their parasite fauna.}},

   using data on more than 4000 Japanese firms, ranging from listed large

   sector. The presence of labor unions has statistically and economically
   significant positive effects on firm productivity. Unions' effects on
   wages are also positive, their magnitude being slightly larger than
   those on productivity. The decrease in the number of employees is
   greater at unionized firms than at non-unionized firms. The difference
   in employment growth is mainly attributable to the change in the number
   of part-time workers. In order to enhance productivity, close
   cooperation between management and unions is essential. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Previously, we reported upregulation of astrocyte {[}Ca2+](i)
   oscillation by growth factors (i.e., conversion of glutamate-induced
   sustained {[}Ca2+] increase in astrocytes cultured in a defined medium
   to {[}Ca2+](i) oscillation by EGF and bFGF treatment over 48 h) (Morita
   et al., (2003) J Neurosci 23:10944-10952). As our previous study also
   showed that these growth factors increase intracellular Ca2+ stores,
   this study was performed to investigate the mechanism underlying loading
   of intracellular Ca2+ stores in astrocytes, especially sarco-endoplasmic
   reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), as a candidate mechanism by which growth
   factors upregulate {[}Ca2+](i) oscillation. The results indicated that
   the growth factors upregulated a SERCA inhibitor-sensitive component of
   {[}Ca2+](i) clearance, and increased expression of the SERCA subtype,
   SERCA2b. Furthermore, treating the growth factor-treated astrocytes with
   a low concentration of SERCA inhibitor to partially inhibit SERCA
   reduced the level of intracellular Ca2+ storage and reversed
   glutamate-induced {[}Ca2+](i) oscillations to sustained {[}Ca2+](i)
   increases. Thus, the upregulation of {[}Ca2+](i) oscillations was
   attributed to the upregulation of SERCA activities. These results
   indicated that these growth factors regulate the pattern of
   glutamate-induced astrocyte {[}Ca2+](i) increases via SERCA2b
   expression. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the
   world, ranging from 6\% to 28\% with an average of approximately 13.8\%
   in the general population. It has been reported that human leucocyte
   antigen (HLA) alleles are associated with the outcome of HCV infection,
   but this associations showed ethnic and geographical differences. The
   objective of this study is to investigate the association between the
   frequencies of HLA Class I and chronic HCV infection in Egyptian
   patients and to find out whether there is a relation between certain HLA
   Class I antigens and HCV viral load, degree of fibrosis, activity and
   alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level. A case control study was conducted
   on 100 patients with chronic HCV infection and 150 healthy controls.
   HLA-A and HLA-B typing by complement-dependent microlympho-cytotoxicity
   assay was performed for both groups. HLA-A11 antigen was significantly
   increased in patients with chronic HCV infection versus controls (OR
   3.98; 95\% CI = 1.85-8.89; P = 0.001; and Pc = 0.021). HLA-B12, HLA-B13,
   HLA-B17 and HLA-B40 were higher in patients, and HLA-A32 and HLA-B14
   were higher in controls, although the significance was lost after
   correction for multiple testing. HLA-A9 was significantly associated
   with low viral load (P = 0.008, Pc = 0.048). The results of this work
   implicate that HLA-A11 antigen may influence chronic HCV infection and
   may play a role in viral persistence. Different HLA Class I antigens are
   not associated with degree of liver fibrosis, grades of activity or
   level of ALT. However, HLA-A9 is associated with low HCV viral load in
   chronic HCV Egyptian patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To measure the height, anteroposterior, and transverse
   diameters of the nasolacrimal duct (NLD) in normal children between 2
   weeks and 34 months of age and to compare the development of the NLD
   with the maxilla.
   Design: Retrospective case series.
   Participants: Thirty-eight children with no history of NLD abnormalities
   who underwent prior axial computed tomography (CT) facial scans of 0.50
   to 0.625 mm resolution.
   Methods: Consecutive cases of CT facial series over a 16-month period at
   a single institution were studied.
   Main Outcome Measures: Height, anteroposterior and transverse diameters,
   and volume of the NLD; height of the maxillary sinus.
   Results: The height of the bony NLD increases 1.8-fold, the average
   diameter increases 1.4-fold, and the volume increases 4.6-fold between 2
   weeks and 34 months of age. The dimensional increases of the NLD are
   nonlinear, with most of the increase occurring in the first 6 months of
   life. The increase in height of the NLD is highly correlated with
   postnatal growth of the maxilla.
   Conclusions: Spontaneous resolution of NLD obstruction in normal infants
   is coincident with elongation, limited radial extension, and the
   resulting volume expansion of the NLD. We propose that increases in
   hydrostatic pressure within the fluid column of the NLD combined with
   central cavitation of the epithelial core can account for the patency of
   the NLD in normal infants.

Abstract = {{It has been recognized widely that sequestration of atmospheric CO2 by
   terrestrial ecosystems can contribute significantly to the stabilization
   of atmospheric CO2. The carbon sequestration potential of crop lands
   should be considered as a modest but non-negligible contribution to
   climate change mitigation. Salinity is one of the most important
   environmental factors limiting crop production of marginal agricultural
   soils in many parts of the world. In our research, several physiological
   analyses were performed in atmospheric CO2, in daylight, both in normal
   conditions and with salinity (40 mm NaCl). Crops like melon or pepper
   showed significantly lower photosynthetic rates when they were grown in
   saline conditions. Also, the total chlorophyll content and carbon
   percentage were lower in the salinity-treated plants of these species.
   For lettuce, treated plants showed a significant decrease in
   photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll content, but there were no
   differences in carbon content. On the other hand, there were no
   significant differences in the values of total chlorophyll content,
   photosynthetic rate, or carbon content for tomato and watermelon plants
   when control and NaCl-treated plants were compared. The mineral
   composition data showed greater increases of sodium in both roots and
   leaves of melon and pepper when plants were treated with NaCl compared
   with the rest of the species. In conclusion, tomato and watermelon seem
   to be more efficient in CO2 fixation than the other crops of this
   experiment and this seems to be related to their greater salinity
   tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{The hepatic hydatid cyst is a major health problem in endemic areas.
   Surgery is still the best choice for the treatment of hydatid cyst of
   the liver. There is controversy regarding efficacy of radical versus
   conservative surgical approaches. In this study, we aimed to evaluate
   the two surgical methods in patients treated for the hepatic hydatid
   cyst. This is a retrospective review of the medical records of 135
   patients who underwent surgery for the hepatic hydatid cyst from 1993 to
   2003. Surgery comprised conservative methods (evacuation of the cyst
   content and excision of the inner cyst layers) and radical methods
   (total excision of the cyst and removal of its outer layer). One hundred
   thirty five patients underwent liver surgery. Conservative surgery was
   performed for 71 (53\%), whereas, the remaining 64 patients (47\%)
   underwent radical surgery. Local recurrence rate of the cysts was lower
   in the radical versus conservative surgery group and the mean length of
   hospital stay was shorter in the radical surgery group. Radical surgery
   of the hepatic hydatid cyst may be the preferred treatment because of
   its low rate of local recurrence, as well as short hospital stay.}},

Abstract = {{The blurred lantern shark Etmopterus bigelowi, a deep-water squaloid
   shark, is globally widespread in temperate and tropical waters, but
   there is little available information about its biology owing to its
   relative rarity of capture and taxonomic confusion with its sibling
   species Etmopterus pusillus. Specimens used in this study were collected
   from July to December 2004 as by-catch in the commercial deep-water
   trawl fishery targeting red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea in the
   southwestern Atlantic. We examined 55 specimens (22 males and 33
   females) ranging in total length (TL) from 31.5 to 73 cm and in total
   weight from 103 to 1600 g. Length-weight relationships were explored for
   each sex and significant differences were found in the slope
   coefficients of the male and female regressions. The size at maturity
   for each sex was evaluated fitting a logistic regression. Females
   matured at larger sizes than males, with estimated sizes at first
   maturity of 56.0 cm TL for females and 45.1 cm TL for males. The present
   study provides important preliminary information about E. bigelowi that
   can be incorporated in risk assessment and stock assessment models,
   essential for efficient management practices aimed at avoiding
   overexploitation of these vulnerable deep-sea sharks.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. A bloodstream infection (BSI) is a life-threatening
   condition. We studied the causative agents of BSIs and antimicrobial
   susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates at Muhimbili National
   Hospital (MNH) in Oar es Salaam, Tanzania.
   Methods. A retrospective analysis of blood culture results obtained at
   MNH from January 2005 to December 2009 was done. Blood culture isolates
   judged to be clinically significant and antimicrobial susceptibility
   results of the bacteria were included. The frequencies and proportions
   of bacteria isolated and antimicrobial susceptibility results were
   analysed and compared using Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's exact
   test where applicable, or the Mann-Whitney U-test.
   Results. A total of 13 833 blood cultures were performed. Bacterial
   pathogens were detected in 1 855 (13.4\%), Gram-positive bacteria (1
   523; 82.1\%) being significantly more prevalent than Gram-negative
   bacteria (332; 17.9\%) (p=0.008). The most common bacterial pathogens
   isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (1 250; 67.4\%),
   S. aureus (245; 13.2\%), Escherichia coli (131; 7\%) and Klebsiella spp.
   (130; 7.0\%). All bacteria isolated showed high resistance to penicillin
   G (70.6\%), tetracycline (63.8\%), cefotaxime (62.5\%) and ampicillin
   (62.3\%). Moderate to high resistance was seen against chloramphenicol
   (45.2\%), erythromycin (35.0\%), ciprofloxacin (29.3\%), co-trimoxazole
   (25.0\%) and gentamicin (23.5\%). Of S. aureus isolates, 23.3\% were
   resistant to methicillin.
   Conclusions. CoNS accounted for two-thirds of the bacterial pathogens
   isolated. High-level resistance was seen to first-line and inexpensive
   antimicrobial agents. Routine screening for extended-spectrum
   beta-lactamase production and methicillin resistance among Gram-negative
   rods and S. aureus from blood cultures should be instituted to monitor
   spread of multidrug-resistant isolates.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was a correct statistical comparison of two
   assay methods for determination of glycated haemoglobin HbA1c. The
   immunoturbidimetric determination of HbA1c was performed in two ways:
   using an automatic analyser Hitachi 912, calibrated according to the
   IFCC reference system (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry
   and Laboratory Medicine) and using an analyser Advia 1200 and the NGSP
   reference system (National Glycohaemoglobin Standardization Program).
   For statistical comparison of these two analytical methods several
   advanced regression methods were used, which respect random errors of
   both compared methods. Specifically, Deming regression with and without
   weights, orthogonal regression, and Passing-Bablok regression were
   employed. The results demonstrate that the investigated analytical assay
   methods do not correspond to each other. The summarized results indicate
   usefulness of better harmonisation of two existing reference systems.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive flux of free fatty acids (FFA) into the liver contributes to
   liver impairment in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It
   remains unclear how FFA contribute to impairment of hepatocytes. This
   study treated hepatocytes with linoleic acid and palmitate to
   investigate the early event triggering FFA-mediated impairment. It
   determined cell viability, content of nitrite/nitrate and
   triacylglycerides (TG), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein,
   oxidation of cardiolipin (CL) as well as formation of F-2-isoprostanes
   in the presence of insulin and glucose. Linoleic acid caused significant
   decrease in cell viability. It is shown that palmitate caused induction
   of iNOS resulting in increased nitrite/nitrate concentration and slight
   increase in TG content. Linoleic acid led to a decrease in
   nitrite/nitrate concentration parallelled by massive TG accumulation in
   combination with increased oxidation of CL and increased F-2-isoprostane
   levels. It is concluded that nitric oxide (NO) concentration regulates

Abstract = {{We report on an analysis of the quark spectral representation at finite
   temperatures based on the quark propagator determined from its
   Dyson-Schwinger equation in Landau gauge. In Euclidean space we achieve
   nice agreement with recent results from quenched lattice QCD. We find
   different analytical properties of the quark propagator below and above
   the deconfinement transition. Using a variety of ansatze for the
   spectral function we then analyze the possible quasiparticle spectrum,
   in particular its quark mass and momentum dependence in the high
   temperature phase. This analysis is completed by an application of the
   Maximum Entropy Method, in principle allowing for any positive
   semi-definite spectral function. Our results motivate a more direct
   determination of the spectral function in the framework of
   Dyson-Schwinger equations.}},

Abstract = {{Power stations and industrial processes burning fossil fuels account for
   the largest percentage of carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon capture and
   sequestration has received enormous global attention to reduce the
   carbon footprint and combat global warming. Adsorption has become an
   alternative technique to the conventional absorption process for
   capturing carbon dioxide due to its low operating and capital costs.
   In this study, Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) process has been compared
   with Thermal Pressure Swing Adsorption (TPSA) process for CO, recovery
   from a flue gas composition of 10\% CO2 (by vol) in N-2 using Ceca 13X
   adsorbent. A factorial design set of experiments was performed to
   optimise the carbon dioxide recovery and study the effects and
   interaction of four control parameters namely, purge/feed flow ratio,
   purge time, purge gas temperature and adsorption column pressure.
   Results indicated that better regeneration conditions used in a TPSA
   cycle was essential over a PSA cycle for regaining maximum adsorption
   capacity of the used Ceca 13X adsorbent. It was found that Purge time
   had a significant effect on the CO2) recovery followed by Column
   pressure, purge/feed flow ratio and purge temperature. A Minitab (R)
   statistical software was used to analyse the data. It was found that the
   test of significance for lack of fit showed the fitted model to be an
   adequate representation of the experimental data. The results showed
   that to maximise the CO2 recovery, highest values of the control
   parameters have to be used.}},

   to undecidability over arbitrary frames (Areces et al. (1999) {[}2]). We
   also show that adding the @ operator or the past modality leads to
   undecidability over transitive frames. This is again in contrast to the
   case of transitive trees and linear frames, where we show these
   languages to be nonelementarily decidable. Furthermore, we establish
   2EXPTIME and EXPTIME upper bounds for satisfiability over transitive
   frames and transitive trees, respectively, for the hybrid Until/Since

Abstract = {{Recent advances in cancer biology reveal that microRNAs (miRNAs) are
   involved in the regulation of cancer-related genes, or they function as
   tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In prostate cancer, evidence has
   accumulated for the contribution of the androgen-dependent gene network
   to tumor growth, although the precise functions of miRNAs in prostate
   cancer remain to be investigated. Here, we identified
   androgen-responsive miRNAs by the short RNA sequencing analysis in LNCaP
   prostate cancer cells. Among 10 miRNAs with known sequences, we have
   determined that miR-148a reduces the expression of cullin-associated and
   neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1), a negative regulator of
   SKP1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligases, by binding to the
   3'-untranslated region of CAND1 mRNA. CAND1 knockdown by small
   interfering RNA promoted the proliferation of LNCaP cells. Our study

Abstract = {{Anosmin-1, defective in Kallmann's syndrome, participates in the
   adhesion, migration and differentiation of different cell types in the
   CNS. Although not fully understood, the mechanisms of action of
   Anosmin-1 involve the interaction with different proteins, being the
   interaction with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and the
   modulation of its signalling the best studied to date. Using
   glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays we demonstrate that the
   FnIII. 3 (Fibronectin-like type III) domain and the combination whey
   acidic protein-FnIII. 1, but not each of them individually, interact
   with FGFR1. The interaction of the whey acidic protein-FnIII. 1 domains
   is substantially reduced when the cysteine-rich region is present,
   suggesting a likely regulatory role for this domain. The introduction in
   FnIII. 3 of any of the two missense mutations found in Kallmann's
   syndrome patients, E514K and F517L, abolished the interaction with
   FGFR1, what suggests an important role for these residues in the
   interaction. Interestingly, the chemoattraction of Anosmin-1 on rat
   neuronal precursors (NPs) via FGFR1 is retained by the N-terminal region
   of Anosmin-1 but not by FnIII. 3 alone, and is lost in proteins carrying
   either one of the missense mutations, probably because of a highly
   reduced binding capacity to FGFR1. We also describe homophilic
   interaction Anosmin-1/Anosmin-1 via the FnIII repeats 1 and 4, and the
   interaction of FnIII. 1 and FnIII. 3 with Fibronectin and of FnIII. 3
   with Laminin.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To address the question of whether a mortality risk
   associated with depression in a 1952 representative sample of Stirling
   County adults changed in a new sample in 1970, and whether there was a
   change in associations with cigarette smoking and alcoholism.
   Method: Sample members were interviewed about depression and cigarette
   smoking. General physicians were interviewed by psychiatrists regarding
   alcoholism. Information about death as of December 31, 1992, was
   provided by Statistics Canada. Proportional hazards models were fitted
   in the 2 samples to assess the mortality risks associated with
   depression among men and women during 20 years of follow-up, and
   additionally among men with heavy smoking and alcoholism. Specific
   causes of death were investigated.
   Results: Hazard ratios representing the association between depression
   and premature death among men were 2.6 (95\% CI 1.4 to 4.9) and 2.8
   (95\% CI 1.5 to 5.1), respectively, in the 1952 and 1970 samples for the
   first 10 years of follow-up. Hazard ratios for women were 1.4 (95\% CI
   0.6 to 3.2) and 1.2 (95\% CI 0.5 to 2.9). The risk associated with
   depression among men was independent of alcoholism and heavy smoking.
   Depression and alcoholism were significantly associated with death by
   external causes and circulatory disease; heavy smoking was significantly
   associated with malignant neoplasms.
   Conclusion: The mortality associated with depression did not change
   during the period from 1952 to 1970. Depressed men experienced a
   significant mortality risk that was not matched among depressed women
   and also was not due to alcoholism and heavy smoking.}},

Abstract = {{By means of molecular-dynamics simulations, temperature-driven
   diffusionless structural phase transitions in equiatomic and nearly

   purpose, a model potential from the literature was adopted {[}W. S. Lai

   on the tight-binding model in second moment approximation. The model
   predicts a stable B19' phase at low temperatures and a nearly cubic B2
   phase at high temperatures. After an analysis of crystallography and
   energetics of the emerging structures, the experimentally known strong
   dependence of transition temperatures on composition is confirmed and
   related to lattice instability. Free-energy calculations finally give
   insight into the driving forces of the phase transitions and reveal free
   energy barriers inhibiting them below the transition temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{This study establishes the immune response elicited in guinea pigs after
   pulmonary and parenteral immunizations with diphtheria CRM-197 antigen
   (CrmAg). Several spray-dried powders of formalin-treated/untreated CrmAg
   nanoaggregates with L-leucine were delivered to the lungs of guinea
   pigs. A control group consisting of alum with adsorbed CrmAg in saline
   was administered by intramuscular injection. Animals received three
   doses of powder vaccines containing 20 or 40 mu g of CrmAg. The serum
   IgG titers were measured for 16 weeks after the initial immunization;
   IgA titers were measured at the time of sacrifice in the
   broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. Further, toxin neutralization tests in
   naive guinea pigs were performed for a few select serum samples.
   Histopathology of the lung tissues was conducted to evaluate
   inflammation or injury to the lung tissues. While the highest titer of
   serum IgG antibody was observed in guinea pigs immunized by the
   intramuscular route, those animals immunized with dry powder formulation
   by the pulmonary route, and without the adjuvant alum, exhibited high
   IgA titers. A pulmonary administered dry powder, compared to parenteral
   immunization, conferred complete protection in the toxin neutralization
   test. Mild inflammation was observed in lung tissues of animals
   receiving dry powder vaccines by the pulmonary route. Thus,
   administering novel CrmAg as dry powders to the lungs may be able to
   overcome some of the disadvantages observed with the existing diphtheria
   vaccine which is administered by the parenteral route. In addition,
   these powders will have the advantage of eliciting a high mucosal immune
   response in the lungs without using traditional adjuvants.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To establish a novel serum marker for endometriosis, serum
   autoantibodies (autoAbs) were investigated using a proteomic approach.
   Design: Retrospective study.
   Setting: Departments of Molecular Pathology and Obstetrics and
   Gynecology in Ehime University and University Hospital.
   Patient(s): Sixty-nine patients with endometriosis, 38 disease control
   patients without endometriosis, and 44 healthy volunteers.
   Intervention(s): Autoantibodies in sera of endometriotic patients and
   healthy controls were investigated using a human fibroblast cell line,
   two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting. Proteins in
   reacted spots were identified using MALDI time of flight mass
   spectrometry with MASCOT analysis. ELISAs were established using
   recombinant proteins, and autoAb-titers were estimated in sera of
   endometriotic patients and controls.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Identification of serum autoAb useful for
   diagnosis of endometriosis.
   Result(s): Several autoAbs were identified. ELISAs were established and
   serum autoAb titers were estimated. Among those identified,
   anti-PDIK1L-autoAb levels were significantly elevated in endometriotic
   patients. Sensitivity (59.4\%) and accuracy (72.8\%) of serum
   anti-PDIK1L-autoAb assay were better than those of serum CA125 levels
   (36.2\% and 62.9\%, respectively) in diagnosis of endometriosis.
   Additionally, anti-PDIK1L-autoAb could detect endometriotic patients in
   early stages.
   Conclusion(s): Serum anti-PDIK1L-autoAb can be a new serum marker for
   the diagnosis of endometriosis. This study validates further clinical
   evaluation of this novel marker. (Fertil Steril (R) 2010;94:2552-7. (C)

Abstract = {{Aims: Glimepiride, a third generation sulfonylurea (SU), is known to
   have extra-pancreatic effects, but its vascular effect is unclear. We
   investigated the efficacy of glimepiride in improving arterial stiffness
   assessed by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) in type 2 diabetic
   patients, compared with glibenclamide, a conventional SU. Methods: Forty
   type 2 diabetic patients were randomly assigned to two groups. One group
   was administered glimepiride 1.5 mg/day, and the other group was
   administered glibenclamide 1.25 mg/day for 6 months. Results: No
   significant difference in hypoglycaemic effect was observed between two
   groups. CAVI significantly decreased only in glimepiride group (9.4 +/-
   1.4 -> 8.9 +/- 0.8, p < 0.05). Decrease in CAVI was greater in
   glimepiride group than in glibenclamide group (-0.50 +/- 0.98 vs. -0.04
   +/- 0.57, p = 0.048). Urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)
   decreased in glimepiride group and increased in glibenclamide group, and
   the changes were significantly different between groups (-1.5 +/- 3.5
   vs. + 1.8 +/- 3.6, p = 0.009); whereas serum lipoprotein lipase mass
   increased in glibenclamide group and decreased in glibenclamide group,
   and the changes tended to be different between groups (+ 2.1 +/- 19.1
   vs. -7.4 +/- 19.2, p = 0.096). Change in urinary 8-OHdG was a
   significant independent predictor for change in CAVI in all subjects.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that glimepiride improves CAVI
   compared with glibenclamide. Reduced oxidative stress and improved
   insulin resistance may contribute to the improvement of CAVI

   V and improved subthreshold swings. By comparison, NW TFETs realized
   using conventional RTP for dopant activation show an order of magnitude
   lower current. We attribute these findings to a more abrupt doping
   profile at the tunnel junction, owing to reduced dopant diffusion and
   improved dopant activation.}},

Abstract = {{In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), higher hemoglobin (HGB)
   has been associated with better outcomes, but packed red blood cell
   (PRBC) transfusions with worse outcomes. We performed a prospective
   pilot trial of goal HGB after SAH.
   Forty-four patients with SAH and high risk for vasospasm were randomized
   to goal HGB concentration of at least 10 or 11.5 g/dl. We obtained
   blinded clinical outcomes at 14 days (NIH Stroke Scale and modified
   Rankin Scale, mRS), 28 days (mRS), and 3 months (mRS), and blinded
   interpretation of brain MRI for cerebral infarction at 14 days. This
   trial is registered atwww.stroketrials. Results Forty-four patients were
   randomized. Patients with goal HGB 11.5 g/dl received more PRBC units
   per transfusion {[}1 (1-2) vs. 1 (1-1), P < 0.001] and more total PRBC
   units {[}3 (2-4) vs. 2 (1-3), P = 0.045]. Prospectively defined safety
   endpoints were not different between groups. HGB concentration was
   different between study groups from day 4 onwards. The number of
   cerebral infarctions on MRI (6 of 20 vs. 9 of 22), NIH Stroke Scale
   scores at 14 days {[}1 (0-9.75) vs. 2 (0-16)], and rates of independence
   on the mRS at 14 days (65\% vs. 44\%) and 28 days (80\% vs. 67\%) were
   similar, but favored higher goal HGB (P > 0.1 for all).
   Higher goal hemoglobin in patients with SAH seems to be safe and
   feasible. A phase III trial of goal HGB after SAH is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this paper was to collect feedback on a specialist
   parent-infant psychiatric service in terms of client satisfaction with
   inpatient treatment, and the impact on health outcomes of providing
   written information about available support options in the community
   following discharge.
   Methods: Women (n = 37) from consecutive admissions between January 2006
   and December 2007 were contacted by telephone and administered a service
   quality evaluation questionnaire.
   Results: Women were happy with the quality of inpatient care provided
   but suggested areas of improvement included continuity of staff during
   the inpatient stay and better communication between inpatient and
   outpatient services post-discharge. At discharge, women were not
   confident with their ability in coping with motherhood but confidence
   with parenting skills increased post-discharge. Use of recommended
   post-discharge community support and/or health services was poor.
   Conclusion: As adherence with discharge recommendations was less than
   ideal, greater involvement of primary/community health care
   professionals, and active participation of clients and carers, in
   discharge planning is required. Increased emphasis on the practical
   skills of motherhood as well as opportunities to develop the
   mother-infant relationship may assist mothers in gaining confidence to
   interact with their baby and pick up infant cues.}},

   between the high-temperature tetragonal (HIT) and the low-temperature

   substitution by Ce ion, x dependence of the critical temperature T-c
   showed a dip at x = 0.115 and a maximum at x = 0.15. The dip structure
   shifts to x = 0.125 and the T-c maximum shifts to x = 0.16 for
   La1.99-xSrxCe0.01 CuO4. On the other hand, x dependence of the
   structural phase transition temperature T-d1 was hardly affected by the
   Ce substitution. These results indicate that the Ce substitution for the

Abstract = {{Background The seventh edition of TNM classification for non-small cell
   lung cancer (NSCLC) has been approved Vascular invasion has been
   reported as being a strong risk factor, therefore, we reviewed the
   impact of vascular invasion on new TNM classification
   Methods We reviewed patients with completely resected NSCLC without
   lymph node metastasis treated at our institute between January 1993 and
   December 2003 Vascular invasion was examined using Victoria blue-van
   Gieson stains performed in maximum cut sections of tumor Correlation
   between vascular invasion and other clinicopathologic factors, such as
   age, sex, histology, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels,
   smoking habitation, and T descriptors, were assessed In addition, we
   evaluated the impact of vascular invasion on survival
   Results A total of 826 patients were analyzed Median age was 65 years
   (range, 32-86) Thirty-two percent of patients were >70 years, 44\% were
   women, 78\% had adenocarcinoma, 41\% were never smokers, 39\% smoked >30
   pack-years, and 31\% had elevated serum CEA levels Vascular invasion was
   detected in 279 patients (33 8\%) and more was observed in patients who
   were male, did not have adenocarcinoma, were smokers, and had elevated
   CEA levels Positive vascular invasion was significantly correlated with
   worse prognosis compared with negative (5-year survival, 90 5\% vs 71
   0\%, P < 001) This trend was observed in each subgroup of T1a (92 9\% vs
   72 5\%, P < 001), T1b (89 7\% vs 772\%, P = 015), and T2a (86 3\% vs 65
   6\%, P < 001)

Abstract = {{P-31 NMR was performed on the normal state in the newly discovered iron
   pnictide superconductor BaFe2(As0.67P0.33)(2) with maximum T-c of 30 K.
   The Knight shift is temperature-independent while the nuclear
   spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature (T-1 T)(-1) exhibits
   a more than twofold increase on cooling. This contrasting behavior
   clearly indicates the development of low-lying antiferrornagnetic
   fluctuations in BaFe2(As0.67P0.33)(2) as observed in (Ba1-xKx)Fe2As2.
   The observed low-lying antiferromagnetic fluctuations may be universal
   in optimally doped ``122{''} superconductors, in contrast to ``1111{''}
   superconductors. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the biomechanical function of
   anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) remnants in anteroposterior and
   rotational knee stability in patients with a complete ACL injury.
   Methods: ACL remnants were classified into 5 morphologic patterns: group
   1, bridging between the posterior cruciate ligament and tibia; group 2,
   bridging between the intercondylar notch and tibia; group 3, partial
   rupture of the posterolateral bundle; group 4, partial rupture of the
   anteromedial bundle; and group 5, no substantial ACL remnants. The
   decision of whether the remaining bundle represented partial or complete
   rupture of the ACL was made based on physical, magnetic resonance
   imaging, and arthroscopic findings in a comprehensive manner. Patients
   in groups 1 (n = 18) and 2 (n = 12) underwent intraoperative arthrometry
   with a navigation system before and immediately after resection of the
   ACL remnant. The effects of chronicity (duration between injury and
   surgery) and ACL remnant pattern on changes in knee laxity after
   debridement of the ACL remnant were investigated. Results: Chronicity
   had a significant effect on changes in anteroposterior knee laxity
   evaluated at 30 degrees of knee flexion after resection of the ACL
   remnant (change in laxity of 2.22 mm for chronicity <= 1 year and 0.17
   mm for chronicity >1 year). Chronicity did not influence changes in
   rotational knee stability after resection of the remnant. There were no
   significant differences between groups 1 and 2 with regard to any of the
   evaluated changes in knee stability. Conclusions: In groups 1 and 2 ACL
   remnants contributed to anteroposterior knee stability evaluated at 30
   degrees of knee flexion for up to 1 year after injury, beyond which this
   biomechanical function was lost. Chronicity and remnant pattern did not
   influence changes in rotational knee stability after resection of the
   remnant. Level of Evidence: Level III, diagnostic study of
   nonconsecutive patients.}},

Abstract = {{An ab initio downfolding method is formulated to construct
   low-dimensional models for correlated electrons. In addition to band
   downfolding by a constrained random phase approximation formulated for
   3D models, screening away from the target layer (chain) is further
   involved. Eliminating the off-target degrees of freedom, namely,
   dimensional downfolding, yields ab initio low-dimensional models. The
   method is applied to derive a 2D model for the layered superconductor
   LaFeAsO, where interlayer screening crucially makes the effective
   interaction short-ranged and reduces the onsite Coulomb interactions by
   10-20\% compared with the 3D model for the five iron-3d orbitals.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Long-term clinical outcomes of diabetes mellitus (DM)
   patients who underwent drug-eluting stent deployment has not well
   investigated.
   Methods and Results: A total of 2,050 cases were enrolled consecutively
   from 50 sites in Japan into the Cypher stent Japan Post-Marketing
   Surveillance (Cypher J-PMS) registry, and the 3-year outcomes of DM
   patients were analyzed. Subjects were divided into 2 groups based on the
   treatment of DM (insulin-treated diabetes (IT) group, n=207, and non
   insulin-treated diabetes (NIT) group, n=682). Major adverse cardiac
   event (MACE) rates in the IT group and the NIT group were 260\% and
   145\% at 3 years, respectively (P<0 001). There were no significant
   differences in stent thrombosis rates (definite and probable by Academic
   Research Consortium (ARC) definition) (0\% and 1.08\%, respectively).
   Multivariate analysis suggested that hemodialysis and insulin-treated DM
   were independent predictors for MACE, and insulin-treated DM,
   hemodialysis and long lesions were strong independent predictors for
   target-lesion revascularization (TLR).
   Conclusions: Hemodialysis and insulin-treated DM were strong independent
   predictors of mortality and TLR in DM patients. These results might
   suggest that special attention to patients with hemodialysis and
   insulin-treated DM is warranted in the setting of sirolimus-eluting
   stent deployment for DM patients. (Circ J 2010; 74: 2592-2597)}},

Abstract = {{The Epstein-Barr virus BMRF1 DNA polymerase processivity factor, which
   is essential for viral genome replication, exists mainly as a C-shaped
   head-to-head homodimer but partly forms a ring-shaped tetramer through
   tail-to-tail association. Based on its molecular structure, several
   BMRF1 mutant viruses were constructed to examine their influence on
   viral replication. The R256E virus, which has a severely impaired
   capacity for DNA binding and polymerase processivity, failed to form
   replication compartments, resulting in interference of viral
   replication, while the C95E mutation, which impairs head-to-head contact
   in vitro, unexpectedly hardly affected the viral replication. Also,
   surprisingly, replication of the C206E virus, which is expected to have
   impairment of tail-to-tail contact, was severely restricted, although
   the mutant protein possesses the same in vitro biochemical activities as
   the wild type. Since the tail-to-tail contact surface is smaller than
   that of the head-to-head contact area, its contribution to ring
   formation might be essential for viral replication.}},

   for critical media literacy, informed by critical educational theories
   developed by Paulo Freire, Henry Giroux, and others. Third, it aims to
   identify some core areas of critical media literacy by which to
   reconfigure mass communication as an interdisciplinary academic field
   within the larger context of democracy. Ultimately, the article makes
   the case for repositioning critical media literacy as pedagogy of

Abstract = {{Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), particularly pulmonary
   fibrosis, is a serious clinical concern and myofibroblasts have been
   suggested to have a major role, with it recently being revealed that
   some of these myofibroblasts are derived from lung epithelial cells
   through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we
   examined the EMT-inducing abilities of drugs known to induce ILD
   clinically. EMT-like phenotypes were induced by A771726, an active
   metabolite of leflunomide having an inhibitory effect on dihydroorotate
   dehydrogenase (DHODH). Smad-interacting protein 1 (a transcription
   factor regulating EMT) and the Notch-signaling pathway but not
   transforming growth factor-beta was shown to be involved in
   A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes. When the cultures were supplemented
   with exogenous uridine, the A771726-induced EMT-like phenotypes and
   activation of the Notch-signaling pathway disappeared. Similarly, an
   A771726 analog without inhibitory activity on DHODH produced no
   induction, suggesting that this process is mediated through the
   inhibition of DHODH. In vivo, administration of leflunomide stimulated
   bleomycin-induced EMT-like phenomenon in pulmonary tissue, and
   exacerbated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, both of which were
   suppressed by coadministration of uridine. Taken together, these
   findings suggest that leflunomide-dependent exacerbation of
   bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis is mediated by stimulation of EMT
   of lung epithelial cells, providing the first evidence that drug-induced
   pulmonary fibrosis involves EMT of these cells. Cell Death and

Abstract = {{Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are a frequent occurrence in the
   presence of ischemic heart disease. A very high PVC load can be
   symptomatic or occasionally result in a cardiomyopathy (CMP). Treatment

   RFA has been successful in treating PVCs in symptomatic patients or in
   the presence of unexplained CMP. Ranolazine is a piperazine derivative
   used for treating chronic stable angina. It also has antiarrhythmic
   properties. We report a patient with ischemic CMP, symptomatic PVCs, and
   monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) despite attempts to control
   symptoms with two antiarrhythmic drugs. Initiation of ranolazine led to
   marked reduction in PVCs along with control of VT and symptoms. (PACE

Title = {{Small-scale convection signatures associated with a strong plage solar
   magnetic field}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{524}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Context. Solar convection in a strong plage, in which the magnetic field
   is vertical and strong over extended regions, but much weaker than in
   the umbrae of large sunspots, has so far not been well studied. This has
   been mostly because of a lack of spectropolarimetric data at adequate
   spatial resolution. The combination of a large solar telescope, such as
   the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, adaptive optics, powerful image
   reconstruction techniques, and a high-fidelity imaging
   spectropolarimeter is, however, capable of producing such data.
   Aims. In this work, we study and quantify the properties of strong-field
   small-scale convection and compare these observed properties with those
   predicted by numerical simulations.
   Methods. We analyze spectropolarimetric 630.25 nm data from a unipolar
   ephemeral region near the Sun center. We use line-of-sight velocities
   and magnetic field measurements obtained with Milne-Eddington inversion
   techniques along with measured continuum intensities and Stokes V
   amplitude asymmetry at a spatial resolution of 0.'' 15 to establish
   statistical relations between the measured quantities. We also study
   these properties for different types of distinct magnetic features, such
   as micropores, bright points, ribbons, flowers, and strings.
   Results. We present the first direct observations of a small-scale
   granular magneto-convection pattern within extended regions of a strong
   (more than 600 G on average) magnetic field. Along the boundaries of the
   flux concentrations, we see mostly downflows and asymmetric Stokes V
   profiles, consistent with synthetic line profiles calculated from MHD
   simulations. We note the frequent occurrence of bright downflows along
   these boundaries. In the interior of the flux concentrations, we observe
   an up/down flow pattern that we associate with small-scale
   magnetoconvection, appearing similar to that of field-free granulation
   but with scales 4 times smaller. Measured rms velocities are 70\% of
   those of nearby field-free granulation, even though the average
   radiative flux is not lower than that of the quiet Sun. The interiors of
   these flux concentrations are dominated by upflows.}},

Abstract = {{The carrot (Daucus carota L.) is a plant of the Umbelliferae family. It
   produces an aromatic and edible root, and is one of the most widely
   cultivated vegetable in Brazil. It represents the main source of
   plant-origin, pro-vitamin A carotenoids, especially alpha and
   beta-carotene, and is also a great source of dietary fiber, antioxidants
   and minerals. This study aimed to evaluate two methods of extraction of
   beta-carotene, supercritical fluid (SFE) and conventional, and to
   examine the proximate composition of the carrot in nature. The contents
   of beta-carotene obtained by SFE and by conventional extraction were
   2,457 and 2,455 mu g/100g, respectively. The average values found for
   the dry-matter of the carrot were: dry matter = 8.9\%; ether extract =
   0.29\%; ashes = 8.11\%, crude fiber = 14.57\%, crude protein = 6,4\%,
   non-nitrogen extract = 6.3\% and caloric value = 27.7 kcal. It is
   concluded that the extraction of carotenoids using the supercritical
   fluid is a viable separation technique since this fluid is inert and
   does not generate waste or final environmental waste. It can be
   concluded from the levels found that carrots are good sources of fiber,
   present high moisture content and low fat, ash and calorific value.}},

Abstract = {{In the present investigation a novel design algorithm is proposed for
   evaporative fluid coolers (EFCs) and closed circuit cooling towers. The
   principal of this study is to derive a relationship among heat transfer
   coefficients, pressure drops, heat transfer area, and mass transfer
   coefficient. Using maximum allowable pressure drops in this algorithm
   leads to minimize the required heat transfer area and a straight forward
   performance appraisal of EFC can be observed. It is revealed that the
   novel design algorithm can successfully predicts the design outputs

Abstract = {{Dopaminergic D1/D5-receptor-mediated processes are important for certain
   forms of memory as well as for a cellular model of memory, hippocampal
   long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
   D1/D5-receptor function is required for the induction of the protein
   synthesis-dependent maintenance of CA1-LTP (L-LTP) through activation of
   the cAMP/PKA-pathway. In earlier studies we had reported a synergistic
   interaction of D1/D5-receptor function and N-methyl-D-aspartate
   (NMDA)-receptors for L-LTP. Furthermore, we have found the requirement
   of the atypical protein kinase C isoform, protein kinase M zeta (PKM
   zeta) for conventional electrically induced L-LTP, in which PKM zeta has
   been identified as a LTP-specific plasticity-related protein (PRP) in
   apical CA1-dendrites. Here, we investigated whether the dopaminergic
   pathway activates PKM zeta. We found that application of dopamine (DA)
   evokes a protein synthesis-dependent LTP that requires synergistic
   NMDA-receptor activation and protein synthesis in apical CA1-dendrites.
   We identified PKM zeta as a DA-induced PRP, which exerted its action at
   activated synaptic inputs by processes of synaptic tagging.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To describe what and how pediatric residents in Massachusetts
   are taught about children and youth with special health care needs
   (CYSHCN) and the medical home.
   PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Faculty members and residents at
   Massachusetts' 5 pediatric residency programs were interviewed to
   identify current curricula and teaching methods related to care of
   CYSHCN. In addition, residents were surveyed to quantify these concepts.
   RESULTS: Thirty-one faculty members and 25 residents were interviewed.
   Most exposure to CYSHCN was reported to occur in inpatient settings.
   However, most formal teaching about CYSHCN was described as occurring in
   the ambulatory setting. Promising educational strategies included home
   and community visits, inclusion of CYSHCN in resident continuity panels,
   and simulation and role-playing. Overall, the programs had little
   training emphasis on the lives and needs of CYSHCN and their families
   outside the hospital setting. Twenty (80\%) of the residents interviewed
   completed the written survey instrument. They noted a high degree of
   comfort in caring for CYSHCN in various settings and involving families
   in decision-making about their child's care but expressed less comfort
   in identifying community resources and collaborating with community
   agencies and schools.
   CONCLUSIONS: Programs offer a variety of successful educational and
   clinical experiences related to the medical home and CYSHCN. The results
   of our study indicate that residents and faculty members believe that
   residents would benefit from more formal training opportunities to learn
   directly from families and community representatives about caring for
   CYSHCN. Pediatrics 2010; 126: S183-S189}},

   incompatible with well-motivated conditions on phrase structure. The
   alternative we develop is a local encoding mediated by percolation of
   selectional requirements comparable to the slash features of HPSG. The
   proposed local encoding of movement is superior to the copy theory in at
   least three respects: (i) it explains why movement must target a
   c-commanding position, (ii) it can account for surprising restrictions
   on scope reconstruction, and (iii) it can capture patterns of
   interaction between different types of movement. In the first two cases,
   the copy theory falls short of the mark; in the third, the theory
   proposed here seems more parsimonious.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The forest-sagebrush ecotone is characterized by a more arid climate
   than forested regions; therefore, establishing fire histories using
   traditional methods (e.g. fire-scars from trees, charcoal in lake
   sediments) is problematic. This study uses radiocarbon dating of
   charcoal preserved in alluvial deposits to reconstruct a record of fire
   and geomorphic response in southwestern Idaho. Samples indicate three
   primary periods of fire-related activity: 4400-4000, 2000-1400, and
   650-400 cal. yr BP. Charcoal macrofossil identification and comparison
   with other regional records indicate this area has likely alternated
   between a `fuel-limited' system (fires limited by lack of fuels), and a
   `moisture-limited' system (fires limited by too much moisture) with
   changes in Holocene climate. Over the past similar to 2000 yr, samples
   from this site indicate most fires occurred during wetter times than the
   record average. During overall wetter periods, (e. g. `Little Ice Age'
   (LIA); 600-100 cal. yr BP) tree density may have increased, and fires
   occurred during intervals of relative drought. During times of prolonged
   drought (e. g. `Medieval Climate Anomaly' (MCA); 1025-650 cal. yr BP)
   fire was recorded during a wetter interval. After similar to 600 cal. yr
   BP, fire activity was similar to alluvial charcoal records of
   low-intensity fires in a nearby ponderosa pine-dominated drainage, and
   sagebrush is common in charcoal samples. Both the ponderosa site and the
   Wood Creek site show low fire activity in similar to 6500-5000 cal yr
   BP; climatically, similar to 7-5 ka appears to correspond with regional
   records of drought. This work provides a unique record of fire in a
   semi-arid ecotone where (1) few records exist because of the paucity of
   dating sites, and (2) climatic sensitivity is likely enhanced.}},

   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) programme of active surveillance plus
   decolonization with the current Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
   strategy of active surveillance alone, as well as a common strategy of
   no surveillance. A decision-analytical model was developed for an
   inpatient stay time horizon, using the VHA's perspective. Model inputs
   were taken from published literature where available, and supplemented
   with expert opinion when necessary. Effectiveness outcomes were
   hospital-acquired MRSA infections and deaths avoided. One-way and
   two-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed.
   In the base-case analysis, the strategy of active surveillance plus
   decolonization dominated (i.e. lower cost and greater effectiveness)
   both the comparison strategies of active surveillance and no
   surveillance. In addition, the active surveillance strategy dominated
   the strategy of no surveillance. One-way and two-way sensitivity
   analyses demonstrated that at low levels of direct benefit of
   decolonization (1-4\%), the strategy of active surveillance plus
   decolonization would no longer be dominant. In the probabilistic
   sensitivity analysis, active surveillance plus decolonization dominated
   both the other two strategies, and the active surveillance strategy
   dominated no surveillance in all of 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. These
   results provide a strong economic argument for adding an MRSA
   decolonization protocol to the current VHA active surveillance strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary biology is experiencing an exceptional process of revision
   and outreach because of the 200-anniversary if the birth of Charles
   Darwin. As a consequence, the study of organic evolution and also its
   teaching are being discussed at several levels, by evolutionary
   biologists, biologists and scholars outside evolutionary biology and by
   the general public. In this scenario, a didactic explanation of how
   biologists address evolutionary research in real populations seems to be
   useful. Using actual research examples, here I tried to outline how the
   classic theory (termed here as the ``basic scheme{''}) is useful to
   answer relevant questions in biology and how a less dogmatic paradigm
   (or a more versatile one) would be needed when dealing with the most
   recent and extravagant cases of gene, genotype, phenotype and
   environment interactions. Specifically, I used three in-extenso examples
   of research driven by hypothesis-testing: (1) the changes in genetic
   architecture induced by sexuality in a cyclically parthenogenetic
   insect; (2) the test of the energetic definition of fitness through
   phenotypic selection studies; and (3) the assessment of the underlying
   causes of character displacement in Darwin finches. In the former two
   cases, it is argued that the basic scheme is useful and sufficient for
   testing relevant evolutionary hypotheses. In the third case, it is
   argued that something else is needed to explain the observed genetic
   variation that Geospiza species exhibit in Daphne major island
   (Galapagos). Finally, I outline some ``extravagant{''} cases biological
   entities interacting, such as horizontal gene transfer, epigenetic
   inheritance, adaptive anticipatory conditioning, evolutionary
   capacitance and niche construction. This ``post-modern{''} biology has
   been seriously proposed and demonstrated to be widespread in nature,
   which would justify an extended evolutionary synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{The PKD/Mhm(cy/+) rat is a widely used animal model for the study of
   human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease one of the most
   common genetic disorders affecting one in 1000 individuals We identified
   a new gene Anks6 which is mutated (Anks6((p R823W))) m PKD/Mhm(cy/+)
   rats The evidence for a causal link between Anks6((p R823W)) and
   cystogenesis is still lacking, and the function of Anks6 is presently
   unknown This study presents a novel transgenic rat model that
   overexpresses the mutated 2 8 kb Anks6((p R823W)) cDNA m the renal
   tubular epithelium The transgenic Anks6((p R823W)) acts in a dominant
   negative fashion and causes a predictable poly cystic phenotype that
   largely mimics the general characteristics of the PKD/Mhm(cy/+) rats
   Cyst development is accompanied by enhanced c myc expression and
   continuous proliferation apoptosis and de differentiation of the renal
   tubular epithelium as well as by a lack of translational up regulation
   of p21 during aging Using Northern blot analysis and in situ
   hybridization studies we identified the first 10 days of age as the
   period during which transgene expression precedes and initiates cystic
   growth Thus we not only provide the first in vivo evidence for a causal
   link between the novel Anks6((p R823W)) gene mutation and polycystic
   kidney disease but we also developed a new transgenic rat model that
   will serve as an important resource for further exploration of the still
   unknown function of Anks6 (Am J Pathol 2010 177 3000-3009 DOI 10

Journal = {{CURRENT GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{584-590}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) is the most recently
   described member of the Rel family of transcription factors, including
   NF-kappa B and NFAT1-4, which play central roles in inducible gene
   expression during the immune response. NFAT5 was initially described to
   drive osmoprotective gene expression in renal medullary cells, which are
   routinely faced by high extracellular osmolalities. Recent data however
   indicate profound biological importance of the mammalian osmotic stress
   response in view of NFAT5 dependent gene regulation in non-renal
   tissues. In mononuclear cells and epithelial cells, NFAT5 stimulates the
   expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines during elevated ambient
   tonicity. Accordingly, compared to plasma, the interstitial tonicity of
   lymphoid organs like spleen and thymus and that of liver is
   substantially hypertonic under physiological conditions. In addition,
   anisotonic disorders (hypernatremia, diabetes mellitus, dehydration)
   entail systemic hyperosmolality, and, in inflammatory disorders, the
   skin, intestine, and cornea are sites of local hyperosmolality. This
   article summarizes the current knowledge regarding systemic and local
   osmotic stress in anisotonic and inflammatory disorders in view of NFAT5
   activation and regulation, and NFAT5 dependent cytokine production.}},

   of different meditation practices. We evaluated 12 advanced meditators
   and 14 non-meditators with cerebral blood flow (CBF) SPECT imaging at
   rest. Images were analyzed with both region of interest and statistical
   parametric mapping. The CBF of long-term meditators was significantly
   higher (p < .05) compared to non-meditators in the prefrontal cortex,
   parietal cortex, thalamus, putamen, caudate, and midbrain. There was
   also a significant difference in the thalamic laterality with long-term
   meditators having greater asymmetry. The observed changes associated
   with long-term meditation appear in structures that underlie the
   attention network and also those that relate to emotion and autonomic

Abstract = {{Reconstructive surgery of the midface using facial artery perforator
   (FAP) flaps is being used more frequently now as it has been reported to
   provide better aesthetic results and reduce a traditional two-stage
   procedure to a one-stage technique. However, the wide acceptance of this
   approach is limited by a poor understanding of the anatomy associated
   with this technique. This was investigated through a cadaveric study.
   The facial artery (FA) of 16 cadaveric half-faces were each identified,
   cannulated with coloured latex and then dissected to give an accurate
   and quantified description of FA perforating branches. A lateral-view
   picture of each specimen was taken and analysed using ImageJ 1.42q.
   Cadaveric dissections showed that each hemiface could be regarded as a
   single entity. The values of the means were as follows: FA length = 116
   +/- 22 mm, FA diameter = 2.62 +/- 0.74 mm, number of FAPs = 4 +/- 2, FAP
   length = 14.12 +/- 3.46 mm and FAP diameter = 0.94 +/- 0.29 mm. A
   reference point, A, where FAPs were consistently found to originate, was
   also identified. Therefore, the FAP flap is a viable and valuable
   addition to plastic reconstructive techniques. The localisation of point
   A with precise measurements can facilitate the design and use of such
   FAP flaps for the reconstruction of nasal, as well as perinasal and
   perioral defects. (C) 2010 British Association of Plastic,

Abstract = {{Some complex measures based on recurrence plots give evidence about

   transition,{''} Phys. Rev. E 78, 066206 (2008)]. In this paper, these
   measures are combined with a significance test based on twin surrogates
   to identify such a transition in a fourth-order Lorenz-like system,
   which is able to pass from a hyperchaotic to a chaotic behavior for
   increasing values of a single parameter. A circuit analog of the
   mathematical model has been designed and implemented and the robustness
   of the recurrence-based method on experimental data has been tested. In
   both the numerical and experimental cases, the combination of the
   recurrence measures and the significance test allows to clearly identify
   the hyperchaos-chaos transition. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The Fourier transform microwave spectrum of isopropenyl acetate

   The experimental data as well as quantum chemical calculations have
   shown that this molecule exists as only one conformer of C-1 symmetry in
   which the vinyl group is tilted by an angle of approximately 70 against
   the plane containing the ester group Due to internal rotation of the
   acetyl methyl group we found large A-E splittings of all lines (from a
   few MHz up to 1 GHz or more) We also were able to resolve the splitting
   due to the internal rotation of the second isopropenyl methyl group The
   A species lines split into doublets and the E species lines into
   triplets These splittings vary from 10 kHz up to 1 MHz much smaller than
   the splatings due to the acetyl methyl group By analyzing the spectrum
   with the program Xiam a torsional barriers of 135 3498(38) and 711 7(73)
   cm(-1) for the acetyl methyl group and the isopropenyl methyl group were

Abstract = {{Robust linear regression is one of the most popular problems in the
   robust statistics community. It is often conducted via least trimmed
   squares, which minimizes the sum of the k smallest squared residuals.
   Least trimmed squares has desirable properties and forms the basis on
   which several recent robust methods are built, but is very
   computationally expensive due to its combinatorial nature. It is proven
   that the least trimmed squares problem is equivalent to a concave
   minimization problem under a simple linear constraint set. The ``maximum
   trimmed squares{''}, an ``almost complementary{''} problem which
   maximizes the sum of the q smallest squared residuals, in direct pursuit
   of the set of outliers rather than the set of clean points, is
   introduced. Maximum trimmed squares (MTS) can be formulated as a
   semi-definite programming problem, which can be solved efficiently in
   polynomial time using interior point methods. In addition, under
   reasonable assumptions, the maximum trimmed squares problem is
   guaranteed to identify outliers, no mater how extreme they are. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The Adria domain and the neighbouring chains (Alps, Apennines,
   Dinarides) are presented with images and interpretative models
   indicating their main crustal characteristics as revealed by the
   geophysical prospecting (gravity, receiver functions, wide-angle seismic
   and near vertical reflections). The collision with the adjacent blocks
   has implied deformations of the lower crust and of the crust-mantle
   boundary with accretionary wedging of slabs of lithosphere, entire crust
   or upper crust, respectively. The position of the main decoupling levels
   within the subducting lithosphere like the Sub Tauern Ramp in the
   Eastern Alps is the key parameter for the post-collision evolution.
   Decoupling levels at the top of the lower crust or at the base of the
   upper crust also might have played a dominant role in the orogenic
   movements controlling the present-day crustal architecture. According to
   the recent acquisitions a triple junction among Adria, Pannonian and
   European crusts is proposed near Katschberg, at the eastern edge of the
   Tauern Window, with Pannonian acting as upper plate in the collision
   with Europe and with Adria: Europe underthrusts Adria and Pannonian and
   Adria underthrusts Pannonian fragments. Finally, Adria underthrusts the
   Apennines along the western side of the Adriatic Sea. The paper revisits
   the geophysical data (mainly reflection and refraction seismic) to
   evidence resolution and penetration limits in the exploration of crustal
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the increasing world population growth and competition for space,
   especially in bigger cities, the construction of subsurface civil
   engineering structures has become unavoidable. Safety, both during and
   after the construction of such structures, is of paramount importance to
   civil engineers. One of the main challenges in securing this safety is
   presented in the form of groundwater flow and its control. In this
   paper, the state of the art techniques for controlling groundwater flow
   during underground excavation are outlined with case studies from some
   construction sites in Japan. It needs to be pointed out that no single
   technique is adequate for controlling groundwater flow at an excavation
   site. Also, not so much attention has been paid to the designed
   groundwater level, which plays a major role in the stability of the
   structure after construction. In addition, groundwater conservation has
   yet to be considered in the designs of such structures. It is necessary
   for by-passes for groundwater flow to be constructed and monitored over
   the long term to assess their performances.}},

Journal = {{CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{845-850}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{P>Purpose:
   To evaluate visual outcome and factors affecting visual outcome in
   herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO).
   Methods:
   A prospective, longitudinal, observational study was undertaken in 64
   consecutive patients with HZO presenting within 72 h of rash onset.
   Patients underwent detailed ophthalmological and dermatological
   examinations at presentation, with follow up at first, second and fourth
   weeks and third and sixth months. All patients received both systemic
   and topical acyclovir. The main outcome measure was best-corrected
   visual acuity at 6 months' follow up. Local and systemic factors were
   correlated with visual outcome using univariate and multivariate
   analyses.
   Results:
   Overall visual outcome was good, with 36/64 (56.3\%) patients having a
   visual acuity of 6/6 or better. Mild visual loss occurred in 22/64
   (34.3\%), moderate loss in 3/64 (4.7\%) and severe loss in 3/64 (4.7\%);
   moderate to severe visual loss was due to severe uveitis (2),
   neurotrophic keratitis (1) and cataract (3). Increasing age (P = 0.04),
   positive Hutchinson sign (P = 0.001), absent corneal sensation (P =
   0.01), corneal epithelial lesions (P = 0.03) and uveitis (P < 0.001)
   were significantly associated with visual loss. Uveitis was found to be
   the best predictor of visual loss in HZO on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusion:
   The overall visual outcome is good in HZO patients receiving antiviral
   therapy. Hutchinson's sign and anterior uveitis were found to be strong
   predictors of visual loss in HZO. Presence of these predictors calls for
   close monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{(Contribution to the identification of spores belonging to Fungi Kingdom
   in the atmosphere of La Plata, Argentina). Based on the aeromycological
   analysis of La Plata city, artificial Morphological Groups of fungal
   spores were defined. This study is a methodological contribution to the
   identification and counting of a fraction of the atmospheric micobiota.
   For the definition of groups, the criteria of Saccardo (1886) were taken
   into account and the groupings created by Diaz et al. (1998) and Aira et
   al. (2005) have been reformulated. Four new groups have been created and
   other sporal types have been incorporated to previous classifications.
   Each of them includes 2 to 6 spore types belonging to the Phylum
   Zygomycota, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota and their anamorphs, assigned

Abstract = {{We propose a wireless access scheme which is based on a channel
   reservation sharing method for a group of mobile users. This proposed
   scheme exploits the mobility diversity of the mobile users in order to
   reduce the cost of wireless access. Another aspect of the proposed
   scheme is contention resolution among mobile users belonging to the same
   group in order to access the reserved channel while they are at the same
   location. A game theoretic model is developed for this wireless access
   scheme through which the rational mobile users can minimize the cost of
   wireless access while satisfying their quality-of-service (QoS)
   requirements (e. g., packet loss rate and average packet waiting time).
   The proposed game model consists of two interrelated formulations: a
   coalitional game for channel reservation and a stochastic game for
   channel access. The stable coalitional structure and equilibrium channel
   access policy are obtained from this game model.}},

   factor tg delta for various electric field frequencies and at different
   temperatures. The results show that the dielectric properties are
   heavily influenced by the filler content with very high registered
   values in the case of low frequency electric fields and high
   temperatures. It can be ascertained that samples having a polypropylene
   matrix have superior electric properties than those having a
   polyethylene matrix. Finally, the opportunity for utilization within low

Abstract = {{Background: Recent reports on laparoscopic surgery for urachal anomalies
   have not described any techniques to restore the natural appearance of
   the umbilicus. In this report, we present a simple technique that
   enables complete resection of urachal anomalies while preserving the
   natural appearance of the umbilicus.
   Materials and Methods: Laparoscopic excision of symptomatic urachal
   anomalies was performed for 4 men and 2 women. After dissecting the
   urachal lesion along the preperitoneal plane toward the umbilicus, the
   cephalic side of the lesion was ligated and the skin at the base of the
   umbilicus was divided while compressing the anterior abdominal wall to
   ensure complete removal of the lesion.
   Results: The laparoscopic procedure was successfully completed with
   minimal blood loss, and the umbilicus could be restored to its natural
   appearance in all the cases.
   Conclusions: This is the first report to describe a procedure for
   restoring the natural appearance of the umbilicus. This simple,
   alternative approach yields better cosmetic results and, therefore, will
   be useful, especially in younger patients.}},

   QuickBayt(R) (34\% +/- 3.0\%) was not significantly higher than Agita(R)
   (29\% +/- 1.3\%) (t-test, P>0.05). Agita(R) (101 +/- 5.7 flies) was
   significantly more attractive to flies than QuickBayt(R) (76 +/- 4.8
   flies) and the sugar solution (49 +/- 7.2) (one-way ANOVA, P<0.05). The
   PCB and SCB applications were significantly more attractive to filth
   flies than WPD and SPD (One-way ANOVA, P<0.05), however differences in
   KD\% were not significantly different (One-way ANOVA, P>0.05). The two

Abstract = {{Prevention of the risk of recurrence of depressive episodes is a dynamic
   process that begins early in the management. Although complete remission
   is obtained for almost half of the treated depressive episodes, a
   heuristic conceptual thinking apprehends depression as a potentially
   chronic disorder when considering relapse and recurrence prevention.
   Multiple actions of care have to be initiated. They are formalised, but
   also adjustable to the needs of a critical management period throughout
   the follow-up. These actions include the prescription of an
   antidepressant at an effective dosage. They also consider the
   preventative and therapeutic impact of psychotherapy. The search for
   residual symptoms of depression is the rule, and addition of other
   medication should be considered if needed. These recommendations are
   evidence-based in the context of recurrence prevention. Nevertheless,
   many other initiatives are equally important recommendations in terms of
   therapeutic impact. Thus, rigorous evaluation of the initial
   symptomatology, promotion of information on disease, health-care
   advices, as well as implementation of family and other networks are
   good-practices. Such actions should be conducted in a relationship based
   on a therapeutic alliance. These elements need to be adjusted and
   contextualised in line with the Health System, mode of medical practice
   and unique style of the therapist. Proactive and sustainable
   implementations of these guidelines are required in the context of a
   unique and open therapeutic relationship for both therapist and patient.}},

Abstract = {{Study Objective: To determine the prevalence, pattern of menstrual
   disorders, treatment practices, and the effect of menstrual disorders on
   school attendance in adolescent school girls in Enugu, Nigeria.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: Randomly selected secondary schools.
   Participants: Postmenarcheal adolescent school girls aged 10-19 years.
   Methodology: Pretested, semi-structured questionnaires were used to
   survey 500 consenting students. The main outcome measures were menstrual
   disorders. Data was analyzed using SPSS for windows version 15. Data was
   compared using chi-square test and P <= 0.05 was regarded as
   statistically significant.
   Results: Four hundred ninety-five students responded giving a response
   rate of 99\%. The mean age of the girls was 14.9 +/- 1.7 years. Most
   were Christians (99.2\%) and their mean age of menarche was 12.7 +/- 1.3
   years. The prevalence of menstrual disorders was 69.4\% and
   dysmenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and short menstrual
   cycles were the commonest disorder. Being older, later age of menarche,
   and being domiciled in the boarding house were significantly associated
   with menstrual disorders (P < 0.05). Dysmenorrhea was responsible for
   the greatest number of school abscences. The mean days of school
   absenteeism was 1.8 +/- 1.2. In 80\% of cases paracetamol, aspirin, or
   piroxican were the drugs used for symptom relief. Only 16.3\% of
   respondents ever consulted a doctor for their menstrual disorders.
   Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of menstrual disorders as well
   as a high rate of non-expert treatment of the disorders. This
   underscores the need for awareness creation. Parents and adolescents
   should consult trained practitioners when significant menstrual disorder
   occurs in order to rule out or treat associated or underlying medical
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives In humans, fetal breathing movements affect blood velocities
   in the umbilical vein and artery, but it is not known whether fetal
   respiratory activity is associated with increased fetal blood flow
   through the placenta. We therefore tested this hypothesis in the present
   study.
   Methods One-hundred and ten women with low-risk singleton pregnancies
   were each examined three times by ultrasound during the second half of
   pregnancy. Fetal heart rate, umbilical artery blood velocity, umbilical
   vein diameter and blood velocity, and umbilical blood flow at the
   placental end were determined during fetal rest and fetal respiratory
   movements.
   Results Based on 330 observations obtained during fetal rest or
   breathing activity, no difference was found in the mean fetal heart rate
   (beats per minute (bpm)) during rest compared with breathing (142 bpm
   vs. 142 bpm, respectively). Although fetal breathing affected the
   umbilical artery waveform, there was no difference in the mean
   time-averaged maximum velocity between rest and breathing: 26.6 (95\%
   CI, 25.1-28.3) cm/s vs. 28.9 (95\% Cl, 27.2-30.7) cm/s, respectively.
   The umbilical vein was 27\% greater in cross-sectional area and the
   blood velocity 9\% higher during breathing, resulting in a 42\% increase
   in mean umbilical blood flow: 121.8 (95\% CI, 109.5-135.0) mL/min at
   rest vs. 173.0 (95\% CI, 158.0-188.6) mL/min during breathing. Venous
   velocity was calculated from recordings of mean duration 3.7 s at rest
   and 6.2 s of respiratory activity. Gestational age did not influence the
   relationship.
   Conclusion Fetal breathing is associated with increased umbilical blood
   flow during the second half of pregnancy. Umbilical vein distension
   during breathing suggests active endocrine regulation. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives: The public health burden of tobacco use is shifting to the
   developing world, and the tobacco industry may apply some of its
   successful marketing tactics, such as allaying health concerns with
   product modifications. This study used standard smoking machine tests to
   examine the extent to which the industry is introducing engineering
   features that reduce tar and nicotine to cigarettes sold in middle- and
   low-income countries.
   Study design: Multicountry observational study.
   Methods: Cigarettes from 10 different countries were purchased in 2005
   and 2007 with low-, middle- and high-income countries identified using
   the World Bank's per capita gross national income metric. Physical
   measurements of each brand were tested, and tobacco moisture and weight,
   paper porosity, filter ventilation and pressure drop were analysed. Tar,
   nicotine and carbon monoxide emission levels were determined for each
   brand using International Organization for Standardization and Canadian
   Intensive methods. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical
   Package for the Social Sciences.
   Results: Among cigarette brands with filters, more brands were
   ventilated in high-income countries compared with middle- and low-
   income countries {[}chi(2)(4) = 25.92, P < 0.001]. Low-income brands
   differed from high- and middle-income brands in engineering features
   such as filter density, ventilation and paper porosity, while tobacco
   weight and density measures separated the middle- and high- income
   groups. Smoke emissions differed across income groups, but these
   differences were largely negated when one accounted for design features.
   Conclusions: This study showed that as a country's income level
   increases, cigarettes become more highly engineered and the emissions
   levels decrease. In order to reduce the burden of tobacco-related
   disease and further effective product regulation, health officials must
   understand cigarette design and function within and between countries.

Abstract = {{Background: For patients with an atrial septal defect and pulmonary
   hypertension it can be difficult to determine whether it is safe to
   intervene. With newer treatments for pulmonary hypertension and
   transcatheter techniques avoiding surgical stressors, it has been hoped
   that we can occlude previously inoperable defects safely.
   Methods: We undertook a subgroup analysis of outcomes for patients with
   mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAp) >= 30 mm Hg from within our
   database of patients undergoing transcatheter ASD closure from 1997 to
   2004.
   Results: Data for 11 patients were reviewed. Mean age of the patients at
   intervention was 38 years (5-69 years). Eight patients have had
   symptomatic improvement with no evidence of progressive pulmonary
   hypertension. There was one death due to unrelated causes. Two patients
   have developed progressive pulmonary vascular disease with one death.
   Conclusions: Despite early symptomatic improvement, adverse outcomes may
   occur in patients with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance undergoing
   transcatheter ASD closure. Careful haemodynamic evaluation is vital.
   Modest elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance and the presence of
   left to right shunt (Qp:Qs > 1.5:1) are reassuring. (Heart, Lung and

Abstract = {{In the modern criminal justice system, adherence to expedience and
   pragmatism have contributed to the prevalence of two practices that have
   questionable constititional bases: plea bargains and postconviction
   civil penalties. Each practice has been challenged in the courts
   individually and has survived judicial scrutiny. And as these two
   practices have become more commonplace, their continued intersection and
   interaction has become increasingly inevitable; however, even a
   superficial analysis of this combination of plea bargaining and
   postconviction civil penalties demonstrates that the constitutionality
   of the two practices can no longer he justified by an uneasy compromise
   with practicality.
   This Comment is intended to illustrate the nature and the extent of the
   intersecting practices of plea bargaining and postconviction civil
   penalties. Furthermore, by embracing the contract-based approach to the
   theoretical justification of plea bargaining, this Comment argues that
   retroactive postconviction civil penalty statutes in particular the most
   recently enacted federal sexual offender registration and notification
   law should not survive a due process challenge and accordingly should
   not apply to plea-convicted defendants. At the very least, this Comment
   hopes to demonstrate that the individually debatable practices of plea
   bargaining and postconviction civil penalties have grown and interwoven
   to such an extent that, in light of the basic dictates of fairness and
   due process, the state has finally gone too far.}},

   PHD/bromodomain protein LIN-49, is required to first initiate and then
   actively maintain lateralized gene expression in the gustatory system of
   the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Similar defects are observed upon
   postembryonic removal of two C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors,
   die-1 and che-1, demonstrating that a combination of transcription
   factors, which recognize DNA in a sequence-specific manner, and a

Abstract = {{Objectives: To compare the use of computed tomography - positron

   Patients and methods: From January to July 2009, 15 consecutive head and
   neck cancer patients (11 men and four women; mean age 59 years; age
   range 19 to 81 years) underwent computed tomography - positron emission
   tomography and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for pre-therapeutic
   evaluation. All scans were staged, as per the American Joint Committee
   on Cancer tumour-node-metastasis classification, by two blinded
   consultant radiologists, in two sittings. Diagnoses were confirmed by
   histopathological examination of endoscopic biopsies, and in some cases
   whole surgical specimens.
   Results: Tumour staging showed a 74 per cent concordance, node staging
   an 80 per cent concordance and metastasis staging a 100 per cent
   concordance, comparing the two imaging modalities.
   Conclusion: This study found radiological staging discordance between
   the two imaging modalities. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging is an
   emerging staging modality with superior visualisation of metastatic
   disease, which does not require exposure to ionising radiation.}},

Abstract = {{The glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) of processed brown cowpea
   (Vigna unguiculata) were determined. The whole seeds were dehulled,
   ground into a paste and steamed ({''}moin-moin{''} MM) or fried
   ({''}Akara{''} FB). Proximate analyses were done to determine the
   quantity containing 50 g available carbohydrate. Forty healthy
   volunteers were used for this study. The test groups consumed the
   processed cowpea while 50 g glucose was administered to the control
   group. The blood glucose response at 0, 30, 60,120 and 180 min was
   assessed for each individual of the different groups. The GI values for
   BB, MM and FB were 46.63 +/- 9.0, 50.98 +/- 5.74 and 53.42 +/- 9.50,
   respectively. The GL values for the test foods were 5.51 +/- 1.19, 6.92
   +/- 2.14 and 4.94 +/- 1.88, respectively. The GI and GL values for the
   test foods did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). However, BB had the
   lowest GI and GL values.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
   Legumes, particularly cowpeas, are good sources of nutrients (protein,
   carbohydrate, fiber, vitamins and minerals). Recently, beans have been
   shown to be low glycemic index (GI) foods. They therefore have positive
   health benefits which include hypocholesterolemia, mitigation of
   diabetes and weight control.
   Cowpeas are processed traditionally in Nigeria, by soaking, dehulling,
   grinding, frying steaming and boiling to form cooked beans. These
   methods are often combined by grinding to a paste and fried or steamed
   to form ``Akara{''} (fried bean cakes) and ``moin-moin{''} (steamed bean
   pudding), respectively. These processing methods generally alter the
   contents and nutritional quality of the seeds when consumed.
   Diabetic Nigerians often eat these processed legumes because they help
   reduce hyperglycemic stress while providing satiety effects.
   The determination of the glycemic indices and glycemic loads of these
   processed legumes will give useful information as to how best legumes
   can be processed for consumption by people with diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{A steel hot strip finishing mill presents significant interactions
   between variables that considerably reduce performance. Traditionally,
   the control techniques implemented are based on classical approaches
   assuming an ideal model. Modelling interactions would allow the
   opportunity to suppress them by the application of modern multivariable
   control techniques. In this paper the derivation of a linearized
   multivariable model of a real-life hot strip mill based on previous
   schemes is presented as a case study. Linearization of the non-linear
   static relations around an operating point is performed. The operating
   conditions are the mill set-up calculations obtained from rolling
   schedules and non-linear relations used in the plant. Some useful
   details for practitioners are given. Simulations and experimental model
   validation are also presented. Since the mill in the real hot rolling
   line is in closed loop, it is not possible to carry out an experimental
   validation of the plant itself (i.e. in open loop); therefore, the model
   was experimentally validated in closed loop. As an example of the use of
   the multivariable model an H-infinity multivariable optimal controller
   to attain nominal performance is designed for the looper system and
   results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this work orientation imaging microscopy (OIM), based on electron
   backscatter diffraction in scanning electron microscopy, was employed to
   examine in detail the relationship between laser cladding processing
   parameters and he properties and the microstructure of single and
   overlapping laser tracks. The study was performed on thick (similar to 1
   mm) Co-based coatings prepared by 2 kW Nd:YAG laser cladding a 42CrMo4
   steel substrate using different laser beam scanning speeds (1.0-15 mm
   s(-1)). It was found that the directional growth of individual primary
   grains led to the formation of a typical solidification fiber texture.
   The dependence of this texture on the processing speed and the shape of
   the solidification front were investigated in detail. Strong epitaxial
   growth of Co grains on austenitic steel substrate grains was found,
   which did not depend on the laser beam scanning velocity. During laser
   cladding a strong temperature gradient exists just below the
   coating-substrate interface that promotes the formation of a
   Greninger-Troiano orientation relationship between martensitic plates
   and the original austenitic grain inside the heat affected zone: \{1 1
   1\}(gamma) approximate to 1 degrees to \{1 1 0\}(alpha) and ((1) over

Abstract = {{Objective - The objective of this study was to describe the pattern of
   acute myocardial infarction in an African country. These data are
   important for prevention strategies but are scarce from sub-Saharan
   African countries and altogether absent from Kenya.
   Methods and results - This was a retrospective study done at Kenyatta
   National Hospital, Kenya. Cases of acute myocardial infarction admitted
   to the hospital between January 2000 and December 2009 were examined for
   mode of diagnosis, age, gender, risk factors, and outcome. Only those
   with confirmed diagnosis were included. Results were analysed by SPSS
   version 13.0 for Windows, and are presented in tables and bar charts.
   One hundred twenty cases (80 men; 40 women) were analysed. Clinical
   diagnosis had been confirmed by electrocardiography and cardiac enzymes
   (87.5\%), angiography (8.3\%) and echocardiography (4.2\%). Mean age was
   56.8 years and male:female ratio 2:1. Common risk factors were
   hypertension (35\%), diabetes mellitus (20.8\%), smoking and infection
   12.5\% each and alcohol (10.8\%). The majority (50.8\%) of the patients
   recovered, 44.2\% developed congestive cardiac failure and only 5\%
   died.
   Conclusion - Acute myocardial infarction is not uncommon in Kenya. Over
   30\% of the patients are 50 years and younger and it carries a high
   morbidity from heart failure. Risk factors comprise a combination of
   non-communicable diseases, namely hypertension and diabetes mellitus,
   coexisting with infections. Control measures targeting both categories
   are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a photo detector using a complementary
   metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) for plastic optical fiber (POF)
   applications. Generally, the PIN photodiode and optical receiver
   front-end circuit are made from III-V compound materials, such as GaAs,
   InP, and HEMT (High Electron Mobility Transistor), due to their high
   speed and low noise characteristics. However, silicon deep-submicron
   CMOS technology is more attractive due to its low cost and high
   integration capacity. A PIN photodiode using a CMOS suffers from a low
   responsivity (R) a slow spreading speed of drift and diffusion current
   generated by photon. To overcome the low responsivity of the CMOS PIN
   photodiode, we exploit a PN junction between the N-well and the
   P-substrate. We propose a finger-shaped arrangement of the P-substrate
   to compensate for the slow spreading speed of the drift currents. The
   implemented CMOS PIN photodiode exhibits 0.12-A/W responsivity and
   4.5-pF parasitic capacitance. Also, the optical receiver front-end
   circuit for the POF applications is integrated with the CMOS PIN
   photodiode. The designed photo detector exhibits a 112-MHz 3-dB
   bandwidth and consumes only 3-mA of DC current from a single 3.3 V
   supply voltage.}},

Abstract = {{Patients and methods: The primary end point of this randomised,
   multicentre, phase II study was objective response rate (ORR) and the
   secondary end points included time to progression (TTP), clinical
   benefit rate (CBR), PK profiles and tolerability. Postmenopausal women
   with ER-positive advanced breast cancer were randomised to 28-day cycles
   of fulvestrant approved dose (AD), loading dose (LD) or high dose (HD)
   until disease progression.
   Results: Hundred and forty-three patients (median age 61 years) received
   fulvestrant AD (n = 45), LD (n = 51) or HD (n = 47). ORR was similar
   across dose regimens: 11.1\%, 17.6\% and 10.6\% for AD, LD and HD,
   respectively, with overlapping confidence intervals. TTP and CBR were
   also similar between groups (median TTP: 6.0, 7.5 and 6.0 months,
   respectively; CBR: 42.2\%, 54.9\% and 46.8\% for AD, LD and HD,
   respectively). C-max and area under the plasma concentration-time curve
   were dose proportional and PK steady state was reached earlier with LD
   and HD than with AD. All three doses were well tolerated, with a similar
   adverse-event profile and no emerging safety concerns.
   Conclusion: Fulvestrant AD, LD and HD had similar efficacy and
   tolerability profiles in postmenopausal Japanese women with ER-positive

Abstract = {{The subfamily Apaturinae consists of 20 genera and shows disjunct
   distributions and unique host-plant associations. Most genera of this
   subfamily are distributed in Eurasia South-East Asia and Africa, whereas
   the genera Doxocopa and Asterocampa are distributed mainly in South
   America and North America, respectively. Although the Apaturinae larvae
   mainly feed on the Cannabaceae, those of the genus Apatura are
   associated with Salix and Populus (Salicaceae), which are distantly
   related to the Cannabaceae. Here, we infer the phylogeny of Apaturinae
   and reconstruct the history of host shifting and of colonization in the
   New World. We analyzed 9761 bp of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence
   data, including the genes encoding EF1a, Wg, ArgK, CAD, GAPDH, IDH, MDH,
   RpS5, COI, COII, ATPase8, ATPase6, COIII, ND3, and ND5 for 12 apaturine
   genera. We also inferred the phylogeny with six additional genera using
   mitochondrial sequence data alone. Within the Apaturinae, two major
   clades are recovered in all the datasets. These clades separate the New
   World genera, Doxocopa and Asterocampa, indicating that dispersal to the
   New World occurred at least twice. According to our divergence time
   estimates, these genera originated during the Early Oligocene to the
   Early Miocene, implying that they migrated across the Bering Land Bridge
   rather than the Atlantic Land Bridge. The temporal estimates also show
   that host shifting to Salix or Populus in Apatura occurred more than 15
   million years after the divergence of their host plants. Our
   phylogenetic results are inconsistent with the previously accepted
   apaturine genus groups and indicate that their higher classification
   should be reconsidered. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   samples, contamination frequencies with E. coli O157 were analyzed by
   LAMP assays and the IMS method. E. coli O157 was detected in 12 of 230
   samples (5.2\%). There was no sample positive for E. coli O157 isolation
   but negative for LAMP assays for Stx gene and O157 antigen gene. Four
   samples (1.7\%) were positive by both LAMP assays but negative by the
   IMS method. The result that there was no sample positive for the O157
   antigen gene, but not the Stx gene, indicated that the IMS method failed
   to detect E. coli O157. Twenty-nine samples (12.6\%) were positive for
   the Stx gene but not the O157 antigen gene. The results indicated that
   screening of Stx gene and O157 antigen gene by LAMP assays is effective
   in saving time and effort to isolate E. coli O157 by the IMS method
   because the LAMP assay is more sensitive. This suggested that samples
   positive for Stx gene and O157 antigen gene should be examined by the
   IMS method to isolate E. coli O157.}},

Abstract = {{Thermally induced ring-opening polymerization of monofunctional
   N-allyl-1,3-benzoxazine 1a was compared with that of
   N-(n-propyl)-1,3-benzoxazine 1b to clarify an unexpected effect of allyl
   group to promote the polymerization, that is, in spite of the comparable
   bulkiness of allyl group to n-propyl group, the polymerization of 1a was
   much faster than that of 1b. Such a difference in polymerization rate
   was also observed similarly in the comparison of thermally induced
   polymerization of a bifunctional N-allyl-benzoxazine 2a with that of a
   bifunctional N-(n-propyl) analogue 2b. These observations implied a
   certain contribution of an electron-rich C-C double bond of the N-ally
   group to promotion of the ring-opening reaction of 1,3-benzoxazine into
   the corresponding zwitterionic species, which would involve a mechanism
   to stabilize the cationic part of the zwitterionic species based on
   ``neighboring group participation{''} of the C-C double bond. (C) 2010

   device under loads of 20 N, 40 N and 60 N, at linear sliding speed of
   1m/sec and sliding distance of 1800 m. The experimental results show
   that pearlitic microstructure of ductile iron turned into ausferritic

Abstract = {{Aluminum alloys containing 2 and 4 wt.\% copper reinforced with aluminum
   dodecaborides were successfully fabricated by squeeze casting employing
   pressures up to 62 MPa. The distribution of reinforcements throughout
   the composites was quantified, whereas the effect of pressure on the
   composites density and hardness was determined. In addition, the
   reinforcement chemical stability was examined using high-temperature
   x-ray diffraction which permitted to confirm the formation of AlB2 phase
   a result of AlB12 decomposition. The pressure effect on the squeezed
   composites was investigated by optical microscopy, Vickers microhardness
   testing, superficial Rockwell hardness testing, and differential thermal
   analysis. At the highest applied pressures, the castings density
   increased when the shrinkage porosity was practically eliminated. The
   composite superficial hardness improved by increasing the applied
   squeeze. The indirect squeeze cast technique caused Al2Cu phase
   segregation to upper regions of the specimens, while conversely, the
   AlB12 reinforcements segregated preferentially at lower regions of the
   casting.}},

Abstract = {{The distillation process is one of the most important processes in
   industry, especially petroleum refining. Designing a distillation column
   assesses numerous challenges to the engineer, being a complex process
   that is approached in various studies. An important component, directly
   affecting the efficient operation of the column, is the reflux ratio
   that is correlated with the number of the theoretical stages, a
   correlation developed and studied by Gililland. The correlation is used
   in the case of simplified control models of distillation columns and it
   is a graphical method. However, in many situations, there is the need
   for an analytical form that adequately approximates the experimental
   data. There are in the literature different analytical forms which are
   used taking into account the desired precision. The present article
   attempts to address this problem by using the technique of Genetic
   Programming, a branch of Evolutionary Algorithms that belongs to
   Artificial Intelligence, a recently developed technique that has
   recorded successful applications especially in process modeling. Using
   an evolutionary paradigm and by evolving a population of solutions or
   subprograms composed of carefully chosen functions and operators, the
   Genetic Programming technique is capable of finding the program or
   relation that fits best the available data.}},

Abstract = {{The Piperaceae family comprises about 1000 to 2000 of the species that

   the ethanol extracts were used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity on
   human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and non-malignant Chang's liver
   cell lines by using MTT
   (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay.
   Ethanol extracts from eight Piperaceae families were selected randomly.
   Results showed that all eight spesies (P. sarmentosum, P. ramifilum, P.
   paucistigmum, P. betle, P. macronatum, P. ridleyi, P. magnibaccum and P.
   miniatum) showed cytotoxicity activity with Piper sarmentosum exhibit
   higher cytotoxicity activity with the IC50 value at 12.5 mu g/mL. On the
   other hand, there were no cytotoxicity activity of Chang's cell that
   could be induced by the ethanol extracts because the IC50 values for
   non-malignant Chang's cell were greater than 30 mu g/mL. Viability
   analysis using trypan blue showed that P. sarmentosum ethanol extract
   produced significant (p<0.05) decreased of HepG2 cells as compared to
   control (p<0.05). In conclusion, all ethanol extracts selected randomly
   from Piperaceae family showed cytotoxic using MTT assay. Viability
   analysis using trypan blue staining demonstrates that this type of

Abstract = {{Muscarinic acetylcholine (M) and adrenergic (AR) receptors mediate
   gastrointestinal motility. Using radioligand binding assays and
   real-time polymerase chain reaction, the densities of binding sites and
   mRNA levels of M-2, M-3, alpha(2AD)- and beta(2)-AR were compared in
   muscle tissues from the abomasal fundus, pylorus, duodenum, caecum, and
   external loop of the spiral colon of eight cows with left displacement
   of abomasum (LDA), and of eight healthy cows. Specific binding of the
   {[}H-3]-ligands to each of the four receptors was competitive and
   saturable. Binding sites of M-2 (all intestinal sites), M-3 (duodenum
   and caecum), and of alpha(2AD)-AR (abomasal fundus) were lower (P <
   0.05) in cows with LDA than in healthy cows. The coefficients of
   correlation between binding sites and mRNA transcripts of receptors were
   dissimilar in cows with LDA and healthy cows. The decrease in densities
   of M (intestine) and of alpha(2AD)-AR (abomasum) receptors suggests
   their implication in the impairment of motility associated with or
   leading to LDA. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social science disciplines have used decision theory and game theory to
   provide metaphorical understanding and analytical rigour in their
   particular domains. The paper explores whether a similar perspective can
   be applied to operational research (OR) in order to provide an
   integrating theme for both theory and practice. It is argued that, while
   the methods of OR are instrumentally rational, OR interventions embrace
   non-instrumental aspects as well. A case study of an application of
   decision theory is described and analysed from a decision and game
   theory (DGT) perspective. The case demonstrates that although the model
   developed was instrumental, the structure and content of the model
   reflected the normative and communicative aspects of the decision
   context. The paper concludes that OR could use a DGT perspective as a
   conceptual framework for the teaching, research and practice of OR.

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effects of metrenperone on healing of
   unilateral, collagenase-induced lesions in the Superficial Digital
   Flexor Tendons (SDFT) of rabbits.
   After controlled injury of the left SDFT, nine rabbits received daily
   treatment with metrenperone for 28 days. Another nine were untreated
   controls; in both groups the contra-lateral tendons served as uninjured
   controls. Histological and ultrastructural changes, mechanical
   properties, dry weight, collagen content, and amount of DNA in healing
   and control tendons were assessed 28 days after injury.
   Restoration of structural hierarchy was more organized in treated than
   in untreated tendons while cellularity was greater in the latter. At the
   ultrastructural level, collagen in treated lesions was predominantly in
   the form of small-diameter, new fibrils, with few large, old fibrils; in
   untreated lesions there was a high proportion of large, old fibrils but
   relatively few small, new ones. The amount of DNA in untreated injuries
   was much greater than in normal tendons, while in treated lesions it was
   not significantly different from that of uninjured controls. There were
   no significant differences in total collagen, stiffness and ultimate
   strength of injured, treated, and untreated tendons 28 days after
   injury. Both were significantly weaker than their corresponding
   contralaterals.
   The findings suggest that metrenperone had positive effects on collagen
   turnover, remodelling, and organization during acute inflammation and
   fibroplasia. Provided that the new fibrils subsequently matured in a
   normal manner, mechanical characteristics of the organized scar should
   be better than those of an untreated lesion.}},

   (DWMs), the Primary Standards for force measurements with ranges of
   0.05-5kN, 0.5-50kN, 10-500kN, 500-1000kN and 100-5000kN. All are
   computerized and delivered by GTM Company except the 5kN machine which
   is a manually controlled machine, established through research works
   carried out by FMMD {[}1]. The FMMD was transferred to a new building
   which lead to dismantling the 5kN machine and re-assembling it in its
   new site. In addition, the machine was developed as a part of
   modernizing NIS force laboratory {[}2]. This development entailed
   checking the design of machine main frame using finite element method,
   determining the gravitational acceleration in the new building,
   determining the air density surrounding the machine, adjusting the

   City of Munster in an epidemiologic study and aims to optimize pain
   management in accordance with nursing standards and medical guidelines.
   Hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient nursing services, hospices and pain
   care centers will be examined. After an analysis of the current state on
   the basis of a pre-test, the necessary optimization measures will be
   developed and implemented. Subsequently, the pain management will be
   reevaluated in a post-test. In partly still unexplored health care areas
   of Germany, epidemiologic data will be generated, barriers to the
   implementation of standards and guidelines revealed and measures of
   improvements developed and tested. In addition, interface problems
   between the evaluated sectors will be identified. In this article the

Abstract = {{Multidrug-resistance-associated protein 6 (MRP6/ABCC6) is a protein
   belonging to the ABC transporter family. Proteins in this family share
   many characteristic structural features, including two membrane-spanning
   domains and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), that
   function cooperatively but not equally bind and hydrolyze ATP. The MRP6
   protein is structurally and functionally poorly characterized.
   Previously, we showed, by NMR spectroscopy, that a fragment of MRP6-NBD1
   presents helical structure and fluorescence experiments demonstrated
   that peptide binds ATP. These data suggested that the study on selected
   regions could be a valid approach to define the structure of MRP6.
   In the present study, to better characterize MRP6-NBD1, we report data
   of CD spectroscopy, nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis on two
   different polypeptides, one corresponding to the full-length NBD1 domain
   (residues from Asp-627 to Leu-851) and the other is a shorter
   polypeptide (residues from Arg-648 to Thr-805) without some key
   residues.
   We report that both polypeptides are highly structured in aqueous buffer
   and in 20\% trifluoroethanol showing considerable helical and
   beta-structure content. The ATP hydrolysis activity is exhibited only by
   the full-length NBD1 domain. Comparison between our findings and the
   structurally well characterized MRP1-NBD1 supports the role of H-loop
   for the ATP hydrolysis and of A-loop in stabilizing the ATP binding.}},

   the development of multicomponent interventions for obese pregnant
   women. A cohort of 22 healthcare professionals was interviewed. The
   interview transcripts were analysed thematically. Three key themes were
   highlighted by the interviews: (1) the lack of existing services for
   obese pregnant women in south-east London; (2) the barriers and
   challenges that need to be overcome (e. g. ethnic and cultural) when
   considering the creation of a new service for obese women who are
   pregnant; (3) the possible components of a new intervention. The
   findings of this study will inform the design of a programme to combat
   maternal obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Three Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland and Norway, participated in the
   IEA SITES 2006 study. All the three countries have launched huge policy
   and investment programmes to promote digital literacy and readiness for
   the information age. In relation to the remarkable Finnish Programme for
   International Student Assessment (PISA) results, it is interesting to
   see if the Finnish school system may be better suited to ground and
   contextualize pedagogical practice with Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) than the Danish and Norwegian counterparts. One main
   difference is that the Finnish system seems to anchor decisions about
   and interpretations on how ICT should be utilized stronger at the local
   level than the two other systems. One of the general goals in the policy
   programmes is to get teachers to innovate with ICT in the classrooms.
   The Second Information Technology in Education Study (SITES) 2006
   indicators for two innovative pedagogical orientations, lifelong
   learning orientation and connectedness are utilized to compare teachers
   from the three nations. The main findings is that Finnish teachers are
   either not differing or they are scoring significantly lower on the two
   indicators than teachers from Denmark or Norway. The exception is
   Finnish science teachers who are more inclined towards using ICT in
   lifelong learning practices than their Danish and Norwegian
   counterparts. Generally, the Finnish teachers seem to be more autonomous
   in their pedagogical choices but may also be more conservative than the
   Danish and Norwegian teachers in making use of ICT.}},

Abstract = {{Functional genomics of the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus
   subtilis reveals valuable insights into basic concepts of cell
   physiology. In this study, we monitor temporal changes in the proteome,
   transcriptome and extracellular metabolome of B. subtilis caused by
   glucose starvation. For proteomic profiling, a combination of in vivo
   metabolic labelling and shotgun mass spectrometric analysis was carried
   out for five different proteomic subfractions (cytosolic, integral
   membrane, membrane, surface and extracellular proteome fraction),
   leading to the identification of similar to 52\% of the predicted
   proteome of B. subtilis. Quantitative proteomic and corresponding
   transcriptomic data were analysed with Voronoi treemaps linking
   functional classification and relative expression changes of gene
   products according to their fate in the stationary phase. The obtained
   data comprise the first comprehensive profiling of changes in the
   membrane subfraction and allow in-depth analysis of major physiological
   processes, including monitoring of protein degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The development of anhydrous proton-conducting membranes is important
   for the operation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) at
   intermediate temperature (100-200 degrees C) In this work
   poly(vinylbenzylchloride) PVBC was produced by free radical
   polymerization of 4-vinylbenzylchloride and then it was modified with
   5-aminotetrazole (ATET) to obtain poly(vinylbenzylaminotetrazole)
   PVBC-ATET The composition of the polymer was verified by elemental
   analysis (EA) and the structure was characterized by FT-IR and C-13 NMR
   spectra According to the elemental analysis result PVBC was modified by
   ATET with 80\% yield The polymer was doped with trifluoromethanesulfonic
   acid (TA) at various molar ratios x 1 25 2 5 3 75 with respect to
   tetrazole unit The proton transfer from TA to the tetrazole rings was
   proved with FT-IR spectroscopy Thermogravimetry (TG) analysis showed
   that the samples are thermally stable up to approximately 200 degrees C
   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results illustrated the
   homogeneity of the materials Cyclic voltammetry (CV) study illustrated
   that the electrochemical stability domain for PVBC-ATET-TA(2 5) extends
   over 3 0 V The proton conductivity of these materials increased with
   dopant concentration and the temperature Maximum proton conductivity of
   PVBC-ATET-TA(2 5) was found to be 001 S/cm at 150 C in the anhydrous

Abstract = {{Cobalt-doped willemite is a promising blue ceramic pigment, but some
   important aspects concerning crystal structure, optical properties and
   technological behaviour are still undisclosed. In order to get new
   insight on these features, willemite pigments (Zn2-xCoxSiO4, 0 <x <0.3)
   were synthesized by the ceramic route and characterized from the
   structural (XRPD with Rietveld refinement), optical (DRS and
   colorimetry), microstructural (SEM, STEM, TEM, EDX, EELS) and
   technological (simulation of the ceramic process) viewpoints. The
   incorporation of cobalt in the willemite lattice, taking preferentially
   place in the Zn1 tetrahedral site, induces an increase of unit-cell
   parameters, metal-oxygen distances, and inter-tetrahedral tilting. It
   causes shifting and enhanced splitting of spin-allowed bands of Co2+ in
   tetrahedral coordination, implying slight changes of crystal field
   strength Dq and Racah B parameter, but increasing spin-orbit coupling
   parameter lambda. Willemite pigments impart deep blue hue to ceramic
   glazes and glassy coatings with a colouring performance better than
   commercial Co-bearing colorants in the 800-1200 degrees C range.
   Detailed SEM-TEM investigation and microanalysis proved that no
   diffusion phenomena occur at the pigment-glassy coating interface and
   that willemite pigments are chemically inert during firing at 1050
   degrees C. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Morbidity of obesity-related diseases tends to increase due to a rise in
   the body mass index (BMI). We aimed to investigate how the body
   composition and biochemical parameters change while BMI increases in
   adult women were categorized as so: as normal weight, overweight and
   obese. Our objectives are to study the effects of those changes in the
   development of metabolic disturbances and to find out which parameters
   are the most sensitive to predict cardiometabolic risks. Three hundred
   and twenty two records of adult women (mean age: 38.62 +/- 12.71 year)
   who admitted to our unit concerning about losing or preserving their
   weights, were analyzed in the study. All patients had undergone
   anthropometric measurements and body composition analyses as well as
   some biochemical tests. Body composition analyses were performed by
   means of the Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer (BIA). Increase in BMI
   significantly increased the body fat, blood sugar, insulin, triglyceride
   and uric acid levels. BMI and circumference of the waist were
   significantly and negatively correlated with the ratio of body water and
   lean mass/fat mass. However they were positively correlated with the
   ratio of fat mass and basal metabolism. Furthermore, it was also found
   that BMI and circumference of the waist were significantly and
   positively correlated with level of fasting blood sugar, insulin,
   triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),
   uric acid and fibrinogen levels, and negatively correlated with high
   density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level. In multiple regression
   analyses, circumference of waist measurements was significantly
   correlated with insulin, triglyseride and HDL, whereas the correlation
   between BMI and these parameters was not found significant. Total body
   fat mass (as \%) showed significant correlation only with HDL-C level.
   It could be said that obesity which is a disorder that causes many
   health complications and affects the quality of life in the short and
   long term could be prevented or cured by keeping negative environmental
   conditions under control. According to our results, visceral adipose
   tissue (VAT) measurement was thought to be more related for metabolic
   and cardiovascular disorders rather than BMI. We also propose to test
   fasting blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, HDL, fibrinogen,
   homocystein (HOM) levels along with VAT measurements to predict more
   truly about not only global cardiometabolic risk but also dementia in
   later life.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to investigate the brain pathological changes
   according to ageing in cats. For that, brains of 24 cats (over 10 years
   old) were compared with those of 8 younger cats (1-2 years old) using
   haematoxylin and eosin (HE), Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and von Kossa
   stains and immunohistochemical labelling for neuron-specific enolase
   (NSE), 2,3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), ubiquitin,
   glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and beta-amyloid protein (A
   beta). Cerebral and cerebellum atrophy with ventricular dilatation were
   observed for all aged cat brains. Histologically, these changes were
   frequently associated with fibrosis of meningeal vessels and hyalinosis
   of the choroid plexus, with neuronal degeneration (characterized by
   intense vacuolisation and swelling, white matter spongiosis, ubiquitin
   and NSE labelling and lipofuscinosis coupled to mineralization areas in
   the oldest cats) and also with severe gliosis (proliferation of
   Bergmann's glial cells and numerous positive GFAP and CNPase cells).
   Furthermore A beta deposits were mainly observed in vessel walls (in
   91.7\% of old cats) and as senile plaque (in 83.3\% of cases). These
   age-related alterations of brain observed in cats were similar to those
   observed in humans and in other old mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) detected by computerized
   tomography (CT)/echocardiography or elevated biomarkers is associated
   with a poor prognosis for pulmonary embolism (PE). However, these
   prognostic factors have not previously been concomitantly elucidated in
   the same patient group.
   Methods: This prospective study included 108 consecutive patients with
   normotensive PE confirmed by CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). On
   admission, patient serum NT-proBNP and troponin T (Tn-T) levels were
   measured, and echocardiography was performed within 24 hours after
   diagnosis of PE. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was
   performed to determine the optimal echocardiographic end-diastolic
   diameters of the right ventricle, the ratio of the right ventricle to
   left ventricle (RV/LV ratio) on CTPA, and NT-proBNP and Tn-T cut-off
   levels with regard to prognosis.
   Results: All-cause 30-day mortality was 13\% and PE-related mortality
   was 5.6\%. RVD was defined as a right/left ventricular dimension ratio
   >= 1.1 on CTPA and RV >30 mm on echocardiography by ROC analysis. A
   cut-off level of NT-proBNP <= 90 pmol/ml had a high positive predictive
   value of 98\% for survival, whereas NT-proBNP >300 and Tn-T >= 0.027 had
   a negative predictive value, for all-cause deaths, of 95\% and 96\%,
   respectively. PE mortality in patients with NT-proBNP >300 and Tn-T >=
   0.027 reached 64\%. In univariable analysis, the combination of Tn-T >=
   0.027 ng/ml with a echocardiographic RVD were the most significant
   predictors of overall mortality and PE-related death {[}HR: 14 (95\% CI:
   4.6-42,) and HR: 37.6 (95\% CI: 4.4-324)], respectively. In
   multivariable Cox's regression analysis, NT-proBNP >300 and Tn-T >=
   0.027 HR: 26.5 (95\% CI: 4.1-169.9, p<0.001) were the best combination
   to predict all-cause of mortality.
   Conclusions: The combination of NT-proBNP and Tn-T clearly appears to be
   a better risk stratification predictor than biomarkers plus RVD on CT/
   echocardiography in patients with normotensive PE. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to incorporate time-dependent dune
   evolution in the determination of bed roughness coefficients applied in
   hydraulic models. Dune roughness is calculated by using the
   process-based dune evolution model of Paarlberg et al. (2009) and the
   empirical dune roughness predictor of Van Rijn (1984). The approach is
   illustrated by applying it to a river of simple geometry in the 1-D
   hydraulic model SOBEK for two different flood wave shapes. Calculated
   dune heights clearly show a dependency on rate of change in discharge
   with time: dunes grow to larger heights for a flood wave with a smaller
   rate of change. Bed roughness coefficients computed using the new
   approach can be up to 10\% higher than roughness coefficients based on
   calibration, with the largest differences at low flows. As a result of
   this larger bed roughness, computed water depths can be up to 15\%
   larger at low flow. The new approach helps to reduce uncertainties in
   bed roughness coefficients of flow models, especially for river systems
   with strong variations in discharge with time. Copyright (c) 2010 John

Abstract = {{Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the negative
   predictive value (NPV) of sonography in the diagnosis of acute
   appendicitis. Methods. Right lower quadrant sonograms of 193 patients
   (158 female and 35 male; age range, 3-20 years) with suspected acute
   appendicitis over a 1-year period were retrospectively reviewed.
   Sonographic findings were graded on a 5-point scale, ranging from a
   normal appendix identified (grade 1) to frankly acute appendicitis
   (grade 5). Sonographic findings were compared with subsequent computed
   tomographic (CT), surgical, and pathologic findings. The diagnostic
   accuracy of sonography was assessed considering surgical findings and
   clinical follow-up as reference standards. Results. Forty-nine patients
   (25.4\%) had appendicitis on sonography, and 144 (74.6\%) had negative
   sonographic findings. Computed tomographic scans were obtained in 51
   patients (26.4\%) within 4 days after sonography. These included 39
   patients with negative and 12 with positive sonographic findings.
   Computed tomography changed the sonographic diagnosis in 10 patients:
   from negative to positive in 3 cases and positive to negative in 7.
   Forty-three patients (22.2\%) underwent surgery. The surgical findings
   were positive for appendicitis in 37 (86\%) of the 43 patients who had
   surgery. Patients with negative sonographic findings who, to our
   knowledge, did not have subsequent CT scans or surgery were considered
   to have negative findings for appendicitis. Seven patients with negative
   sonographic findings underwent surgery and had appendicitis; therefore,
   137 of 144 patients with negative sonographic findings did not have
   appendicitis. On the basis of these numbers, the NPV was 95.1\%.
   Conclusions. Sonography has a high NPV and should be considered as a
   reasonable screening tool in the evaluation of acute appendicitis.
   Further imaging could be performed if clinical signs and symptoms
   worsen.}},

Abstract = {{Bacabi (Oenocarpus mapora H. Karsten) is a native Amazonian palm that
   produces racemes with hundreds of fruits with great potential for
   commercial and food uses, but has not been well studied. The objectives
   of this research were to estimate the repeatability coefficients, to
   determine predictability and the number of measurements needed for
   raceme characters of this palm. Twenty seven individuals of bacabi that
   belong to the Germplasm Bank of Oenocarpus/Jessenia at Embrapa Eastern
   Amazon, in Belem, PA, Brazil were evaluated. Three fully matured racemes
   from each plant were sampled to measure six characters: raceme total
   weight (RTW) and fruit weight per raceme (FWR), number of rachillae per
   raceme (NRR), rachis length per raceme (RLR), weight of 100 fruits (WHF)
   and fruit yield per raceme (FER). The repeatability estimates were
   obtained by three statistical methods: analysis of variance; principal
   components; and structural analysis. For all characters, the estimates
   of the repeatability coefficients presented values with very similar
   magnitudes in the three methods. The estimates of repeatability
   coefficients and determination coefficients were relatively high (r >=
   0.60 and R2 >= 81.7\%) for the characters FER and NRR, showing
   regularity of genotypes for these raceme measurements. For these
   characters, the minimum number of racemes necessary to estimate the true
   character value of the genotypes was thirteen (FER) and five (NRR), with
   95\% reliability. The remaining characters showed repeatability and
   determination coefficients with medium to low values, indicating the
   need for better environmental control to make the measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA)-associated
   vasculitis (AASV) commonly suffer from arthralgias and, sometimes,
   polyarthritis during disease flares. Although rheumatoid factor (RF) can
   be detected in up to 37-50\% of AASV patients, anti-cyclic citrullinated
   peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies are rare. Herein, we describe the clinical
   features of five P-ANCA-positive vasculitis patients, who had persistent
   and/or high anti-CCP levels and, more importantly, suffered from
   remittent non-destructive arthralgias and polysynovitis, independently
   of the vasculitis course and without evidence of RA. Two were initially
   thought to have RA rather than microscopic polyangiitis and, at AASV
   diagnosis, all had kidney involvement and three had alveolar
   hemorrhages. With a median follow-up of 30 months, one suffered
   vasculitis relapses, preceded by polysynovitis, and others had remittent
   arthralgias and polysynovitis, while their vasculitides remained in
   remission. None of these patients had radiological destructive
   arthritis. We discuss the challenge of diagnosing these patients
   positive for anti-CCP and ANCA, and with dominant articular
   manifestations. AASV patients with anti-CCP antibodies may experience
   relapsing polysynovitis and non-erosive polyarthritis prior to
   vasculitis flares, but also independently of the vasculitis course,
   which is uncommon in AASV, and might represent a small subgroup of AASV
   patients. (C) 2010 Societe francaise de rhumatologie. Published by

Abstract = {{A toroidal field coil is composed of several individual toroidal coils
   (ITCs) which are connected in a series and distributed in a toroidal and
   symmetrical form. Cross section of ITCs is rectangular or negligible.
   This paper presents analytical equations of mutual inductance of two
   ITCs applicable to tokamak reactors using the filament method. These
   equations are based on those formulated by Neumann. The numerical
   analysis of the integrations resulting from these equations is solved
   using the extended three-point Gaussian algorithm. The finite element
   method (FEM) is employed to verify the mutual inductance equations of
   ITCs. The results obtained using FEM, when dimensional parameters of
   ITCs are changed, confirm the analytical and empirical results showing
   an error of less than 0.2043\% in the worst case. This indicates the
   reliability of the presented equations. This paper also employs FEM to
   obtain depth of penetration of electromagnetic waves in
   high-conductivity conductors (HCCs). The results show that the ratio of
   real depth of penetration, obtained by FEM, to ideal depth of
   penetration in HCCs is independent of frequency. This ratio shows that
   the magnitude of traveling plane waves in HCC decreases with e(-1.7916)
   rather than e(-1).}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the clinical manifestations in upper and lower limb deep
   venous thrombosis patients from India and difference in etiological
   factors. Fifty-three patients with primary upper extremity deep vein
   thrombosis (UEDVT; males 30, females 23) and 236 patients with lower
   limb deep vein thrombosis (LLDVT; males 157, females 79) were included
   in this study. The thrombophilia markers studied were protein C (PC),
   protein S (PS), antithrombin (AT) III, and factor V Leiden (FVL)
   mutation. Females had significantly higher prevalence of prothrombotic
   markers as compared to males (P = .046) in the UEDVT group. No
   statistically significant differences in the prevalence of prothrombotic
   markers were observed between the LLDVT and the UEDVT patients. The
   clinical picture however revealed greater involvement of thrombus of the
   iliofemoral vein (P = .009) and the proximal tibial vein (P = .005) in
   males than females, while no differences were observed in the clinical
   manifestations between the 2 sexes in UEDVT patients. Our study is able
   to give a broad perspective of the prevalence data of UEDVT and LLDVT in
   the city of Mumbai of approximately 5 million population served by this
   hospital. We conclude that the topology of thrombosis in deep vein
   thrombosis (DVT) patients in India is different from that of the Western
   countries.}},

Abstract = {{In silico models that predict the rate of human renal clearance for a
   diverse set of drugs, that exhibit both active secretion and net
   re-absorption, have been produced using three statistical approaches.
   Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Random Forests (RF) have been used to
   produce continuous models whereas Classification And Regression Trees
   (CART) has only been used for a classification model. The best models
   generated from either PLS or RF produce significant models that can
   predict acids/zwitterions, bases and neutrals with approximate average
   fold errors of 3,3 and 4, respectively, for an independent test set that
   covers oral drug-like property space. These models contain additional
   information on top of any influence arising from plasma protein binding
   on the rate of renal clearance. Classification And Regression Trees
   (CART) has been used to generate a classification tree leading to a
   simple set of Renal Clearance Rules (RCR) that can be applied to man.
   The rules are influenced by lipophilicity and ion class and can
   correctly predict 60\% of an independent test set. These percentages
   increase to 71\% and 79\% for drugs with renal clearances of <0.1
   ml/min/kg and >1 ml/min/kg, respectively. As far as the authors are
   aware these are the first set of models to appear in the literature that
   predict the rate of human renal clearance and can be used to manipulate
   molecular properties leading to new drugs that are less likely to fail
   due to renal clearance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the auditory-perceptive
   evaluation and the psychodynamic aspects of voice samples among suicidal
   movie characters. Method: Voice samples of 48 characters (27 male, 21
   female), extracted from 36 movies produced between 1968 and 2006, were
   analyzed. The samples were evaluated through a specific protocol
   focusing on the auditory-perceptive evaluation (voice quality,
   resonance, pitch, loudness, modulation, pauses, articulation and rhythm)
   and the psychodynamic aspects of voice. Results: 85.5\% of the samples
   exhibited abnormal findings in at least five parameters of the
   auditory-perceptive analysis, such as breathiness (n = 42; 87.5\% of the
   samples), hoarseness (n = 39; 81.2\%) and strain (n = 29; 60.4\%), as
   well as laryngopharingeal resonance (n = 39; 81.2\%), either high pitch
   (n = 14; 29.2\%), or decreased loudness (n = 31; 64.6\%). With respect
   to the psychodynamic aspects, dismay was detected in 50\% (n = 24) of
   the samples, hopelessness in 47.9\% (n = 23), resignation in 37.5\% (n =
   18), and sadness in 33.3\% (n = 16). Conclusion: Our findings suggest
   the existence of specific patterns used by actors during the
   interpretation of suicidal characters. The replication of these findings
   among real patients may contribute to improvement in the evaluation of
   potential suicidal patients, as well as the implementation of preventive
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{Using the results from a long-term grazing trial in the Dry Highland
   Sourveld of the KwaZulu-Natal province, we prepared a water use
   efficiency value (the ratio of the increment in annual biomass to total
   annual evapotranspiration) for this rangeland type. Using seasonal
   biomass measurements recorded between March 2000 and March 2007, we
   developed a model for predicting the increment in annual biomass using a
   regression relationship between fPAR (fraction of photosynthetically
   active radiation intercepted by the vegetation canopy) and measured
   standing biomass. This regression model was used to estimate the growth
   rates from fPAR for the period 2001-2006. During the period 2004-2007,
   when complete meteorological records were available, we calculated
   reference or potential evapotranspiration (ET0) using the
   Penman-Monteith equation. To approximate actual evapotranspiration (ET),
   we used the MODIS leaf area index to approximate canopy conductance
   component (G) of the Penman-Monteith equation. Using the adjusted fPAR
   curves as a surrogate for plant growth, and ET, we calculated a water
   use efficiency value for these grasslands of 7.5 +/- 0.48 kg DM mm-1
   ha-1 y-1. This value relates well to other published water use
   efficiencies for natural rangeland.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic periaortitis (CP) is a rare disease hallmarked by the presence
   of a periaortic retroperitoneal fibro-inflammatory tissue which can
   often cause obstructive uropathy. CP is isolated in most cases but it
   may also be associated with other sclerosing inflammatory and
   immune-mediated diseases. We here present the case of a patient who was
   initially diagnosed as having CP and subsequently developed membranous
   nephropathy and chronic sclerosing sialoadenitis of the right parotid
   gland. As these conditions were all characterized by either pronounced
   infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells or marked IgG4 tissue
   deposition, we hypothesize that they are part of the same disease
   spectrum, and discuss the immune-mediated pathogenetic mechanisms
   potentially shared by these conditions. In particular, we consider the
   role of Th2-mediated immune reactions and of immunogenetic factors such
   as HLA genotype as common determinants of these disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has been carried
   out in an area of Genoa (Italy) for subjects aged 65 years or more to
   evaluate prevalence of this disease.
   Methods. Between March 2007 and September 2009 8 234 subjects were
   screened. Ultrasound examination of the abdominal aorta and the iliac
   arterial segments was carried out on each subject and all data related
   to risk factors were collected.
   Results. Five hundreds-twelve (6.2\%) subjects were found to have an
   AAA: 469 (10.8\%) males and 43 (1.1\%) females (significant difference,
   P<0.01). Based on the aortic diameter, 403 (4.9\%), 80 (1.0\%) and 29
   (0.3\%) had an AAA of 3.0-3.9 cm, 4.0-4.9 cm and >= 5.0 cm diameter,
   respectively. With regards to risk factors, family history of
   cardiovascular disease only resulted more frequent in subjects with AAA
   than in those without AAA.
   Conclusion. The prevalence of patients with AAA (6.2\%) was similar to
   previously published estimates. Nevertheless, AAA resulted very high in
   males. This observation is likely due to screening in a city with a very
   high percentage of elderly subjects. Family predisposition to
   cardiovascular disease resulted significant risk factor for AAA. Results
   of our epidemiological study provide evidence of the usefulness of AAA
   screening thanks to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of AAA.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR HISTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{The harderian gland is located within the orbit of the eye of most
   terrestrial vertebrates. It is especially noticeable in rodents, in
   which it synthesises lipids, porphyrins, and indoles. Various functions
   have been ascribed to the harderian gland, such as lubrication of the
   eyes, a site of immune response, and a source of growth factors.
   Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are zinc-containing metalloenzymes that
   catalyse the reaction CO(2) + H(2)O double left right arrow H(+) +
   HCO(3)(-). They are involved in the adjustment of pH in the secretions
   of different glands. Thirteen enzymatically active isozymes have been
   described in the mammalian alpha-CA family. Here, we first investigated
   them RNA expression of all 13 active CAs in the mouse harderian gland by
   quantitative real-time PCR. Nine CA mRNAs were detectable in the gland.
   Car5b and Car13 showed the highest signals. Car4, Car6, and Car12 showed
   moderate expression levels, whereas Car2, Car3, Car7, and Car15 mRNAs
   were barely within the detection limits. Immunohistochemical staining
   was performed to study the expression of Car2, Car4, Car5b, Car12, and
   Car13 at the protein level. The epithelial cells were intensively
   stained for CAVB, whereas only weak signal was detected for CAXIII.
   Positive signals for CAIV and CAXII were observed in the capillary
   endothelial cells and the basolateral plasma membrane of the epithelial
   cells, respectively. This study provides an expression profile of all
   CAs in the mouse harderian gland. These results should improve our
   understanding of the distribution of CA isozymes and their potential
   roles in the function of harderian gland. The high expression of
   mitochondrial CAVB at both mRNA and protein levels suggests a role in
   lipid synthesis, a key physiological process of the harderian gland.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study the effects of stress state (tension/compression)
   and test temperature on the critical stress level for the stress-induced
   martensitic transformation, the shape memory effect and superelasticity
   of {[}001]-oriented Ni49Fe18Ga27Co6 (at.\%) single crystals were
   investigated. It is shown that the strong tension/compression asymmetry
   of the critical stress levels for the stress-induced martensitic
   transformation can be described by a modified Clausius-Clapreyron
   relationship, which takes the difference between the elastic moduli of
   austenite and martensite into account. The temperature interval in which
   superelasticity occurs and the reversible strain values associated with
   superelasticity and the shape memory effect are both strongly dependent
   on the stress state (tension/compression). Moreover, the conditions
   necessary for the development of high-temperature superelasticity in
   Ni49Fe18Ga27Co6 single crystals have been determined. For the
   Ni49Fe18Ga27Co6 single crystals a large interval of superelasticity (315
   K < T < 723 K) was obtained when the single crystals were loaded in
   tension along the {[}001]-orientation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In India leprosy services, were integrated into the General Health
   Services (GHS), in a phased manner, in different provinces, from 2001 to
   2004. This study reports the findings from a follow-up operational
   research undertaken in 2006-2007, to assess the level of integration, on
   predetermined indicators related to: referral services, training of
   health functionaries, availability of diagnosis, treatment, MDT
   dispersal and counselling guidelines in health facilities, recording and
   reporting by GHS staff, MDT stock management and involvement of health
   sub-centres in different Indian provinces. Nine provinces, 18 districts,
   88 health facilities and 108 sub-centres were selected, by using
   multistage stratified random sampling techniques. Reverse integration,
   as reflected by the training and deployment of vertical staff in GHS,
   was also assessed. Data was collected by medical officers experienced in
   leprosy, with the assistance of state health functionaries, and recorded
   on separate schedules for health facility and sub-centre levels. The
   study also touched on the issue of client perception towards MDT
   services by interviewing 149 under treatment/cured leprosy cases (who
   had completed treatment within the last year), in the community with the
   help of local interpreters. Results showed wide variations across the
   selected provinces in various parameters. District leprosy nuclei were
   understaffed in 12 (66.7\%) districts, and district hospitals were not
   working as referral institutions anywhere. The training status of
   medical officers and multi-purpose workers in leprosy was low in Andhra
   Pradesh (6.9 and 22.4\%), Madhya Pradesh (26.3 and 14.5\%), Rajasthan
   (19.7 and 40.9\%) and Kerala (25.5 and 65.7\%). MDT stock availability
   as per the National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) guidelines was
   not adequate in all provinces. Availability of patient counseling
   guidelines was nil/low in Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal, Orissa,
   Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. The involvement of sub-centres, in case
   referral, recording and dispensing MDT was nil Kerala and Rajasthan and
   poor in Andhra Pradesh. Ninety percent of clients in Kerala and 38.0\%
   in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh did not get MDT in the nearest
   health facilities or sub-centres.}},

Abstract = {{The seminal paper on the liver physiologically-based pharmacokinetic
   (PBPK) model by Rowland et al. (J Pharmacokinet Biopharm 1:123-136,
   1973) that described the influence of blood flow, intrinsic clearance,
   and binding on hepatic clearance had inspired further development of
   PBPK modeling of the liver, kidney and intestine as well as whole body.
   Shortly thereafter, a series of papers from Pang and Rowland compared
   the well-stirred and parallel-tube liver models and sparked further
   development on clearance concepts in the liver, including those
   described by the dispersion model. From 2005 onwards, several seminal
   papers by Rodgers and Rowland, in their recognition of the binding of
   molecules to tissue acidic and neutral phospholipids, improved the
   methodology in providing estimates of the tissue-to-plasma coefficient
   and rendering easy calculation of these hard-to-get constants. The
   improvement has strongly consolidated the basic premise on PBPK modeling
   and simulations and these basics have allowed scientists to focus on
   other important variables: membrane barriers, and transporter and enzyme
   and their heterogeneities that further impact drug disposition. In
   particular, the PBPK models have delved into sequential metabolism and
   futile cycling to illustrate how transporters and enzymes could affect
   the metabolism of drugs and metabolites. PBPK models that are especially
   pertinent to metabolite kinetics are being utilized in drug studies and
   risk assessment. These types of PBPK modeling reveal differences in
   kinetics between the formed vs. preformed metabolite, showing special
   considerations for membrane barriers, and the influence of competing
   pathways and competing organs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a solution to a problem existing in the cork
   industry: cork stopper/disk classification according to their quality
   using a visual inspection system. Cork is a natural and heterogeneous
   (remarkable variability among different samples, being impossible to
   find two samples with the same morphological distribution in its
   defects) material; therefore, its automatic classification (seven
   quality classes exist) is very difficult. The solution proposed in this
   paper evaluates the following procedures: quality discriminatory
   features extraction and classifiers analysis. Each procedure focused on
   the study of aspects that could influence cork quality. Experiments show
   that the best results are obtained by system specific features: cork
   area occupied by defects (after thresholding), size of the biggest
   defect within the cork area (morphological operations), and the Laws
   TEMs E5L5TR, E5E5TR, S5S5TR, W5W5TR, all working on a Neuro-Fuzzy
   classifier. In conclusion, the results of this study represent an
   important contribution to improve quality control in the cork industry.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an application of Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANNs) in the renewable energy domain We particularly look at the
   Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network which has been the most used of
   ANNs architectures both in the renewable energy domain and in the time
   series forecasting We have used a MLP and an ad hoc time series
   pre-processing to develop a methodology for the daily prediction of
   global solar radiation on a horizontal surface First results are
   promising with nRMSE similar to 21\% and RMSE similar to 3 59 MJ/m(2)
   The optimized MLP presents predictions similar to or even better than
   conventional and reference methods such as ARIMA techniques, Bayesian
   inference, Markov chains and k-Nearest Neighbors Moreover we found that
   the data pre-processing approach proposed can reduce significantly
   forecasting errors of about 6\% compared to conventional prediction
   methods such as Markov chains or Bayesian inference The simulator
   proposed has been obtained using 19 years of available data from the
   meteorological station of Ajaccio (Corsica Island, France, 41 degrees
   55'N, 8 degrees 44'E, 4 m above mean sea level) The predicted whole
   methodology has been validated on a 1 175 kWc mono-Si PV power grid Six
   prediction methods (ANN, clear sky model, combination) allow to predict
   the best daily DC PV power production at horizon d + 1 The cumulated DC
   PV energy on a 6-months period shows a great agreement between simulated
   and measured data (R-2 > 0 99 and nRMSE < 2\%) (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All

Abstract = {{Sea surface gradients derived from the Geosat and ERS-1 satellite
   altimetry geodetic missions were integrated with marine gravity data
   from the National Geophysical Data Center and Brazilian national

   with a resolution of 2' x 2'. The integration of satellite and shipborne
   data showed better statistical results in regions near the coast than
   using satellite data only, suggesting an improvement when compared to
   the state-of-the-art global gravity models. Furthermore, these results
   were obtained with considerably less input information than was used by
   those reference models. The least squares collocation presented a very
   low content of high-frequency noise in the predicted gravity anomalies.

Journal = {{HEART RHYTHM}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{1790-1796}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and a spontaneous type 1
   ECG are considered to be at greater increased risk for sudden cardiac
   death than are patients with an abnormal ECG only after administration
   of sodium channel blockers and therefore represent a more severe
   phenotype. Thus, it can be hypothesized that in the presence of a more
   severe electrical phenotype, structural and functional changes are more
   likely expected because electrical changes can play a causal role in
   producing structural changes.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the
   different ECG manifestations in patients with BrS are associated with
   structural changes detected by cardiovascular magnetic resonance
   imaging.
   METHODS Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 69
   consecutive patients with proven BrS and 30 healthy controls. Twenty-six
   patients had a spontaneous diagnostic type 1 BrS ECG; the remainder had
   a type 1 response to ajmaline provocation. Left and right ventricular
   volumes and dimensions were assessed and compared with respect to ECG
   pattern.
   RESULTS The right ventricular outflow tract area was significantly
   enlarged in patients with a spontaneous type 1 ECG compared to patients
   with a nondiagnostic resting ECG or controls (11 cm(2), 9 cm(2), and 9
   cm(2), respectively, P < .05). Patients with a spontaneous type 1 BrS
   ECG revealed significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction than
   did patients with a nondiagnostic resting ECG and controls (56 +/- 5 vs
   59 +/- 5 vs 60 +/- 4, respectively, P < .05) and significantly lower
   right ventricular ejection fraction (54 +/- 5 vs 59 +/- 5, P = .001) as
   well as end-systolic volumes compared to controls (34 +/- 9 mL/m(2) vs
   28 +/- 79 mL/m(2), P = .02).
   CONCLUSION Patients with a spontaneous type 1 BrS ECG reveal
   significantly functional and morphological alterations in both the left
   and right ventricles compared to patients with basal nondiagnostic ECG
   or controls.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a multifunctional
   proinflammatory cytokine, which is a critical inflammatory mediator
   involved in aging and neurodegenerative diseases of aging. Previous work
   has shown that diets enriched with antioxidants reduce levels of the
   cytokine TNF-alpha and improve classical eyeblink conditioning
   performance. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that the proinflamatory
   cytokine TNF-alpha may be a critical factor that modulates classical
   conditioning behavior. If increased levels of endogenous cerebellar
   TNF-alpha negatively affect performance on the eyeblink conditioning
   task in aged rats, then exogenous administration of TNF-alpha in young
   rats should result in an impaired acquisition and/or retention of
   eyeblink conditioning memory. On the other hand, the reduction or
   blockage of the age-related increase in cerebellar TNF-alpha levels in
   aged rats should result in an improvement in memory. Young (3 month old)
   F344 rats were pretreated with an intracerebellar injection of
   recombinant rat (rr) TNF-alpha or denatured (rr) TNF-alpha prior to
   eyeblink conditioning coupled to microdialysis. The results showed that
   young rats treated with rrTNF-alpha have a decreased rate of learning
   compared to the control group. Norepinephrine which has been shown to
   play a critical role in cerebellar learning tasks presented a shift on
   training day one of young rats resembling that observed in aged rats. In
   a second experiment aged (22 month old) F344 rats were pretreated with
   intracerebellar microinjection of anti-rat TNF-alpha three times a week
   for 4 weeks prior to eyeblink conditioning training couple to
   microdialysis. Aged rats showed a better performance in the conditioned
   responses when compared to controls. The release of norepinephrine in
   this group reached basal levels sooner than the control group but not as
   early as the young rats. The results of these experiments demonstrate a
   critical correlation between TNF-alpha and the rate of learning and the
   pattern of NE release during eyeblink conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was conducted to examine recent trends in ovarian
   cancer incidence and mortality and secular trends in demographic factors
   in Korea.
   Methods: With the data from Korea Central Cancer Registry, International
   Agency for Research on Cancer, Korean Death Registry, and World Health
   Organization's Statistical Information System, we calculated
   age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for ovarian cancer. Also
   we estimated future incidence of ovarian and cervical cancer using
   linear regression model. To assess the demographic trend, data from
   national surveys in Korea or results from published papers were
   searched.
   Results: Ovarian cancer incidence rate was similar to that in women
   worldwide but lower than those in Western countries, and the trend has
   been increased steadily. Ovarian cancer-related mortality rates have
   been increasing in Korea, even though those in western and some Asian
   countries, such as China, have been decreasing. Age-specific incidence
   rate and mortality rate showed steep increases with advancing age. The
   incidence rate of ovarian cancer was estimated to surpass that of
   uterine cervix cancer in 2015. Korea showed rapid changes in
   nutritional, reproductive, and anthropometric factors.
   Conclusion: These recent trends in ovarian cancer incidence and
   mortality may be partly attributed to gradual westernizing of life
   styles and to changes in socio-demographic behavior factors. In
   particular, the increasing trend in ovarian cancer mortality in Korea
   may be attributed to a real rise in mortality as well as, in part, a
   decline in misclassification bias related to an increase in the
   proportion of deaths confirmed by physician diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{The intermediate filament protein, nestin, is a widely employed marker
   of multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs). Recent in vitro studies have
   implicated nestin in a number of cellular processes, but there is no
   data yet on its in vivo function. Here, we report the construction and
   functional characterization of Nestin knockout mice. We found that these
   mice show embryonic lethality, with neuroepithelium of the developing
   neural tube exhibiting significantly fewer NSCs and much higher levels
   of apoptosis. Consistent with this in vivo observation, NSC cultures
   derived from knockout embryos show dramatically reduced self-renewal
   ability that is associated with elevated apoptosis but no overt defects
   in cell proliferation or differentiation. Unexpectedly, nestin
   deficiency has no detectable effect on the integrity of the
   cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the knockout of Vimentin, which abolishes
   nestin's ability to polymerize into intermediate filaments in NSCs, does
   not lead to any apoptotic phenotype. These data demonstrate that nestin
   is important for the proper survival and self-renewal of NSCs, and that
   this function is surprisingly uncoupled from nestin's structural
   involvement in the cytoskeleton. STEM CELLS 2010; 28: 2162-2171}},

Abstract = {{The International Thermanuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) tokamak
   device is composed of 9 vacuum vessel (VV)/toroidal field coils
   (TFCs)/vacuum vessel thermal shields (VVTS) 40 degrees sectors. Each
   VV/TFCs/VVTS 40 degrees sector is made up of one 40 degrees VV, two 20
   degrees TFCs and associated VVTS segments. The 40 degrees sectors are
   sub-assembled at assembly hall respectively and then nine 40 degrees
   sectors sub-assembled at assembly hall are finally assembled at tokamak
   in-pit hall.
   The assembly strategy and tools for the 40 degrees sector sub-assembly
   and final assembly should be developed to satisfy the basic assembly
   requirements of the ITER tokamak device. Accordingly, the purpose-built
   assembly tools should be designed and manufactured considering assembly
   plan, available space, cost, safety, easy operation, efficient
   maintenance, and so on. The 40 degrees sector assembly tools are
   classified into 2 groups. One group is the sub-assembly tools including
   upending tool, lifting tool, sub-assembly tool, VV supports and bracing
   tools used at assembly hall and the other group is the in-pit assembly
   tools including lifting tool, central column, radial beams and their
   supports.
   This paper describes the current status of the assembly strategy and
   major tools for the VV/TFCs/VVTS 40 degrees sector assembly at in-pit
   hall and assembly hall. The conceptual design of the major assembly
   tools and assembly process at assembly hall and tokamak in-pit hall are
   presented also. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A relative navigation and formation control algorithm for satellite
   formation flying was developed, and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
   simulation testbed was established and configured to evaluate this
   algorithm. The algorithm presented is a relative navigation estimation
   algorithm using double-difference carrier-phase and single-difference
   code measurements based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In
   addition, a state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique is
   utilized as a nonlinear controller for the formation control problem.
   The state-dependent coefficient (SDC) form is formulated to include
   nonlinearities in the relative dynamics. To evaluate the relative
   navigation and control algorithms developed, a closed-loop H I L testbed
   is configured. To demonstrate the performance of the testbed, a test
   formation flying scenario comprising formation acquisition and keeping
   in a low earth orbit (LEO) has been established. The relative navigation
   results from the closed-loop simulations show that a 3D RMS of 0.07 in
   can be achieved for position accuracy. The targeted leader follower
   formation flying in the along-track separation of 100 m was maintained
   with a mean position error of approximately 0.2 m and a standard
   deviation of 0.9 m. The simulation results show that the NIL testbed is
   capable of successful demonstration of the GPS-based satellite
   autonomous formation flying mission. (C) 2010 COSPAR. Published by

Abstract = {{Elevators are devices that demand a high safety requirement. The
   elevator faults affect not only the operations of other assets but may
   also result in serious injuries or even death. Consequently, an elevator

   inspection, which is a technique for systematic decision-making to
   identify likely failed components and its consequences, is proposed for
   elevator maintenance due to a trade-off between economics and safety.
   The proposed technique is evaluated by using Korean disaster and failure

   effective technique for elevator maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{The 3D architecture of the mandible contributes to the functional and
   morphological characteristics of the lower one third of craniofacial
   region. The mandible has six distinct functional units, and its
   architecture is the sum of balanced growth of each functional unit and
   surrounding matrix. A dentofacial deformity (DFD) with malocclusion can
   be interpreted as their unbalanced growth. In order to characterize the
   mandibular 3D architecture, we analyzed the 3D reconstructed computed
   tomography (CT) images in terms of functional units. We evaluated both
   sides of 30 datasets of 3D CT scans of normal controls (N = 6) and
   patients with prognathic (N = 17) or retrognathic (N = 7) mandibles. We
   first identified and evaluated reference points to define mandibular
   functional units and compared their linear and angular measurements of
   DFD with normal group. The condylar and body length, the ratio of
   condyle/coronoid length, and the condylar head axis angle showed the
   statistically significant differences between groups. From these
   results, we could define the 3D reference points for functional units
   and identify the 3D architectural characteristics of DFD mandibles.
   These models may help us improve diagnosis and treatment planning to let
   them return to the normal and balanced architecture for DFD.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that a system composed of several randomly
   interdependent networks is extremely vulnerable to random failure.
   However, real interdependent networks are usually not randomly
   interdependent, rather pairs of dependent nodes are coupled according to
   some regularity which we coin inter-similarity. For example, we study a
   system composed of an interdependent world wide port network and a world
   wide airport network and show that well-connected ports tend to couple
   with well-connected airports. We introduce two quantities for measuring
   the level of inter-similarity between networks: i) the inter
   degree-degree correlation (IDDC); ii) the inter-clustering coefficient
   (ICC). We then show both by simulation models and by analyzing the
   port-airport system that as the networks become more inter-similar the
   system becomes significantly more robust to random failure.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella spp. is considered to be the most common bacterial zoonoses
   but although its significance and prevalence in food animals have been
   well-studied, its role in companion animals is less elucidated. To
   determine whether apparently healthy dogs can carry and shed
   salmonellae, a total of 62 fecal swabs were collected and tested for the
   presence of Salmonella spp. using conventional isolation procedures and
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Each sample was initially enriched in
   brain heart infusion (BHI) broth at 42 degrees C. For conventional
   isolation, these were subsequently plated on xylose lysine deoxycholate
   (XLD) agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Alkaline colonies
   with jet black center were picked, purified and biochemically tested.
   For PCR, DNA from each sample was extracted and the target sequence was
   subsequently amplified using the Salmonella DAS Kit (TM) (BIOTECH,
   UPLB). Salmonella spp. were detected in both conventional
   microbiological procedures (1 out of 62 or 1.6\%) and PCR (26 out of 62
   or 42\%) of the samples tested. These results indicate that apparently
   healthy dogs can be carriers and shedders of potentially zoonotic
   salmonellae, and that PCR can be an effective means of detecting the
   said pathogen in canine fecal samples. Further work on isolation,
   serotyping, and molecular characterization of isolates are recommended
   to confirm the viability and nature of salmonellae carried by dogs and
   establish the role of this species in the epidemiology of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Use of biosutures in animal models of colonic anastomoses is
   associated with decreased adhesions without affecting anastomotic
   strength This study aimed to evaluate the effect of biosutures on
   colonic anastomoses kept free of adhesions by peritoneal instillation of
   icodextrin 4\%
   Methods Three types of colonic anastomoses were compared group 1,
   anastomoses without icodextrin 4\% and control suture, group 2,
   anastomoses with icodextrin 4\% (adhesion-free anastomoses) and control
   suture, and group 3, anastomoses with icodextrin 4\% (adhesion-free
   anastomoses) and biosutures Dehiscence, adhesion formation, and
   anastomotic strength were evaluated on day 4 after the operation
   Results When peritoneal icodextrin 4\% was used in anastomoses with
   conventional sutures, a decrease in the adhesion index (P=0 01) and a
   lower bursting pressure (P=0 15) were observed When adhesion-free
   anastomoses were compared, those performed with biosutures had a higher
   bursting pressure (P=0 008) and a similar pattern of adhesion index (P=0
   48)
   Conclusions Biosutures improve the strength of adhesion-free colonic
   anastomoses}},

Abstract = {{The effect of Chenopodium quinoa seeds on lipid profile, glucose level,
   protein metabolism and selected essential elements (Na, K, Ca, Mg) level
   was determined in high-fructose fed male Wistar rats. Fructose decreased
   significantly LDL {[}42\%, p < 0.01] and activity of alkaline
   phosphatase {[}20\%, p < 0.05], and increased triglycerides level
   {[}86\%, p < 0.01]. The analysis of blood of rats fed quinoa indicated,
   that these seeds effectively reduced serum total cholesterol {[}26\%, p
   < 0.05], LDL {[}57\%, p < 0.008] and triglycerides {[}11\%, p < 0.05]
   when compared to the control group. Quinoa seeds also significantly
   reduced the level of glucose {[}10\%, p < 0.01] and plasma total protein
   level {[}16\%, p < 0.001]. Fructose significantly decreased HDL {[}15\%,
   p < 0.05] level in control group but when the quinoa seeds were added
   into the diet the decrease of HDL level was inhibited. Quinoa seeds did
   not prevent any adverse effect of increasing triglyceride level caused
   by fructose. It was shown in this study that quinoa seeds can reduce
   most of the adverse effects exerted by fructose on lipid profile and
   glucose level.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The DEX/CRH test has been proposed to be suitable as a
   biomarker for the prediction of treatment response in depression.
   Methods: We performed the DEX/CRH test in 10 severely depressed male
   patients with melancholic features before initiation of antidepressant
   treatment with 20 mg fluoxetine.
   Results: We found a low cortisol response (as measured by cortisol AUC)
   to a single DEX/CRH test to be associated with clinical response to
   treatment.
   Conclusions: A strength of this study lies in the inclusion of patients
   after a drug wash-out phase. Despite a certain inconsistency described
   in the literature, several studies support the notion that it might be
   of importance to measure baseline HPA system activity before choice of
   treatment. Further systematic studies are warranted. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This work was carried out to evaluate the use of Bacillus subtilis
   probiotic C-3102 (10(10)cfu/g) in diets with or without growth promoters
   on the performance of broilers in the period from 1 to 42 days of age.
   It was used 1,200 Cobb line broilers, distributed in a complete
   randomized block with five diets: negative controller (without
   promoters); Bacillus subtilis (30 g/t ration); Bacillus subtilis (50 g/t
   ration); Bacillus subtilis (30 g/t ration) + colistin (10 ppm);
   avilamycin (10 ppm) + colistin (10 ppm). Each diet was evaluated in 10
   repetitions with 24 birds. From 21 to 42 days of age, feed intake,
   weight gain and feed conversion were evaluated, and at 42 days of age,
   productive efficiency index was evaluated. At the end of the
   experimental period, it was observed an increase in the consumption of
   diet with the lowest dose of Bacillus subtilis (30 g) in relation to
   that one with Bacillus subtillis (30 g) + colistin (10 ppm). The values
   of weight gain obtained with the diet with the lowest dose of Bacillus
   subtillis (30 g) and with avilamycin (10 ppm) + colistine (10 ppm) were
   higher than those of the birds fed control diet (without promoters). For
   feed conversion, the best results were obtained by supplying diets
   containing 50 g of Bacillus subtillis, diet with 30 g of Bacillus
   subtillis + 10 ppm of colistin; and diet with 10 ppm of avilamycin + 10
   ppm colistin. For the analysis of productive efficiency index, the best
   results were obtained with diets containing additives (probiotics and/or
   antibiotics) in comparison to the control diet. Bacillus subtillis
   C-3102 probiotic, at concentration 10(10) cfu/g, is an efficient
   substitute of antibiotics.}},

Abstract = {{A series of low-band-gap (LBG) donor-accepor conjugated main-chain
   copolymers (P1-P4) containing planar 2,7-carbazole as electron donors
   and bithiazole units (4,4'-dihexyl-2,2'-bithiazole and
   4,4'-dihexyl-5,5'-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,2'-bithiazole) as electron
   acceptors were synthesized and studied for the applications in bulk
   heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The effects of electron deficient
   bithiazole units on the thermal, optical, electrochemical, and
   photovoltaic (PV) properties of these LBG copolymers were investigated.
   Absorption spectra revealed that polymers P1-P4 exhibited broad
   absorption bands in UV and visible regions from 300 to 600 nm with
   optical band gaps in the range of 1.93-1.99 eV, which overlapped with
   the major region of the solar emission spectrum. Moreover,
   carbazole-based polymers P1-P4 showed low values of the highest occupied
   molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, which provided good air stability and
   high open circuit voltages (V-oc) in the PV applications. The BHJ PV
   devices were fabricated using polymers P1-P4 as electron donors and
   (6,6)-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or
   (6,6)-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as electron
   acceptors in different weight ratios. The PV device bearing an active
   layer of polymer blend P4:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w) showed the best power
   conversion efficiency value of 1.01\% with a short circuit current
   density (J(sc)) of 4.83 mA/cm(2), a fill factor (FF) of 35\%, and V-oc -

Abstract = {{Marie de Gournay's poetic treatises and epic translations highlight her
   disgust at seeing the stylistic concept of douceur overly feminized in
   the verse of her Malherbian contemporaries. For Gournay this had
   rendered French poetry incapable of cognitive complexity. Gournay
   developed a new understanding of douceur through the notions of esprit
   and vigueur: a poetic style influenced by the Pleiade and by Montaigne.
   Gournay attempted to foreground douceur in complex metaphor rather than
   in euphony and rationalized clarity; she privileged forceful, oratorical
   vehemence rather than purely conciliatory discourse. Gournay dismissed
   her contemporaries' conception of douceur as mollesse, a pejorative vice
   commonly associated with women in her day. Conversely, douceur rendered
   through esprit and vigueur appears at first to privilege qualities more
   readily associated with men. However, in her search for `vraye douceur'
   through the medium of Virgilian epic, Gournay shows that esprit and
   vigueur may be associated with ideals of masculinity and femininity -
   indeed, classical decorum should lead us to expect no less. Inspired by
   Virgil, yet also anticipating the femme forte of the 1640s, Gournay
   depicts a Venus who is douce yet vigorous, suggesting the possibility of
   a gender-neutral style for French verse.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Intraabdominal vascular injury (IAVI) as a result of
   penetrating and blunt trauma carries a high mortality rate. This study
   was performed to compare current mortality rates with a previously
   reported historic control.
   Methods: The experience at our institution from 1970 to 1981 was
   previously reported with an overall mortality rate of 32\% in 112
   patients with penetrating IAVI. In a retrospective analysis, this
   historic cohort was compared with 248 patients with penetrating and
   blunt IAVI during a 138-month interval ending in June 2007.
   Results: Overall mortality rate was 28.6\%. The most commonly injured
   arteries were the iliac artery, aorta, and superior mesenteric artery.
   The most commonly injured veins were the inferior vena cava, iliac vein,
   and portal vein. Injury to the aorta, IVC, and portal vein had the
   highest mortality rates of 67.8\%, 42.1\%, and 66.6\%, respectively. One
   hundred forty-four patients with one vessel injured had a mortality rate
   of 18.7\%, whereas those with more than one vessel injured had a
   mortality rate of 48.7\% (p < 0.001). A total of 46\% of 117 patients in
   shock died compared with 9.6\% of 104 patients not in shock (p < 0.001).
   Patients with a base deficit of less than -15 had a mortality rate of
   72\%, whereas those with a base deficit of 0 to -15 (p < 0.001) had a
   mortality rate of 18.9\%. There was no difference in the overall
   mortality rate for penetrating trauma compared with the previous study.
   Conclusions: Although over 20 years have passed, no significant changes
   have occurred in the mortality associated with IAVI. Patients presenting
   in shock with IAVI continue to have a high mortality rate.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Manual hyperinflation (MH) can be performed as part of
   airway management in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients to
   mobilize airway secretions. Although previous studies demonstrated MH to
   be associated with hemodynamic and respiratory instability, we
   hypothesized MH to cause fewer adverse events (AEs) when performed by
   experienced and trained nurses in stable critically ill patients.
   Methods. The incidence and type of AEs associated with MH were studied
   in a 28-bed mixed medical-surgical Intensive Care Unit. A difference in
   mean arterial pressure (MAP) or heart rate (HR) >15\%, a decrease in
   peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) >5\%, and a change in end-tidal
   (et)-CO2 >20\% were considered AEs. A decrease of MAP to mmHg, any new
   arrhythmia, and a decrease of SpO2 <= 90\% were all considered severe
   AEs. Also, all changes in medication were considered severe AEs.
   Results. A total of 107 MH maneuvers in 74 patients, performed by 57
   nurses, were observed and analyzed. A total of 17 MH maneuvers (16\%)
   were associated with any AE; 7 maneuvers (6\%) were associated with a
   severe AE. Overall, MH did not affect MAP. MH caused a statistically
   significant but clinically irrelevant increase of HR (from 87 +/- 24 to
   89 +/- 22 bpm). In one patient the MAP dropped from 70 mmHg to 60 mmHg,
   requiring adjustment of vasopressor therapy; one patient developed
   ventricular tachycardia requiring electric cardioversion. In general, MH
   did not affect SpO2. In one patient SpO2 dropped below 90\%, requiring
   additional oxygen supply for 10 minutes. MH caused a statistically
   significant but clinically irrelevant increase of et-CO2 levels (from
   4.4 +/- 0.9 to 4.5 +/- 1.0 kPa). Five patients developed
   anxiety/agitation during or shortly after MH, mandating additional
   sedation in four patients. Occurrence of (severe) AEs was not associated
   with any specific patient or MH characteristic.
   Conclusion. The rate of hemodynamic and respiratory AEs with MH is low
   when performed by experienced and trained nurses in stable, critically
   ill patients. MH, however, may induce or increase anxiety/agitation. We
   consider MH a safe maneuver in stable ICU patients in our setting.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an in-detail investigation of the possible
   advantages related to the use of the pseudospectral (PS) method for the
   efficient description of the carrier quantization in nanoscale n- and

   the finite-difference (FD) and PS methods, self-consistent
   Schrodinger-Poisson solvers for both a 2-D hole gas described by a k . p
   Hamiltonian (suitable for p-MOSFETs) and a 1-D electron gas in the
   effective-mass approximation (for n-type fin-shaped FETs and nanowire
   FETs). The PS and FD methods have been systematically compared in terms
   of the CPU time and the number of discretization points by monitoring
   not only the subband energies in the low-dimensional carrier gas but
   also the calculation of some scattering matrix elements that are
   critically important for the transport modeling. Our results indicate a
   remarkable reduction in the CPU time for the PS method with respect to
   the FD method, which makes the PS method very attractive for the
   modeling of the carrier quantization in nanoscale MOSFETs.}},

Title = {{PTEN-loss and nuclear atypia of EIN in endometrial biopsies can predict

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether nuclear
   atypia or PTEN-loss in endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN),
   could help to predict in endometrial curettage material, the prevalence
   of concurrent carcinoma in hysterectomy specimens.
   Materials and methods. This retrospective single-institution study
   included women who were diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia (simple
   or complex) and underwent hysterectomy within 12 weeks from the initial
   diagnosis without interval treatment. All endometrial curettage slides
   were reviewed by three experienced pathologists and only cases that
   fulfilled the criteria of EIN were used for further analysis. For each
   case, the nuclear atypia and the immunohistochemically detected
   expression of PTEN were evaluated. The hysterectomy slides were also
   reviewed and the findings were used in the subsequent analysis.
   Results. Out of 83 cases that were enrolled in the study, 33 (39.76\%),
   had a concurrent endometrial carcinoma. Nuclear atypia in EIN cases with
   a final histology of endometrial cancer was found in 31 out of 33 cases
   (93.94\%) but only in 27 out of 50 benign cases (54\%). There was no
   PTEN-loss in 8 out of 33 EIN cases (24.24\%) that proved to be cancer
   and 22 out of 50 EIN cases (44\%) that proved to be benign. Either
   atypia or PTEN-loss or both were found in 33/33 (100\%) cancer cases and
   in 39/50 (78\%) benign cases; this difference was statistically
   significant (Fisher exact test, p<0.05).
   Conclusion. PTEN-loss, as an independent variable, was not found to be a
   predictor of endometrial cancer in the final histology. However,
   biopsies presented with EIN, featuring nuclear atypia and recognized as
   PTEN-null are more likely to be finally diagnosed with endometrial
   cancer. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of
   angiogenesis inhibition by bevacizumab, a monoclonal anti-vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, on the healing process of
   colonic anastomoses in rats, assessing some specific involved factors
   This new agent is used mainly in metastatic colorectal cancer The
   angiogenesis plays an important role in both wound healing and
   metastatic invasion and spread of malignant cells There has not been any
   evidence assessing the optimal time for its safe use in operated
   patients
   Materials and methods Forty Wistar rats were randomly allocated into
   four equal groups A colonic anastomosis was performed in all rats Half
   of them received intraoperatively a single dose of bevacizumab 5 mg/body
   weight and the rest received placebo The animals were sacrificed on the
   7th (Avastin 7th, placebo 7th) and 14th (Avastin 14th, placebol 4th)
   postoperative day The anastomosis was resected and sent for histological
   study and for tissue biochemical assays (VEGF, endothelin-1 (ET-1),
   C-reactive protein (CRP), prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB),
   carbonylated proteins, hydroxyproline) using specific enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay kits For statistical analysis, the Mann-Whitney U
   test was used (of statistical significance when P<0 05)
   Results No complication or anastomotic dehiscence was observed Histology
   did not reveal statistically significant differences between groups
   concerning degree of inflammation, fibroblasts, collagen, and fibrosis
   Likewise, hydroxyproline levels did not differ However, some
   statistically significant differences were found in VEGF, CRP and
   carbonyl proteins (Avastin 7th vs placebo 7th, placebo 14th vs placebo
   7th), ET-1, and PAB (Avastin 14th vs Avastin 7th), which did not finally
   affect the collagen synthesis marker hydroxyproline, nor did the
   anastomotic strength
   Conclusions Bevacizumab, when administered intraoperatively, has no
   significant effect on colon anastomotic healing in rats despite a
   transient mild ischemia}},

Abstract = {{Given the severity and early onset of pediatric bipolar disorder, early
   intervention is important to bring about recovery and alter the course
   of the illness. There is a new and burgeoning body of literature on the
   biological basis of early signs of the illness and the mechanistic
   understanding of treatment interventions. Biological findings based on
   multimodal imaging, genomic studies of cellular proteins, and
   performance-based findings of neurocognitive studies are beginning to
   assemble a cohesive and interlinked model of systems neuroscience. This
   offers the promise of identifying biomarkers, predictors of illness, and
   treatment outcomes. In complement, at the tier of clinical application
   is a multitude of efficacy trials, yet neither a single medication nor a
   combination of choices seems to suffice in reality. The current review
   develops a point of view bridging scientific developments to where
   comprehensive, multipronged treatment strategies find their clinical
   application-a model that is similarly applicable in adult bipolar
   disorder.}},

Title = {{Evidence of widespread degraded Amazonian-aged ice-rich deposits in the
   transition between Elysium Rise and Utopia Planitia, Mars: Guidelines
   for the recognition of degraded ice-rich materials}},
Journal = {{PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Widespread deposits surrounding mesas, in craters and in valley systems
   are observed in the transition zone between the Elysium Rise and the
   Utopia Planitia Basin. They are characterized by their relatively high
   albedo, the presence of ring-mold crater (RMC) morphologies and their
   pitted surfaces, with textures ranging from lineations and
   fish-scale-patterns to widely distributed knobs. These deposits are
   interpreted to be modified ice-rich material in the form of degraded
   deposits of concentric crater fill (CCF), lineated valley fill (LVF) and
   lobate debris aprons (LDA). The degraded CCF deposits are observed from
   31.2-40 degrees N, 138-150 degrees E over an elevation range of almost 9
   km. This wide-ranging distribution demonstrates that degraded ice-rich
   deposits exist at every altitude and latitude in the study area,
   indicating that icy mantle materials were initially deposited over
   extensive areas and were stable over a long time period, allowing the
   deposits to coexist and interact with different processes under very
   different conditions. The degraded LDA deposits represent the largest
   unit of modified ice-rich material, with an area of similar to 15,700
   km(2), and are populated with a range of ring-mold crater morphologies
   that is interpreted to be related to a degradational sequence between
   previously described RMC and newly observed RMCs that appear to be more
   degraded. A distinctive frequency difference in the distribution of
   normal and degraded RMCs permits an evaluation of different degradation
   stages of the LDA deposits: we show how an RMC distribution can be used
   as a key tool for evaluation of altered LDA, LVF and CCF deposits. Taken
   together, these observations suggest that ice-rich material has played a
   major role in shaping the present-day landscape in the transition zone
   between the Elysium Rise and the Utopia Planitia Basin, and they provide
   a link for understanding Amazonian-aged degradation processes of
   ice-rich deposits in an area with no significant topographic relief. (C)

Abstract = {{Within the framework of the Pan-European project about the geochemistry
   of bottled mineral waters in Europe launched in 2007 by the European
   Geological Surveys (EGS) Geochemistry Expert Group fourteen brands of
   bottled natural waters from Croatia of both mineral and spring types
   were evaluated for getting more coherent spatial information about the
   natural variation of element concentration in bottled waters found at
   the European market. Results of chemical analysis show that not a single
   one out of fourteen analyzed bottled waters from Croatia exceeds the
   Croatian water standards sanctioning thereby their suitability for human
   consumption. Also, statistical tests performed for 41 analytes
   (including pH and EC) clearly show that the water chemistry is in a high
   degree of conformity with regional geology, depending on structural,
   stratigraphic and, above all, lithological diversity of aquifers. Thus
   Dinaric and Pannonian parts of Croatia differ largely with regard to
   their water types: Dinaric region is completely lacking mineral water
   types while, on the other side, in the Pannonian region even the spring
   waters show stronger mineralization in comparison with their Dinaric
   counterparts. Typically, all natural waters from Croatia bear the
   bicarbonate (HCO3) signature. However, Ca-Mg cation pair combination is
   characteristic of spring waters while Na-K dominates in the mineral
   waters. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of bisaryldiketene derivatives were designed and synthesized as

   interactions were further evaluated by FRET, ITC, and PCR stop assay. In
   contrast to most of the G-quadruplex ligands reported so far, which
   comprise an extended aromatic ring, these compounds are neither
   polycyclic nor macrocyclic, but have a non-aromatic and relative
   flexible linker between two quinoline moieties enabling the conformation
   of compounds to be flexible. Our results showed that these
   bisaryldiketene derivatives could selectively recognize G-quadruplex DNA
   rather than binding to duplex DNA. Moreover, they showed promising
   discrimination between different G-quadruplex DNA. The primary binding
   affinity of ligand M2 for c-myc G-quadruplex DNA was over 200 times
   larger than that for telomere G-quadruplex DNA. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Detection of pathogenic bacteria and viruses require strategies that can
   signal the presence of these targets in near real-time due to the
   potential threats created by rapid dissemination into water and/or food
   supplies In this paper, we report an innovative strategy that can
   rapidly detect bacterial pathogens using reporter sequences found in
   their genome without requiring polymerase chain reaction (PCR) A pair of
   strain-specific primers was designed based on the 168 rRNA gene and were
   end-labeled with a donor (Cy5) or acceptor (Cy5 5) dye In the presence
   of the target bacterium, the primers were joined using a ligase
   detection reaction (LDR) only when the primers were completely
   complementary to the target sequence to form a reverse molecular beacon
   (rMB), thus bringing Cy5 (donor) and Cy5 5 (acceptor) into close
   proximity to allow fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to
   occur These rMBs were subsequently analyzed using single molecule
   detection of the FRET pairs (single-pair FRET, spFRET) The LDR was

Abstract = {{A 56-year-old man with lifelong trauma-induced blisters, nail dystrophy

   eruption. Clinicopathologically, he had evidence of both an inherited
   and an acquired blistering disorder: non-Herlitz junctional
   epidermolysis bullosa (nHJEB) and bullous pemphigoid (BP). HIstological
   examination of a skin biopsy found reduced (but not absent) collagen
   XVII in nonlesional skin, in vivo bound anticollagen XVII antibodies in
   perilesional skin, and prominent eosinophils in perilesional and
   lesional skin, with subepidermal blistering. Circulating anticollagen
   XVII antibodies were also present. Treatment with oral corticosteroids
   and mycophenolate mofetil led to clinical control of the BP but had no
   effect on the mechanobullous blistering. Our patient is unusual in that
   his skin retains some labelling for collagen XVII rather than having the
   complete absence of immunoreactivity expected in patients with
   generalized nHJEB. Moreover, we were unable to identify any pathogenic
   mutations in the COL17A1 gene encoding collagen XVII (or in other
   EB-associated basement membrane genes). It is plausible that the
   long-term consequences of basement membrane disruption in our patient,
   perhaps associated with atypical inherited COL17A1 pathology, might
   result in a conformationally altered and more immunogenic protein with
   the subsequent development of anticollagen XVII antibodies and BP as a
   secondary pathology}},

Abstract = {{A large series of A.A. Dorodnicyn's works deals with rigorous

   Numerous problems he studied in these directions are closely related to

   having been published in this journal by this paper's authors and their
   coauthors since 1980. This paper describes the results of a series of
   works analyzing the propagation of small perturbations in various
   stratified and/or uniformly rotating inviscid fluids. It is assumed that
   each of the fluids either occupies an unbounded lower half-space with a
   free surface or is a semi-infinite two-component fluid layer. The
   perturbations are excited by a moving source specified as a periodic
   plane wave traveling along the interface of the fluids. Problems for
   five mathematical fluid models are formulated, their explicit analytical
   solutions are constructed, and their existence and uniqueness are
   discussed. The asymptotics of the solution as t -> +infinity are
   studied, and the long-time wave patterns developing in five fluid models
   are compared.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To assess the reliability of computed tomography (CT) to identify the
   direction of implant insertion for cortical screws along the
   longitudinal axis of intact (nonfractured) distal sesamoid bones.
   Study Design
   In vitro study.
   Sample Population
   Cadaveric paired equine forelimbs (n=16).
   Methods
   Insertion of a cortical screw in lag fashion along the longitudinal axis
   of intact (nonfractured) distal sesamoid bones was evaluated in 2 groups
   (3.5 and 4.5 mm) of 8 paired limbs. In each group, the direction of the
   distal sesamoid bone was determined by CT (Equine XTC 3000 pQCT
   scanner). Screw placement was verified by specimen dissection. Implant
   direction was considered satisfactory if the entire screw length was
   within the distal sesamoid bone and not damaging the articular or
   flexural surfaces.
   Results
   In our sample and according to our criteria, the proportion of
   satisfactory direction of screws was 0.63 (5/8) for 4.5 mm implants, and
   0.87 (7/8) for 3.5 mm implants.
   Conclusions
   CT is a useful imaging modality to identify anatomic landmarks for
   insertion of a 3.5 mm cortical screw in the distal sesamoid bone.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the determinants of consumer attitudes toward
   organic products marketed by mainstream retailers under a private label.
   Since organic products are credence goods, consumers cannot directly
   verify whether these products comply with official standards. Organic
   labels are the primary source of consumer trust in organics, but these
   labels must be noticed and understood before consumers will actively
   seek them out. In that some consumers may not prioritize product labels
   when they shop, it is sometimes up to retailers to strengthen consumer
   trust. Within the antecedents of this trust, we isolated the
   contribution of the corporate social responsibility associations held by
   consumers about retailers. We surveyed Italian customers interested in
   organics and found that they are more likely to trust the private-label
   organic products sold by a retailer when it is considered socially
   responsible. Our results also show that consumer trust translates into
   brand loyalty and a willingness to pay a premium price for organic
   products. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP

Abstract = {{Hemicelluloses could be used to replace fossil-based materials in
   several high-value-added products. Today, vast amounts of hemicelluloses
   are discharged from pulp mills all over the world as waste, but these
   could be isolated by membrane filtration, and utilized in various
   applications. In this study, the hemicellulose galactoglucomannan was
   isolated from process water from a thermomechanical pulp mill using
   ultrafiltration. The retention of hemicelluloses and lignin, and the
   flux and fouling of three ultrafiltration membranes (ETNA01, ETNA10 and
   UFX5) were studied at various operating conditions. One of the membranes
   (UFX5) was found to have a high hemicellulose retention (above 90\%)
   independent of flux and pressure. With the ETNA01 membrane it was
   impossible to combine a high flux with high hemicellulose retention,
   while with the ETNA10 membrane the hemicellulose retention could be
   increased above 90\% by running at transmembrane pressures above the
   critical flux. The UFX5 membrane could be used at the temperature of the
   process water in the pulp mill (75-85 degrees C), while the ETNA10
   membrane could only withstand temperatures below 60 degrees C,
   increasing the cost due to the need to cool the process water. However,
   the susceptibility of UFX5 to fouling was much greater than for ETNA10,
   which would increase the cleaning cost of the UFX5 membrane. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Simulations of tungsten armour cracking under small ELM-like plasma heat
   load, which does not cause surface melting, have been performed using
   the PEGASUS-3D code. A dedicated series of experiments have been
   performed in the QSPA-Kh50 facility for measurements of the unknown
   tungsten thermophysical properties and for verification of the
   PEGASUS-3D simulation results.
   The simulations revealed that a cellular crack network with average mesh
   size Lambda similar to 0.5mm formed after first ELMs and the pattern
   does not change further. With increasing number of repetitive ELMs
   loads, the average crack width Delta(n) has a maximum value Delta(m).
   The ratio of Delta(m)/Lambda is equal to the tungsten thermal expansion
   at the maximum surface temperature. Delta(n) tends to this value
   exponentially. The number of ELMs n(m) needed for Delta stabilization
   depends on the ELMs energy density and time duration, n(m) similar to
   300 for the simulated ELMs of 0.45 MJ/m(2) and 0.25 ms duration.
   The PEGASUS-3D code is prepared for simulations of tungsten armour
   damage under action of ELMs of various energy deposition and time
   duration. These parameters of ELMs depend on ITER regimes of operation
   and on how successful will be the efforts on ELMs mitigation. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Cervical cancers are characterized by the persistence of human papilloma
   virus (HPV) genome that is found in tissue samples starting from the
   early stages of tumor progression. Just like in other tumors, the
   activation of telomerase was observed in cervical carcinomas, but
   information about its expression was controversial. The aim of this
   study is to find possible correlations between the presence of HPV
   sequences, activity of telomerase and expression of different spliced
   forms of hTERT RNA in cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN). The
   results show that HPV DNA is present in 60\% of normal tissue adjacent
   to CIN lesions and up to 84\% in CIN samples. Telomerase activity was
   found in 28\% of adjacent normal tissue and in 68\% of CIN II-III. hTERT
   RNA that encodes an active enzyme was present almost in all CIN samples.
   Variations in levels of telomerase activity are possibly not regulated
   by the splicing forms of hTERT mRNA with deletions. (C) 2010 Published

Abstract = {{A local weighted least-squares (LS) method is often used to approximate
   a solution function in computational aerodynamics problems. In our paper
   we study LS approximation by a quadratic polynomial on unstructured
   grids that have the high cell aspect ratio. It will be shown in the
   paper that an LS method degrades to unacceptable accuracy on stretched
   meshes and weighting of distant stencil points does not result in a more
   accurate reconstruction. A concept of numerically distant points will be
   employed to explain the reasons behind the method's poor performance and
   an approach will be discussed that allows one to improve the results of
   a quadratic LS reconstruction in a boundary layer region. Copyright (C)

   20-km time trial performance. J Strength Cond Res 24(12): 3265-3269,
   2010-During time trials cyclists start individually with a uniform time
   gap between riders. With the exception of the first and last cyclists
   all riders will chase riders ahead and be chased from behind. The
   purpose of this study was to determine if cycling in a lead or chase
   position would influence 20-km time trial performance. Eight male
   cyclists performed four 20-km indoor time trials. During trial 1 (T(1))
   individuals cycled as fast as possible. Prior to the start of trial 2
   (T(2)) subjects were shown times and rank order from T(1) and attempted
   to improve rank among opponents. After T(2) subjects were ranked again
   and paired with the closest competitor. Subjects were alternately
   positioned to lead (T(L)) and chase (T(C)) in trials 3 and 4. T(L) and
   T(C) were counterbalanced. Means for time, mean power (MP), ratings of
   perceived exertion (RPE), and heart rate (HR) were recorded and pacing
   evenness was compared between trials using deviation scores (power
   variation at designated distances from overall mean). Repeated-measures
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) (alpha = 0.05) indicated no significant
   differences for HR or RPE. For time, T(2) (33.84 +/- 1.38 minutes) was
   significantly faster than T(1) (34.80 +/- 2.25 minutes) and MP was
   significantly greater (T(1) = 229 +/- 36 W, T(2) = 243 +/- 24 W). Time
   for T(C) (33.52 +/- 1.33 minutes) was significantly faster than T(1)
   (34.80 +/- 2.25 minutes). Pacing during T(C) (9 +/- 3 W) was
   significantly more even in comparison to T(L) (12 +/- 1 W). No
   significant difference in performance was detected between T(C) and
   T(L). In conclusion, extrinsic factors (chase vs. lead position) did not
   affect overall performance, even when pacing altered between trials;
   however, differences in performance times may represent meaningful
   differences in competitive settings.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Rhinoconjunctivitis because of tree pollen sensitization is
   common in Northern Europe. Specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is
   the only disease-modifying treatment, but unmodified allergen extracts
   carry a risk of allergic side-effects. Our objective was to examine
   efficacy and safety of a depigmented-polymerized mixed tree pollen
   extract.
   Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 184 tree pollen
   allergic adults was performed. SCIT consisted of four increasing doses
   at 7-day intervals, then maintenance injections every 6 weeks for 18
   months. Primary outcome was combined symptom and medication score during
   the 2008 season. Secondary outcomes included analysis at different
   levels of pollen exposure and a responder analysis. Adverse events were
   classified using the EAACI scale. Birch pollen-specific IgE and IgG(4)
   were measured before and after treatment.
   Results: The combined symptom and medication score of actively treated
   patients was significantly lower than those on placebo (P < 0.04).
   Increased efficacy was seen at high pollen exposure (median score 2.1
   for active {[}IQR 0.7-3.4] vs 4.2 {[}IQR 2.4-5.3] for placebo for days
   with 500 or more pollen grains per m(3), a 50\% reduction, P < 0.01). A
   modified responder analysis revealed 64\% responders in the active and
   32\% in the placebo group (P < 0.01). There were 17 systemic reactions.
   All were mild (grade 1 or 2) and required no treatment. Serum
   birch-specific IgG4 increased in the SCIT group (P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: SCIT with depigmented- polymerized tree pollen extract was
   clinically effective and well tolerated. Responder analysis suggested
   that one-third of patients treated with immunotherapy may not respond.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is usually difficult to resolve the fine details of turbulent flows,
   especially when targeting real-time applications. We present a novel,
   scalable turbulence method that uses a realistic energy model and an
   efficient particle representation that allows for the accurate and
   robust simulation of small-scale detail. We compute transport of
   turbulent energy using a complete two-equation k-epsilon model with
   accurate production terms that allows us to capture anisotropic
   turbulence effects, which integrate smoothly into the base flow. We only
   require a very low grid resolution to resolve the underlying base flow.
   As we offload complexity from the fluid solver to the particle system,
   we can control the detail of the simulation easily by adjusting the
   number of particles, without changing the large scale behavior. In
   addition, no computations are wasted on areas that are not visible. We
   demonstrate that due to the design of our algorithm it is highly
   suitable for massively parallel architectures, and is able to generate
   detailed turbulent simulations with millions of particles at high
   framerates.}},

Abstract = {{The province of Ontario, Canada, has a highly diverse and multicultural
   population. Specialty foods (i.e., foods from different cultures) are
   becoming increasingly available at retail food outlets and foods service
   establishments across the province; as a result, public health
   inspectors (PHIs) are increasingly required to assess the safety of
   foods with which they may be unfamiliar. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the concerns, perceptions, and self-identified needs of PHIs
   in Ontario with regard to specialty foods and food safety information
   resources in languages other than English. A cross-sectional online
   survey of 239 PHIs was conducted between April and June 2009. The study
   found that while some food safety information resources were available
   in languages other than English, fewer than 25\% of respondents (56/239)
   were satisfied with the current availability of these resources. With
   regard to specialty foods, 60\% of respondents (143/239) reported at
   least one specialty food with which they were not confident about their
   current food safety knowledge, and 64\% of respondents (153/239)
   reported at least one specialty food with which they were dissatisfied
   with the current availability of food safety information. Therefore, the
   development of additional food safety information resources for
   specialty foods, and food safety resources in additional languages may
   provide enhanced support to PHIs involved in protecting and promoting a
   safe food supply.}},

Abstract = {{High-speed mobility, high data throughput, and flexibly scalable
   architecture are some of the key advantages of mobile WiMAX (Worldwide
   interoperability for Microwave Access) or wireless metropolitan area
   network, which is now being considered as the initiation of the next
   generation wireless network. Recently, multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) techniques, especially the mature Space-Time Block Codes (STBC)
   scheme, have attracted lots of interest for increasing both transmission
   capacity and quality. Although MIMO for OFDM systems was intensively
   studied in literatures, published works usually demonstrate the system
   performance with a perfect knowledge of channel while channel estimation
   plays a very important role in determining the real performance. This
   paper aims to apply MIMO-STBC with a novel channel estimation method to
   the Downlink-Partial Usage of Subchannels (DL-PUSC) mode of the mobile
   WiMAX system to study the system performance more practically.
   Performance analysis is carried out by simulating the system in many
   mobile channel models recommended by ITU and COST259. The results show
   that MIMO-STBC in 802.16e DL-PUSC provides a great improvement over the
   single-input single-output (SISO) approach and the new channel
   estimation method enhances the performance farther. Up to 15 dB gain
   with STBC and 1-3 dB more with the new channel estimation scheme are
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes two algorithms to balance energy consumption among
   sensor nodes by distributing the workload of image compression tasks
   within a cluster on wireless sensor networks The main point of the
   proposed algorithms is to adopt the energy threshold which is used when
   we implement the exchange and/or assignment of tasks among sensor nodes
   The threshold is well adaptive to the residual energy of sensor nodes
   input image compressed output and network parameters We apply the lapped
   transform technique an extended version of the discrete cosine transform
   and run length encoding before Lempel Ziv Welch coding to the proposed
   algorithms to improve both quality and compression rate in image
   compression scheme We extensively conduct computational experiments to
   verify the our methods and find that the proposed algorithms achieve not
   only balancing the total energy consumption among sensor nodes and thus
   increasing the overall network lifetime but also reducing block noise in
   image compression}},

Abstract = {{The structural and magnetic properties of the LaFe11.3Si1.7 alloy
   synthesized by arc-melting and the LaFe13-xSix (x = 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0)
   series synthesized by high energy ball-milling (BM) have been
   investigated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that an almost
   single 1:13 phase is obtained by BM. No secondary LaFeSi phase was
   observed for ball-milled samples, which is not the case for the
   arc-melting synthesis. Moreover, only 30 min of heat treatment are
   needed for ball-milled LaFe13-xSix alloys in order to obtain single
   phase compounds (30 days in the case of arc-melted compounds). The study
   of the magnetic properties revealed that the Curie temperature increases
   with the Si content whereas the magnetic entropy variation decreases.
   The latter are respectively associated with a change of the Fe-Fe
   exchange energy and a magnetic dilution caused by the substitution of a
   ferromagnetic element by a diamagnetic one. It is shown in this paper
   that BM compounds display similar magnetic behavior as the corresponding
   bulk alloys. This means that this way to prepare LaFe13-xSix compounds
   with giant magnetocaloric effect is cost-effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis (ALS) are overlapping neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations
   in the growth factor progranulin (PGRN) gene cause FTLD, sometimes in
   conjunction with ALS; such mutations are also observed in some ALS
   patients. Most PGRN mutations underlying FTLD are null mutations that
   result in reduced PGRN levels. We investigated PGRN expression in human
   ALS and in mouse models of motor neuron degeneration. Progranulin plasma
   or CSF levels in newly diagnosed ALS patients did not differ from those
   in healthy or disease controls (PGRN mutation-negative FTLD and
   Alzheimer disease patients). In the mutant SOD1(G93A) mouse model of
   ALS, spinal cord PGRN levels were normal in presymptomatic animals but
   increased during the degenerative process. This increase in PGRN
   correlated with enhanced expression of PGRN in microglia. In CSF, PGRN
   levels were normal in presymptomatic and early symptomatic animals, but
   with disease progression, a raise in PGRN was detectable. These data
   indicate that upregulation of PGRN is a marker of the microglial
   response that occurs with progression in motor neuron diseases.}},

   are also presented. A set of phonetic rules describing phonetic context
   observed empirically in spontaneous conversation is also validated with
   the transcription. The corpus has been used for the construction of
   acoustic models and a phonetic dictionary for the construction of a
   speech recognition system. Initial performance results suggest that the

Abstract = {{Using surrogate models outside training data boundaries can be risky and
   subject to significant errors. This paper presents a computationally
   efficient approach to estimate the boundaries of training data inputs in
   surrogate modeling using the Mahalanobis distance (MD). This distance
   can then be used as a threshold for deciding whether or not a particular
   prediction site is within the boundaries of the training data inputs,
   and has the potential of a likelihood/probabilistic interpretation. The
   approach is evaluated using two and four dimensional analytical
   restricted input spaces and a complex biomechanical six dimensional
   problem. The proposed approach: i) gives good approximations for the
   boundaries of the restricted input spaces, ii) exhibits reasonable error
   rates when classifying prediction sites as inside or outside known
   restricted input spaces and iii) reflects expected error trends for
   increasing values of the MDs similar to those obtained using a
   computationally expensive convex hull approach.}},

Abstract = {{We study the SIS and SIRI epidemic models discussing different
   approaches to compute the thresholds that determine the appearance of an
   epidemic disease. The stochastic SIS model is a well known mathematical
   model, studied in several contexts. Here, we present recursively
   derivations of the dynamic equations for all the moments and we derive
   the stationary states of the state variables using the moment closure
   method. We observe that the steady states give a good approximation of
   the quasi-stationary states of the SIS model. We present the relation
   between the SIS stochastic model and the contact process introducing
   creation and annihilation operators. For the spatial stochastic epidemic
   reinfection model SIRI, where susceptibles S can become infected I, then
   recover and remain only partial immune against reinfection R, we present
   the phase transition lines using the mean field and the pair
   approximation for the moments. We use a scaling argument that allow us
   to determine analytically an explicit formula for the phase transition
   lines in pair approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Vortical structures and associated instabilities for flows around the
   Wigley hull for a wide range of drift angles (10A degrees A a parts per
   thousand currency signA alpha a parts per thousand currency sign 60A
   degrees) with free surface are identified and analyzed. Quantitative
   verification and validation are conducted on three systematically
   refined grids with comparison to the experimental data for alpha = 10A
   degrees. Analysis of the flow pattern shows a strong correlation between
   the vortical structures and free-surface wave elevation. For alpha = 10A
   degrees and 30A degrees, the flows remain steady and vortices are
   generated at the keel and fore and aft perpendiculars of the hull. The
   strength and complexity of these vortices increase with increasing
   alpha. At alpha = 45A degrees, flow becomes unsteady without any
   significant change in the main flow pattern. At alpha = 60A degrees, a
   complex and unsteady flow field on the leeward side of the hull is
   formed with a large recirculation region from the aft to the fore end,
   which prevents the flow coming from below the keel from moving up and
   generating the keel vortices observed at lower drift angles. Karman-like
   and helical instabilities are analyzed. The effect of Froude number is
   more apparent for large than for small drift angles.}},

Abstract = {{Entering a new era of high-energy gamma-ray experiments, there is an
   exciting quest for the first detection of gamma-ray emission from
   clusters of galaxies. To complement these observational efforts, we use
   high-resolution simulations of a broad sample of galaxy clusters, and
   follow self-consistent cosmic ray (CR) physics using an improved
   spectral description. We study CR proton spectra as well as the
   different contributions of the pion decay and inverse-Compton emission
   to the total flux and present spectral index maps. We find a universal
   spectrum of the CR component in clusters with surprisingly little
   scatter across our cluster sample. When CR diffusion is neglected, the
   spatial CR distribution also shows approximate universality; it depends
   however on the cluster mass. This enables us to derive a semi-analytic
   model for both the distribution of CRs as well as the pion decay
   gamma-ray emission and the secondary radio emission that results from
   hadronic CR interactions with ambient gas protons. In addition, we
   provide an analytic framework for the inverse-Compton emission that is
   produced by shock-accelerated CR electrons and is valid in the full
   gamma-ray energy range. Combining the complete sample of the brightest
   X-ray clusters observed by ROSAT with our gamma-ray scaling relations,
   we identify the brightest clusters for the gamma-ray space telescope
   Fermi and current imaging air Cerenkov telescopes (IACTs) (MAGIC, HESS,
   VERITAS). We reproduce the previous result of Pfrommer, but provide
   somewhat more conservative predictions for the fluxes in the energy
   regimes of Fermi and IACTs when accounting for the bias of `artificial
   galaxies' in cosmological simulations. We find that it will be
   challenging to detect cluster gamma-ray emission with Fermi after the
   second year but this mission has the potential of constraining
   interesting values of the shock acceleration efficiency after several
   years of surveying. Comparing the predicted emission from our
   semi-analytic model to that obtained by means of our scaling relations,
   we find that the gamma-ray scaling relations underpredict, by up to an
   order of magnitude, the flux from cool-core clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Sliding mode control approaches are developed to stabilize a class of
   linear uncertain fractional-order dynamics. After making a suitable
   transformation that simplifies the sliding manifold design, two sliding
   mode control schemes are presented. The first one is based on the
   conventional discontinuous first-order sliding mode control technique.
   The second scheme is based on the chattering-free second-order sliding
   mode approach that leads to the same robust performance but using a
   continuous control action. Simple controller tuning formulas are
   constructively developed along the paper by Lyapunov analysis. The
   simulation results confirm the expected performance. Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The effects of insect defoliators on throughfall and soil nutrient
   fluxes were studied in coniferous and deciduous stands at five UK
   intensive monitoring plots (1998 to 2008) Links were found between the
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) fluxes
   through the forest system to biological activity within the canopy
   Underlying soil type determined the leaching or accumulation of these
   elements Under oak monitored at two sites frass from caterpillars of
   Tortrix viridana and Operophtera brumata added direct deposition of -16
   kg ha(-1) extra N during defoliation Peaks of nitrate (NO3-N) flux
   between 5 and 9 kg ha(-1) (x5 usual winter values) were recorded in
   consecutive years in shallow soil waters Synchronous rises in deep soil
   NO3-N fluxes at the Grizedale sandy site indicate downward flushing not
   seen at the clay site Under three Sitka spruce stands generation of
   honeydew (DOC) was attributed to two aphid species (Elatobium abietinum
   and Clara pilicornis) with distinctive feeding strategies Throughfall
   DOC showed mean annual fluxes (6 seasons) similar to 45-60 kg ha(-1)
   compared with rainfall values of 14-22 kg ha(-1) Increases of total N in
   throughfall and NO3-N fluxes in shallow soil solution were detected soil
   water fluxes reached 8 kg ha(-1) in Llyn Brianne similar to 25 kg ha(-1)
   in Tummel and similar to 40 kg NO3-N ha(-1) in Coalburn At Tummel on
   sandy soil NO3-N leaching showed increased concentration at depth
   attributed to microbiological activity within the soil By contrast at
   Coalburn and Llyn Brianne sites on peaty gleys soil water NO3-N was
   retained mostly within the humus layer Soil type is thus key to
   predicting N movement and retention patterns These long term analyses

Abstract = {{The Crandall CanyonMine, Utah, collapse in 2007 August resulted in a
   total of nine fatalities. We processed data from the ALOS satellite
   acquired before and after the collapse to quantify surface subsidence
   associated with the collapse to better understand the collapse process.
   The deformation shows a steep V-shaped pattern of subsidence with slight
   asymmetry. We compare the fit of four different models that simulate the
   subsidence pattern. The first two models use elastic half-space
   rheology. We find that collapse alone cannot explain the observations,
   and a component of normal faulting is required to fit the data. The
   second set of models simulates collapse in elasto-plastic media. Only a
   small component of normal faulting is required in these models. We
   suggest that considering elasto-plastic material behaviour is
   particularly important for shallow deformation modelling, where
   microfractures and other non-elastic rheology are common. Disregarding
   this material behaviour can lead to biased model parameter estimates.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of weak pulse electric fields on the destructive activity and

   that the physiological response of bacteria on their treatment by

   the changes in the values of electrokinetic potential and

   pulse duration of 1-10 ms and frequency of 100-500 Hz tends to increase
   by 20-30\% the destruction of NaAg(CN)(2). It is suggested that changes
   in surface properties and the enhancement of biochemical activity of
   bacteria are based on the metabolic reaction of the cell related to the
   stimulation or suppression of the bacteria respiration upon the

   ethanol solutions, absolute ethanol, and 100\% hexamethyldisilazane and

   microphotographs of collagen fibers and cells were characterized by high

   high magnification (x50,000) for both chemical drying and high-vacuum
   freeze drying. However, high-vacuum freeze drying is superior to
   chemical drying for the investigation of the internal space of 3D
   scaffolds, because sample fracture can be prepared directly in liquid

Abstract = {{Objective-To determine the role of platelets in stimulating mouse and
   human neutrophil activation and pulmonary injury in sickle cell disease
   (SCD).
   Methods and Results-Both platelet and neutrophil activation occur in
   SCD, but the interdependence of these events is unknown. Platelet
   activation and binding to leukocytes were measured in mice and patients
   with SCD and in controls. Relative to controls, blood obtained from mice
   or patients with SCD contained significantly elevated
   platelet-neutrophil aggregates (PNAs). Both platelets and neutrophils
   found in sickle PNAs were activated. Multispectral imaging (ImageStream)
   and conventional flow cytometry revealed a subpopulation of activated
   neutrophils with multiple adhered platelets that expressed significantly
   more CD11b and exhibited greater oxidative activity than single
   neutrophils. On average, wild-type and sickle PNAs contained 1.1 and 2.6
   platelets per neutrophil, respectively. Hypoxia/reoxygenation induced a
   further increase in PNAs in mice with SCD and additional activation of
   both platelets and neutrophils. The pretreatment of mice with SCD with
   clopidogrel or P-selectin antibody reduced the formation of PNAs and
   neutrophil activation and decreased lung vascular permeability.
   Conclusion-Our findings suggest that platelet binding activates
   neutrophils and contributes to a chronic inflammatory state and
   pulmonary dysfunction in SCD. The inhibition of platelet activation may
   be useful to decrease tissue injury in SCD, particularly during the
   early stages of vaso-occlusive crises. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.

Abstract = {{Nurses and ethicists worry that the implementation of care at a distance
   or telecare will impoverish patient care by taking out `the heart' of
   the clinical work. This means that telecare is feared to induce the
   neglect of patients, and to possibly hinder the development of a
   personal relation between nurse and patient. This study aims to analyse
   whether these worries are warranted by analysing Dutch care practices
   using telemonitoring in care for chronic patients in the Netherlands.
   How do clinical practices of nursing change when telecare devices are
   introduced and what this means for notions and norms of good nursing?
   The paper concludes that at this point the practices studied do not
   warrant the fear of negligence and compromised relations. Quite the
   contrary; in the practices studied, telecare lead to more frequent and
   more specialised contacts between nurses and patients. The paper
   concludes by reflecting on the ethical implications of these changes.}},

Abstract = {{We designed a survey to investigate current international management
   trends of neonates with lumbar midline skin stigmata suspicious of
   tethered cord, among pediatric neurosurgeons, focusing on the lower risk
   stigmata, simple dimples, deviated gluteal folds, and discolorations.
   Our findings will enable physicians to assess their current diagnosis
   routine and aid in clarifying management controversies.
   A questionnaire on the proposed diagnostic evaluation of seven case
   reports, each accompanied by relevant imaging, was distributed by e-mail
   to members of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery, the
   European Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery, and via the PEDS server
   list between March and August 2008.
   Sixty-two questionnaires, completed by experienced professionals with a
   rather uniform distribution of experience levels, were analyzed.
   Forty-eight percent do not recommend any imaging of simple dimples, 30\%
   recommend US screening and 22\% recommend MR. Seventy-nine percent
   recommend imaging of deviated gluteal fold with 30\% recommending MR.
   Ninety-two percent recommend imaging infants with hemangiomas with 74\%
   recommending MR. MR for sinus tracts is recommended by 90\% if sacral
   and by 98\% if lumber. Eighty-four percent recommend MR for filar cyst.
   Our survey demonstrates that management of low-risk skin stigmata,
   simple dimple, deviated gluteal fold, and discolorations lacks
   consensus. In addition, a significant sector of the professional
   community proposes a work-up of simple dimples, sacral tracts, and filar
   cysts that contradicts established recommendations. A simple
   classification system is needed to attain a better approach, enabling
   correct diagnosis of tethered cord without exposing neonates to
   unnecessary examinations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The role of questionnaires is important in improving the
   recognition of major depression. Aims: Our aims were: 1) to compare the
   differences of structure between the Depression Scale (DEPS) and other
   instruments, and 2) to study whether the DEPS items function in the same
   way with patients grouped by gender, by age or by education, at the same
   time taking into account the level of depression. Methods: The item
   topics of the DEPS and five other self-rating questionnaires (BDI-II,
   CES-D, HADS-D, PHQ-9, SCL-90-D), an interviewer rating scale (HAMD-17)
   and two diagnostic interviews for depression (ICD-10, DSM-IV) were
   listed in a table. The format of the questionnaires and the rating scale
   were compared. Differential item functioning (DIF) analysis using
   empirical material (n=1522) and logistic regression models was done to
   predict DEPS item responses across dichotomous categories for gender,
   age and education. Results and conclusions: The DEPS scale items covered
   essential symptoms of depression. Of the instruments assessed, the DEPS
   seemed the most simple. DIF analyses with the DEPS scale revealed some
   socio-demographic variation in which symptoms were endorsed after
   matching for DEPS sum score. Clinically the DEPS has good applicability
   and accuracy for screening depression in working aged primary care
   patients.</.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of H2O2 with ice surfaces at temperatures between 203
   and 233 K was investigated using a low pressure, coated-wall flow tube
   equipped with a chemical ionisation/electron impact mass spectrometer.
   Equilibrium surface coverages of H2O2 on ice were measured at various
   concentrations and temperatures to derive Langmuir-type adsorption
   isotherms. H2O2 was found to be strongly partitioned to the ice surface
   at low temperatures, with a partition coefficient, K-linC, equal to 2.1
   x 10(-5) exp(3800/T) cm. At 228 K, this expression results in values of
   KlinC which are orders of magnitude larger than the single previous
   determination and suggests that H2O2 may be significantly partitioned to
   the ice phase in cirrus clouds. The partition coefficient for H2O2 was
   compared to several other trace gases which hydrogen-bond to ice
   surfaces and a good correlation with the free energy of condensation
   found. For this class of trace gas a simple parameterisation for
   calculating KlinC(T) from thermodynamic properties was established.}},

Abstract = {{Hyoscyamine 6 beta-hydroxylase (H6H; EC 1.14.11.11), an important enzyme
   in the biosynthesis of tropane alkaloids, catalyzes the hydroxylation of
   hyoscyamine to give 6 beta-hydroxyhyoscyamine and its epoxidation in the
   biosynthetic pathway leading to scopolamine. Datura metel produces
   scopolamine as the predominant tropane alkaloid. The cDNA encoding H6H
   from D. mete! (DmH6H) was cloned, heterologously expressed and
   biochemically characterized. The purified recombinant His-tagged H6H
   from D. mete! (DmrH6H) was capable of converting hyoscyamine to
   scopolamine. The functionally expressed DmrH6H was confirmed by HPLC and
   ESI-MS verification of the products, 6 beta-hydroxyhyoscyamine and its
   derivative, scopolamine; the DmrH6H epoxidase activity was low compared
   to the hydroxylase activity. The K-m values for both the substrates,
   hyoscyamine and 2-oxoglutarate, were 50 mu M each. The CD (circular
   dichroism) spectrum of the DmrH6H indicated a preponderance of
   alpha-helicity in the secondary structure. From the fluorescence
   studies, Stern-Volmer constants for hyoscyamine and 2-oxoglutarate were
   found to be 0.14 M-1 and 0.56 M-1, respectively. These data suggested
   that the binding of the substrates, hyoscyamine and 2-oxoglutarate, to
   the enzyme induced significant conformational changes. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although the ability of disulfiram to inactivate CYP2E1 has been known
   for more than 20 years, the mechanism has not yet been elucidated. A
   metabolite of disulfiram, diethyldithocarbamate (DDC), is converted by
   CYP2E1 to a reactive intermediate that subsequently inactivates the
   protein, leading to mechanism-based inactivation. Mass spectral analysis
   of the inactivated human 2E1 protein demonstrates that the inactivation
   is due to the formation of an adduct of the reactive metabolite of DDC
   with the apoprotein. These data, along with mass spectral analysis of a
   reactive intermediate trapped with GSH, indicate the involvement of a
   reactive intermediate with a molecular mass of 116 Da. Our results
   suggest that this binding involves formation of a disulfide bond with
   one of the eight cysteines in CYP2E1. The inactivation of wild-type
   CYP2E1 as well as two of its polymorphic mutants, CYP2E1{*}2 and
   CYP2E1{*}4, was also investigated. For wild-type CYP2E1, the K-I was
   12.2 mu M and the k(inact) was 0.02 min(-1). The KI values for the two
   polymorphic mutants were 227.6 and 12.4 mu M for CYP2E1.2 and CYP2E1.4,
   and the k(inact) values were 0.0061 and 0.0187 min(-1), respectively.
   These data indicate that DDC is a much less efficient inactivator of
   CYP2E1.2 than it is of either the wild-type or the CYP2E1.4 variant.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel digital watermarking method for video based
   on a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition. The watermark used is a
   binary image. This watermark is embedded in the wavelet coefficients of
   the LH, HL and HH sub-bands of the second wavelet decomposition level by
   quantization. Every bit of the watermark is spread over a number of
   wavelet coefficients with the use of a key. The resulting watermarking
   scheme can be used for public watermarking applications, where the
   original image is not available for watermark extraction. We have tested
   the resilience of the watermarking algorithm against a series nine
   different attacks for different videos and improved the decoding BER by
   redundant embedding of the same watermark in different frames and by
   using an error correction code. Experimental results show that the
   embedded watermark is invisible and robust to attacks. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Studies of Mayak workers and people who lived along the Techa River have
   demonstrated significant associations between low-dose-rate radiation
   exposure and increased solid cancer risk. It is of interest to use the
   long-term follow-up data from these cohorts to describe radiation
   effects for specific types of cancer; however, statistical variability
   in the site-specific risk estimates is large. The goal of this work is
   to describe this variability and provide Bayesian adjusted risk
   estimates. We assume that the site-specific estimates can be viewed as a
   sample from some underlying distribution and use Bayesian methods to
   produce adjusted excess relative risk per gray estimates in the Mayak
   and Techa River cohorts. The impact of the adjustment is compared to
   that seen in similar analyses in the atomic bomb survivors.
   Site-specific risk estimates in the Mayak and Techa River cohorts have
   large uncertainties. Unadjusted estimates vary from implausibly large
   decreases to large increases, with a range that greatly exceeds that
   found in the A-bomb survivors. The Bayesian adjustment markedly reduced
   the range of the site-specific estimates for the Techa River and Mayak
   studies. The extreme variability in the site-specific risk estimates is
   largely a consequence of the small number of excess cases. The adjusted
   estimates provide a useful perspective on variation in the actual risks.
   However, additional work on interpretation of the adjusted estimates,
   extension of the methods used in describing effect modification, and
   making more use of prior knowledge is needed to make these methods
   useful. (C) 2010 by Radiation Research Society}},

Abstract = {{Context.-Within the last 15 years, evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes
   (SLNs) has become the most popular method of early staging of several
   malignancies, including melanoma. Sentinel lymph nodes are usually
   examined on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections and by routine
   histology/immunohistochemistry (research protocols have used other
   techniques such as polymerase chain reaction). Approximately 20\% of
   patients with cutaneous melanoma have metastasis in the SLN. In most
   studies, detection of positive SLN conveys a poorer prognosis for
   patients with cutaneous melanoma.
   Objective.-To review the morphologic patterns of melanoma metastasis in
   the SLN, the differential diagnosis, and the quantification of tumor
   burden as a prognostic factor.
   Data Sources.-Personal observations and review of the pertinent
   literature.
   Conclusions.-Evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes is certainly becoming a
   widespread technique and most authors agree on its prognostic power for
   staging patients with cutaneous melanoma. Current studies are evaluating
   the possible therapeutic value of removal of positive SLNs. (Arch Pathol

Title = {{Intra- and Postoperative Parathyroid Hormone-Kinetics Do Not Advocate
   for Autotransplantation of Discolored Parathyroid Glands During
   Thyroidectomy}},
Journal = {{THYROID}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Background: Thyroidectomy continues to pose the risk of typical
   complications, including postoperative hypocalcemia and permanent
   hypoparathyroidism. The strategic decision on how to preserve
   parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion relies on assessing the viability of
   the parathyroid glands (PGs). The aim of this study was to assess
   parathyroid discoloration as an indicator for loss of parathyroid
   function.
   Methods: The prospective study included 29 patients (24 women, 5 men;
   age 53.2 +/- 13.0 years) who underwent near-total or total
   thyroidectomy. An intra-and postoperative PTH and calcium monitoring was
   performed. The intraoperative situs of the PGs was documented by a study
   protocol. The patients were grouped in three categories: group A, 12
   patients with four visualized and normally colored PGs; group B, 13
   patients with four visualized and three or four discolored PGs; group C,
   4 patients who had undergone autotransplantation of two PGs.
   Results: Compared to group A, groups B and C showed sharper
   intraoperative PTH declines. PTH values recovered more quickly in group
   B than in group C. However, no significant differences in PTH kinetics
   were found in the general linear model for repeated measures (p -
   0.132). However, a significantly higher incidence of protracted
   hypocalcemia-related symptoms for more than 14 postoperative days was
   found for group C (50.0\%) than for groups A (0\%) and B (0\%; p-0.011).
   None of the patients developed permanent hypoparathyroidism.
   Conclusions: The function of discolored PGs is only transiently impaired
   and recovers within a short time after surgery. Our observations do not
   support autotransplantation as a generally applicable first-line
   intervention for discolored PGs in the absence of other criteria for
   autotransplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Genomic imprinting refers to genes that are epigenetically programmed in
   the germline to express exclusively or preferentially one allele in a
   parent-of-origin manner. Expression-based genome-wide screening for the
   identification of imprinted genes has failed to uncover a significant
   number of new imprinted genes, probably because of the high tissue- and
   developmental-stage specificity of imprinted gene expression. A very
   large number of technical and biological artifacts can also lead to the
   erroneous evidence of imprinted gene expression. In this article, we
   focus on three common sources of potential confounding effects: (i)
   random monoallelic expression in monoclonal cell populations, (ii)
   genetically determined monoallelic expression and (iii) contamination or
   infiltration of embryonic tissues with maternal material. This last
   situation specifically applies to genes that occur as maternally
   expressed in the placenta. Beside the use of reciprocal crosses that are
   instrumental to confirm the parental specificity of expression, we
   provide additional methods for the detection and elimination of these
   situations that can be misinterpreted as cases of imprinted expression.}},

Journal = {{THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of semi-arid plant communities are determined by the
   Interplay between competition and facilitation among plants The sign and
   strength of these biotic interactions depend on plant traits However the
   relationships between plant traits and biotic interactions and the
   consequences for plant communities are still poorly understood Our
   objective here was to investigate with a modelling approach the role of
   plant reproductive traits on biotic interactions and the consequences
   for processes such as plant succession and invasion The dynamics of two
   plant types were modelled with a spatially-explicit integrodifferential
   model (1) a plant with seed dispersal (colonizer of bare soil) and (2) a
   plant with local vegetative propagation (local competitor) Both plant
   types were involved in facilitation due to a local positive feedback
   between vegetation biomass and soil water availability which promoted
   establishment and growth Plants in the system also competed for limited
   water The efficiency in water acquisition (dependent on reproductive and
   growth plant traits) determined which plant type dominated the community
   at the steady state Facilitative interactions between plant types also
   played an important role in the community dynamics promoting
   establishment in the driest conditions and recovery from low biomass
   Plants with vegetative propagation took advantage of the ability of seed
   dispersers to establish on bare soil from a low initial biomass Seed
   dispersers were good invaders maintained high biomass at intermediate
   and high rainfall and showed a high ability in taking profit from the
   positive feedback originated by plants with vegetative propagation under
   the driest conditions However seed dispersers lost competitiveness with
   an increasing investment in fecundity All together our results showed
   that reproductive plant traits can affect the balance between
   facilitative and competitive interactions Understanding this effect of
   plant traits on biotic interactions provides insights in processes such
   as plant succession and shrub encroachment (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All

Abstract = {{Objective Define the structure and working procedures of the Pharmacy
   and Therapeutic Committees (P\&T Committees) in Spanish hospitals.
   Setting Hospitals over 75 beds located in all regions of the Spanish
   State. Method A cross-sectional descriptive study based on the
   completion of a questionnaire that consisted of 138 questions. The
   participants were recruited by post, e-mail and telephone between
   November 2007 and January 2008. The Hospitals were classified according
   to their size and public or private and university or non-university
   status. Main outcome measures They are related with the structure and
   composition of the P\&T Committees, performance, drug evaluation
   process, working methods and the results of their activity. Results A
   total of 200 hospitals answered the questionnaire (response rate of
   39.0\% of hospitals and 57.1\% of the beds in Spain). All the hospitals
   have P\&T Committees, 99.5\% have a Drug Formulary, 71.0\% have a
   Therapeutic Interchange Programme and 91.0\% have a document determining
   the mission, objectives and functions of the P\&T Committee. Almost all
   hospitals (95.5\%) have established a formal application for the
   inclusion of a drug in the hospital, while 80.5\% have established a
   model for evaluation reports. The mean (SD) number of participants in
   P\&T Committees was 11.84 (3.82). The annual mean of drugs evaluated per
   hospital was 10.35 (7.45). The proportion of assessments that concludes
   the inclusion, rejection or deferral of the decision was 75.3, 21.4 and
   3.2\%, respectively. Conclusion Spanish P\&T Committees have a similar
   structure and function, a multi-disciplinary professional composition to
   carry out an important assessment activity. This activity is higher in
   large hospitals and in university hospitals. The proportion of the
   approved and rejected drugs is similar in different types of hospital.
   The Therapeutic Interchange Guidelines, the use of application models
   and the reports follow the indications of scientific collaborative
   groups, thus being used more in Spain than in other countries.}},

Abstract = {{Humans map timewords such as ``yesterday{''} or ``future{''} onto a
   mental timeline that holds temporally earlier events on the left side of
   space and temporally later events on the right side. The perception of
   time and spatial mapping both are partially subserved by right
   temporo-parietal brain regions. We tested stroke patients with
   right-hemisphere lesions on a spatio-temporal cueing task to see whether
   spatial associations of noninformative temporal cues would elicit the
   same cognitive deficits as do typical stimulus-driven exogenous cues.
   While our right brain-damaged patients were able to maintain a mental
   timeline with words referring to the past sitting to the left and words
   referring to the future sitting to the right, we also observed that the
   typical deficit in disengaging from incongruently cued locations
   persists for noninformative cues that are mapped onto a mental spatial
   continuum.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity and hyperandrogenaemia are key features of polycystic ovary
   syndrome (PCOS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether leptin
   and androgens are associated with obesity in PCOS subjects and identify
   whether there exist any genetic alterations in leptin gene in women with
   PCOS. The results reveal that leptin levels are elevated in women with
   PCOS and associate with BMI. However, irrespective of the obesity status
   leptin levels are higher in PCOS cases indicating that increased
   BMI/obesity may not be the only factor contributing to elevated levels
   of leptin. With regard to testosterone and androstenedione, the levels
   were increased in obese individuals irrespective of PCOS status. No
   correlation between leptin and androstenedione or testosterone was
   observed in controls and PCOS subjects. The single-nucleotide
   polymorphism G19A detected in the untranslated exon 1 of leptin gene was
   not associated with PCOS and does not contribute to elevated levels of
   leptin. The results overall suggest that androgen and leptin levels are
   increased in PCOS and obesity. It demonstrates that obesity is a
   confounding factor for hyperandrogenaemia irrespective of their PCOS
   status. The study rules out role of obesity status and leptin genotype
   in increase in leptin levels observed in PCOS cases.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Amphiregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor
   family, is expressed by activated mouse T H 2 cells. Amphiregulin
   produced by mouse hematopoietic cells contributes to the elimination of
   a nematode infection by a type 2 effector response.
   Objective: To identify the human peripheral blood cell population
   expressing amphiregulin.
   Methods: Amphiregulin-expressing cells were identified by flow cytometry
   of cell surface markers and histologic staining. Histamine and
   amphiregulin in supernatants were measured by enzyme immunoassay.
   Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA expression.
   Results: Stimulation of human PBMCs by anti-CD31+ anti-CD28 antibodies
   induced expression of amphiregulin mRNA and protein by a non-T-cell
   population. The amphiregulin-producing cells were basophils, as judged
   by morphology and expression of CD203c and CD123 ( IL-3 receptor a
   chain). Activated mouse basophils also produced amphiregulin.
   Amphiregulin expression by basophils in response to anti-TCR stimulation
   required IL-3 produced by T cells, and IL-3 alone induced high levels of
   amphiregulin expression by purified basophils. Amphiregulin was
   expressed at much higher levels when human basophils were stimulated by
   IL-3 than by IgE cross-linking, whereas the opposite was true for IL-4
   expression and histamine release. Heparin-binding epidermal growth
   factor-like growth factor was also expressed by IL-3-stimulated human
   basophils. PBMCs from human subjects with asthma contained significantly
   higher numbers of basophils able to produce amphiregulin compared with
   controls with or without allergy.
   Conclusion: IL-3 can induce basophils to express high levels of
   amphiregulin, which may contribute to tissue remodeling during type 2
   immune responses such as asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol

Abstract = {{Rice lipid content as one of important ingredients of functional food
   and industrial products has become an entirely new target in the rice
   breeding programs worldwide. A genetic linkage map spanning 12 rice
   chromosomes with an average interval of 10.51 cM between markers was
   created using 172 DNA markers, which intended to elucidate genetic basis
   of lipid content in brown rice by QTL detection. Eight QTLs related to
   lipid content with LOD from 2.52 to 7.86 were mapped on chromosome1, 2,
   3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 using a doubled haploid (DH) population from a cross of
   `Samgang/Nagdong' with field experiments for five years. Two QTLs of
   qLC5.1 and qLC6.1 in the intervals 5014-5024 and 6011-RM19696 were
   repeatedly detected over four years at average LOD scores of 4.85 and
   4.21, respectively. Five of eight QTLs tend to increase the lipid
   content from `Samgang' alleles. Epistatic and environmental effects
   played important roles and explained 42.20\% of phenotype variations.
   Three QTLs of qLC6.1, qLC7.1 and qLC9.1 collectively explained much than
   27\% of phenotype variations and increased 0.25\% of lipid content and,
   showed much than 85\% of selection efficiency for the lines with high
   lipid contents in the F7 population from a cross of `Samgang/Nagdong'.
   Thus it provides the sufficient possibility to realize QTLs pyramiding
   and to promote process of rice breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased incidence and
   severity of pneumonia. In both the general population and individuals
   consuming excess alcohol, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent
   lung infection pathogen. Alcoholic patients with pneumonia frequently
   present with granulocytopenia, which is predictive of increased
   mortality. The mechanisms underlying this impaired granulopoietic
   response to pneumococcal pneumonia have yet to be elucidated.
   Methods: Acute alcohol intoxication was induced in mice 30 minutes
   before intrapulmonary infection with S. pneumoniae. Bone marrow, lung,
   and blood samples were collected. Bone marrow cells were also isolated
   from naive mice and treated in vitro with plasma from mice infected with
   S. pneumoniae.
   Results: Alcohol intoxication impaired the pneumococcal-induced increase
   in granulocyte recruitment into the alveolar space, decreased bacterial
   clearance from the lung, and increased mortality. Pneumococcal pneumonia
   significantly increased bone marrow lineage(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) (LKS)
   cell number and colony-forming unit-granulocytes and monocyte (CFU-GM)
   activity of these cells. Both enhanced proliferation of LKS cells and
   re-expression of Sca-1 surface protein on downstream progenitor cells
   bearing lineage(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(-) surface markers accounted for the
   expansion of marrow LSK cells during pneumonia. Alcohol intoxication
   impaired these 2 mechanisms of LKS cell population expansion and was
   associated with a relative granulocytopenia during pneumococcal lung
   infection.
   Conclusions: Alcohol inhibits the hematopoietic precursor cell response
   to pneumonia, which may serve as a mechanism underlying the
   granulocytopenia and impaired host defense in alcohol abusers with
   bacterial pneumonia.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules represent a
   diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. In 2007, the National Cancer
   Institute recommended The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid
   Cytopathology (TBSRTC) as a means of improving the accuracy of thyroid
   cytopathology. Our objective was to determine the effect of TBSRTC on
   thyroidectomy rates and malignancy risk in cytologically indeterminate
   lesions.
   Methods. We compared thyroidectomy rates and malignancy risk in patients
   with indeterminate thyroid cytopathology across 2 time periods, spanning
   January 2000 and November 2009; pre-TBSRTC (January 2000 to September
   2003) and post-TBSRTC (June 2008 to November 2009). Statistical
   comparisons were performed using the Fisher's exact test and chi-square
   analysis (P = .05 significant).
   Results. We performed 938 fine-needle aspirations in the first period,
   765 in the second. We identified 78 (8.3\%) cytologically indeterminate
   lesions in the pre-TBSRTC group and 91 (11.9\%) lesions in the
   post-TBSRTC group. We found no difference in thyroidectomy rates between
   the groups (37/78 {[}47\%] pre-Bethesda versus 32/91 {[}35\%]
   post-Bethesda; P = .12). However, the malignancy rate was significantly
   lower in the post-TBSRTC group (13/37 {[}35\%] pre-Bethesda versus 4/32
   {[}13\%] post-Bethesda; P = .02).
   Conclusion. Application of TBSRTC is associated with lower malignancy
   risk in indeterminate thyroid nodules, despite similar thyroidectomy
   rates. These findings imply that standardization of cytologic
   classification improves diagnostic accuracy. (Surgery 2010;148:1267-73.)}},

Abstract = {{The generative and somatic characteristics of female sturgeon of five
   species and three hybrid forms, which were reared at the TINRO Center's
   warm-water cage farm at the north of Primorsky Krai and used in caviar
   production, are considered. Data on the somatic growth, roe output,
   functional fecundity, mean egg weight, and gonadosomatic index of the
   female Amur Sturgeon, Kaluga, Siberian Sturgeon of the Lena and the
   Baikal populations, Sterlet of the Volga population, hybrids of Russian
   Sturgeon and Siberian Sturgeon, hybrids of Siberian Sturgeon and Amur
   Sturgeon, and hybrids of Kaluga and Amur Sturgeon are analyzed. The
   sexual maturity age and interspawning intervals are defined in the
   studied females. Domesticated females of all the species are shown to
   mature a few years earlier than those in natural conditions and to have
   a greater body weight. The interspawning intervals shorten by a few
   years in domesticated females. Most female Sterlet and some females from
   both populations of Siberian Sturgeon spawn annually, while the
   remainder spawn once in 2 years. The interspawning intervals in two
   species of sturgeon that inhabit the Amur River and in hybrid forms
   usually last for 2 years. With age, values of characteristics such as
   roe amount, fecundity, mean egg weight, and roe output relative to body
   weight grow in females spawning for the second time in the warm-water
   farm. The maximum roe output is found in female Kalugas at the second
   spawning. Then the species follow in the order of decreasing of roe
   output: Amur Sturgeon, hybrids of Amur Sturgeon with Kaluga, hybrids of
   Siberian Sturgeon with Amur Sturgeon, hybrids of Russian Sturgeon with
   Siberian Sturgeon, Siberian Sturgeon of the Baikal population, Siberian
   Sturgeon of the Lena population, and Sterlet. The hybrid between the
   Russian Sturgeon and Siberian Sturgeon shows the best processability and
   survivability characteristics; the Amur Sturgeon and Sterlet follow.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in the design and manufacture of photovoltaic cells have
   recently been a growing concern in the UAE At present, the embodied

   This paper explores the variation of the total energy of building
   integrated photovoltaic systems (BiPV) as a wall cladding system applied
   to the UAE commercial sector and shows that the ratio between PV output
   and saving in energy due to PV panels is within the range of 1 3-1 4 The
   result indicates that for the southern and western facades in the UAE,

Abstract = {{Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is caused by
   protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense.
   Despite the enormous technological progress in molecular parasitology in
   recent years, the diagnosis of HAT is still problematic due to the lack
   of specific tools. To date, there are two realities when it comes to
   HAT; the first one being the world of modern experimental laboratories,
   equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technology, and the second
   being the world of HAT diagnosis, where the latest semi-commercial test
   was introduced 30 years ago (Magnus et al. 1978). Hence, it appears that
   the lack of progress in HAT diagnosis is not primarily due to a lack of
   scientific interest or a lack of research funds, but mainly results from
   the many obstacles encountered in the translation of basic research into
   field-applicable diagnostics. This review will provide an overview of
   current diagnostic methods and highlight specific difficulties in
   solving the shortcomings of these methods. Future perspectives for
   accurate, robust, affordable diagnostics will be discussed as well.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems showed good utilization of
   channel characteristics. In MIMO systems multiple signals are
   transmitted using multiple antenna system. This provides each receiver
   the combined signals and hence, array processing techniques helps in
   reducing the effects of interference among them. In this paper we devise
   the use of pre-coded MIMO system to reduce the effects of frequency
   selectivity and hence, enhance the systems capacity and/or reduce the
   bit error rate. In this technique we introduce a temporal pre-coder on
   each antenna signal; this creates a deterministic multi-path signals
   similar to signals received when the channel is multi-path fading
   channel. The same antenna signal will arrive at each receiver forming
   orthogonal sub-space and the receiver will be simple add and delay of
   the received signals. Ant colony optimization is used in this paper to
   select the best pre-code. Results showed that we can diagonalize the
   channel matrix and practically eliminate the interference for frequency
   selective fading channel. Simulation of two transmitting two receiving
   antennas pre-coded MIMO system showed that the capacity can be doubled.}},

   also cell progenitors of different differentiation levels. Wound healing
   process was faster in lin(-) cell suspension treated group, the stage of
   proliferation was more intensive and increased number of skin appendages
   occurred. The adaptation of purified HSC at the site of injury was
   longer and the stages of wound healing took place later. The results
   obtained show that in further experiments the complex procedure of HSC
   isolation and purification could be shortened and heavy skin injuries
   could be successfully treated with the help of lin- cell population. (C)

Abstract = {{Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been classified for decades as a strict
   aerobic species. Whole genome sequencing of the type culture strain
   H37Rv has revealed the presence of a full set of genes allowing for
   anaerobic metabolism. Naphthoate synthase (menB) is a key enzyme
   required for the synthesis of menaquinone, which plays a crucial role in
   anaerobic electron transport, ultimately resulting in the formation of
   energy generating intermediates. Interrupting the synthesis of this
   enzyme will interfere with the production of menaquinone and therefore
   this enzyme is a potential drug target.
   This study serves to investigate the role of naphtoate synthase in the
   survival of M. tuberculosis H37Rv when incubated under oxygen limiting
   conditions of unagitated liquid culture over 15 weeks. M. tuberculosis
   H37Rv was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 media. The tubes were kept
   undisturbed at 37 C for up to 15 weeks. At selected time points,
   aliquots of cells were removed and frozen. RNA was simultaneously
   extracted from all aliquots. The RNA was converted to cDNA for Real-Time
   PCR on the ABI 7000 SDS. Gene expression was normalized against 16S RNA
   quantities at each time point.
   A systematic increase in the expression of the menB gene product was
   observed over the incubation period with a 4.3-fold increase seen at
   week 6 (P < 0.001) relative to day 0 and an 85.8-fold increase at week
   15 (P < 0.001) relative to day 0.
   Cells of M. tuberculosis increase menaquinone production during
   prolonged incubation in broth culture as a mechanism of survival. This
   study substantiates the menB enzyme to be a putative drug target. (C)

Abstract = {{In this note a squared output signal is generated from an astable

Abstract = {{In the current study, isolation of glucosinolate degradation products
   was done in 4 different incubation solutions with different pHs based on
   the fact that distinct hydrolytic products are formed at different pHs.
   All the extracts were tested against direct-acting mutagens (4
   nitro-o-phenylenediamine {[}NPD]), sodium azide, and indirect-acting
   mutagen (2-aminofluorene {[}2AF]). It was observed that extracts
   inhibited mutagenesis induced by the S9-dependent mutagen (2AF) more
   significantly than direct-acting mutagens. Two different modes of
   experimentation (pre-incubation and co-incubation) were used, and it was
   observed that the extracts showed better results in the pre-incubation
   mode of experimentation. Out of the 4 extracts tested, 0.1 mol/L of HCl
   extract was found to be the most effective in inhibiting mutagenesis
   with both TA 98 and TA 100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium. All other
   extracts also showed pronounced antimutagenic potential. The results of

Title = {{How Terminology and Definitions in Analytical Geochemistry can Help or
   Hinder the Development of New Ideas}},
Journal = {{GEOSTANDARDS AND GEOANALYTICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{317-324}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Refining terminology can help the development of new concepts. For
   example, the definition of the terms bias and precision for the two
   types of measurement error were useful in the early development of data
   quality in analytical chemistry. The more recent recognition of
   uncertainty of measurement has aided the development of further new
   ideas, such as the fitness-for-purpose of measurements. The wording of
   the definition of each term needs to be clear and understandable, as
   well as rigorous, if it is to enable new ideas to be explained to both
   the research community and to the users of measurements. However, some
   definitions are identified as cryptic and ambiguous. This inhibits the
   development of new ideas, and leads to misunderstanding and confusion
   amongst researchers, students and the wider user community. One possible
   solution is to have one formal definition that is technically rigorous,
   and ideally, but not necessarily, widely comprehensible. A second
   informal definition could also be made that is widely comprehensibility,
   whilst being consistent with the formal definition. An increased level
   of discussion and debate is required in the measurement community to
   resolve the underlying philosophical issues that cause some of the
   ambiguity in the description of the measurement process. For example,
   there is a choice to be made between the statistical and the
   metrological approaches, which result in use of the concepts of either
   the true value of the analyte concentration, or the measurand.Une mise a
   jour de la terminologie peut aider au developpement de nouveaux
   concepts. Par exemple, la definition des termes biais et precision pour
   les deux types d'erreurs de mesure a ete utile dans les stades precoces
   du developpement de l'analyse de la qualite des donnees en chimie
   analytique. La reconnaissance plus recente de l'incertitude de mesure a
   favorise le developpement de nouvelles idees, telles que l'aptitude a
   l'usage des mesures. Le libelle de la definition de chaque terme doit
   etre claire et comprehensible, ainsi que rigoureuse, si elle a pour but
   d'expliquer de nouvelles idees a la fois la communaute scientifique et
   aux utilisateurs des mesures. Cependant, certaines definitions sont
   identifies comme enigmatique et ambigue. Ceci empeche le developpement
   de nouvelles idees, et conduit a l'incomprehension et la confusion parmi
   les chercheurs, les etudiants et la communaute plus large
   d'utilisateurs. Une solution possible est d'avoir une definition
   formelle qui est techniquement rigoureuse et, idealement, mais pas
   necessairement, largement comprehensible. Une deuxieme definition
   informelle qui est largement comprehensible peut aussi etre proposee,
   tout en etant compatible avec la definition formelle. Une augmentation
   du niveau de la discussion et du debat est necessaire dans la communaute
   s'occupant des mesures afin de resoudre les problemes philosophiques
   sous-jacents qui causent une certaine ambiguite dans la description du
   processus de mesure. Par exemple, il y a un choix a faire entre les
   statistiques et les approches de metrologie, qui aboutit a l'usage des
   concepts soit de la valeur reelle de la concentration de l'analyte, ou
   le mesurande.}},

Abstract = {{Seed localization uses a radioactive source to identify nonpalpable
   breast lesions for excision; it is an emerging alternative to wire
   localization (WL). Previous single health system studies report
   decreased rates of re-excision and improved patient convenience with
   this technique. This study is the first to implement this procedure in a
   public health care delivery system composed of a primarily minority and
   low-income population.
   A multidisciplinary team was formed to create a protocol for breast seed
   localization (BSL) and monitor the results. After 50 seed localizations
   were successfully completed, a retrospective matched-pair analysis with
   patients who had undergone WL during the same period was performed.
   Overall experience with the BSL protocol is reviewed, along with the
   occurrence of a seed loss. Processes necessary to reactivate the BSL
   protocol and prevent future losses are delineated. BSL is associated
   with decreased rates of re-excision and can be successfully implemented
   in a public health care system.
   BSL is an attractive alternative to WL in a high-volume, county-based
   population. It allows increased efficiency in the operating room and has
   a low rate of complications. Cautionary measures must be taken to ensure
   proper seed chain of custody to prevent seed loss.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for the lineage identification of cell or tissue-engineered
   therapeutics must provide a high degree of performance to confidently
   distinguish the intended cell type from other lineages that could be
   present in the finished product. For many applications, these methods
   also require rapid, high-throughput capability. In this work, methods
   for the identification of autologous cultured chondrocytes for
   implantation were investigated. A histological analysis confirmed that
   fibrous tissue occasionally present in biopsies procured for autologous
   chondrocyte implantation production comprised synovium. Chondrocyte and
   synovial cell cultures were then examined using a full transcriptome
   microarray analysis, which revealed cartilage link protein and
   microfibril-associated glycoprotein-2 (MAGP2) as the most differentially
   expressed transcripts between the culture types. Performance
   characteristics of gene expression assays formed by the analysis of
   cartilage link protein with normalization to either standard reference
   genes or to MAGP2 were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the
   MAGP2-based assay provided superior performance for the purpose of cell
   culture identification compared to assays using standard reference
   genes. The selectivity against synovial and heterogeneous samples
   provided by the novel assay suggests it as an appropriate lineage
   identification method for cell cultures derived from cartilage.}},

Abstract = {{P>Objectives
   Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) replacement therapy in children
   and adults currently requires daily subcutaneous injections for several
   years or lifelong. The current study examined safety, tolerability,
   pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response parameters after single and
   multiple doses of a long-acting rhGH preparation (NNC126-0083).
   Design
   Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose,
   dose-escalating (0 center dot 02, 0 center dot 04, 0 center dot 08 and 0
   center dot 16 mg protein/kg), sequential dose group trial.
   Subjects
   Forty adult Japanese healthy male volunteers (aged 20-45; body mass
   index: 18 center dot 0-27 center dot 0 kg/m2). Five groups (n = 8) were
   randomized to receive multiple doses of NNC126-0083 (n = 6) or placebo
   (n = 2).
   Methods
   Primary outcome was safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of
   NNC126-0083 compared with placebo. Blood samples for the assessment of
   pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics response {[}insulin-like
   growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3)] were taken
   after multiple ascending doses.
   Results
   NNC126-0083 was well tolerated and not associated with any local
   injection-site reactions or lipoatrophy. Following administration,
   NNC126-0083 levels increased rapidly and remained elevated for several
   days, returning to baseline before each weekly injection. Steady-state
   PK was achieved after the third dosing. A more than dose-proportional
   exposure was observed at the highest NNC126-0083 dose (0 center dot 16
   mg protein/kg). A strong dose-dependent pharmacodynamic response in
   circulating concentrations of both IGF-I and IGFBP-3 compared with
   placebo (P < 0 center dot 0001) was observed during the administration
   of all doses.
   Conclusions
   Multiple administration of NNC126-0083 in healthy male volunteers
   indicates that NNC126-0083 has the potential for an efficacious,
   well-tolerated, once-weekly rhGH compound in the treatment of GH
   deficiency.}},

   Methods Retrospective case series.
   Results Four patients with mature cataract developed severe acute,

   formation and acutely elevated intraocular pressure. None of the
   patients had a history of trauma or evidence of angle, iris, or retinal

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY}},

Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{12609-12618}},

Abstract = {{Matrix proteins (M) direct the process of assembly and budding of
   viruses belonging to the Mononegavirales order. Using the two-hybrid
   system, the amino-terminal part of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) M
   was shown to interact with dynamin pleckstrin homology domain. This
   interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of both proteins in
   cells transfected by a plasmid encoding a c-myc-tagged dynamin and
   infected by VSV. A role for dynamin in the viral cycle (in addition to
   its role in virion endocytosis) was suggested by the fact that a late
   stage of the viral cycle was sensitive to dynasore. By alanine scanning,
   we identified a single mutation of M protein that abolished this
   interaction and reduced virus yield. The adaptation of mutant virus
   (M.L4A) occurred rapidly, allowing the isolation of revertants, among
   which the M protein, despite having an amino acid sequence distinct from
   that of the wild type, recovered a significant level of interaction with
   dynamin. This proved that the mutant phenotype was due to the loss of
   interaction between M and dynamin. The infectious cycle of the mutant
   virus M.L4A was blocked at a late stage, resulting in a quasi-absence of
   bullet-shaped viruses in the process of budding at the cell membrane.
   This was associated with an accumulation of nucleocapsids at the
   periphery of the cell and a different pattern of VSV glycoprotein
   localization. Finally, we showed that M-dynamin interaction affects
   clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Our study suggests that hijacking the
   endocytic pathway might be an important feature for enveloped virus
   assembly and budding at the plasma membrane.}},

Abstract = {{Circular dichroism (CD) is a spectroscopic technique that is widely used
   to obtain information about protein structure, and hence is an important
   tool with many applications, including the characterization of
   biopharmaceuticals. A previous inter-laboratory study, CCQM-P59, showed
   that there was a poor level of comparability between laboratories in CD
   spectroscopy. In a follow-up study reported here, we achieved our goal
   of demonstrating improved comparability and data quality, primarily by
   addressing the problems identified in the previous study, which included
   cell path-length measurement, instrument calibration and good practice
   in general. Multivariate analysis techniques (principal component
   analysis and soft independent modelling of class analogies) were shown
   to be useful in comparing large spectral data sets and in classifying
   spectra. However, our results also show that there is more work to be
   done to improve confidence in the technique as the discrepancies
   observed were partially due to systematic effects, which the statistical
   approaches do not consider. We therefore conclude that there is a need
   for an improved understanding of the uncertainties in CD measurement.}},

   concentration, i.e., 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 wt\% on neat phenolic

   measurement of density, weight loss, linear shrinkage, and mechanical
   properties under compression mode to understand the carbonization
   behavior of carbon-carbon composite. The study was carried out after
   curing, postcuring, and carbonization. Also, thermogravimetric analysis
   was used to study the effects of curing agent concentration on thermal
   stability and kinetic parameters (i.e., activation energy, order of
   decomposition, pre-exponential term, etc). The kinetic parameters were
   evaluated by using four single heating rate techniques namely Friedman,
   Coats-Redfern, Freeman-Carroll, and Chang methods. Further, to study the
   effects of both carbon black filler loading and carbonization
   temperature, phenolic-carbon black composites were prepared at the
   loading of 10, 20, 30, 40 wt\% using 1.5 wt\% of PTSA. These were also
   investigated through density, weight loss, and shrinkage measurements
   after curing, postcuring, and carbonizing at the temperature of 600,
   1000, and 1400 degrees C in nitrogen atmosphere. To analyze the
   evolution of carbon phase X-ray diffraction study was carried out for
   the carbonized samples. Finally, cured, postcured and carbonized

Abstract = {{Nonwoven structures have been recently explored for numerous novel
   applications ranging from composites to scaffolds. The tensile property
   of nonwovens is a pre-requisite and indeed, one of the main parameters
   to determine their performance for such applications. In the first part,
   a modified micromechanical model describing the tensile behaviour of
   thermally bonded nonwovens was proposed by incorporating the effect of
   fibre re-orientation during the deformation (Rawal et al., J Mater Sci
   45: 2274, 2010). In this study, an attempt has been made to compare the
   theoretical and experimental stress-strain curves of thermally bonded
   and spunbonded nonwoven structures. These theoretical findings have been
   obtained from the most popular analytical tensile models of nonwovens
   available in the literature in addition to our modified tensile model.
   Poisson's ratio has also been determined experimentally in order to
   predict the stress-strain behaviour of nonwoven, and its relationship
   with longitudinal strain has clearly distinguished between the randomly
   and preferentially orientated types of structures. In thermally bonded
   nonwovens, the tensile strength in various test directions is computed
   through pull-out stress and a comparison is made with the experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization of antenna downtilt is an important aspect of coverage
   optimization in cellular networks. In this paper, an algorithm based on
   the combination of fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning is proposed
   and applied to the downtilt optimization problem to achieve the
   self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing functionalities
   required for future communication networks. To evaluate the efficiency
   of the proposed scheme, we use a detailed Long Term Evolution (LTE)
   simulation environment and employ an algorithm for configuring and
   optimizing the downtilt angle of the LTE base station antennas. This
   scheme is fully distributed and does not require any synchronization
   between network elements. Compared to an existing solution, evolutionary
   learning of fuzzy rules (ELF), the solution we propose provides up to 20
   percent improvement in performance. In addition to self-x capabilities,
   the experiments further confirm the reliability and robustness of the
   algorithm in extremely noisy environments. (C) 2010 Alcatel-Lucent.}},

Abstract = {{A meta-analysis was conducted with 65 school-based psychotherapy and
   counseling dissertations over the last 10 years (1998-2008) to assess if
   a file-drawer problem (i.e., studies conducted but not published that,
   as a whole, have different results than studies in the same area
   published) exists in the school-based outcome literature. An overall
   mean effect size of 0.44 was found for 73 treatment interventions. This
   effect size is comparable to Prout and DeMartino's 1986 meta-analysis
   conducted with published school-based studies and approximately half a
   standard deviation smaller than Prout and Prout's 1998 meta-analysis of
   school-based intervention studies. A bias does appear to exist but seems
   to be smaller than the bias found in the general child and adolescent
   psychotherapy outcome literature. Most of the dissertation studies
   evaluated group interventions and used a cognitive-behavioral or skills
   training intervention. Skills training and interventions with
   elementary-school students yielded the largest effect sizes. Comparisons
   of the current study with previous school-based intervention
   meta-analyses are discussed as are suggestions for future research. (C)

Title = {{Wigner quantization of some one-dimensional Hamiltonians}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recently, several papers have been dedicated to the Wigner quantization
   of different Hamiltonians. In these examples, many interesting
   mathematical and physical properties have been shown. Among those we
   have the ubiquitous relation with Lie superalgebras and their
   representations. In this paper, we study two one-dimensional
   Hamiltonians for which the Wigner quantization is related with the
   orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(1|2). One of them, the Hamiltonian
   (H) over cap = (x) over cap(p) over cap, is popular due to its
   connection with the Riemann zeros, discovered by Berry and Keating on
   the one hand and Connes on the other. The Hamiltonian of the free
   particle, (H) over cap (f) = (p) over cap (2)/2, is the second
   Hamiltonian we will examine. Wigner quantization introduces an extra
   representation parameter for both of these Hamiltonians. Canonical
   quantization is recovered by restricting to a specific representation of
   the Lie superalgebra osp(1|2). (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Background
   The Comparative Study of Human versus Methotrexate (MTX) vet sus Placebo
   in Psoriasis Patients (CHAMPION) demonstrated superior efficacy of
   biologic over conventional systemic immuno-suppressant therapy in
   psoriasis.
   Objective
   We sought to compare the risk-benefit profile of idalimumab (ADA), MTX,
   and placebo using data nom CHAMPION.
   Methods
   Patients randomized to ADA (n = 107) MTX (n = 110), or placebo (n = 53)
   were followed up for 16 weeks. Response (>= 75\% improvement in
   Psoriasis Area and Seventy Index), days flee of adverse events (AEs),
   moderate to severe AEs, infection-related AEs, and study drug-related
   AEs were analyzed.
   Result
   ADA treatment was associated with substantially more days (SD) of
   AE-free response compared with MIX cm placebo treatment, respectively:
   36.9 (31.1) versus 8.3 (15.9) or 6.7 (18.1) days of response free of any
   AEs, 43.8 (31.9) vet sus 11.1 (19.9) or 7.9 (19.9) clays of response
   free of moderate to severe AEs, 48.5 (29.2) versus 12.4 (21.7) or 9.2
   (21.8) days of response flee of infection-related AEs, and 44.6 (31.4)
   vet sus 11.8 (21.1) cm 10.0 (24.0) days flee of study drug-related AEs
   (all P < .0001 for ADA vs MIX or placebo).
   Limitations
   This clinical trial-based analysis may not hive captured the full
   spectrum of AEs in the actual clinical setting. The short (16-week)
   duration of the n tal limited the ability to capture some important but
   uncommon AEs associated with long-tetra ADA or MIX use.
   Conclusion
   With 4 times as many AE-free response clays, ADA demonstrated a superior
   benefit-risk profile.}},

Abstract = {{New heat flow data and recent relative Vs (Delta Vs/Vs) studies suggest
   differential crustal warming from prolonged intrusions in the Socorro
   magma body area. Heat flow above the Socorro magma body, relative to the
   adjacent Colorado Plateau and Datil-Mogollon region, indicates that
   similar to 8 times more heat has been introduced into the crust than
   contained in a basaltic Socorro magma body. A combination of relative Vs
   contours and heat flow data suggests this differential is less, a factor
   similar to 4.5. From relative Vs contours, depth of Socorro magma body,
   and conduction time constants, the minimum time required to increase
   heat flow resulting from midcrustal intrusions is similar to 1-3 m.y.
   Recent models indicate that observed historic uplift at the Socorro
   magma body is explained by viscoelastic response of crustal material
   surrounding the Socorro magma body. Our estimates suggest that a long
   time scale (similar to 10(6) yr) for emplacement of basaltic magma
   sill(s) and surface uplift need not be directly related. Based on heat
   flow, we estimate >600 m of basaltic intrusion during
   Pliocene-Pleistocene time. Compared with adjacent rift basins, the
   Socorro magma body area shows anomalous landscape instability but no
   significant uplift of stream terraces across the magma body. Contiguous
   areas in the Rio Grande Rift have high heat flow but no present magma
   layer, no historic uplift, and little seismicity. Elliptical relative Vs
   crustal contours for the area suggest conductive heat transfer. The
   relative Vs model implies that the Socorro magma body is fed by narrow
   conduits (dikes) from the upper mantle and that the depth of the
   sill-like Socorro magma body is primarily controlled by rheology.}},

Title = {{INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC HYDRAULIC FACTORS IN VARYING SIZES OF TWO
   AMAZONIAN PALM SPECIES (IRIARTEA DELTOIDEA AND MAURITIA FLEXUOSA)
   DIFFERING IN DEVELOPMENT AND GROWING ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: This study seeks to determine how hydraulic
   factors vary with ontogeny and whether they begin to limit further
   height growth in palms. Palms are an attractive group for physiological
   research because their columnar trunks and simple leaf habit allow key
   intrinsic and extrinsic hydraulic variables to be estimated more easily
   than in complex arborescent dicotyledons.
   Methods: We measured various biometric and physiological factors
   including sap flux, leaf areas, turnover rates, and internode lengths in
   two Amazonian rainforest species: terra firme Iriartea deltoidea and
   swamp-adapted Mauritia flexuosa. These two palm species differ markedly
   in edaphic conditions, leaf type (pinnately compound vs. palmate), and
   bole development, making physiological comparisons between them
   important as well.
   Key results: The species exhibited differing patterns in height growth
   rate along boles, which appear to relate to their differences in bole
   development. Growth rates ultimately slowed at the tops of tall palms in
   both species. We also found a high degree of convergence in total leaf
   area with height in both species even though they exhibited contrasting
   patterns in both live frond number and leaf area per frond with height.
   Sap flux density from leaves was constant with height but four times
   greater in M. flexuosa than in I. deltoidea.
   Conclusions: Although height growth rates slow considerably in tall
   palms, neither species shows evidence that hydraulic factors become
   limiting because they are able to support much greater leaf areas with
   similar sap flux densities as shorter palms.}},

Abstract = {{Ever since they began to be widely discussed during the early nineteenth
   century, evolutionary ideas have played a controversial role in debates
   about politics and social reform. Understanding the political
   commitments of those who have sought to integrate politics and evolution
   is a complex challenge, though; not least because memories of
   mid-twentieth-century eugenic policies have frequently shaped how we
   talk about biosocial science. However, as the case of the Scottish
   biologist-turned-town-planner Patrick Geddes highlights, while we need
   to be aware of the broad appeal that biosocial science has historically
   held, we also need to recognise that current political categories can be
   misleading when thinking about those of who have put evolution and
   politics together.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a theory for magnetic relaxation phenomena developed in
   the framework of thermodynamics of irreversible processes (TIP) with
   internal variables by G. A. Kluitenberg (G. A. K.) and the author is
   reviewed. Analogies and correlations with thermodynamic theories with
   internal variables for mechanical distortional phenomena and dielectric
   relaxation phenomena, derived, respectively, by G. A. K., and by G. A.
   K. and the author, following the same procedure, are put forward as
   evidence. It is assumed that if n different types of irreversible
   microscopic phenomena give rise to magnetic relaxation, it is possible
   to describe thesemicroscopic phenomena splitting the total specific
   magnetization in n + 1 parts and introducing n of these partial specific
   magnetizations as internal variables in the thermodynamic state space.
   The phenomenological equations are formulated in the anisotropic and
   isotropic cases. Finally, linearizing the equations of state,
   generalizations of the Snoek equation for magnetic relaxation phenomena
   are obtained by eliminating the internal variables. Some results
   obtained in the paper are new.}},

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{319-329}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. A common procedure in the regression analysis of interspecies data is
   to first test the independent and dependent variables X and Y for
   phylogenetic signal, and then use the presence of signal in one or both
   traits to justify regression analysis using phylogenetic methods such as
   independent contrasts or phylogenetic generalized least squares.
   2. This is incorrect, because phylogenetic regression assumes that the
   residual error in the regression model (not in the original traits) is
   distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution with
   variances and covariances proportional to the historical relations of
   the species in the sample.
   3. Here, I examine the consequences of justifying and applying the
   phylogenetic regression incorrectly. I find that when used improperly
   the phylogenetic regression can have poor statistical performance, even
   under some circumstances in which the type I error rate of the method is
   not inflated over its nominal level.
   4. I also find, however, that when tests of phylogenetic signal in
   phylogenetic regression are applied properly, and in particular when
   phylogenetic signal in the residual error is simultaneously estimated
   with the regression parameters, the phylogenetic regression outperforms
   equivalent non-phylogenetic procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Eighty-five right-handed subjects (39 female and 46 male, 47 being
   right-eye dominant and 38 being left-eye dominant) were tested on three
   tasks of different levels of difficulty, performed in five locations. In
   the current study, participants were required to pick up the tool, pick
   up and pantomime how to use it and pick up and actual use on the
   materials provided. Our goal was to evaluate how the effect of object
   location interacts with task difficulty on adult hand selection. We also
   tried to evaluate the effect of eye dominance as a biological factor on
   hand selection. The result showed that the frequency of preferred hand
   reaches was greater for pantomime and real use than the pick up
   condition. This effect was mediated by the position of the object in
   hemispace, with more right hand reaches occurring for the use and
   pantomime task than the pick up task. The result also revealed that
   there is no difference between frequency of preferred hand reaches in
   left- and right-eye dominant. Based on results of this study, it can be
   suggested that limb selection depends on task and environmental
   constraints, rather than a biological factor like eye dominance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Identification of a patient cohort at high risk of
   developing oesophageal cancer might enable a greater proportion of
   patients with curable disease stages to be identified and permit better
   use of investigative resources. The aim of this study was to develop a
   scoring system that identifies patients with dysphagia at greatest risk
   of having oesophageal cancer.
   Methods: Data on 435 patients with dysphagia were recorded. Univariable
   and multivariable analyses were performed to identify parameters
   predictive of cancer. These were used to create the Edinburgh Dysphagia
   Score (EDS), which was then validated in a second cohort of patients.
   Results: The EDS contained six parameters: age, sex, weight loss,
   duration of symptoms, localization of dysphagia and acid reflux. It
   stratified the development cohort into a group at higher risk,
   containing 39 of 40 patients with cancer, and a group at lower risk,
   comprising 36.0 per cent of referrals (sensitivity 97.5 per cent,
   negative predictive value 99.3 per cent). On validation, the EDS divided
   the referrals into a higher-risk group identifying all 26 cancers and a
   lower-risk group comprising 30.0 per cent of referrals.
   Conclusion: From 574 referrals, the EDS correctly classified as higher
   risk all but one patient with cancer. Some 34.0 per cent of patients
   identified as lower risk could have been investigated less urgently.
   This simple scoring system permits sensitive prioritization of patients
   referred with dysphagia, and enables more efficient use of investigative
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of chronic leg ulcers remains a major health care issue.
   Although many reports have examined different topical dressings, none
   have specifically looked at microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). We aimed
   to evaluate in a prospective, open study the safety and performance of a
   MCC membrane (Veloderm) in a series of chronic leg wounds of different
   aetiology. Fifty-five patients participated in this study. The membrane
   was applied every 5-10 days for 1 month, immediately after surgical
   debridement. The wound bed was assessed on days 7, 15 and 30 for
   erythema, pain, exudate level and infection. The wound size change at 30
   days was the primary efficacy parameter and any adverse events were
   collected and analysed. A wound size change of 55\% was achieved at the
   end of follow-up, with an improvement in all the collected parameters,
   but the erythema, which showed a mild increase. To date, this is the
   largest experience with a MCC product in chronic wounds. Our study
   suggests that this treatment may be safe and useful and deserves further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{P>Vibrio cholerae causes the severe diarrhoeal disease cholera. A
   cascade of regulators controls expression of virulence determinants in
   V. cholerae at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
   ToxT is the direct transcription activator of the major virulence genes
   in V. cholerae. Here we describe TarA, a highly conserved, small
   regulatory RNA, whose transcription is activated by ToxT from toxboxes
   present upstream of the ToxT-activated gene tcpI. TarA regulates ptsG,
   encoding a major glucose transporter in V. cholerae. Cells
   overexpressing TarA exhibit decreased steady-state levels of ptsG mRNA
   and grow poorly in glucose-minimal media. A mutant lacking the
   ubiquitous regulatory protein Hfq expresses diminished TarA levels,
   indicating that TarA likely interacts with Hfq to regulate gene
   expression. RNAhybrid analysis of TarA and the putative ptsG mRNA leader
   suggests potential productive base-pairing between these two RNA
   molecules. A V. cholerae mutant lacking TarA is compromised for infant
   mouse colonization in competition with wild type, suggesting a role in
   the in vivo fitness of V. cholerae. Although somewhat functionally
   analogous to SgrS of Escherichia coli, TarA does not encode a regulatory
   peptide, and its expression is activated by the virulence gene pathway
   in V. cholerae and not by glycolytic intermediates.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This Article examines the complex ways in which William Prosser shaped
   the development of the American law of tort privacy. Although Prosser
   certainly gave tort privacy an order and legitimacy that it had
   previously lacked, he also stunted its development in ways that limited
   its ability to adapt to the problems of the Information Age. His
   skepticism about privacy, as well as his view that tort privacy lacked
   conceptual coherence, led him to categorize the law into a set of four
   narrow categories and strip it of any guiding concept to shape its
   future development. Prosser's legacy for tort privacy law is thus a
   mixed one: He greatly increased the law's stature at the cost of giving
   it no guidance and making it less able to adapt to new circumstances in
   the future. If tort privacy is to remain vital in a digital age, it must
   move beyond Prosser's conception.}},

Title = {{Aural Symptoms in Patients With Temporomandibular Joint Disorders:
   Multiple Frequency Tympanometry Provides Objective Evidence of Changes
   in Middle Ear Impedance}},
Journal = {{OTOLOGY \& NEUROTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The association of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders
   with aural symptoms, such as tinnitus, otic fullness, and subjective
   decrease of hearing acuity, is a well-established clinical observation.
   Although several hypotheses have been made about the otic-conductive
   origin of these complaints, conventional 226-Hz tympanometry has failed
   to demonstrate any middle ear abnormalities. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate patients with TMJ disorders with multiple frequency
   tympanometry (MFT).
   Study Design: Prospective clinical study.
   Setting: Outpatient clinic.
   Patients: The population of this study consisted of 40 patients with
   unilateral TMJ disorders diagnosed for longer than 1 month.
   Interventions: After verifying that there were no abnormal otoscopic
   findings, 226-Hz tympanometry, conventional pure-tone audiometry,
   brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and MFT were performed.
   Main Outcome Measure: Resonant frequency (RF) values.
   Results: With the exception of MFT, no abnormal audiologic findings were
   revealed. The ear ipsilateral to the lesion demonstrated significantly
   higher (p = 0.002) RF values in comparison to the contralateral ear. The
   difference in RF values was more obvious in patients aged 45 years or
   younger.
   Conclusion: The results of this study imply an increase in the stiffness
   of the middle ear, which has not been detected by conventional
   tympanometry. This represents the first concrete documentation of minor
   alterations in the conductive properties of the middle ear and seems to
   support the various hypotheses on the middle-ear origin of aural
   complaints in patients with TMJ disorders. Further studies are needed
   before a clear insight on the presumably multifactorial pathophysiology
   of these complaints can finally be reached.}},

Abstract = {{This prospective, non-interventional study (OROSANA4001) was conducted
   at 71 sites throughout Germany. 219 adults with chronic pain due to
   osteoporosis and a pain intensity >= 6 on a numerical rating scale (NRS
   0-10) were documented. Pain relief was rated by the patients on a scale
   from 0\% (no relief) to 100\% (complete relief) and the interference of
   pain with general activity was assessed on a scale from 0 to 10.
   Furthermore, satisfaction with pain therapy (by patient and physician)
   and patient's capability of physical therapy were evaluated.
   Tolerability was assessed by documentation of adverse events and study
   discontinuation. Treatment with oral osmotic hydromorphone decreased all
   pain intensity ratings significantly from baseline to the last
   assessment (p < 0.0001). Compared to baseline, the physical therapy
   capability improved significantly (p < 0.0001) in 76.3\% of patients (n
   = 135). Interference of pain with daily activities also improved
   significantly (p < 0.0001). At the last visit satisfaction with pain
   control was rated as very satisfied or satisfied by 77\% of patients (n
   = 99) and by 80\% of physicians (n = 104). Adverse events were reported
   by 70.1\% of patients; the most frequent adverse events were
   constipation (24.3\%), nausea (19.2\%), fatigue (15\%), and dizziness
   (14\%). Treatment with oral osmotic hydromorphone resulted in high
   treatment satisfaction, and significant pain relief combined with
   improved physical therapy capability and less interference of pain with
   daily activities. We conclude that pain management with oral osmotic

Abstract = {{Upon exposure to alkylating agents, Escherichia coli increases
   expression of aidB along with three genes (ada, alkA, and alkB) that
   encode DNA repair proteins. While the biological roles of the Ada, AlkA,
   and AlkB proteins have been defined, despite many efforts, the molecular
   functions of AidB remain largely unknown. In this study, we focused on
   the biological role of the AidB protein, and we demonstrated that AidB
   shows preferential binding to a DNA region that includes the upstream
   element of its own promoter, PaidB. The physiological significance of
   this specific interaction was investigated by in vivo gene expression
   assays, demonstrating that AidB can repress its own synthesis during
   normal cell growth. We also showed that the domain architecture of AidB
   is related to the different functions of the protein: the N-terminal
   region, comprising the first 439 amino acids (AidB ``I-III{''}),
   possesses FAD-dependent dehydrogenase activity, while its C-terminal
   domain, corresponding to residues 440 to 541 (AidB ``IV{''}), displays
   DNA binding activity and can negatively regulate the expression of its
   own gene in vivo. Our results define a novel role in gene regulation for
   the AidB protein and underline its multifunctional nature.}},

Abstract = {{Nanosized materials of gadolinium oxide can provide high-contrast
   enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this
   research was to characterize a novel emulsion composed of a
   silicon-based nanocomposite polymer (NCP) and gadolinium (III) oxide
   (Gd2O3) nanoparticles. The size and morphological structure of this
   nanoparticle are determined by particle size analysis device (zeta
   sizer) and transmission electronic microscope. We determined composition
   of Gd2O3 nanoparticles with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) and
   magnetic resonance signal by T (1)-weighted MRI. Cytotoxicity of Gd2O3
   nanoparticles in SK-MEL-3 cancer cells was evaluated. Zeta sizer showed
   Gd2O3 nanoparticles to be 75 nm in size. EDXA indicated the two main
   chemical components of gadolinium-nanocomposite polymer emulsion:
   gadolinium and silicon and MRI also showed a significantly higher
   incremental relaxivity for Gd2O3 nanoparticles compared to Magnevist
   (conventional contrast agent). In such concentrations, the slope of R-1
   relaxivity (1/T (1)) vs. concentration curve of Magnevist and Gd2O3 were
   4.33, 7.98 s(-1) mM(-1). The slope of R-2 relaxivity (1/T (2)) vs.
   concentration curve of Magnevist and Gd2O3 were 5.06, 13.75 s(-1)
   mM(-1). No appreciable toxicity was observed with Gd2O3 nanoparticles.
   Gadolinium-nanocomposite polymer emulsion is well characterized and has
   potential as a useful contrast agent for magnetic resonance molecular
   imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The assertion that ability differences no longer matter beyond a certain
   threshold is inaccurate. Among young adolescents in the top 1\% of
   quantitative reasoning ability, individual differences in general
   cognitive ability level and in specific cognitive ability pattern (that
   is, the relationships among an individual's math, verbal, and spatial
   abilities) lead to differences in educational, occupational, and
   creative outcomes decades later. Whereas ability level predicts the
   level of achievement, ability pattern predicts the realm of achievement.
   Adding information on vocational interests refines prediction of
   educational and career choices. Finally, lifestyle preferences relevant
   to career choice, performance, and persistence often change between ages
   25 and 35. This change results in sex differences in preferences, which
   likely have relevance for understanding the underrepresentation of women
   in careers that demand more than full-time (40 hours per week)
   commitment.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The significant reforms being implemented in governance systems around
   the world reflect a broader transition of society from the modern to a
   new emerging era. This transition is framed in terms of a shift from a
   mechanistic to an ecological worldview, stimulated by a number of
   developments during the twentieth century and the last decade. In
   contrast to the mechanistic orientation toward reductionism, prediction
   and control, and competition, an ecological worldview emphasizes the
   interconnectedness, self-organizing capacity, and coevolutionary
   dynamics of all natural systems. This emergent worldview yields useful
   insights regarding the purpose, design, process, and relationships
   characteristic of organizational systems that strive to play an
   effective role in the future governance of society. The discussion
   outlines specific organizing principles pertinent to these four areas,
   identifying some compatible practices that are already being adopted by
   public and private organizations. The authors address the possibility
   that the continued transition to ecological governance may not reflect
   just a long, slow process of incremental change, but also could entail a
   sudden, systemic reorientation that results in a faster transformation
   of the extant institutions of public administration.}},

Abstract = {{Therapies that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
   pathway cause hypertension, but the mechanism remains unknown. This
   cross-sectional study tested the hypothesis that VEGF inhibition causes
   hypertension by suppressing VEGF-mediated vasodilatory pathways. Urine
   was collected from 80 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma from
   2002 to 2009, 40 at baseline and 40 while on VEGF inhibitors. Measured
   urinary biomarkers include albumin, metabolites of the nitric oxide (NO)
   pathway and its downstream effector cGMP, and prostaglandin pathway
   biomarkers prostaglandin E2, 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, and cAMP,
   all normalized to urinary creatinine. The mean age in both groups was
   61.8 years, 76\% were men, and urinary albumin was higher in patients
   receiving VEGF inhibitors (median: 18.4 versus 4.6 mg/g; P=0.009).
   cGMP/creatinine was suppressed in patients on VEGF inhibitors (0.28
   versus 0.39 pmol/mu g; P=0.01), with a trend toward suppression of
   nitrate/creatinine (0.46 versus 0.62 mu mol/mg; P=0.09). Both
   comparisons were strengthened when patients on bevacizumab were
   excluded, and only those receiving small molecule tyrosine kinase
   inhibitors were analyzed (cGMP/creatinine: P=0.003; nitrate/creatinine:
   P=0.01). Prostaglandin E2, 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, and cAMP did
   not differ between groups. These results suggest that hypertension
   induced by VEGF inhibitors is mediated by suppression of NO production.
   Prospective studies are needed to explore whether these biomarkers may
   be useful predictors of efficacy in patients receiving VEGF-targeted
   therapies. (Hypertension. 2010;56:1131-1136.)}},

   of methane into methanol in conditions of simultaneous oxygen evolution.
   The GDE was obtained by pressing and sintering TiO2(0.7)/RuO2(0.3)
   powder and PTFE and used for the electrosynthesis of methanol from
   methane. In the experiments, methane was inserted into the reaction
   medium by the GDE and electrosynthesis was carried out in 0.1 mol L-1
   Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte. Controlled potential experiments showed
   that methanol concentration increased with applied potential, reaching
   220 mg L-1 cm(2), at 2.2 V vs. a calomel reference electrode and current
   efficiency for methanol formation was 30\%. Mass spectrometry data also
   indicated the formation of formaldehyde and formic acid, the latter at a

Abstract = {{Introduction: Helical tomotherapy (HT) is an innovative approach to the
   delivery of intensity-modulated radiation therapy which combines the
   imaging elements of helical computed tomography (CT) with megavoltage
   linear accelerator treatment. The purpose of this report is to describe
   our experience with the clinical implementation of HT for genitourinary
   malignancies.
   Materials and methods: All patients treated with a primary genitourinary
   malignancy were included in this study cohort. Descriptive statistics
   for various demographic and treatment-related parameters such as patient
   age, primary site of disease, site of radiotherapy, goal of treatment,
   dose/fractionation, immobilization and clinical trial enrolment were
   calculated.
   Results: A total of 57 patients diagnosed with a primary genitourinary
   malignancy were treated on the helical tomotherapy unit during the study
   period. Median age was 69 years (range 45 to 83 years) and 56 (98.2\%)
   patients were male. Prostate cancer was the most frequently treated
   genitourinary cancer in this cohort of 57 (94.7\%) cases. Ten patients
   (17.5\%) were treated with palliative intent, 46 (80.7\%) with radical
   intent (including full dose prostate bed adjuvant/salvage RT), and one
   (1.8\%) patient was treated in a purely adjuvant manner (high risk
   postop bladder).
   Conclusions: HT is a technology that can be utilized in both radical and
   palliative genitourinary treatment situations in order to deliver
   precise conformal IMRT therapy with unique localization and critical
   structure avoidance properties.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this work is the study of consumers' preferences of
   ``Cabrito Transmontano{''}, a meat product with POD (Protected Origin
   Designation) label. The effects of sex and carcass weight were studied.
   Variables of taste, texture, juiciness and overall acceptability were
   evaluated on 60 animals grouped by sex and carcass weight in 6 different
   groups. A trained taste panel established some sensory characteristics
   of the meat. Sensory preference of meat was evaluated by a consumers'
   panel. Consumers' panel preferred lighter carcasses, in all sensory
   variables studied, and showed no marked preference by any sex. The
   results indicate that the Breed Association should sell young animals to
   produce light carcasses according to consumer preferences. This can be a
   good way to reduce production costs, because these animals have to be
   fed just for a short period with their mothers' milk, and do not compete
   long time with the milk production, fundamental to produce cheese also
   another product with protected origin label, they also tend to reach a
   higher market price.}},

Abstract = {{In the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, septic tanks are one of the main
   wastewater treatment systems. The sludge generated in these systems is
   disposed of with no previous treatment. Existing data suggest that use
   of earthworms for treatment of sewage sludge is a viable alternative,
   and the vermicompost could be a product of agricultural importance. This
   work evaluated the production of seedlings of habanero pepper Capsicum
   chinense with vermicompost from sewage sludge from septic systems,
   compared with the commercial substrate peat moss. Maximum total height
   and increase (13.5 and 10.58 cm, respectively) were observed with the
   100\% vermicompost substrate, generated with an earthworm density of 2.5
   kg.m(2). The average survival of transplanted seedlings was more than
   90\%. The highest values of nutrients of agricultural importance were
   generally observed in substrates containing the largest amounts of
   vermicompost. The results suggest that the use of vermicompost generated
   from sewage sludge in the production of seedlings of habanero pepper,
   has environmental and economic benefits; however, it is important to
   continue evaluating strategies that will allow improving the quality of
   vermicompost, which is valuable for any agricultural product.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Synthetic Fe chelates are commonly used to overcome Fe
   deficiencies in crops, but most of them are scarcely biodegradable.
   Iminodisuccinic acid (IDHA) is a biodegradable chelating agent that is
   currently being evaluated as an alternative to EDTA. In this work, the
   efficacy of the foliar application of IDHA/Fe3+ to soybean chlorotic
   plants under controlled conditions was studied, testing the influence of
   the adjuvant used and of the plant nutritional status.
   RESULTS: When IDHA/Fe3+ was applied to soybean plants with severe Fe
   chlorosis and the foliar sprays were the sole source of Fe, this chelate
   behaved similarly to the EDTA/Fe3+ and the recovery of the plants was
   slight in both cases. The same chelates were tested when foliar sprays
   were an additional source of Fe for mildly chlorotic plants, which were
   also being supplied with low concentrations of Fe applied to the
   nutrient solution. Then, plant recovery was appreciable in all cases,
   and the IDHA/Fe3+ was as effective as EDTA/Fe3+. Among the adjuvants
   studied, a urea-based product was the only one that did not damage the
   leaf surface and that could improve the efficiency of IDHA/Fe3+ up tp
   the level of EDTA/Fe3+.
   CONCLUSIONS: Thus, it was concluded the foliar application of IDHA/Fe3+
   can be an environmentally friendly alternative to the non-biodegradable
   chelate EDTA/Fe3+ when the appropriate adjuvant is used. (C) 2010

   were 3170 +/- 420 and 39.21 +/- 1.29, respectively. Percentage of fat
   mass increased significantly over the first 4 mo (p < 0.001), both in
   boys and girls, with no differences detected between boys and girls at
   any time point. This article provides preliminary in-depth data on
   whole-body composition, in exclusively breast-fed infants during the
   first months of life. Further studies assessing larger sample sizes are
   desirable to develop reference body composition data. (Pediatr Res 68:

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic procedure for the elastodynamic
   modeling of industrial robots that is applicable to either serial or
   parallel manipulators. This procedure is based on a 3-D space
   generalization of the equivalent rigid link system (ERLS) description,
   the finite-element method (FEM), and the Lagrange principle. It
   considers flexible links and joints, and leads to generic equations of
   motion expressed according to the angles of the actuated joints and the
   independent elastic degrees of freedom. An efficient identification
   process through modal analysis is detailed, and the description of
   damping and joint behavior according to the model application is
   discussed. The method is applied to a 3-D delta-like parallel structure
   and successfully validated through an experimental impact testing-based
   modal analysis.}},

Abstract = {{ELISA with antibodies to corticosterone was used to evaluate the
   possibility of estimating the level of adrenocortical activity in male
   bank voles, Myodes glareolus (Rodentia, Cricetidae), by determining the
   concentration of immunoreactive steroids (IRS) in their feces. The
   binding curves of dilutions of the corticosterone standard and the
   extracts from dried feces were shown to be parallel. The corticosteroid
   response was evoked by ACTH injection, blood sampling, or
   immobilization. The response to ACTH injection was highly significant
   both in the blood in and fecal samples (a delayed response after 4 h),
   with daily variation in the IRS level being insignificant. In the case
   of blood sampling, the increased level of fecal IRS was recorded after 4
   h and remained high after 8 h. Immobilization did not result in any
   significant increase in blood corticosterone or fecal IRS level.
   Individual baseline concentrations of fecal IRS levels were found to be
   highly repeatable between days. Thus, the antibodies to corticosterone
   used in this study (IZW, Berlin, Germany) proved effective for the
   assessment of stress by measuring fecal IRS in bank voles.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging picture of prehistoric Arabia suggests that early modern
   humans were able to survive periodic hyperarid oscillations by
   contracting into environmental refugia around the coastal margins of the
   peninsula. This paper reviews new paleoenvironmental, archaeological,
   and genetic evidence from the Arabian Peninsula and southern Iran to
   explore the possibility of a demographic refugium dubbed the ``Gulf
   Oasis,{''} which is posited to have been a vitally significant zone for
   populations residing in southwest Asia during the Late Pleistocene and
   Early Holocene. These data are used to assess the role of this large
   oasis, which, before being submerged beneath the waters of the Indian
   Ocean, was well watered by the Tigris, Euphrates, Karun, and Wadi Batin
   rivers as well as subterranean aquifers flowing beneath the Arabian
   subcontinent. Inverse to the amount of annual precipitation falling
   across the interior, reduced sea levels periodically exposed large
   portions of the Arabo-Persian Gulf, equal at times to the size of Great
   Britain. Therefore, when the hinterlands were desiccated, populations
   could have contracted into the Gulf Oasis to exploit its freshwater
   springs and rivers. This dynamic relationship between environmental
   amelioration/desiccation and marine transgression/regression is thought
   to have driven demographic exchange into and out of this zone over the
   course of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, as well as having
   played an important role in shaping the cultural evolution of local
   human populations during that interval.}},

Abstract = {{Prion propagation in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies involves
   the conversion of the cellular prion protein, PrPC, into the pathogenic
   conformer PrPSc. Human familial forms of the disease are linked to
   specific mutations in the PrP gene, PRNP, and include
   Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), familial
   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD), and fatal familial insomnia. To gain
   insights into the molecular basis of these disorders, we performed 200
   ns of classical molecular dynamic simulations in aqueous solution on
   wild type (WT) human PrP (HuPrP), and on three HuPrP variants located in
   the globular HuPrP domain: two pathological mutations, HuPrP(Q212P) and
   HuPrP(E200K), linked to GSS and to fCJD respectively, and one protective
   polymorphism, HuPrP(E219K) (total time-scale simulated 800 ns). A
   comparison between the predicted structural determinants of WT HuPrP and
   HuPrP(E200K) with their NMR structures established the accuracy of the
   methods used. Strikingly, the analyzed disease-linked variants produced
   their major effect on the alpha(2)-alpha(3) region and the
   beta(2)-alpha(2) loop, regardless of the mutation position. The
   conformational change of the latter might affect the interactions with
   cellular partners in the fibrillation process. The protocol proposed
   here represents a powerful approach for reproducing the structural
   effects of genetic mutations located in the globular domain of HuPrP,
   such as the GSS-related HuPrP(Q212P) and the protective polymorphism
   HuPrP(E219K).}},

Abstract = {{In this study we investigate the relationship between individual
   differences in associative information processing and different facets
   of creativity. Associative information processing was measured by means
   of a slightly modified variant of Gianotti et al.'s (2001) word pair
   list, in which participants are shown indirectly related (e.g. cat -
   cheese) and unrelated word pairs (e.g. subject - marriage) and asked to
   generate a third word that could possibly serve as a connective
   associative link between the presented stimuli words. In contrast to
   Gianotti et al., we instructed our participants to judge the associative
   distance between the given problem words on a rating scale. This
   modified word pair list was administered along with a variety of
   psychometric creativity tasks in two different groups of university
   students who considerably differed with respect to their
   creativity-related demands in their fields of studies. We observed a
   weak but significant negative correlation between originality and the
   rated associative distance between the unrelated word pairs. In addition
   to this, the higher creative group estimated the distance between
   unrelated word pairs as being smaller than lower creative people. The
   results support Mednick's (1962) theory of individual differences in
   associative hierarchies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Opioid-bowel dysfunction (OBD) is a broad
   range of symptoms potentially associated with opioid therapy. This
   prospective, multicentric study assesses the prevalence of OBD in
   patients on analgesic therapy for the treatment of pain from any cause
   and identifies the factors associated with the onset of this side
   effect.
   Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients aged >18 years, on analgesic
   treatment with opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
   or other therapies for chronic pain of any aetiology were included in
   the study. The association of OBD with gender, age, pain aetiology and
   analgesic treatment was analyzed by multivariate analysis and logistic
   analysis.
   Results: In total, 2324 patients were included in the study. The
   prevalence of OBD symptoms was 63.5\%, despite that the wide majority of
   patients (89.5\%) were receiving laxatives. OBD symptoms were judged as
   directly correlated with analgesic therapy in 85.1\% of cases. The
   highest prevalence of constipation was reported with morphine, whereas
   the lowest was observed in patients on oxycodone CR and buprenorphine
   TTS. Statistical analysis showed that patients on opioids have a higher
   likelihood of experiencing OBD symptoms than those on NSAIDs or other
   treatments (66.2\% vs 37.0\%), and this probability is even higher in
   those with cancer-related pain (69.3\%). Female gender and age >70 years
   also appeared as risk factors. The logistic analysis indicated that
   cancer-related pain, increased age and the use of fentanyl are positive
   predictors of the presence of OBD, whereas the administration of
   oxicodone CR was associated with a decreased incidence of these
   symptoms.
   Discussion: Even with the limitation of any observational experience,
   this study suggests, for the first time, the existence of some factors
   predictive of the onset of OBD symptoms in patients on analgesic
   treatment. Moreover, different opioids seem to be associated with a
   different risk of experiencing these symptoms.}},

Title = {{Impact of KCNE Subunits on KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) Channel Membrane Surface
   Targeting}},

Abstract = {{The KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) channel plays an important role in cardiovascular
   physiology. Cardiomyocytes co-express KCNQ1 with KCNE1-5 proteins. KCNQ1
   may co-associate with multiple KCNE regulatory subunits to generate
   different biophysically and pharmacologically distinct channels.
   Increasing evidence indicates that the location and targeting of
   channels are important determinants of their function. In this context,
   the presence of K+ channels in sphingolipid cholesterol-enriched
   membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) is under investigation. Lipid rafts
   are important for cardiovascular functioning. We aimed to determine
   whether KCNE subunits modify the localization and targeting of KCNQ1
   channels in lipid rafts microdomains. HEK-293 cells were transiently
   transfected with KCNQ1 and KCNE1-5, and their traffic and presence in
   lipid rafts were analyzed. Only KCNQ1 and KCNE3, when expressed alone,
   co-localized in raft fractions. In addition, while KCNE2 and KCNE5
   notably stained the cell surface, KCNQ1 and the rest of the KCNEs showed
   strong intracellular retention. KCNQ1 targets multiple membrane surface
   microdomains upon association with KCNE peptides. Thus, while
   KCNQ1/KCNE1 and KCNQ1/KCNE2 channels target lipid rafts, KCNQ1
   associated with KCNE3-5 did not. Channel membrane dynamics, analyzed by
   fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, further
   supported these results. In conclusion, the trafficking and targeting
   pattern of KCNQ1 can be influenced by its association with KCNEs. Since
   KCNQ1 is crucial for cardiovascular physiology, the temporal and spatial
   regulations that different KCNE subunits may confer to the channels
   could have a dramatic impact on membrane electrical activity and
   putative endocrine regulation. J. Cell. Physiol. 225: 692-700,2010. (C)

Title = {{Excellent reproducibility of laser speckle contrast imaging to assess
   skin microvascular reactivity}},
Journal = {{MICROVASCULAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{505-511}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We compared the inter-day reproducibility of post-occlusive
   reactive hyperemia (PORH) assessed by single-point laser Doppler
   flowmetry (LDF) and laser speckle contrast analysis (LSCI), and the
   reproducibility of local thermal hyperemia (LTH) assessed by LDF, laser
   Doppler imaging (LDI) and LSCI. We also tested whether skin blood flow
   assessment by LDF and by LSCI are correlated.
   Methods: Skin blood flow was evaluated during PORH and LTH using LDF,
   LDI (for LTH only) and LSCI on the forearms of healthy volunteers, at a
   7 day interval. Data are expressed as cutaneous vascular conductance
   (CVC), as a function of baseline and scaled to the thermal plateau.
   Reproducibility is expressed as within subject coefficients of variation
   (CV, in \%) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC).
   Results: Twenty-eight healthy participants were enrolled in this study.
   The reproducibility of the PORH peak CVC was better when assessed with
   LSCI compared to LDF (CV=8\%; ICC=0.76 and CV=30\%; ICC=0.54,
   respectively). Inter-day reproducibility of the LTH plateau was better
   when assessed with LSCI or LDI than LDF (CV=15\%, ICC=0.66; CV=17\%,
   ICC=0.51 and CV=42\%, ICC=0.28 respectively). Finally, we observed
   significant correlation between simultaneous LDF and LSCI measurements
   of the PORH peak CVC (R=0.54; p=0.001).
   Conclusion: The recently developed LSCI technique showed very good
   inter-day reproducibility for assessing PORH and LTH. Moreover, we
   showed significant correlation between LSCI and single-point LDF for
   PORH. However, more data are needed to evaluate the linearity between
   the LSCI signal and skin blood flow. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6, SI}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Microtunnelling traditionally utilises pipe-jacked or segmental lining
   systems, however when employed over long, continuous distances, which
   may include changes in depth and direction, both lining systems have
   associated limitations that would reduce the drive rate of the TBM and
   increase the costs of the project. The use of an extruded lining system
   could circumvent a number of these limitations and make such an
   undertaking economically viable. A numerical model has been developed to
   simulate the extrusion of a tunnel lining from a microtunnelling TBM.
   The model was created in Plaxis (3-D Tunnel), a commercially available
   finite element modelling package. A methodology was developed and tested
   to approximate the movement of a TBM and the curing of the extruded
   lining, both of which are time-based phenomena. The extruded materials
   were subsequently investigated, using published strength-curing time for
   a normal strength concrete and a polymer concrete, for two drive rates.
   The outcome of the modelling suggests that the relationship between the
   developing stiffness and time in the early phases of curing is critical
   if an extruded lining system is to be deployed behind a TBM without
   slowing its drive rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Do people with mental illness deserve what they get? Links between

Abstract = {{Meritocratic worldviews that stress personal responsibility, such as the
   Protestant ethic or general beliefs in a just world, are typically
   associated with stigmatizing attitudes and could explain the persistence
   of mental illness stigma. Beliefs in a just world for oneself ({''}I get
   what I deserve{''}), however, are often related to personal well-being
   and can be a coping resource for stigmatized individuals. Despite these
   findings in other stigmatized groups, the link between worldviews and
   the stigma of psychiatric disorders is unknown. We measured just world
   beliefs for self and others as well as endorsement of the Protestant
   ethic in 85 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or affective
   disorders and 50 members of the general public. Stigmatizing attitudes
   toward people with mental illness (perceived responsibility, perceived
   dangerousness, general agreement with negative stereotypes) were
   assessed by self-report. Using a response-latency task, the Brief
   Implicit Association Test, we also examined guilt-related implicit
   negative stereotypes about mental illness. We found a consistent
   positive link between endorsing the Protestant ethic and stigmatizing
   self-reported attitudes in both groups. Implicit guilt-related
   stereotypes were positively associated with the Protestant ethic only
   among members of the public. Among people with mental illness, stronger
   just world beliefs for self were related to reduced self-stigma, but
   also to more implicit blame of persons with mental illness. The
   Protestant ethic may increase (self-)stigmatizing attitudes; just world
   beliefs for oneself, on the other hand, may lead to unexpected implicit
   self-blame in stigmatized individuals. Public anti-stigma campaigns and
   initiatives to reduce self-stigma among people with mental illness
   should take worldviews into account.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a new variant of the KAM theory, containing an
   artificial parameter q, 0 < q < 1, which makes the steps of the KAM
   iteration infinitely small in the limit q NE arrow 1. This KAM procedure
   can be compared for q < 1 with a Riemann sum which tends, for q NE arrow
   1, to the corresponding Riemann integral. As a consequence this limit
   has all advantages of an integration process compared with its
   preliminary stages: Simplification of the conditions for the involved
   parameters and global linearization which therefore improves numerical
   results. But there is a difference from integrals: The KAM iteration
   itself works only for q < 1, however, q can be chosen as near to 1 as we
   want and the limit q NE arrow 1 exists for all involved parameters.
   Hence, the mentioned advantages remain mainly preserved. The new
   technique of estimation differs completely from all what has appeared
   about KAM theory in the literature up to date. Only Kolmogorov's idea of
   local linearization and Moser's modifying terms are left. The basic idea
   is to use the polynomial structure in order to transfer, at least
   partially, the whole KAM procedure outside of the original domain of
   definition of the given dynamical system.}},

   provide support for the efficacy of BCT for improving substance use
   behavior, dyadic adjustment, child psychosocial outcomes, and reducing
   partner violence. This review includes a description of BCT, summaries
   of primary and secondary outcomes, highlights methodological strengths
   and weaknesses, notes barriers to dissemination, suggests future
   research directions, and provides clinical implications for couple and
   family therapists. Although there are several versions of BCT developed
   for the treatment of substance abuse this paper focuses on the version
   developed by O'Farrell, Fals-Stewart, and colleagues.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{ISIDA Property-Labelled Fragment Descriptors (IPLF) were introduced as a
   general framework to numerically encode molecular structures in
   chemoinformatics, as counts of specific subgraphs in which atom vertices
   are coloured with respect to some local property/feature. Combining
   various colouring strategies of the molecular graph - notably
   pH-dependent pharmacophore and electrostatic potential-based flagging -
   with several fragmentation schemes, the different subtypes of IPLFs may
   range from classical atom pair and sequence counts, to monitoring
   population levels of branched fragments or feature multiplets. The
   pH-dependent feature flagging, pursued at the level of each
   significantly populated microspecies involved in the proteolytic
   equilibrium, may furthermore add some competitive advantage over
   classical descriptors, even when the chosen fragmentation scheme is one
   of the state-of-the-art pattern extraction procedures (feature sequence
   or pair counts, etc.) in chemoinformatics. The implemented fragmentation
   schemes support counting (1) linear feature sequences, (2) feature
   pairs, (3) circular feature fragments a.k.a. ``augmented atoms{''} or
   (4) feature trees. Fuzzy rendering - optionally allowing nonterminal
   fragment atoms to be counted as wildcards, ignoring their specific
   colours/features - ensures for a seamless transition between the
   ``strict{''} counts (sequences or circular fragments) and the
   ``fuzzy{''} multiplet counts (pairs or trees). Also, bond information
   may be represented or ignored, thus leaving the user a vast choice in
   terms of the level of resolution at which chemical information should be
   extracted into the descriptors. Selected IPLF subsets were - tree
   descriptors, in particular - successfully tested in both neighbourhood
   behaviour and QSAR modelling challenges, with very promising results.
   They showed excellent results in similarity-based virtual screening for
   analogue protease inhibitors, and generated highly predictive
   octanol-water partition coefficient and hERG channel inhibition models.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain 2 (NOD2) has been reported to
   be a candidate gene for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis
   (MAP) infection in a Bos taurus x Bos indicus mixed breed based on a
   genetic association with the c.2197T>C single nucleotide polymorphism
   (SNP). Nevertheless, this SNP has also been reported to be monomorphic
   in the B. taurus species. In the present work, 18 SNPs spanning the
   bovine NOD2 gene have been analysed in a genetic association study of
   two independent populations of Holstein-Friesian cattle. We found that
   the C allele of SNP c.{*}1908C>T, located in the 3'-UTR region of the
   gene, is significantly more frequent in infected animals than in healthy
   ones, which supports the idea that the bovine NOD2 gene plays a role in
   susceptibility to MAP infection. However, in silico analyses of the NOD2
   nucleotide sequence did not yield definitive data about a possible
   direct effect of SNP c.{*}1908C>T on susceptibility to infection and led
   us to consider its linkage disequilibrium with the causative variant. A
   more exhaustive genetic association study including all putative,
   functional SNPs from this gene and subsequent functional analyses needs
   to be conducted to achieve a more complete understanding of how
   different variants of NOD2 may affect susceptibility to MAP infection in
   cattle.}},

Abstract = {{Animations of hair dynamics greatly enrich the visual attractiveness of
   human characters. Traditional simulation techniques handle hair as
   clumps or continuum for efficiency; however, the visual quality is
   limited because they cannot represent the fine-scale motion of
   individual hair strands. Although a recent mass-spring approach tackled
   the problem of simulating the dynamics of every strand of hair, it
   required a complicated setting of springs and suffered from high
   computational cost. In this paper, we base the animation of hair on such
   a fine-scale on Lattice Shape Matching (LSM), which has been
   successfully used for simulating deformable objects. Our method regards
   each strand of hair as a chain of particles, and computes geometrically
   derived forces for the chain based on shape matching. Each chain of
   particles is simulated as an individual strand of hair. Our method can
   easily handle complex hairstyles such as curly or afro styles in a
   numerically stable way. While our method is not physically based, our
   GPU-based simulator achieves visually plausible animations consisting of
   several tens of thousands of hair strands at interactive rates.}},

Abstract = {{Efficacy of proteins can be enhanced by using polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   conjugation (PEGylation) to the protein molecules. Mobile non-toxic PEG
   chains conjugated to bio-therapeutics increase their hydrodynamic volume
   and in turn can prolong their plasma retention time and increase their
   solubility. An important aspect of PEGylation is the selection of PEG
   molecule with suitable structure and molecular weight. In this study,
   conceiving the idea that branched PEG-conjugates show superior efficacy
   over the linear PEG-conjugates, a tri-branched PEG-interferon
   (mPEG(3)L(2)-IFN) was synthesized by reacting a 30 KDa tri-branched
   mPEG(3)L(2)-NHS reagent with IFN to improve its pharmacokinetic
   properties and reduce the loss of in vitro bioactivity (which is
   generally exhibited by PEGylation) of the conjugated protein to some
   extent. The PEGylation procedure was optimized in terms of concentration
   and molar ratios of reactants, reaction time, temperature and pH
   conditions of the reaction mix. The conjugate was purified by cation
   exchange chromatography and characterized by SDS-PAGE and SE-HPLC.
   Trypsin digestion of mPEG(3)L(2)-IFN indicated a single site specificity
   of PEGylation. Anti viral bioactivity of mPEG(3)L(2)-IFN was found to be
   2.38 x 10(7) IU/mg which is approximately 9.52\% of native IFN alpha 2
   (2.5 x 10(8) IU/mg) and better than PEGasys from Roche Pharma.
   Therefore, it is reported that the tri-branched mPEG(3)L(2)-NHS reagent
   has the potential to be used to conjugate proteins for the promising
   therapeutic results.}},

Abstract = {{Syntheses and evaluation of fluoroalkylated ciprofloxacin analogues are
   described. Among these analogues, N-4'-3-fluoropropylciprofloxacin (16)
   showed the most efficient antibacterial activity against E. colt strains
   (DH5 alpha and TOP10) and a high binding affinity for DNA gyrase of
   bacteria. To develop bacteria-specific infection imaging agents for
   position emission tomography (PET), no-carrier-added
   N-4'-3-{[}F-18]fluoropropylciprofloxacin ({[}F-18]16) was prepared in
   two steps from N-4'-3-methanesufonyloxypropylciprofloxacin, resulting in
   a 40\% radiochemical yield (decay corrected for 100 min) via the
   ten-alcohol media radiofluorination protocol with high radiochemical
   purity (>99\%) as well as high specific activity (149 +/- 75 GBq/mu
   mol). The agent was stable (>90\%), as shown by an in vitro human serum
   stability assay. A bacterial uptake and blocking study of {[}F-18]16
   using authentic compound 16 in TOP10 cells demonstrated its high
   specific bacterial uptake. The results suggest that this radiotracer
   holds promise as a useful bacterial infection radiopharmaceutical for
   PET imaging.}},

Abstract = {{An epidemiological investigation of the one-humped camel (Camelus
   dromedarius) was carried out to determine the status of camel
   brucellosis in the Lake Chad area of Borno state. A total of five
   hundred and eleven (511) sera were collected from adult one-humped
   camels and tested by Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and Microtitre Serum
   Agglutination Test (MSAT). Sixty two (12.13 per cent) of this samples
   tested positive by both RBPT and MSAT, out of which 23(4.5 per cent)
   were male and 39 (7.6 per cent) were female camels. There was no
   statistically significant association between sex and reaction to either
   of the serological tests P>0.05; OR=0.388-1.161. Two hundred and fifty
   seven (257) of the 511 sera collected were from slaughtered camels from
   abattoir while the remaining two hundred and fifty four (254) were from
   range camels. Thirty eight (14.8 per cent) of the 257 camels slaughtered
   in the abattoir and 24 (9.4 per cent) of those in the range were
   positive by both RBPT and MSAT, respectively. The statistical
   association was also not significant (P>0.05). Ten (3.9 per cent) and 14
   (5.5 per cent) males and females, respectively were positive by both
   RBPT and MSAT, out of the 254 samples collected from range herds in the
   Lake Chad area of Borno state. Thirteen (5.05 per cent) of the 144 males
   from the abattoir samples were positive while 25 (9.7 per cent) of the
   113 female were positive by both RBPT and MSAT. There was statistically
   significant association between positive serological reactions in female
   camels slaughtered in abattoir and those in herds in the range
   (OR=1.514-6.202; P<0.05). The overall prevalence of brucellosis among

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The puzzle-assembly problem has many application areas such as
   restoration and reconstruction of archeological findings, repairing of
   broken objects, solving jigsaw type puzzles, molecular docking problem,
   etc. The puzzle pieces usually include not only geometrical shape
   information but also visual information such as texture, color, and
   continuity of lines. This paper presents a new approach to the
   puzzle-assembly problem that is based on using textural features and
   geometrical constraints. The texture of a band outside the border of
   pieces is predicted by inpainting and texture synthesis methods. Feature
   values are derived from these original and predicted images of pieces.
   An affinity measure of corresponding pieces is defined and alignment of
   the puzzle pieces is formulated as an optimization problem where the
   optimum assembly of the pieces is achieved by maximizing the total
   affinity measure. A Fast Fourier Transform based image registration
   technique is used to speed up the alignment of the pieces. Experimental
   results are presented on real and artificial data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To evaluate the outcome and preoperative risks of twin twin
   transfusion syndrome (TTTS) following fetoscopic laser surgery (FLS).
   Methods A retrospective cohort study of a series of 181 consecutive
   cases of TUTS before 26 weeks' gestation subjected to FLS at four
   centers in Japan between July 2002 and December 2006.
   Results The chances of survival of at least one twin at 28 days of age
   and 6 months of age were 91.2\% and 90.1\%, respectively. The rate of
   major neurological complications in survivors at 6 months of age was
   4.7\%. Preoperative findings that were significant risk factors for
   death were as follows: (1) being donor {[}odds ratio (OR): 3.01, 95\%
   confidence interval (Cl): 1.24-7.31, P = 0.015]; (2) reversed (OR:
   11.78, CI: 3.05-45.55, P < 0.001) and absent (OR: 3.95, CI: 1.66-9.43, P
   = 0.002) end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery (EDV-UA) of the
   donor; and (3) reversed blood flow in the ductus venosus of the
   recipient (OR: 2.35, CI: 1.04-5.29, P = 0.040).
   Conclusions FLS leads to high survival rates and low neurological
   morbidity for fetuses in TTTS. FLS is an effective therapeutic option
   for before 26 weeks of gestation. Preoperative Doppler findings of the
   umbilical artery and the ductus venosus are useful in predicting
   prognosis following FLS. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A genome-wide association study was conducted using a mixed model
   analysis for QTL for fertility traits in Danish and Swedish Holstein
   cattle. The analysis incorporated 2,531 progeny tested bulls, and a
   total of 36 387 SNP markers on 29 bovine autosomes were used. Eleven
   fertility traits were analyzed for SNP association. Furthermore, mixed
   model analysis was used for association analyses where a polygenic
   effect was fitted as a random effect, and genotypes at single SNPs were
   successively included as a fixed effect in the model. The Bonferroni
   correction for multiple testing was applied to adjust the significance
   threshold. Seventy-four SNP-trait combinations showed chromosome-wide
   significance, and five of these were significant genome-wide.
   Twenty-four QTL regions on 14 chromosomes were detected. Strong evidence
   for the presence of QTL that affect fertility traits were observed on
   chromosomes 3, 5, 10, 13, 19, 20, and 24. The QTL intervals were
   generally smaller than those described in earlier linkage studies. The
   identification of fertility trait-associated SNPs and mapping of the
   corresponding QTL in small chromosomal regions reported here will
   facilitate searches for candidate genes and candidate polymorphisms.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of olfactory, taste and trigeminal perceptions must be
   taken into account to better understand the perception of beverages. To
   do this, seven beverages were formulated to investigate the role of
   ingredients on trigeminal perception. All mutual interactions between
   olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal perceptions were studied.
   Instrumental measurements and sensory evaluation were used to elucidate
   both physicochemical and sensory interactions. Sensory profiling was
   conducted according to monadic product presentation, and in vivo aroma
   release was assessed in the nasal cavities of subjects during beverage
   consumption.
   This study further revealed the influence of trigeminal perception on
   taste and aroma in complex beverages. The addition of CO2 in beverages
   induced a decrease in sweetness perception, an increase in sourness
   perception and an enhancement of aroma perception. Physicochemical
   and/or physical mechanisms (pH, aroma stripping effect) were assumed to
   be at the origin of these gustatory and olfactory interactions.
   Furthermore, the addition of mint flavoring enhanced tingling and
   freshness perceptions, highlighting perceptual interactions. The
   presence of sugar was shown to decrease the freshness perception but not
   the tingling perception. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Remodeling of the Major Light-Harvesting Antenna Protein of PSII
   Protects the Young Leaves of Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) from
   Photoinhibition under Prolonged Iron Deficiency}},

Abstract = {{Because of the high demand for iron of the photosynthetic apparatus in
   thylakoid membranes, iron deficiency primarily affects the electron
   transfer between the two photosystems (PSI and PSII), resulting in
   photooxidative damage in plants. However, in barley, PSII is protected
   against photoinhibition, and the plant survives even with a low iron
   content in its chlorotic leaves. In this study, we report an adaptation
   mechanism of the photosynthetic apparatus in barley to iron deficiency,
   which is concomitant with the remodeling of a PSII antenna system.
   Transcriptome analysis revealed that long-term iron deficiency induced
   the expression of two genes of the major light-harvesting Chl
   a/b-binding protein of PSII (LHCII), namely HvLhcb1.11 and HvLhcb1.12.
   Chl fluorescence analysis of the wild type and Lhcb1-less chlorina
   mutants clearly showed that non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of the
   wild type was increased by approximately 200\% by iron deficiency,
   whereas NPQ of chlorina mutants did not change significantly under iron
   deficiency. The mutant showed severe photodamage in young leaves under
   prolonged iron deficiency, suggesting that the HvLhcb1 protein is
   essential for both thermal dissipation and photoprotection in
   iron-deficient barley. Analysis of thylakoid protein complexes revealed
   that the proportion of the monomeric form of Lhcb1 significantly
   increased in barley grown under iron-deficient conditions. We
   hypothesize that alteration of the HvLhcb1 subpopulations modifies the
   organization of LHCII in the thylakoid membranes, which is a key step
   for thermal dissipation to compensate for excess excitation energy and
   thereby protect the photosystems from serious damage in iron-deficient
   barley leaves.}},

Abstract = {{The existing powerful steganalyzers can find out the presence of secret
   information in images with high accuracy. Increasing the embedding
   capacity of cover images reduces the detection risk of stego images. In
   this respect, we introduce boosted steganography scheme (BSS) that has a
   preprocessing stage before applying steganography methods. The goal of
   BSS is increasing the undetectability of stego images. Due to the
   dependence of embedding capacity of images to their content, we proposed
   an ensemble steganalyzer to estimate the embedding capacity of each
   cover image. Since the content of cover images has less significance in
   steganography, therefore to have more security, the steganographer can
   select a cover image from a database to achieve higher security and
   satisfactory embedding capacity. We present several experiments that
   show the effectiveness of boosted steganography scheme in improving the
   security of stego images. The experimental results demonstrate that
   considering a preprocessing stage can significantly improve the
   steganography security. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a regimen-related toxicity
   that occurs in the early phase of hematopoietic stern cell
   transplantation (HSCT). Therapeutic modalities for established VOD are
   limited, and severe VOD characterized by multiple organ failure is
   associated with a fatal prognosis despite intensive supportive care.
   Procedure. We analyzed the data of 95 consecutive allogeneic HSCT for
   childhood hematological malignancies, and assessed the efficacy of our
   VOD prophylaxis regimen based on danaparoid (n = 48), comparing with
   historical control regimen based on dalteparin (n = 47). Results. Eight
   patients (danaparoid cohort in one; dalteparin cohort in seven)
   developed VOD on day +30 (median onset, day +22; range, day +11 to day
   +28) after HSCT. The probability of developing VOD for the danaparoid
   cohort was 2\% (95\% CI, 0-6\%) and that of the dalteparin cohort was
   15\% (95\% CI, 5-26\%). In the Cox hazard proportional model, the
   danaparoid cohort had a significant advantage over the dalteparin cohort
   for the prophylaxis of VOD (hazard ratio (HR), 0.0; 95\% CI, 0.0-0.3; P
   < 0.01) without increasing hemorrhagic events. Conclusions. Our findings
   suggest that danaparoid may have promise for the prophylaxis of VOD
   after allogeneic HSCT and further randomized studies are warranted.

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided celiac plexus
   neurolysis (EUS-CPN) is safe and effective but not beneficial for some
   patients with extended abdominal cancer. We compared the effectiveness
   of standard EUS-CPN and EUS-guided broad plexus neurolysis (EUS-BPN)
   that extends over the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) using a 25-gauge
   needle.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients referred to our quaternary EUS centers
   were eligible for inclusion. To evaluate the neurolytic spread, contrast
   was mixed with the neurolytic agent and post-procedure computed
   tomography scanning was performed. The regions containing the celiac,
   superior, and inferior mesenteric arteries were divided on the frontal
   plane into six areas: upper right and left, middle right and left, and
   lower right and left. The number of contrast-bearing areas after EUS-CPN
   and EUS-BPN were related to the degree of pain relief achieved.
   RESULTS: A total of 67 patients with advanced abdominal cancer were
   included (34 EUS-CPN and 33 EUS-BPN). The qualitative variables of the
   two groups did not differ significantly. The EUS-BPN group had more
   patients with six contrast-bearing areas (42\%) than the EUS-CPN group
   (0\%). These patients had significantly better short-term and
   long-lasting pain relief than patients with less than five
   contrast-bearing areas. EUS-BPN patients exhibited significantly greater
   reductions in days 7 and 30 visual analog pain scale scores than EUS-CPN
   patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggested that EUS-BPN using a
   25-gauge needle provides patients with advanced abdominal cancer with
   better pain relief than standard EUS-CPN, and without incurring serious
   complications. Moreover, it seems that broad neurolysis over the SMA may
   provide superior analgesia.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Surgical indication for stage IV colorectal cancer patients
   with bilobar hepatic metastases may be controversial.
   Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis was performed using data of 200
   patients who underwent surgical resections for synchronous metastases of
   colorectal cancer between 1990 and 2005. Of these, 80 patients had
   solitary, 43 had unilobar multiple, and 77 had bilobar metastases.
   Prognostic factors of the 77 bilobar metastases were evaluated using
   multivariate analysis. The survival was compared with that of 95
   patients undergoing chemotherapy for unresectable bilobar hepatic
   metastases.
   Results: Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the number
   of metastasis (>= 6) {[}relative risk (RR), 2.7; P = 0.002] and depth of
   invasion (T4) (RR, 2.0; P = 0.04) were predictors of survival of the 77
   patients. The survival of 11 T4 cancer patients with six or more
   metastases was poor, but significantly better than that of 95 patients
   with unresectable bilobar metastases (P = 0.04).
   Conclusion: Surgical resection in stage IV colorectal cancer patients
   having bilobar hepatic metastases was justified in the present setting.

Abstract = {{Climate change poses a serious threat to species persistence. Effective
   modelling of evolutionary responses to rapid climate change is therefore
   essential. In this review we examine recent advances in phylogenetic
   comparative methods, techniques normally used to study adaptation over
   long periods, which allow them to be applied to the study of adaptation
   over shorter time scales. This increased applicability is largely due to
   the emergence of more flexible models of character evolution and the
   parallel development of molecular technologies that can be used to
   assess adaptive variation at loci scattered across the genome. The
   merging of phylogenetic and population genetic approaches to the study
   of adaptation has significant potential to advance our understanding of
   rapid responses to environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Dyslipidemia, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, is frequent among
   both adults and children with chronic kidney disease. Here, we describe
   the prevalence and pattern of dyslipidemia from a cross-sectional
   analysis of 391 children aged 1-16 years, enrolled in the multicenter
   Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study, with a median
   glomerular filtration rate (GFR), measured by the plasma disappearance
   of iohexol, of 43 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Multivariate analysis was
   applied to adjust for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), GFR, and the
   urinary protein/creatinine ratio. Proteinuria was in the nephrotic range
   in 44 and the BMI exceeded the 95th percentile in 57 patients of this
   cohort. Baseline lipid analysis found a high prevalence of
   hypertriglyceridemia in 126, increased non-HDL-C in 62, and reduced
   HDL-C in 83. Overall, 177 children had dyslipidemia, of whom 79 had
   combined dyslipidemia. Lower GFR was associated with higher
   triglycerides, lower HDL-C, and higher non-HDL-C. Nephrotic-range
   proteinuria was significantly associated with dyslipidemia and combined
   dyslipidemia. Compared with children with a GFR >50, children with a GFR
   <30 had significantly increased odds ratios for any dyslipidemia or for
   combined dyslipidemia. Hence, among children with moderate chronic
   kidney disease, dyslipidemia is common and is associated with lower GFR,
   nephrotic proteinuria, and non-renal factors including age and obesity.

Abstract = {{Recently data embedding over images has drawn tremendous interest, using
   either lossy or lossless techniques. Although lossy techniques can allow
   large hiding capacity, host image cannot be recovered with high
   fidelity. Some applications require exact recovery of the host image,
   i.e. in medicine patient data can be embedded without affecting the
   medical image. In general lossless data hiding techniques suffer from
   limited capacity as the host image should be kept intact. In this paper
   a lossless embedding technique is proposed. In this technique image
   histograms are analyzed to identify the embedding capacity of different
   image types. Histogram maxima and minima are used in embedding capacity
   estimation. The proposed technique gives hiding capacity that can reach
   up to 50\% of the host image size for images with large homochromatic
   regions (cartoons-like). In fact, our study showed that the embedding
   capacity is not only affected by the host image size but also by its
   histogram distribution. The data embedding and extraction is performed
   using simple processing operations that can save on power consumption
   for wireless devices. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Veterans Affairs Hypertension Primary Care Longitudinal Cohort
   (VAHC) was initiated in 2003 as a pilot study designed to link the VA
   electronic medical record system with individual genetic data. Between
   June 2003 and December 2004, 1,527 hypertensive participants were
   recruited. Protected health information (PHI) was extracted from the
   regional VA data warehouse. Differences between the clinic and mail
   recruits suggested that clinic recruitment resulted in an over-sampling
   of African Americans. A review of medical records in a random sample of
   study participants confirmed that the data warehouse accurately captured
   most selected diagnoses. Genomic DNA was acquired non-invasively from
   buccal cells in mouthwash; similar to 96.5 per cent of samples contained
   DNA suitable for genotyping, with an average DNA yield of 5.02 +/- 0.12
   micrograms, enough for several thousand genotypes. The coupling of
   detailed medical databases with genetic information has the potential to
   facilitate the genetic study of hypertension and other complex diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations and turbulent fluxes of accumulation mode particles were
   measured during the 2004-2005 `Canopy and Aerosol Particle Interaction
   in Toulouse Urban layer' project (CAPITOUL) at the top of two
   intersecting street canyons and in the urban boundary layer (UBL) in
   Toulouse, France. Particle numbers were strongly affected by boundary
   layer depth and showed limited sensitivity to local emissions.
   Differences in the diurnal patterns of particle numbers were observed
   between the finer fraction (0.3-0.4 mu m) and coarser fraction (1.6-2.0
   mu m) of accumulation mode particles, indicating different processes of
   formation, evolution and transportation may be dominant. Highest
   particle numbers were observed in the narrow street canyon which had
   more limited local emissions and comparatively small particle fluxes.
   However, the improved ventilation rate in the wider canyon was also
   associated with the downward mixing of particles into the street canyon
   from the UBL The results from this study clearly illustrate the temporal
   and spatial variability of particle numbers and fluxes in the urban

Abstract = {{Object. Sagittal plane deformities can be subdivided into kyphotic and
   lordotic forms and further characterized according to their global or
   regional (focal) presentation. Regional deformities of a significant
   magnitude constitute a gibbous deformity. Pedicle subtraction osteotomy
   (PSO) and interlaminar Smith-Petersen osteotomies have been used to
   correct sagittal plane deformities in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar
   spine. By resecting a portion of the vertebral body and closing in the
   gap of this vertebra, the spine is placed in local lordosis and kyphosis
   is corrected. These osteotomies have generally been carried out in the
   lumbar or less frequently in the thoracic area. While PSO has been
   performed in the mid and lower thoracic spine, there have been no case
   series of patients undergoing PSO at the CTJ. Specifically, a PSO
   approach that addresses the challenges of the CTJ is needed. Here, the
   authors review their case series of PSOs performed in the CTJ. Their
   goal in the treatment of these patients was to correct the regional CTJ
   kyphosis, restore forward gaze, and reduce the pain associated with the
   deformity.
   Methods. Eight patients (5 males and 3 females, mean age 63 years)
   underwent PSO for the correction of CTJ kyphosis. Pedicle subtraction
   osteotomy was performed at C-7 or the upper thoracic vertebrae and was
   facilitated by a computer-guided intraoperative monitoring system.
   Surgical indications included postlaminectomy kyphosis, spinal cord
   tumor resection, posttraumatic kyphosis, and degenerative cervical
   spondylosis.
   Results. The mean follow-up was 15.3 months (range 12-20 months), and
   the mean preoperative CTJ kyphosis was 38.67 degrees (range 25
   degrees-60 degrees). Clinically satisfactory correction of the regional
   deformity was accomplished in all patients, achieving a mean correction
   of 35.63 degrees (range 15 degrees-66 degrees) at the CTJ, with
   restoration of forward gaze and significant reduction in pain.
   Conclusions. A CTJ deformity is a distinctive form of kyphosis that
   presents as a variable local deformity and requires complex spinal
   reconstructive techniques to restore sagittal balance and forward gaze.
   Pedicle subtraction osteotomy allows or significant correction through
   one spinal segment, and it can be used safely to correct the regional
   sagittal alignment of the cervical spine and head in relation to the
   pelvis. Pedicle subtraction osteotomy can be used alone or in
   combination with other techniques as some patients may require
   multistage procedures with anterior and posterior spinal reconstruction
   to obtain stable sagittal correction. All deformities in these patients
   were kyphotic in nature with only mild elements of scoliosis or coronal
   plane deformity. This is unlike lumbar and thoracic curves where the
   kyphosi; is frequently associated with scoliosis. (DO!:

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Competitive foods and beverages are available on most US
   school campuses. States and school districts are adopting nutrition
   standards to regulate these products, but few studies have reported on
   the extent to which schools are able to adhere to competitive
   regulations. The purpose of this study was to describe the extent to
   which schools in disadvantaged communities were able to implement
   California competitive food and beverage standards.
   METHODS: Data on the competitive foods (n = 1019) and beverages (n =
   572) offered for sale on 19 school campuses were collected in 2005 and
   2008. Descriptive statistics were generated on overall adherence rates
   to school nutrition standards and adherence rates by venue and school
   level. Logistic regression models tested predictors of adherence by
   continuous and categorical variables (eg, venue, item selling price).
   RESULTS: Data show an increase from 2005 to 2008 in average adherence to
   the California standards. Several predictors had statistically
   significant associations with adherence or nonadherence. Adherence was
   higher for competitive foods sold in school stores than foods sold in
   vending machines. Higher selling price was associated with lower
   adherence. Competitive foods classified as entrees were more likely to
   adhere than snack items, and larger total size (in fluid ounces)
   beverages were associated with higher adherence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Schools have begun to implement competitive food and
   beverage policies. However, school environments, particularly in
   secondary schools, are not 100\% compliant with school nutrition
   standards. These findings can inform policymakers and school officials
   about the feasibility of implementing competitive food standards in
   schools.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity and metabolic syndrome increase the risk of coronary heart
   disease and lead to a proinflammatory state of the vascular wall.
   Endothelial dysfunction is associated with up-regulation of
   cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and enhanced synthesis of constrictor
   prostaglandins in systemic arteries in diabetes. The present study
   assessed whether changes in the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism via
   COX-1 and COX-2 may affect endothelial function of coronary arteries in
   obesity. Intramyocardial arteries from obese Zucker rats (OZR) and from
   lean Zucker rats (LZR) were mounted in microvascular myographs to assess
   vascular function and COX expression was determined by both
   immunohistochemistry and Western blot. AA elicited relaxations of
   similar magnitude in arteries from LZR and OZR which were abolished by
   endothelial cell removal. Selective inhibition of COX-1 enhanced the AA
   relaxant responses and inhibited the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced
   vasoconstriction in arteries from both LZR and OZR. Antagonism of the
   TXA(2)/PGH(2) (TP) receptor mimicked the effects of COX-1 blockade in
   arteries from LZR but not OZR. Selective inhibition of COX-2 markedly
   reduced the vasodilatation induced by AA in OZR, but not in LZR, without
   altering 5-HT or ACh responses. COX-1 was widely distributed throughout
   the endothelial layer of coronary arteries from both LZR and OZR, while
   COX-2 protein, which was predominantly expressed in the endothelium, was
   significantly increased in arteries from OZR. Whereas AA is mainly
   metabolised to vasoconstrictor prostanoids via COX-1 in coronary
   arteries from healthy animals, endothelial COX-2 is up-regulated to
   produce vasodilator prostaglandins thus protecting coronary arteries in
   insulin resistant obese rats. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Radiation-induced neurotoxicity is a well-characterized phenomenon.
   However, the underlying mechanism of this toxicity is poorly understood.
   In the central nervous system (CNS), excitotoxic mechanisms are
   implicated in many neurodegenerative disease processes. Pivotal to the
   excitotoxic pathway is dysfunction of glutamate signaling. We reported
   previously that exposure to low-LET gamma radiation results in altered
   glutamate transport in neurons and astrocytes. In the present study, we
   sought to investigate the effects of various particle radiations of
   differing LET on glutamate transport as a measure of the neurochemical
   vulnerability of the CNS. NTera2-derived neurons and astrocytes isolated
   as pure and mixed cultures were exposed to doses of 10 cGy, 50 cGy or 2
   Gy of 250 MeV protons, 290 MeV/nucleon carbon ions, or 1000 MeV/nucleon
   iron ions. Transporter function was assessed at 3 h, 2 days and 7days
   after exposure. Functional assessment of glutamate transport revealed
   that neurons and astrocytes respond in a reciprocal manner after
   exposure to particle radiation. Uptake activity in neurons increased
   after particle irradiation. This effect was evident as late as our last
   time (7 days) after exposure (P < 0.05). In astrocytes, transporter
   activity decreased after exposure. The decrease in uptake observed in
   astrocytes was evident 7 days after exposure to carbon and iron ions.
   Uptake in mixed cultures after exposure to all three forms of radiation
   revealed a muted interactive response suggestive of the individual
   responses of each cellular phenotype acting in opposition. (C) 2010 by

Abstract = {{Introduction. The objective of this study is understand the information
   needs that businesses have while seeking Library and Information Science
   professionals and analyse how they formulate those needs.
   Method. The analysis is performed by examining the professional skills
   and capabilities demanded in job offers published. A total of 1,020 job
   offers collected from a Spanish employment agency Website have been
   analysed for the period between 2006 and 2008.
   Analysis. Knowledge representation techniques using thesauri have been
   used for the automatic content analysis based on natural language
   processing. Data extracted from the corpora have been analysed
   statistically.
   Results of this study indicate a demand for skills related to
   technological advances and the management of electronic resources as
   well as to technical aspects associated with the Informatics domain. The
   knowledge of languages and the possession of an academic title represent
   essential factors in the job offers.
   Conclusions. This method permits the identification of changes in the
   information needs and the contexts inherent to the profession. The
   advantage of using thesauri permits other research groups to reproduce
   the results. The re-use of semantic categories, common to other fields,
   facilitates the reproduction of this method with other occupational
   groups or social roles.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aim:
   In human blood, two main subsets of antigen-presenting-cells (APCs) have
   been described: plasmocytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and myeloid dendritic
   cells (mDC) which are further subdivided in CD11c-mDC and CD16-mDC DC.
   In ulcerative colitis patients (UC) peripheral blood APCs express
   significant levels of the activation and lack immature-tolerogeneic
   APCs. Adacolumn selective granulocytapheresis (GCAP) has been associated
   with clinical efficacy in patients with UC. In the present study we
   sought the effect of sequential GCAP procedures in peripheral blood APCs
   in patients with UC and the effect on soluble cytokines.
   Methods:
   We used multiparametric flow cytometry to quantify peripheral blood APCs
   and serum cytokines in 210 samples obtained from seven patients with
   steroid-dependent or steroid resistant UC undergoing GCAP treatment.
   Samples were drawn before, after 30 and 60 min of each session.
   Results:
   Each GCAP session resulted in a dramatic tenfold reduction of peripheral
   blood CD16-mDC (P < 0.01), pDC decreased twofold (P = 0.05) but
   CD11c-mDC remained unchanged. This depletion was reached after 30 min
   and maintained at 60 min. The depletion of CD16-mDC and monocytes was
   associated with a reduction of serum tumor necrosis factor levels and a
   raise in interleukin-10 levels, although no statistical difference was
   reached.
   Conclusion:
   The effect of GCAP in peripheral blood APC consisted mainly on a
   significant depletion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha secreting CD16-mDC.
   This finding could suggest a potential mechanism of GCAP beneficial
   effect that must be confirmed in larger series.}},

   Materials and Methods: New Zealand white rabbits were injected
   intrastromally with 10<SU6</SU colony-forming units (CFU) of a clinical
   keratitis strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Eyes were examined before
   and after treatment of topical drops every 2 hr from 25 to 47 hr

   Results: Eyes treated with moxifloxacin/cholesterol had a significantly
   lower mean slit lamp examination (SLE) score than eyes treated with
   phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), moxifloxacin alone, or cholesterol
   alone (P < 0.02). A significantly lower log(10) CFU was recovered from

   0.01). At 48 hr PI, significantly lower MPO activity was quantitated
   from eyes treated with moxifloxacin/cholesterol as compared to eyes
   treated with cholesterol or moxifloxacin alone (P < 0.046). Eyes treated
   with moxifloxacin/cholesterol had fewer immune cells and less corneal
   destruction than eyes from all other treatment groups. The MIC for
   moxifloxacin alone was 0.125 mu g/mL, and cholesterol alone was unable
   to inhibit growth at any of the concentrations tested. The MIC for
   moxifloxacin when combined with 1\% cholesterol was 0.0625 mu g/mL.
   Conclusions: Treatment with a mixture of moxifloxacin and cholesterol
   significantly lowers the severity of infection caused by pneumococcal
   keratitis as compared to treatment with moxifloxacin alone, cholesterol
   alone, or PBS. This treatment mixture eradicates the bacteria in the
   cornea, unlike treatment with PBS or cholesterol alone. Using
   cholesterol with moxifloxacin as a treatment for bacterial keratitis
   could help lower the clinical severity of the infection.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful technique for
   measuring low concentrations of fluorescent molecules and their
   diffusion coefficients in an open detection volume However, in several
   practical cases, when FCS measurements are carried out in small
   compartments like microchannels, neglecting boundary effects could lead
   to erroneous results Here, a close form solution is proposed to
   explicitly account for the presence of walls located at a distance
   comparable with the char acteristic detection volume lengths We derive a
   one dimensional diffusion constrained model and then generalize the
   solution to the two and the three dimensional constrained cases We
   further indicate within which limits the standard autocorrelation
   function (ACF) model gives reliable results in microconfinement. Our
   model relies Just on the assumption of elastic hits at the system walls
   and succeeds in describing the ACF of fluorescent probes confined along
   one direction `Through the analysis of FCS experimental data, we are
   able to predict the correct shape of the ACF in channels of micrometric
   and submicrometric width and measure the extent of lateral confinement.
   In addition, it permits the investigation of microstructured material
   features such as cages and cavities having dimensions on the micrometric
   range On the basis of the proposed model, we also show in which
   conditions confinement could generate an apparent time dependent probe
   mobility, thus allowing a proper interpretation of the transport process
   taking place in submicrometric compartments}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to understand the process of Thai men
   becoming a first-time father. Twenty expectant fathers were voluntarily
   recruited from the antenatal clinics of three hospitals in Chiang Mai,
   northern Thailand. The data were collected by in-depth interviews and
   analyzed on the basis of grounded theory methodology. The findings
   demonstrated that ``protecting the unborn baby{''} was the basic social
   process that emerged as the core category. This process was divided into
   three phases: confirming and accepting, perceiving the unborn baby as a
   human being, and ensuring the health of the mother and baby. Throughout
   this process, the Thai expectant fathers applied many strategies to
   manage their concerns, needs, and emotions and to develop themselves
   into fathers. The process of protecting the unborn baby provides insight
   into the expectant fathers' experiences, which will enable nurses and
   midwives to assist and care for men as they become fathers.}},

Abstract = {{Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a common side effect observed in patients
   under chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (CYP). The urotoxic side
   effects of CYP are attributed to the metabolic compound acrolein, and
   can be partially prevented by the uroprotector agent 2-mercaptoethene
   sulfate (Mesna). The present study analyzed the anti-inflammatory and
   the antinociceptive effects of compounds MV8608 and MV8612 obtained from
   Mandevilla velutina in the rat model of CYP-induced HC. Male Wistar rats
   were used (six to eight per group, 220-250 g). HC was induced by a
   single administration of CYP (100 mg/kg, ip). Three behavioral
   parameters-breathing rate, closing of the eyes, and specific
   posture-were used as nociception indexes, and scored at different time
   intervals (15-180 min) after cystitis induction. As inflammatory
   parameters, hemorrhage presence, edema formation, and bladder weight
   were determined at 24 h after CYP administration. The neutrophil
   migration was assessed by means of myeloperoxidase (MPO activity), 4 h
   after cystitis induction. As expected, Mesna treatment was able to
   reduce in a significant manner all the inflammatory and the nociceptive
   parameters induced by CYP. Of note, the administration of MV8608
   significantly inhibited the hemorrhage formation and the neutrophil
   recruitment, while the MV8612 treatment markedly reduced the bladder
   weight, without interfering with neutrophil influx. Interestingly, the
   treatment with either MV8608 or MV8612 markedly reduced the nociceptive
   responses. The present results clearly indicate that MV8608 and MV8612
   might represent important alternatives to prevent side effects,
   especially the nociception, following chemotherapy with CYP.}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific competition has been intensely studied as an organizing
   force in insect herbivore communities that can be mediated by changes in
   resource availability. We analyzed patterns of interspecific association
   of three species of gall-forming insects at shoot length class and shrub
   levels for Bauhinia brevipes through a null model program. Results show
   that shoots galled by three species were distributed independently among
   shoot length classes over 3-years, hence, no evidence of competition for
   shoots was found. Nevertheless, at the plant level our results suggest
   that there was a positive association. We found no evidence of any
   reciprocal negative effect because the density of species did not differ
   among shoot length classes. We suggest that this lack of pattern was
   probably due to: (a) host-plant resistance mediating interactions; (b)
   higher abundance of plant resource available, or (c) free-feeding
   herbivores mediating interactions by manipulating the resources used by
   gall-forming species.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-dimensional analysis (MDA) in analytical chemistry is often
   applied to improve the selectivity of an analytical device and,
   therefore, to achieve a better overview of a sample composition
   Recently, the hyphenation of thermogravimetry with single photo
   ionization mass spectrometry (TG SPIMS) using an electron beam pumped
   excimer lamp (EBEL) for VUV radiation was applied The concept of MDA has
   been realized by upgrading the TG-SPIMS system with a quasi
   comprehensive chromatographic separation step before the soft ionization
   (TG GCxSPIMS) The system was characterized by the thermal analysis of
   diesel fuel, which has often been investigated by the GCxGC-community
   and is therefore a well-known sample material in MDA Data from this
   measurement are used to explain the three-dimensional data structure and
   the advantages of the online TG-GCxSPIMS as compared to TG-SPIMS
   Subsequently, the thermal decomposition behavior of a polymer,
   acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), is investigated TG GCxSPIMS
   provides a two dimensional analysis of the evolved gaseous products TG
   relevant data are obtained as well as an Improved resolution power to
   separate isobaric molecular structures without losing any fraction of
   the samples, as is often the case in heart cutting approaches
   Additionally, this solution is not associated with any extension of the
   measurement time The assignment of the substance pattern to distinct
   species is unproved as compared to solely using mass spectrometry
   without a preceding separation step Furthermore, hitherto undetected
   compounds have been found in the evolved gases from the thermal
   degradation of ABS Finally, a first estimation of the limit of detection
   has been earned out. This results in a significant decrease of the LOD
   in case of TG GCxSPIMS (500 ppt for toluene) as compared to 30 ppb,
   which could be reached with TG-SPIMS}},

Abstract = {{A micro-channeled composite with a laminated microstructure was
   fabricated in Al2O3-ZrO2 composite system through a multipass extrusion
   process. Using this approach, Al2O3-(monoclinic-ZrO2)/tetragonal-ZrO2
   continuously porous composites with concentric laminates were
   fabricated. The entire matrix phase had a laminated microstructure of
   alternate lamina of Al2O3-(m-ZrO2) and t-ZrO2 with a homogeneous
   thickness and central channel. Each of the continuous channels was
   coaxially encircled by a group of 5 alternate laminates. The laminate
   plane was oriented along the axis of the continuous channels. The design
   strategy was to incorporate concentric lamellar microstructural units in
   a macro scaled ceramic body comprising a central channel for each. The
   frame modification was intended to improve the material properties of
   the channeled body which in turn could act as a porous space for the
   inclusion of additional functional attributes. Filaments of polymer
   mixed ceramic powders and pore forming agent carbon were stacked in a
   pre-designed arrangement to obtain the desired microstructure and then
   extruded to obtain green composites. The channel diameter and channel
   frame thickness were approximately 198 +/- 10 mu m and 158 +/- 10 mu m,
   respectively. The channel frame region was furnished with 9 alternating
   shells of Al2O3-(m-ZrO2) and t-ZrO2 with a thickness of around 10
   similar to 20 mu m. The material properties including the relative
   density and bending strength, which depend on temperature, were
   evaluated. The detailed microstructure of the channeled bodies was also
   characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Use of botulinum toxin for esthetic purposes has rapidly expanded over
   the last 20 years. IncobotulinumtoxinA, also known as NT 201, is a new
   botulinum toxin type A (150 kDa) that is free from complexing proteins.
   OBJECTIVES
   A prospective, multicenter, randomized, rater- and patient-blind,
   international Phase III trial to investigate the noninferiority of
   incobotulinumtoxinA to another botulinum toxin type A,
   onabotulinumtoxinA, in the treatment of glabellar frown lines.
   METHODS
   A total of 381 patients were randomized in a 3:1
   (incobotulinumtoxinA:onabotulinumtoxinA) ratio to receive 24 U
   incobotulinumtoxinA of or onabotulinumtoxinA. Efficacy end points
   included the percentage of responders (patients with an improvement of
   >= 1 point on a 4-point facial wrinkle scale) at maximum frown at weeks
   4 and 12 as assessed by the investigators, and a panel of independent
   raters based on standardized digital photographs.
   RESULTS
   Four weeks after injection, response rates at maximum frown were 96.4\%
   in the incobotulinumtoxinA group and 95.7\% in the onabotulinumtoxinA
   group as assessed by independent raters. Analysis of the data confirmed
   the noninferiority of incobotulinumtoxinA. Response rates at rest were
   lower for both products. The rate of adverse events was low.
   CONCLUSION
   IncobotulinumtoxinA is equally as effective as onabotulinumtoxinA in the
   treatment of glabellar frown lines. Both preparations were well
   tolerated.

Abstract = {{Winter tourism is the main economic factor for many different regions in
   the German Mountain Range. Owing to warming trends experienced in the
   past and predicted for the future, precise knowledge about the
   development of snow cover and snow duration in the future is becoming
   more and more important. On the basis of the International Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) A1B scenario, this paper investigates the possible
   regional development of snow cover and snow duration in the Black Forest
   in southwest Germany until 2050. For this purpose, we developed a new
   method that combines Non-linear AutoRegressive networks with eXogenous
   inputs (NARX) with Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System
   (GIS). With this non-parametric approach, we try to define with
   preferably high accuracy a simple transferable model. Besides the
   general problem of developing a robust statistical model, our main focus
   is on the enhancement of the spatial resolution of snow patterns by
   incorporating complex structures of the underlying terrain using
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data.
   The results suggest a possible decrease in the number of snow days (snow
   cover >= 10 cm) in the decade 2041-2050 by 10 to 44\% at altitudes
   higher than 1200 m, by 17 to 57\% at 1000-1200 m and 25 to 66\% at
   500-1000 m. This results in a dramatic shortening of the snow season
   mainly caused by earlier snow melt initiation rather than by later first
   snow precipitation in autumn. These considerable changes in the snow
   season would cause enormous losses in the skiing and tourism industries.
   In this context, the obtained high-resolution snow data and maps can
   provide a useful tool and decision-making aid for the economy and
   politics. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal Meteorological Society}},

Abstract = {{Two inverse problems for the Sturm-Liouville operator Ly = -y `' + q(x)y
   on the interval {[}0, p] are studied. For theta >= 0, there is a mapping
   F: W-2(theta). l(B)(theta), F(sigma) = \{s(k)\}(1)(infinity), related to
   the first of these problems, where W-2(B) = W-2(theta){[}0, pi] is the
   Sobolev space, sigma = integral q is a primitive of the potential q, and
   l(B)(theta) is a specially constructed finite-dimensional extension of
   the weighted space l(2)(theta), where we place the regularized spectral
   data s = \{sk\}(1)(infinity) in the problem of reconstruction from two
   spectra. The main result is uniform lower and upper bounds for parallel
   to sigma - sigma(1)parallel to(theta) via the l(B)(theta)-norm parallel
   to s - s(1)parallel to. of the difference of regularized spectral data.
   A similar result is obtained for the second inverse problem, that is,
   the problem of reconstructing the potential from the spectral function
   of the operator L generated by the Dirichlet boundary conditions. The
   result is new even for the classical case q is an element of L-2, which
   corresponds to theta = 1.}},

Abstract = {{P>Aim
   The aim of this study was to investigate the association between body
   weight and periodontal infection in a longitudinal setting.
   Material and methods
   This study was based on a subpopulation of the Health 2000 Survey that
   included dentate, non-diabetic subjects aged 30-59 years, who had never
   smoked and who had participated in the Follow-Up Study on Finnish
   Adults' Oral Health approximately 4 years later (n=396). The number of
   new teeth with deepened (4 mm deep or deeper) periodontal pockets in the
   follow-up examination was used as the outcome variable. Body weight was
   measured using body mass index, categorized into three categories: <
   25.0 (normal weight), 25.0-29.9 (overweight) and 30.0 or more (obesity).
   Incidence rate ratios were estimated using Poisson's regression models.
   Results
   Body weight was weakly, but not statistically significantly, associated
   with the number of new teeth with deepened periodontal pockets among
   subjects who were periodontally healthy in the baseline examinations,
   whereas only a minuscule association was found among subjects who had
   periodontal infection at baseline.
   Conclusions
   The results of this follow-up study do not provide evidence that
   overweight and obesity can be considered significant risk factors in the
   pathogenesis of periodontal infection.}},

Abstract = {{Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting is a technique which attempts to
   extract a unique identifier from wireless signal transmissions in order
   to perform automated device identification by exploiting variations in
   the transmitted signal caused by hardware and manufacturing
   inconsistencies. The problem of signaling storms caused by increased
   core network signaling load due to idle mode cell camping on femtocells
   is addressed and a novel approach to RF fingerprinting is proposed as a
   solution to tackle this problem by identifying device model types. This
   study describes a large data set containing 54 Universal Mobile
   Telecommunications System (UMTS) user equipment (UE) devices (41 model
   types), the largest of its kind reported in the literature. This study
   also presents a novel feature extraction technique, which greatly
   improves identification accuracy over standard spectral approaches while
   limiting the number of random access channel (RACH) preambles required
   for identification. Accuracy of 99.8 percent was achieved. Importantly,
   the proposed technique can be implemented using today's low cost
   high-volume receivers and requires no manual performance tuning. (C)

Abstract = {{The first collocated measurements during THORPEX (The Observing System
   Research and Predictability Experiment) regional campaign in Europe in
   2007 were performed by a novel four-wavelength differential absorption
   lidar and a scanning 2-mu m Doppler wind lidar on board the research
   aircraft Falcon of the Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR).
   One mission that was characterized by exceptionally high data coverage
   (47\% for the specific humidity q and 63\% for the horizontal wind speed
   v(h)) was selected to calculate the advective transport of atmospheric
   moisture qv(h), along a 1600-km section in the warm sector of an
   extratropical cyclone. The observations are compared with special
   1-hourly model data calculated by the ECMWF integrated forecast system.
   Along the cross section, the model underestimates the wind speed on
   average by 2.8\% (-0.6 m s(-1)) and overestimates the moisture at dry
   layers and in the boundary layer, which results in a wet bias of 17.1\%
   (0.2 g kg(-1)). Nevertheless, the ECMWF model reproduces quantitatively
   the horizontally averaged moisture transport in the warm sector. There,
   the superposition of high low-level humidity and the increasing, wind
   velocities with height resulted in a deep tropospheric layer of enhanced
   water vapor transport qv(h). The observed moisture transport is variable
   and possesses a maximum of qv(h) = 130 g kg(-1) m s(-1) in the lower
   troposphere. The pathways of the moisture transport from southwest via
   several branches of different geographical origin are identified by
   Lagrangian trajectories and by high values of the vertically averaged
   tropospheric moisture transport.}},

Abstract = {{Strong prior models are a prerequisite for reliable spatio-temporal
   cardiac image analysis. While several cardiac models have been presented
   in the past, many of them are either too complex for their parameters to
   be estimated on the sole basis of MR Images, or overly simplified. In
   this paper, we present a novel dynamic model, based on the equation of
   dynamics for elastic materials and on Fourier filtering. The explicit
   use of dynamics allows us to enforce periodicity and temporal smoothness
   constraints. We propose an algorithm to solve the continuous dynamical
   problem associated to numerically adapting the model to the image
   sequence. Using a simple 1D example, we show how temporal filtering can
   help removing noise while ensuring the periodicity and smoothness of
   solutions. The proposed dynamic model is quantitatively evaluated on a
   database of 15 patients which shows its performance and limitations.
   Also, the ability of the model to capture cardiac motion is demonstrated
   on synthetic cardiac sequences. Moreover, existence, uniqueness of the
   solution and numerical convergence of the algorithm can be demonstrated.

Abstract = {{The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend
   vaccinations from birth through adulthood for lifetime protection
   against many diseases and infections. Healthy, active adults need to be
   vaccinated for personal protection against infection as well as
   associated health benefits (eg, ability to maintain their daily
   activities). Immunization also reduces the risk of an individual
   transmitting infection to others, thereby conferring protection to his
   or her entire community. In the United States, influenza and pertussis
   (part of the trivalent Tdap) vaccines are recommended for every adult.
   There are other important vaccines for adults: the human papillomavirus
   (HPV) vaccine is recommended for every adult female aged up to 26 years,
   shingles vaccine is recommended for all adults aged >= 60 years, and
   pneumococcal vaccine is recommended based on age (all adults aged >= 65
   years) and risk factors. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and meningococcal
   vaccines are recommended for adults with certain risk factors or
   conditions that increase their risk for serious complications (ie, there
   are no age-based recommendations for these vaccines in adults). Catch-up
   vaccination is also recommended for adults who have no evidence or proof
   of immunity to selected, traditionally childhood infections (ie,
   measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella). Despite the established safety
   and efficacy of vaccines for disease prevention, millions of adults who
   should be vaccinated are not, resulting in substantial and avoidable
   morbidity and mortality, as well as health care expenditures. It is
   incumbent on health care providers to raise awareness among their adult
   patients and encourage vaccination, thereby improving uptake among
   eligible adults. Routine vaccination into adulthood must be viewed as
   standard of care and an integral component of a comprehensive preventive
   care program.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: The purpose of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for
   Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) Validation Project was to assess
   the diagnostic validity of this examination protocol. The aim of this
   article is to provide an overview of the project's methodology,
   descriptive statistics, and data for the study participant sample. This
   article also details the development of reliable methods to establish
   the reference standards for assessing criterion validity of the Axis I
   RDC/TMD diagnoses. Methods: The Axis I reference standards were based on
   the consensus of two criterion examiners independently performing a
   comprehensive history, clinical examination, and evaluation of imaging.
   Intersite reliability was assessed annually for criterion examiners and
   radiologists. Criterion examination reliability was also assessed within
   study sites. Results: Study participant demographics were comparable to
   those of participants in previous studies using the RDC/TMD. Diagnostic
   agreement of the criterion examiners with each other and with the
   consensus-based reference standards was excellent with all kappas >=
   0.81, except for osteoarthrosis (moderate agreement, kappa = 0.53).
   Intrasite criterion examiner agreement with reference standards was
   excellent (kappa >= 0.95). Intersite reliability of the radiologists for
   detecting computed tomography-disclosed osteoarthrosis and magnetic
   resonance imaging-disclosed disc displacement was good to excellent
   (kappa = 0.71 and 0.84, respectively). Conclusion: The Validation
   Project study population was appropriate for assessing the reliability
   and validity of the RDC/TMD Axis I and II. The reference standards used
   to assess the validity of Axis I TMD were based on reliable and
   clinically credible methods. J OROFAC PAIN 2010;24:7-24}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly complex techniques in cardiovascular medicine lead to a
   competitive partnership between cardiology and cardiac surgery. Common
   challenges will arise in the fields of coronary heart disease, heart
   valves, heart failure and rhythm therapy. For instance, coronary
   revascularization in acute myocardial infarction is no longer considered
   to exclusively be an interventional option. In comparison, the
   implantation of heart valves is increasingly carried out by
   cardiologists using interventional techniques. The latest designs of
   sutureless valves try to combine the benefits of conventional and
   transcatheter heart valves. Heart failure is the most common reason for
   hospital admission and thus an important therapeutic target for
   cardiology and cardiac surgery. New approaches in diagnostics, heart
   assist devices and cellular therapy meet this challenge.
   Conclusion: In the future only a sensitive and transparent collaboration
   across transsectoral borders will offer optimal therapy in
   cardiovascular medicine.}},

Abstract = {{The EU is committed to combat climate change and to increase security of
   its energy supply. Bioenergy from forestry and agriculture plays a key
   role for both. Concurrently, the EU agreed to halt the loss of
   biodiversity within its member states. To fulfil the biodiversity target
   more nature conservation and restoration sites need to be designated.
   There are arising concerns that an increased cultivation of bioenergy
   crops will decrease the land available for nature reserves and for
   ``traditional{''} agriculture and forestry. To assess the role of
   bioenergy in light of possible negative impacts on ecosystems, the
   European Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model (EUFASOM)
   assesses simultaneously economic and environmental aspects of land use.
   This study contributes to the assessment by analyzing the effect of
   bioenergy production on European wetland allocations by incorporating
   the spatial wetland distribution model SWEDI into EUFASOM. Results show
   that bioenergy targets increase land competition and thus marginal costs
   of wetland preservation but also of food prices. The designation of
   national wetland conservation targets, on the other hand, stimulates
   land use intensification in countries without these targets and here
   only a transfer of environmental stresses takes place. The model is able
   to illustrate regional differences of results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the relationship between physical fitness and
   work integration following stroke. Design: Single-group study,
   measurement of physical fitness pre and post physical training,
   measurement of employment status in a follow-up assessment 2 to 36
   months after rehabilitation. Setting: Interdisciplinary outpatient
   rehabilitation program. Participants: 58 stroke survivors (62\% male,
   mean age at program start 46.7 years, mean time since stroke 1.1 years)
   who were consecutively referred to the program. Intervention: 1 1/2
   hours of intensive training of cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle
   strength 1-3 times weekly as part of the 3-month program. Measures:
   Physical fitness was measured with a modified Harvard Step Test, the
   Astrand Cycling Test, and walking/running speed. The type of
   participants' employment as well as the amount of working hours was
   registered. Results: Good physical fitness as measured by the Harvard
   Step test, but not the Astrand Cycling Test and walking/running speed,
   was related to return to competitive, full-time employment. Test results
   from training tended to predict work reintegration better than test
   results from training start. Improvement of physical fitness as measured
   by the Harvard Step Test was also related to follow-up employment.
   Conclusions: The results imply a relationship between physical fitness
   and work integration following stroke and should be confirmed with a

Abstract = {{We examined the influence of reduced hemoglobin concentrations resulting
   from malarial infection on metabolism and thermoregulation in the Fence
   Lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis. Malarial infections diminish the
   oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, depressing hemoglobin
   concentrations by as much as 25\%. Lizards collected from Oregon were
   screened for Plasmodium mexicanum. Malaria-infected and uninfected
   lizards were placed on a temperature-controlled treadmill at preferred
   body temperature (35 degrees C) and induced to walk at constant speed
   for 5 min (0.7 m min(-1)) or sprint maximally to exhaustion (<2 min of
   activity). Excess oxygen consumption during recovery was over 30\%
   higher in infected lizards when compared to uninfected lizards following
   similar levels of activity. Malarial infection significantly elevated
   blood lactate levels following sprint or endurance activity (20 and 36\%
   elevation, respectively) when compared to uninfected lizards. Malarial
   infection significantly increased preferred body temperature tested in a
   thermal gradient following sustained activity (2-4 degrees C increase)
   but had little impact on thermoregulation following exhaustive exercise.
   There was a strong negative correlation between hemoglobin concentration
   and postactivity body temperature. Our findings suggest that there are
   metabolic costs, measured as excess oxygen consumption and
   thermoregulation disruptions, associated with malaria-induced hemoglobin
   depression. These results may help explain limited size and reproductive
   success previously measured in malaria-infected lizards.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many people experiment with alcohol and other drugs of abuse
   during their teenage years. Epidemiological evidence suggests that
   younger initiates into drug taking are more likely to develop
   problematic drug seeking behavior, including binge and other high-intake
   behaviors. The level of drug intake for any individual depends on the
   balance of rewarding and aversive effects of the drug in that
   individual. Multiple rodent studies have demonstrated that aversive
   effects of drugs of abuse are reduced in adolescent compared to adult
   animals. In this study, we addressed 2 key questions: First, do reduced
   aversive effects of ethanol in younger rats correlate with increased
   ethanol consumption? Second, are the reduced aversive effects in
   adolescents attributable to reduced sensitivity to ethanol's physiologic
   effects?
   Methods: Adolescent and adult rats were tested for ethanol conditioned
   taste aversion (CTA) followed by a voluntary drinking period, including
   postdeprivation consumption. Multivariate regression was used to assess
   correlations. In separate experiments, adolescent and adult rats were
   tested for their sensitivity to the hypothermic and sedative effects of
   ethanol, and for blood ethanol concentrations (BECs).
   Results: We observed that in adolescent rats but not adults, taste
   aversion was inversely correlated with postdeprivation consumption.
   Adolescents also exhibited a greater increase in consumption after
   deprivation than adults. Furthermore, the age difference in ethanol CTA
   was not attributable to differences in hypothermia, sedation, or BECs.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that during adolescence, individuals
   that are insensitive to aversive effects are most likely to develop
   problem drinking behaviors. These results underscore the importance of
   the interaction between developmental stage and individual variation in
   sensitivity to alcohol.}},

Abstract = {{Increased waist circumference (WC), a surrogate measure for abdominal
   fat mass, is associated with higher cardiovascular risk not only in
   adults but also in youth. Identifying healthy dietary patterns that
   prevent abdominal fat accumulation is of paramount importance for public
   health. This study investigated the association between adherence to
   Mediterranean diet guidelines and waist circumference in a
   representative national sample of young Spaniards (n=2513), aged 10 to
   24 years. Dietary data were recorded through a 24-h recall, waist
   circumference measured by research staff, and adherence to Mediterranean
   diet guidelines determined with the 16-item KIDMED questionnaire, based
   on the principles sustaining Mediterranean dietary patterns. A
   questionnaire provided physical activity and demographic data. Higher
   KIDMED scoring was significantly associated with higher leisure time
   physical activity levels and higher maternal education. Multiple
   regression analysis showed that the KIDMED score was also inversely
   associated with age-and height-standardized residuals of waist
   circumference and with waist-to-height ratio (p=0.001). After
   multivariate adjustment, a 5-point increase in KIDMED was associated
   with a mean decline of 1.54 cm in sex-, age-and height-adjusted WC.
   These results suggest that following Mediterranean dietary principles
   may be important in reducing the risk of high waist circumference in
   young people.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke is the leading cause of chronic disability. Postacute outpatient
   rehabilitation improves functional capacity and independence in personal
   activities of daily living. There is evidence that rehabilitation may be
   still beneficial in chronic stroke patients. In the rehabilitation
   process physical-therapeutic methods are very important. Evidence of a
   positive effect of several physical-therapeutic interventions like
   different methods of physiotherapy and exercise therapy, treadmill
   training, strength training, use of robotics, occupational therapy, non
   invasive cortical stimulation and electrostimulation has been proven in
   many studies. To support these interventions medicamentous and
   non-medicamentous treatment of pain, focal spasticity (botulinum toxin)
   and depression should be performed. According to the concept of ICF the
   specialists of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation evaluate the
   individual body functions- and structures, activities and participation
   of the patient. Based on this evaluation they are responsible for
   individual adaptation and coordination of a structered rehabilitation

Abstract = {{Recent work has shown that if an isostatic bar-and-joint framework
   possesses nontrivial symmetries, then it must satisfy some very simply
   stated restrictions on the number of joints and bars that are
   ``fixed{''} by various symmetry operations of the framework.
   For the group C-3 which describes 3-fold rotational symmetry in the
   plane, we verify the conjecture proposed by Connelly et al. (Int. J.
   Solids Struct. 46: 762-773, 2009) that these restrictions on the number
   of fixed structural components, together with the Laman conditions, are
   also sufficient for a framework with C-3 symmetry to be isostatic,
   provided that its joints are positioned as generically as possible
   subject to the given symmetry constraints.
   In addition, we establish symmetric versions of Henneberg's theorem and
   Crapo's theorem for C-3 which provide alternate characterizations of
   ``generically{''} isostatic graphs with C-3 symmetry.
   As shown in (Schulze, Combinatorial and geometric rigidity with symmetry
   constraints, Ph.D. thesis, York University, Toronto, Canada, 2009;
   Schulze, Symmetrized Laman theorems for the groups C-2 and C-s, in
   preparation, 2009), our techniques can be extended to establish
   analogous results for the symmetry groups C-2 and C-s which are
   generated by a half-turn and a reflection in the plane, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{While various materials have been developed for bone substitute and bone
   tissue engineering applications over the last decades, processing
   techniques meeting the high demands of scaffold shaping are still under
   development. Individually adapted and mechanically optimised scaffolds
   can be derived from calcium phosphate (CaP-) ceramics via rapid
   prototyping (RP). In this study, porous ceramic scaffolds with a
   periodic pattern of interconnecting pores were prepared from
   hydroxyapatite, beta-tricalcium phosphate and biphasic calcium
   phosphates using a negative-mould RP technique. Moulds predetermining
   various pore patterns (round and square cross section, perpendicular and
   60A degrees inclined orientation) were manufactured via a wax printer
   and subsequently impregnated with CaP-ceramic slurries. Different pore
   patterns resulted in macroporosity values ranging from about 26.0-71.9
   vol\% with pore diameters of approximately 340 mu m. Compressive
   strength of the specimens (1.3-27.6 MPa) was found to be mainly
   influenced by the phase composition as well as the macroporosity, both
   exceeding the influence of the pore geometry. A maximum was found for
   scaffolds with 60 wt\% hydroxyapatite and 26.0 vol\% open porosity. It
   has been shown that wax ink-jet printing allows to process CaP-ceramic
   into scaffolds with highly defined geometry, exhibiting strength values
   that can be adjusted by phase composition and pore geometry. This
   strength level is within and above the range of human cancellous bone.
   Therefore, this technique is well suited to manufacture scaffolds for
   bone tissue engineering.}},

Journal = {{COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Integrins bind extracellular matrix fibrils and associate with
   intracellular actin filaments through a variety of cytoskeletal linker
   proteins to mechanically connect intracellular and extracellular
   structures. Each component of the linkage from the cytoskeleton through
   the integrin-mediated adhesions to the extracellular matrix therefore
   transmits forces that may derive from both intracellular,
   myosin-generated contractile forces and forces from outside the cell.
   These forces activate a wide range of signaling pathways and genetic
   programs to control cell survival, fate, and behavior. Additionally,
   cells sense the physical properties of their surrounding environment
   through forces exerted on integrin-mediated adhesions. This article
   first summarizes current knowledge about regulation of cell function by
   mechanical forces acting through integrin-mediated adhesions and then
   discusses models for mechanotransduction and sensing of environmental

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents data-parallel algorithms for surface and solid
   voxelization on graphics hardware. First, a novel conservative surface
   voxelization technique, setting all voxels overlapped by a mesh's
   triangles, is introduced, which is up to one order of magnitude faster
   than previous solutions leveraging the standard rasterization pipeline.
   We then show how the involved new triangle/box overlap test can be
   adapted to yield a 6-separating surface voxelization, which is thinner
   but still connected and gap-free. Complementing these algorithms, both a
   triangle-parallel and a tile-based technique for solid voxelization are
   subsequently presented. Finally, addressing the high memory consumption
   of high-resolution voxel grids, we introduce a novel octree-based sparse
   solid voxelization approach, where only close to the solid's boundary
   finest-level voxels are stored, whereas uniform interior and exterior
   regions are represented by coarser-level voxels. This representation is
   created directly from a mesh without requiring a full intermediate solid
   voxelization, enabling GPU-based voxelizations of unprecedented size.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Flash evaporation process is currently developing in the wine industry
   where it is used for flash-cooling or concentration. The design of flash
   evaporators is faced with specific constraints and must take into
   account multiple design objectives. In this paper, the development of a
   multi-objective optimization method is investigated for the joint
   optimization of design objectives such as process transportability,
   environmental efficiency, operative cost or cooling power. The
   optimization method is based on the aggregation of design objectives
   through desirability functions and indexes. Desirability functions are
   suitable for formulating design constraints more precisely than
   inequality relations and, moreover, the global design model results in
   an unconstrained optimization problem. However, aggregation methods do
   make it difficult to compute the global optimum of the design problem.
   This difficulty has been addressed by developing a distributed genetic
   algorithm which is not so sensitive to this type of numerical solving
   difficulty. Another difficulty arises from the weighting method for the
   aggregation of desirability functions since weight parameters have no
   physical meaning. This weighting problem is approached through a
   sensitivity analysis of the weight parameters and by observing their
   relative influence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Building floors comprising timber joists connected to limecrete (lime
   concrete) slabs via timber headed studs have low carbon footprints. Such
   floors are not yet used owing to lack of underpinning research. This
   paper presents results from large-scale joint tests which show that by
   sloping the timber studs at 45 degrees against the sense of slip so that
   the slab lifts off the joists during slip, not only does the joint
   exhibit good stiffness and strength, but also the joint fails in a
   highly ductile manner by double curvature hinging of each stud and by
   crushing of the adjacent limecrete and glulam near the slab-joist
   interface. With the studs sloped at 45 toward the sense of slip, joint
   ductility drops significantly while joint stiffness and strength rise
   dramatically. Test data are also given for a 4.6 m long timber
   joist-limecrete slab composite specimen with studs sloped at 45 degrees
   against slip and loaded in four-point bending to failure. Nonlinear
   finite-element analysis (FEA) using the measured joint and material
   constitutive data is seen to reliably predict this specimen's load
   response. The verified FEA is used to compare the effects of the two

Abstract = {{Primary aldosteronism (PA) is one of the common forms of curable
   hypertension. Recent views have suggested that PA is far from being
   relatively benign, as it was previously thought, but it is associated
   with a variety of cardiovascular and renal sequelae that reflect the
   capability of inappropriately elevated aldosterone to induce tissue
   damage over that induced by hypertension itself. The evidence supporting
   these views has been obtained from experiments conducted in hypertensive
   animal models and studies involving patients with PA. Preclinical
   studies have also indicated that aldosterone causes cardiovascular and
   renal tissue damage only in the context of inappropriate salt status. It
   has been suggested that untoward effects of high-salt intake are
   dependent on activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) that might
   result from increased oxidative stress and changes in the intracellular
   redox potential. Unilateral adrenalectomy or treatment with MR
   antagonists are the current options for treating an
   aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) or idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia
   (IHA). Treatments are effective in correcting hypertension and
   hypokalemia, and currently available information on their capability to
   prevent cardiovascular events and deterioration of renal function
   indicates that surgery and medical treatment are equally beneficial in
   the long term.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River has
   extensive impact on the ecosystems and the population of the Three
   Gorges Area (TGA). Inundation and resettlement have induced far-reaching
   land use and land cover change (LUCC). The areas that are affected by
   measures of resettlement are in a tense situation between the
   implementation of various governmental tasks addressing sustainable land
   use and water retention and the fulfilment of the population's economic
   needs, which primarily depend on agricultural production.
   Destabilization of slopes and soil erosion are immediate hazards induced
   by the impoundment. Farming is a very important source of income and has
   to persist on the one hand to assure the income of the rural population.
   On the other hand, the environment has to be protected from runoff, soil
   erosion and instabilities connected to relief, geology and hydraulic
   influences. In this study, supervised classifications are performed
   using Landsat-TM (1987 and 2007) and ASTER (2007) images. LUCC is
   assessed by post-classification change analysis. On the catchment scale,
   arable land has decreased significantly, while garden land (citrus
   orchards) and woodland have increased. LUCC mainly affects the area
   surrounding the reservoir ({''}backwater{''}) of the Xiangxi (e broken
   vertical bar (TM) ae(0a)) River, driven by local resettlement, newly
   built infrastructure, relocation of land cultivation, and conversion of
   arable land to garden land. In the hinterland, LUCC occurs in form of
   abandonment of land cultivation as a consequence of the Grain-for-Green
   programme.}},

Abstract = {{Study Objectives: To determine the associations between deployment in
   support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and sleep quantity and
   quality.
   Design: Longitudinal cohort study
   Setting: The Millennium Cohort Study survey is administered via a secure
   website or US mail.
   Participants: Data were from 41,225 Millennium Cohort members who
   completed baseline (2001-2003) and follow-up (2004-2006) surveys.
   Participants were placed into 1 of 3 exposure groups based on their
   deployment status at follow-up: nondeployed, survey completed during
   deployment, or survey completed postdeployment.
   Interventions: N/A
   Measurements and Results: Study outcomes were self-reported sleep
   duration and trouble sleeping, defined as having trouble falling asleep
   or staying asleep. Adjusted mean sleep duration was significantly
   shorter among those in the deployed and postdeployment groups compared
   with those who did not deploy. Additionally, male gender and greater
   stress were significantly associated with shorter sleep duration.
   Personnel who completed their survey during deployment or postdeployment
   were significantly more likely to have trouble sleeping than those who
   had not deployed. Lower self-reported general health, female gender, and
   reporting of mental health symptoms at baseline were also significantly
   associated with increased odds of trouble sleeping.
   Conclusions: Deployment significantly influenced sleep quality and
   quantity in this population though effect size was mediated with
   statistical modeling that included mental health symptoms. Personnel
   reporting combat exposures or mental health symptoms had increased odds
   of trouble sleeping. These findings merit further research to increase
   understanding of temporal relationships between sleep and mental health
   outcomes occurring during and after deployment.}},

Abstract = {{The first responsibilities in health passed on to the autonomous
   governments were those referring to public health. However, the
   decentralization process has not been accompanied by an updated
   management of the collective efforts to promote and protect health, or
   by a greater weight of public health within the system. To carry out
   such a reform, public health authorities and the central and autonomic
   administrations must assume their corresponding roles. The leading role
   should correspond to the central administration and includes the
   coordination and evaluation of the entire process, while the regional
   public health authorities should be in charge of providing public health
   services to the population, promoting innovations, and collaborating
   among themselves as well as with the central administration. Recent
   legal initiatives show some political sensitivity and may provide an
   opportunity, in addition to those provided by the economic crisis, to
   emphasize the role of guarantor rather than that of supplier for the
   state. Paradoxically, the marginality of public health could facilitate
   the necessary political agreements, even though party interests may be
   an obstacle. The influence of professional associations could be
   important. (C) 2010 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All

Abstract = {{The purpose of the investigation was to observe the

   non-specific immune response in female goats under short-term thermal
   stress. Six female goats had been exposed to 40A degrees C and 60\%
   relative humidity in the psychrometric chamber for 17 days. Blood
   samples were obtained on days 0 and 10 to establish control and thermal
   stress effects, respectively. Chemical adrenalectomy was achieved by
   injecting metyrapone (100 mg/kg body weight) followed by exogenous
   melatonin treatment (0.1 mg/kg body weight) from 11th to 17th day of
   experiment. Thermal stress significantly (P a parts per thousand
   currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05) altered the physiological
   responses. Metyrapone and melatonin treatment significantly (P a parts
   per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05) reduced the
   thermal-stress-induced increase in plasma concentrations of cortisol and
   corticosterone while significantly (P a parts per thousand currency
   signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05) increased the plasma melatonin on
   days 11 and 17. Furthermore, these treatments significantly (P < 0.05)
   increased the phagocytic activity of neutrophils as compared to both
   control and thermal exposure values from 11-17 days of experiment. The
   data generated from this study help us to understand the functional
   relationship between pineal, adrenal, and immune system, and how this
   relationship modifies the non-specific immune response for the well
   being of goats during thermal stress.}},

Title = {{Adaptability and growth of Malpura ewes subjected to thermal and

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to assess the effect of combined stresses (thermal
   and nutritional) on physiological adaptability and growth performance of
   Malpura ewes. Twenty-eight adult Malpura ewes (average BW 33.56 kg) were
   used in the present study. The ewes were divided into four groups, viz.,
   GI (n = 7; control), GII (n = 7; thermal stress), GIII (n = 7;
   nutritional stress), and GIV (n = 7; combined stress). The animals were
   stall-fed with a diet consisting of 60\% roughage and 40\% concentrate.
   GI and GII ewes were provided with ad libitum feeding, while GIII and
   GIV ewes were provided with restricted feed (30\% intake of GI ewes) to
   induce nutritional stress. GII and GIV ewes were kept in climatic
   chamber at 40A degrees C and 55\% RH for 6 h/day between 1000 and 1600
   hours to induce thermal stress. The study was conducted for a period of
   two estrus cycles. The parameters studied were feed intake, water
   intake, physiological responses (viz., respiration rate, pulse rate, and
   rectal temperature), body weight, and body condition scoring (BCS) of
   ewes. Both thermal and combined stress significantly (P < 0.05) affected
   the feed intake, water intake, respiration rate, and rectal temperature.
   The feeding schedule followed in the experiment significantly (P < 0.05)
   altered the body weight and BCS between the groups. The results reveal
   that when compared with thermal stress, nutritional stress had less
   significant effect on the parameters studied. However, when both these
   stresses were coupled, it had a significant influence on all the
   parameters studied in these ewes. It can be concluded from this study
   that when two stressors occur simultaneously, the total cost may have
   severe impact on biological function.}},

Abstract = {{In anhydrite rich reservoir rock, calcium sulfate is one of the dominant
   scale components which unlike carbonate scale are not easily removable

   molecular weight were synthesized and characterized and inhibition
   efficiency of the copolymers was tested at static and dynamic
   conditions. Their iron dispersing ability measured through UV
   spectroscopy is found to be excellent and their biocidal activity
   investigated through agar culture and serial dilution technique is
   almost insignificant. XRD and SEM analyses proved the morphological
   changes of the calcium sulphate scale due to strong inhibition action.

Abstract = {{Aim. Sclerodermus domesticus is an insect belonging to the order
   Hymenoptera. Female of S. domesticus feeds on larvae of xylophagous
   Coleoptera and Lepidoptera living in the galleries they dig in old
   wooden furniture. Human infestation is rare.
   Methods. In the last few months, we observed nine adult patients (7
   males and 2 females) who were affected by S. domesticus infestation.
   Seven patients were antiquarians or restorers and two were housewives.
   The rash was characterized by erythematous-papular lesions, accompanied
   by pruritus and/or pain. In addition, 7 patients reported general
   malaise and fever. In all cases it was possible to find specimens of S.
   domesticus in furniture or house dust.
   Results. Complete remission was obtained with topical corticosteroids,
   oral anti-histamines and pest control of furniture.
   Conclusion. Antiquarians and restorers and, in general, the people in
   close contact with furniture infested by S. domesticus may be stung by
   these insects. S. domesticus infestation can therefore be considered as
   an occupational disease in these subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphosphate (polyP) has been abundant on Earth long before life began.
   In living organisms, polyphosphate can be stored in electron-dense
   granules that have long been referred to as volutin granules. After
   having being ignored for a long time, this polymer has proven to have
   numerous unsuspected functions in living organisms and is receiving more
   attention. The ubiquitous presence of polyP in nature and its structural
   and physico-chemical characteristics appear to be the drivers for the
   evolutionary selection of this versatile molecule as a component of
   cellular processes. Most of our knowledge about the functions of polyP
   comes from the microbial world. PolyP can influence the transcription
   and translation of specific genes, act as a metabolic regulator, provide
   an alternative source of energy, and modulate several stress responses.
   In plant systems, although the presence of polyP has long been known,
   its roles in cellular processes have begun to emerge only recently. The
   purpose of this mini-review is to provide a brief overview of the
   proposed biological roles of polyphosphates in plants and their roles in
   microbial/plant interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. - The aim of this study was to investigate whether lower
   lithium levels (LoLi) or olanzapine doses (LoOL) are risk factors for
   future mood episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder.
   Methods. - A post-hoc analysis of the olanzapine-lithium-maintenance
   study {[}31] was performed using proportional hazards Cox regression
   models and marginal structural models (MSMs), adjusting for non-random
   assignments of dose during treatment.
   Results. - The LoLi group (< 0.6 mmol/L) had a significantly increased
   risk of manic/mixed (hazard ratio {[}HR] = 1.96, p = 0.042), but not
   depressive (HR = 2.11, p = 0.272) episodes, compared to the combined
   medium (0.6-0.79 mmol/L) and high lithium level (>= 0.8 mmol/L) groups.
   There was no significant difference in risk between the two higher
   lithium level groups (0.6-0.79 mmol/L; >= 0.8 mmol/L) for new
   manic/mixed (HR = 0.96, p = 0.893) or depressive (HR = 0.95, p = 0.922)
   episodes. The LoOL group (< 10 mg/day) showed a significantly increased
   risk of depressive (HR = 2.24, p = 0.025) episodes compared to the
   higher olanzapine (HiOL) dose group (HiOL: 10-20 mg/day), while there
   was no statistically significant difference in risk for manic/mixed
   episodes between the two groups (HR = 0.94, p = 0.895).
   Conclusion. - Lithium levels >= 0.6 mmol/L and olanzapine doses >= 10
   mg/day may be necessary for optimal protection against manic/mixed or
   depressive episodes, respectively in patients with bipolar I disorder.

Abstract = {{Diazinon (O,O-diethyl-O-{[}2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl] phosphoro
   thioate), an organo-phosphate insecticide, has been used worldwide in
   agriculture and domestic for several years, which has led to a variety
   of negative effects in non target species including humans. However, its
   nephrotoxic effects and mechanism of action has not been fully
   elucidated so far. Therefore, the present study was aimed at evaluating
   the nephrotoxic effects of diazinon and its mechanism of action with
   special reference to its possible ROS generating potential in rats.
   Treatment of rats with diazinon significantly enhances renal lipid
   peroxidation which is accompanied by a decrease in the activities of
   renal antioxidant enzymes (e.g. catalase, glutathione peroxidise,
   glutathione reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione
   S-transferase) and depletion in the level of glutathione reduced. In
   contrast, the activities of renal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and
   quinone reductase were increased. Parallel to these changes, diazinon
   treatment enhances renal damage as evidenced by sharp increase in blood
   urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. Additionally, the impairment of
   renal function corresponds histopathologically. In summary, our results
   indicate that diazinon treatment eventuates in decreased renal
   glutathione reduced, a fall in the activities of antioxidant enzymes
   including the enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism and excessive
   production of oxidants with concomitant renal damage, all of which are
   involved in the cascade of events leading to diazinon-mediated renal
   oxidative stress and toxicity. We concluded that in diazinon exposure,
   depletion of antioxidant enzymes is accompanied by induction of
   oxidative stress that might be beneficial in monitoring diazinon
   toxicity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Science-based health innovation in Tanzania: bednets and a base for
   invention}},
Journal = {{BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tanzania is East Africa's largest country. Although it is
   socially diverse, it has experienced general political stability since
   independence in 1964. Despite gradual economic development and
   Tanzania's status as one of the biggest recipients of aid in Africa,
   health status remains poor. This paper explores Tanzania's science-based
   health innovation system, and highlights areas which can be
   strengthened.
   Methods: Qualitative case study research methodology was used. Data were
   collected through reviews of academic literature and policy documents,
   and through open-ended, face-to-face interviews with 52 people from
   across the science-based health innovation system over two visits to
   Tanzania from July to October 2007.
   Results and discussion: Tanzania has a rich but complex S\&T governance
   landscape, with the public sector driving the innovation agenda through
   a series of different bodies which are not well-coordinated. It has some
   of the leading health research on the continent at the University of Dar
   es Salaam, Muhimbili University of Health and Applied Sciences, the
   National Institute for Medical Research and the Ifakara Medical
   Institute, with strong donor support. Tanzania has found developing an
   entrepreneurial culture difficult; nevertheless projects such as the
   clusters initiative at the University of Dar es Salaam are encouraging
   low-tech innovation and overcoming knowledge-sharing barriers. In the
   private sector, one generics company has developed a South-South
   collaboration to enable technology transfer and hence the local
   production of anti-retrovirals. Local textile company A to Z Textiles is
   now manufacturing 30 million insecticide impregnated bednets a year.
   Conclusions: To have a coherent vision for innovation, Tanzania may wish
   to address some key issues: coordination across stakeholders involved
   with health research, increasing graduates in health-related
   disciplines, and building capabilities in biological testing,
   preclinical testing, formulation and standardization, and related areas
   important to moving from basic research to applications. The private
   sector can be encouraged to innovate through improved access to
   financing, and incentives for R\&D. The diaspora community represents an
   untapped source for partnerships and access to other developing world
   markets and technology. The government may wish to set up mechanisms to
   encourage south-south collaborations, and to bring the public and
   private sector together around specific projects to help realize the
   country's innovation potential.}},

   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The in-vitro
   radiochemical purity (RCP) yield. in-vivo biodistribution behavior in
   artificially infected rats (AIT) and scintigraphic accuracy in
   artificially infected rabbit (AIB) of the 99(m)Tc-RMP complex was
   investigated using different concentration of the RMP, sodium
   pertechnetate ((NaTcO4)-Tc-99m), stannous chloride dihydrate (SnCl2
   center dot 2H(2)O) at different pH ranges 5-6. The best RCP yield
   observed at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after labeling was: 98.95 +/- 0 20,
   98 15 +/- 0.24. 96.50 +/- 0.27 and 91.55 +/- 0.22\%, respectively. using
   1.5 mg RMP, 175 mu L of SnCl2 2H(2)O (1 mu g/mu L in 0.01 N HCl), 3 mu
   of (NaTcO4)-Tc-99m, at pH 5.6. Initially in the infected muscle (INM) of
   the AIT the activity was lower but after 90 mm it went up to 18.35 +/-
   0.20\% from 595 +/- 0 25\%. The activity in the inflamed muscle (IMM),
   normal (NM) muscle, blood, liver and spleen was initially high that
   decreased with time. The ratios of the INM/NM and IMM/NM were 7.34 +/-
   074 and 1.20 +/- 0.85, respectively. The whole body static (WBS) imaging
   of the MRSA infected rabbit confirmed the usefulness of the Tc-99m-RMP
   as a precise radiotracer for MRSA infection imaging. On the basis of
   in-vitro RCP, in-vivo biodistribution and scintigraphic precision, we
   recommend the Tc-99m-RMP complex prepared aseptically for in-vivo
   assessment of MRSA infection. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The detection and diagnosis of beta-thalassaemia for
   populations with molecular heterogeneity, or diverse ethnic groups, has
   increased the need for the development of an array high-throughput
   diagnostic tool that can deliver large scale genetic detection. We
   report on the update and validation of the ThalassoChip, a
   beta-thalassaemia genetic diagnostic tool which is based on arrayed
   primer extension (APEX) technology.
   Methods: ThalassoChip slides with new and redesigned probes were
   prepared for testing the microarray. Six hundred and sixty DNA samples
   collected from eight Mediterranean countries were used for
   standardisation, optimisation and validation of the ThalassoChip. The
   beta-globin gene region was amplified by PCR, the products were
   hybridised to the probes after fragmentation and the APEX reaction
   followed.
   Results: The ThalassoChip was updated with new probes and now has the
   ability to detect 57 beta-globin gene mutations and three single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a single test. The ThalassoChip as
   well as the PCR and APEX reactions were standardised and optimised using
   500 DNA samples that were previously genotyped using conventional
   diagnostic techniques. Some probes were redesigned in order to improve
   the specificity and sensitivity of the test. Validation of the
   ThalassoChip performed using 160 samples analysed in blinded fashion
   showed no error.
   Conclusions: The updated version of the ThalassoChip is versatile,
   robust, cost-effective and easily adaptable, but most notably can
   provide comprehensive genetic diagnosis for beta-thalassaemia and other
   haemoglobinopathies. Clin Chem Lab Med 2010; 48:1713-8.}},

   even in the tetragonal phase at T = 280 K. In the superconducting
   compounds with x = 0.057 and 0.082, the spin excitations developed below
   the superconducting transition temperatures up to the same order of

   11 meV. The spin excitation, however, almost disappeared in an overdoped
   compound with x = 0.158, which exhibited only low temperature
   superconductivity below 7 K. These results indicate that the present

Abstract = {{A simple, rapid and sensitive method is developed for selective

   extracted and pre-concentrated from acidic water samples by using sodium
   diethyldithiocarbamate as a suitable chelating agent, and carbon
   tetrachloride and acetone as extraction and disperser solvents,
   respectively. After optimizing different parameters, including type and
   volume of extraction and disperser solvents, pH of test solution,
   extraction time, volume and concentration of the chelating agent and
   sample volume, an enrichment factor of 362 was obtained. The linear
   concentration range, limit of detection and relative standard deviation
   of the method were evaluated as 0.04-0.8 ng mL(-1), 0.007 ng mL(-1) and
   4.5\%, respectively. This method was applied successfully to the

Abstract = {{Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) is a widespread monoecious and
   wind-pollinated tree species. It is one of the major components of the
   Hyrcanian forests of Iran and it is of both ecological and economical
   importance. Twelve beech stands were surveyed at 9 chloroplast (cp) and
   6 nuclear (n) polymorphic microsatellite loci (simple sequence repeats,
   SSR) to provide information on distribution of genetic diversity within
   and among populations and on gene conservation and silvicultural
   management of this species. High levels of genetic differentiation were
   detected for the chloroplast genome (F (ST) = 0.80 and R (ST) = 0.95),
   in sharp contrast to the nuclear genome (F (ST) = 0.06, R (ST) = 0.05).
   The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 48\% of the total
   cpSSR variation was attributable to differences among regions and 30\%
   to differences among populations within regions, suggesting multiple
   origins of beech populations in Hyrcanian forests. Nuclear SSRs
   confirmed the presence of significant differentiation among populations
   and among geographic regions, even if, as expected, this was less
   pronounced than that found with cpSSRs (based on AMOVA, differences
   among regions and among populations within regions each contribute 5\%
   to total nSSR variance). A highly significant correlation between
   genetic (nSSRs) and geographic distances (R (2) = 0.522) was estimated,
   thus showing an isolation by distance effect. The application of spatial
   analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) using both marker data allowed
   identification of genetically homogeneous groups of populations.
   Possible applications of these results for the certification of
   provenances and/or seed lots and for designing conservation programs are
   presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous series of experiments, the present authors demonstrated
   that when people are asked to identify the flavors of various drinks on
   the basis of orthonasal olfactory cues, a number of experimental
   variables can modulate whether the color of the drinks influence their
   judgments. Here we examined two additional variables that we
   hypothesized might also mediate color's effect on flavor identification
   behavior: the timing and spatial positioning of color cues with respect
   to the positioning of olfactory cues. In Experiment 1, participants were
   exposed to color cues before, during/after, or after exposure to the
   olfactory cues. Color had a significant influence on flavor
   identification behavior in the latter two conditions, but not in the
   former condition. In Experiment 2, color cues were spatially separated
   from the olfactory cues, and no significant effect of color on flavor
   identification behavior was found. These results therefore reveal that
   manipulating spatial and temporal factors can have differential effects
   on crossmodal color-odor interactions.
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
   This research has the potential to inform the decisions made by
   manufacturers regarding the placement of color and odor cues in products
   and packaging. While color cues (which, critically, often precede our
   consumption of foodstuffs) have been shown to influence our olfactory
   judgments of food and beverage identity, it is important for
   manufacturers to consider the specific temporal and spatial
   relationships that either encourage (or discourage) such crossmodal
   interactions. By taking these factors into account, our experience and
   enjoyment of food and drink can be optimized - especially if color-odor
   interactions are used to facilitate the most favorable interpretation of
   a stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{The role of quantitative D-dimer assay in screening for and diagnosing

   associated with overt DIC, 142 with ISTH scores >= 5 (compatible with
   overt DIC) and 61 with ISTH scores <5 (suggestive of nonovert DIC)
   underwent the quantitative D-dimer assay. Accuracy indices, receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve-derived cutoffs, and areas under
   curve were compared. Mean D-dimer level in overt DIC was 4147.2 +/- 2707
   ng/mL. In nonovert DIC, it was 1678.9 +/- 1888.3 ng/mL. Both were higher
   than healthy controls (229.6 +/- 129.9 ng/mL). An optimized cutoff (2040
   ng/mL) had relatively low sensitivity (75.4\%) and specificity (73.8\%).
   Extensive overlap between groups at this cutoff reduced diagnostic
   utility. Lowered cutoffs increased sensitivity (eg, 91.5\% at 1000
   ng/mL) but diminished specificity (59\%), limiting use of screening. In
   conclusion, the quantitative D-dimer as a stand-alone assay has a
   limited role in diagnosis of overt DIC.}},

Abstract = {{The 5th US FDA-Drug Industry Association (DIA) workshop in a series on
   pharmacogenomics entitled: `Generating and Weighing Evidence in Drug
   Development and Regulatory Decision Making', contained four major topics
   (tracks): `Learning from Labels and Label Changes: How to Build
   Pharmacogenomics into Drug Development Programs'; `Enabling
   Pharmacogenomic Clinical Trials Through Sampling'; `Designing
   Pharmacogenomics Studies to be Fit for Purpose'; and `Co-Development of
   Drugs and Diagnostics'. The meeting was attended by approximately 200
   professionals, primarily involved in drug development and healthcare
   delivery. Several critical elements drove the success of the meeting: it
   was recognized that the enriched conversation at this workshop between
   regulators and drug developers was driven with less inhibition than
   before and with a greater scientific focus on the issues. Multiple
   examples in the field and broader collective experience helped more
   in-depth thinking of the pros and cons of implementing
   pharmacogenetic/genetic approaches during drug development, in the
   current environment. It was also noted that this field is still
   developing and nascent as illustrated by the paucity of actual
   diagnostic drug co-development examples. Furthermore, the complexities
   of conducting pharmacogenetic research in global drug-development
   programs was acknowledged as was the need for rigorous research designs
   and methodologies despite these challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Epithelial cells (ECs) are usually hyporesponsive to various microbial
   products. Detection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of
   gram-negative bacteria, is impeded, at least in part, by intracellular
   sequestration of its receptor, Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). In this
   study, using human bronchial ECs (hBECs) as a model of mucosal
   epithelium, we tested the hypothesis that the human LPS-binding,
   membrane-active cationic host defense peptide cathelicidin LL-37
   augments epithelial response to LPS by facilitating its delivery to
   TLR4-containing intracellular compartments. We found that LL-37
   significantly increases uptake of LPS by ECs with subsequent targeting
   to cholera toxin subunit B-labeled structures and lysosomes. This uptake
   is peptide specific, dose and time dependent, and involves the
   endocytotic machinery, functional lipid rafts, and epidermal growth
   factor receptor signaling. Cathelicidin-dependent LPS internalization
   resulted in significant increased release of the inflammatory cytokines
   IL-6 and IL-8. This indicates that, in ECs, this peptide may replace
   LPS-binding protein functions. In polarized ECs, the effect of LL-37 was
   restricted to the basolateral compartment of the epithelial membrane,
   suggesting that LL-37-mediated activation of ECs by LPS may be relevant
   to disease conditions associated with damage to the epithelial barrier.
   In summary, our study identified a novel role of LL-37 in host-microbe
   interactions as a host factor that licenses mucosal ECs to respond to
   LPS.-Shaykhiev, R., Sierigk, J., Herr, C., Krasteva, G., Kummer, W.,

   Exacerbates Vascular Leak, Fibrosis, and Mortality after Lung Injury}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sphingosine 1-phosphate(S1P) is a key endogenous regulator of the
   response to lung injury, maintaining endothelial barrier integrity
   through interaction with one of its receptors, S1P(1). The short-term
   administration of S1P or S1P(1) receptor agonists enhances endothelial
   monolayer barrier function in vitro, and attenuates injury-induced
   vascular leak in the lung and other organ systems in vivo. Although
   S1P(1) agonists bind to and activate S1P(1), several of these agents
   also induce receptor internalization and degradation, and may therefore
   act as functional antagonists of S1P(1) after extended exposure. Here we
   report on the effects of prolonged exposure to these agents in
   bleomycin-induced lung injury. We demonstrate that repeated
   administration of S1P(1) agonists dramatically worsened lung injury
   after bleomycin challenge, as manifested by increased vascular leak and
   mortality. Consistent with these results, prolonged exposure to S1P(1)
   agonists in vitro eliminated the ability of endothelial cell monolayers
   to respond appropriately to the barrier-protective effects of S1P,
   indicating a loss of normal S1P-S1P(1) signaling. As bleomycin-induced
   lung injury progressed, continued exposure to S1P(1) agonists also
   resulted in increased pulmonary fibrosis. These data indicate that
   S1P(1) agonists can act as functional antagonists of S1P(1) on
   endothelial cells in vivo, which should be considered in developing
   these agents as therapies for vascular leak syndromes. Our findings also
   support the hypothesis that vascular leak is an important component of
   the fibrogenic response to lung injury, and suggest that targeting the
   S1P-S1P(1) pathway may also be an effective therapeutic strategy for
   fibrotic lung diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Vaccination programs to control Newcastle disease include use of low

   protective immunity. In order to further characterize the immune
   response elicited by live virus, we evaluated both cellular and humoral
   immune response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) consequent to vaccine
   application by oculonasal and intranasal routes. Specific antiviral
   antibodies to NDV were detected as early as 7 days post vaccination
   (PV). The peak antibody levels were achieved at 2 wk PV and 3 wk PV in
   chicken vaccinated by oculonasal and intranasal route, respectively. The
   antibodies persisted upto 7 wk PV albeit low levels. The NDV specific
   cell mediated immune response (CMI) as detected by lymphocyte
   proliferation test was induced at 3 wks PV and that persisted upto 7 wk
   PV in chicken vaccinated by both oculonasal and intranasal route. These
   results suggest that both oculonasal and intranasal routes of
   vaccination induce comparable immune responses in chicken vaccinated
   with lentogenic ND vaccine.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Bactrocera (Diptera: Tephritidae) includes approximate to 70
   polyphagous species that are major pests of fruit and vegetable crops.
   Most Bactrocera species have limited geographic distributions, but
   several species are invasive, and many countries operate continuous
   trapping programs to detect infestations. In the United States,
   California maintains approximate to 25,000 traps (baited with male
   lures) specifically for Bactrocera detection distributed over an area of
   approximate to 6,400 km(2) (2,500 miles(2)) in the Los Angeles area.
   Although prior studies have used male lures to describe movement of
   Bactrocera males, they do not explicitly relate capture probability with
   fly distance from lure-baited traps; consequently, they do not address
   the relative effectiveness of male lures in detecting incipient
   populations of Bactrocera species. The objective of this study was to
   measure the distance-dependent capture probability of marked, released
   males of Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) and Bactrocera cucurbitae
   (Coquillett) (methyl eugenol- and cue lure-responding species,
   respectively) within the detection trapping grid operating in southern
   California. These data were then used to compute simple probability
   estimates for detecting populations of different sizes of the two
   species. Methyl eugenol was the more powerful attractant, and based on
   the mark-recapture data, we estimated that B. dorsalis populations with
   as few as approximate to 50 males would always (>99.9\%) be detected
   using the current trap density of five methyl eugenol-baited traps per
   2.6 km(2) (1 mile(2)). By contrast, we estimated that certain detection
   of B. cucurbitae populations would not occur until these contained
   approximate to 350 males. The implications of the results for the
   California trapping system are discussed, and the findings are compared
   with mark-release-recapture data obtained for the same two species in
   Hawaii.}},

Abstract = {{We study boosting algorithms from a new perspective. We show that the
   Lagrange dual problems of l(1)-norm-regularized AdaBoost, LogitBoost,
   and soft-margin LPBoost with generalized hinge loss are all entropy
   maximization problems. By looking at the dual problems of these boosting
   algorithms, we show that the success of boosting algorithms can be
   understood in terms of maintaining a better margin distribution by
   maximizing margins and at the same time controlling the margin variance.
   We also theoretically prove that approximately, l(1)-norm-regularized
   AdaBoost maximizes the average margin, instead of the minimum margin.
   The duality formulation also enables us to develop
   column-generation-based optimization algorithms, which are totally
   corrective. We show that they exhibit almost identical classification
   results to that of standard stagewise additive boosting algorithms but
   with much faster convergence rates. Therefore, fewer weak classifiers
   are needed to build the ensemble using our proposed optimization
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT), approximate
   solution for FG (functionally graded) laminated piezoelectric
   cylindrical shells under thermal shock and moving mechanical loads is
   given utilizing Hamilton's principle. The thin piezoelectric layers
   embedded on inner and outer surfaces of the functionally graded layer
   are acted as distributed sensor and actuator to control dynamic
   characteristics of the FG laminated cylindrical shells. Here, the modal
   analysis technique and Newmark's integration method are used to
   calculate the dynamic response of FG laminated cylindrical shells.
   Constant-gain negative velocity feedback approach is used for active
   vibration control. The active vibration control to a single moving
   concentrated loading, thermal shock loading and a continuous stream of
   moving concentrated loadings is, respectively, investigated. Results
   indicate that the control gain and velocity of moving loadings have
   significant effects on the dynamic response and resonance of the system.

Abstract = {{Nesting ecology and population studies indicate that diamondback
   terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) exhibit nest site fidelity and high
   habitat fidelity. However, genetic studies indicate high levels of gene
   flow. Because dispersal affects the genetics and population dynamics of
   a species, we used six highly polymorphic microsatellite markers to
   investigate sex-biased dispersal and natal philopatry of M. terrapin in
   Barnegat Bay, NJ. We compared results of spatial autocorrelation
   analysis, assignment methods and Wright's FST estimators to a
   mark-recapture analysis. Mark-recapture analysis over a 4-year period
   indicated that most individuals have relatively small home ranges (<2
   km), with mature females displaying greater home ranges than males.
   Goodness of fit analysis of our mark-recapture study indicated that some
   juvenile males were likely transient individuals moving through our
   study location. Mean assignment indices and first-generation migrant
   tests indicated that mature males were more prone to disperse than
   mature females, but first-generation migrant tests indicated that per
   capita there are more female than male dispersers. Thus, the relative
   importance of males and females on gene flow in terrapin populations may
   change in relation to population sex ratios. Spatial autocorrelation
   analysis indicated that mature females exhibited natal philopatry to
   nesting beaches, but first-generation migrant tests indicated that a
   small number of females failed to nest on natal beaches. Finally, we
   discuss the important conservation implications of male-biased dispersal
   and natal philopatry in the diamondback terrapin.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic recognition of communication signal type plays an important
   role in various applications. Most of the existing recognizers can only
   identify a few types of communication signal. This paper presents a
   novel intelligent technique that identifies a variety of digital signal
   types. Here, a hierarchical support vector machine based structure is
   proposed as the multiclass classifier. A proper set of the higher order
   moments (up to eighth) and higher order cumulants (up to eighth) are
   proposed as the effective features for recognizing of the digital
   communication signal. A genetic algorithm is used for selecting the
   suitable parameters of support vector machines. This idea improves the
   performance of the recognizer, efficiently. Simulation results show that
   the proposed recognizer has a high success rate for recognition of the
   different modulations even at very low SNRs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This study investigates the characteristics of induced radioactivity due
   to the operations of a 3-GeV electron accelerator at the Taiwan Photon
   Source (TPS). According to the beam loss analysis, the authors set two
   representative irradiation conditions for the activation analysis. The
   FLUKA Monte Carlo code has been used to predict the isotope inventories,
   residual activities, and remanent dose rates as a function of time. The
   calculation model itself is simple but conservative for the evaluation
   of induced radioactivity in a light source facility. This study
   highlights the importance of beam loss scenarios and demonstrates the
   great advantage of using FLUKA in comparing the predicted radioactivity
   with corresponding regulatory limits. The calculated results lead to the
   conclusion that, due to fairly low electron consumption, the
   radioactivity induced in the accelerator components and surrounding
   concrete walls of the TPS is rather moderate and manageable, while the
   possible activation of air and cooling water in the tunnel and their
   environmental releases are negligible. Health Phys. 99(6):788-799; 2010}},

Abstract = {{Cancer stem cells (CSCs)/tumor-initiating cells have been defined as a
   subset of tumor cells responsible for initiating and sustaining tumor
   development. Emerging evidence strongly supports the existence of CSCs
   in various solid tumors, but they have not yet been identified in human
   gallbladder carcinomas (GBC). In this study, we identified CSCs in
   primary GBC and in the cell line GBC-SD using the cell surface markers
   CD44 and CD133. The percentages of CD44(+) CD133(+) cells were
   1.76-3.05\% in primary tumors and 40.29\% in GBC-SD cells. These cells
   showed stem cell properties, including self-renewal, differentiation
   potential and high tumorigenicity. In vitro culture experiments revealed
   that CD44(+) CD133(+) GBC cells possessed a higher spheroid-colony
   forming ability in serum-free media than other subpopulations. When
   injected into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice,
   these cells formed new tumors and generated CD44(+) CD133(+), CD44(+)
   and CD133(+) progeny. CD44(+) CD133(+) cells also showed a high degree
   of chemoresistance, possibly due to upregulation of the breast cancer
   resistance protein (ABCG2) and the transcription factor Gli1 in these
   highly tumorigenic cells. These results suggest that the CD44(+)
   CD133(+) population exhibited CSC-like characteristics and may thus
   provide a novel approach to the diagnosis and treatment of GBC.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the joint production and recycling problem is
   investigated for a hybrid manufacturing and remanufacturing system where
   brand-new products are produced in the manufacturing plant and recycled
   products are remanufactured into as-new products in the remanufacturing
   facility. Both the brand-new products and remanufactured products are
   used to satisfy customer demands. Returns of used products that are
   recycled from customers are assumed to be stochastic and nonlinearly
   price-dependent. A mathematical model is proposed to maximize the
   overall profit of the system through simultaneously optimizing the
   production and recycling decisions, subject to two capacity constraints
   - the manufacturing capacity and the remanufacturing capacity. Based on
   Lagrangian relaxation method, subgradient algorithm and heuristic
   algorithm, a solution approach is developed to solve the problem. A
   representative example is presented to illustrate the system, and
   managerial analysis indicates that the uncertainties in demand and
   return have much influence on the production and recycling policy. In
   addition, twenty randomly produced examples are solved, and
   computational results show that the solution approach can obtain very
   good solutions for all examples in reasonable time.}},

   polymorphic microsatellites to investigate the level of genetic
   variation and differentiation among these groups. A significant level of
   genetic differentiation was detected in pairwise group comparisons.
   Pairwise F-ST values ranged from 0.019 to 0.028, indicating, however, a
   level of similarity among the groups higher than that observed in other
   species of the Picea genus. Cluster analysis indicated that the three
   groups analyzed here derived from a single gene pool. We propose that
   moisture differences in the sand dunes may lead to the observed
   differentiation in P. mongolica populations, which may be accelerated by
   habitat fragmentation. The observed genetic differentiation among the
   three groups of P. mongolica supports their classification as three
   different ecotypes, namely Picea mongolica f. purpurea, Picea mongolica
   f. rubra, and Picea mongolica f. viridis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{P>Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genetic characteristic of different
   ethnic minorities would be useful for tracing the origin of modern human
   HLA matching in transplantation and disease associations. In this study,
   we reported HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 alleles and haplotypes in the Bulang
   and Hani populations of southwestern China using a high-resolution
   polymerase chain reaction-Luminex (PCR-Luminex) typing method. A total
   of nine HLA-A, 22 HLA-B, 13 HLA-C and 18 HLA-DRB1 alleles were
   identified in the Bulang population, and 11 HLA-A, 25 HLA-B, 14 HLA-C
   and 19 HLA-DRB1 alleles were in the Hani population. Compared with other
   populations, the predominant A{*}1101-B{*}1502-DRB1{*}1202 haplotype in
   the Bulang and Hani populations was also common in Jinuo, Wa, Dai,
   Maonan and Vietnamese populations. The distribution of HLA genes
   indicate that Bulang and Hani populations belong to the Southeast Asia
   group and they have maintained their original genetic characteristics
   and kept a long genetic distance from other populations owing to founder
   effects and subsequent geographic isolation. In addition, the close
   relationship among ethnic groups in Yunnan province and the Thai and
   Vietnamese populations were confirmed, whereas the Mon-Kmer-speaking
   populations shared other common HLA alleles and haplotypes compared with
   other linguistic groups.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This paper summarizes current knowledge of pain-related and
   analgesic-related pathways as well as genetic variations involved in
   pain perception and management.
   Methods The pain group of the GENEQOL Consortium was given the task of
   summarizing the current status of research on genetic variations in pain
   and analgesic efficacy. This review is neither exhaustive nor
   comprehensive; we focus primarily on single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
   Results Two categories of potential genetic pain-perception pathways
   were identified: neurotransmission modulators and mechanisms that affect
   inflammation. Four categories were identified for analgesic efficacy:
   genes related to receptor interaction, modulation of opioid effects,
   metabolism, and transport. Various genetic variations involved in these
   pathways are proposed as candidate genetic markers for pain perception
   and for individual sensitivity to analgesics.
   Conclusions Candidate gene association studies have been used to provide
   evidence for the genetic modulation of pain perception and response to
   analgesics. However, the nature and range of genetic modulation of pain
   is not well addressed due to the limited number of patients and the
   limited number of genes and genetic variants investigated in studies to
   date. Moreover, personalized analgesic treatments will require a more
   complete understanding of the effects of genetic variants and gene-gene
   interactions in response to analgesics.}},

Abstract = {{In mammalian oocytes, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is suggested

   proteins Here, we investigated the role of the UPS in the onset of ZGA
   in early mouse embryo First, we found degradation of cyclin B1 protein
   in fertilized oocytes at 1 hpi by western blot analysis and used the se
   oocytes throughout this study Subsequently, we determined optimal
   experimental conditions for transient inhibition of proteasomal activity
   by specific and reversible proteasomal inhibitor MG132 in the Cl phase
   of the first cell cycle Under the selected optimal conditions, we
   subjected transient MG132-treated embryos to reverse transcription
   (RT)-PCR analysis of expression of four ZGA genes, i e, the hsp70 1,
   MuERV-L, eif-1a and zscan4d genes As a result, we found that onset of
   expression of the four examined ZGA genes was delayed m both normally

   indicate that proteasomal degradation of proteins by the UPS plays a
   pivotal role in the molecular mechanisms of ZGA in early mouse embryos}},

Abstract = {{Background: Neuronal loss in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal
   model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), correlates with
   permanent neurological dysfunction. Current MS therapies have limited
   the ability to prevent neuronal damage.
   Methods: We examined whether oral therapy with SRT501, a pharmaceutical
   grade formulation of resveratrol, reduces neuronal loss during
   relapsing-remitting EAE. Resveratrol activates SIRT1, an
   NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase that promotes mitochondrial function.
   Results: Oral SRT501 prevented neuronal loss during optic neuritis, an
   inflammatory optic nerve lesion in MS and EAE. SRT501 also suppressed
   neurological dysfunction during EAE remission, and spinal cords from
   SRT501-treated mice had significantly higher axonal density than
   vehicle-treated mice. Similar neuroprotection was mediated by SRT1720,
   another SIRT1-activating compound; and sirtinol, an SIRT1 inhibitor,
   attenuated SRT501 neuroprotective effects. SIRT1 activators did not
   prevent inflammation.
   Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that SRT501 attenuates neuronal
   damage and neurological dysfunction in EAE by a mechanism involving
   SIRT1 activation. SIRT1 activators are a potential oral therapy in MS.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial performance index (MPI), or Tei index, is a Doppler
   echocardiographic parameter defined as the sum of the isovolumic
   contraction and relaxation times divided by the ejection time. It is
   considered a reliable parameter for global left ventricular function.
   However, the interpretation of this index is not fully clear in
   diastolic dysfunction. We measured MPI in a pressure-overload model of
   rats with severe diastolic with or without systolic dysfunction and
   examined its usefulness as a parameter for cardiac function in a
   hypertensive heart failure model.
   Pressure overload was created by placement of a metal clip around the
   thoracic aorta {[}transverse aortic constriction (TAC)] at a weight of
   40-50 g. Transthoracic echocardiography including Doppler analysis and
   invasive left ventricular catheter examination were performed 10 and 20
   weeks after TAC (n = 6 for each time point). While left ventricular
   ejection fraction was over 50\% in all TAC animals after 10 weeks (56.3
   +/- 2.3\%), it was below 50\% in all TAC animals after 20 weeks (45.4
   +/- 1.0\%). E/E' was significantly larger in the TAC groups at both time
   points and the time constant tau by Millar catheter was also elevated in
   the TAC groups. On the other hand, MPI was not different compared with
   the control groups (10 weeks: 0.47 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.04; 20 weeks:
   0.38 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.07).
   MPI is not a reliable parameter for the assessment of contractile
   function in pressure-overload heart failure. It is normal in diastolic
   dysfunction with or without preserved ejection fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2)
   are essential for recognizing the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of
   Gram-negative bacteria. We determined the sequences of cDNAs encoding
   TLR4 and MD-2 from cetaceans and generated three-dimensional (3D) models
   for a better understanding of their modes of interaction and LPS
   recognition. The 3D reconstructions showed that cetacean TLR4 and MD-2
   formed a horseshoe-like structure comprised of parallel beta-strands and
   a beta-cup structure consisting of two anti-parallel beta-sheets,
   respectively. The (TLR4-MD-2) 2 duplex-heterodimer was shown to form a
   symmetrical structure. Comparison with the interfaces of the complexes
   in other mammals revealed that cetacean TLR4s have some amino acid
   residue substitutions involved in duplex-heterodimer formation and in
   species variation for LPS recognition. These substitutions in the
   changed amino acid residues may alter the interaction among TLR4, MD-2,
   and LPS and modify the TLR4/MD-2 immunological responses. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Rationale Limited epidemiological data exist on subarachnoid haemorrhage
   (SAH) in China. Effective prevention requires knowledge of the rates and
   risk factors for SAH the most lethal type of stroke that most often
   affects younger adults. We report the methods and the initial experience
   of a new study to address this deficiency.
   Aims To determine the incidence, risk factors, management and outcomes
   of SAH. Design The CHina Epidemiology Research In Subarachnoid
   Haemorrhage (CHERISH) is a prospective, population-based, case-control
   study in a defined region (study population 1.7 million) of the city of
   Baotou in Inner Mongolia, China.
   Methods Cases of spontaneous SAH are identified using standard
   definitions through prospective surveillance of all major acute care
   hospitals with neurology/neurosurgery facilities, small
   hospitals/clinics, and the single city crematorium over a 2-year period.
   Verbal autopsy procedures are used to ascertain the probable causes of
   deaths outside of hospital. For each case, two nonrelative controls
   without SAH are matched by age (5-year strata), gender, and district of
   residence. Data are collected on socio-demography, lifestyle factors,
   and medical history, and blood is taken for the extraction and storage
   of DNA. Details of the clinical features, presentation, and management
   of SAH are obtained from cases, and survivors provide details on health
   care utilisation, physical function, health-related quality of life, and
   complications, at 6-months.
   Study outcomes The primary outcomes are overall, age-and gender-specific
   incidence, relative (odds ratios) and population-attributable risks for
   defined exposures, and 28-day and 6-month case fatality ratios and other
   outcomes.
   Conclusions Preliminary experience confirms the completeness of the
   surveillance methods, with no clear missed out-of-hospital cases of SAH
   with sudden death, and of high participation and reliable data
   collection procedures. CHERISH is well placed to provide reliable
   estimates of the burden of SAH in China.}},

Abstract = {{Background The differences in implantable pressure sensor aneurysm sac
   readings were compared following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)
   among three different stent grafts.
   Methods From January 2006 to March 2009, 51 aortic stent grafts were
   implanted along with the Endosure sensor. Grafts used were Zenith,
   Talent, and Excluder. In the present retrospective study, pulse ratios
   were measured intraoperatively before and after aneurysm sac exclusion
   and in follow-up (within 30 days). Analysis of variance was used to
   determine significance.
   Results The average aneurysm size that was repaired was 5.75 cm (range:
   4-8.5 cm); 41 patients (80.4\%) being male with an average age of 76.3
   years (range: 58-90 years). Thirty-four grafts were Zenith, 9 were
   Talent, and 8 were Excluder. The average pre-aneurysm exclusion pulse
   ratios for the Zenith, Talent, and Excluder were 1.00, 1.08, and 0.95 (p
   = 0.18), respectively. The average post-aneurysm exclusion pulse ratios
   were 0.34, 0.67, and 0.35, respectively (p = 0.003). Pulse ratios at the
   time of follow-up (within 30 days) were 0.17, 0.22, and 0.11,
   respectively (p = 0.44). Nine of 51 (17.6\%) patients had a reduction of
   pulse ratio of less than 30\% after endograft implantation. Five of
   those 9 patients (55.5\%) had the Talent endograft, although there was
   no angiographic evidence of endoleak.
   Conclusions The Talent graft has significantly higher pulse ratios
   following endograft implantation despite having no angiographic evidence
   of endoleak when compared to the Zenith and Excluder grafts. However,
   the pulse ratios decreased to levels similar to Zenith and Excluder
   within 30 days of endograft implantation. This suggests that the Talent
   endograft may have increased porosity initially. If pulse ratios do not
   appropriately decrease immediately after device implantation, further
   angiographic imaging may not be necessary if no obvious endoleak is
   seen.}},

Abstract = {{A hypercomplex representation of DNA is proposed to facilitate comparing

   been proposed to accommodate the hypercomplex number representation of
   DNA and integrated with dynamic programming alignment method. By using
   hypercomplex cross-correlation, the match and mismatch alignment
   information between two aligned DNA sequences are separately stored in
   the resultant real part and imaginary parts respectively. The mismatch

Abstract = {{This paper presents a semi-analytical approach for the geometrically
   nonlinear analysis of skew and trapezoidal plates subjected to
   out-of-plane loads. The thin elastic plate theory with nonlinear von
   Karman strains is used for the nonlinear large deflection analysis of
   the plate. The solution of the governing nonlinear partial differential
   equations with variable coefficients is reduced to an iterative solution
   of nonlinear ordinary differential equations using the multi-term
   extended Kantorovich method. The geometry of the trapezoidal plate is
   mapped into a rectangular computational domain. Parallelogram (skew)
   plates are considered as a particular case of the general trapezoidal
   ones. The capabilities and convergence of the method are numerically
   examined through comparison with other semi-analytical and numerical
   methods and with finite element analyses. The applicability of the
   approach to the nonlinear large deflection analysis of skew and
   trapezoidal plates is demonstrated through various numerical examples.
   The numerical study focuses on combinations of geometry, loading and
   boundary conditions that are beyond the applicability of other
   semi-analytical methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{ECF-class transporters comprise abundant importers for micronutrients
   such as vitamins and transition-metal ions, and for intermediates of
   salvage pathways in bacteria and archaea. They are composed of ABC
   ATPases (A units), a conserved transmembrane protein (T unit) and a
   substrate-specific transmembrane protein (S unit or core transporter).
   Here we analyzed the function of an ECF-type Co2+ transporter (CbiMNQO)
   and, in particular, the derived bipartite S unit CbiMN. CbiMN was
   characterized as the minimal unit that functions as a Co2+ transporter.
   Neither the solitary CbiM nor a tripartite CbiMQO complex was active,
   indicating an essential role for CbiN. CbiN was loosely bound in CbiMNQO
   and CbiMN complexes, and did not copurify with its partners. Generating
   a contiguous reading frame resulted in a Cbi (MN) fusion protein that
   displayed Co2+-transport activity and interacted with CbiQO in vivo.
   Sixteen variants of Cbi(MN) with modifications in the strongly conserved
   N-terminal stretch of ten amino-acid residues were constructed and
   analyzed for transport activity. The results indicate that the length
   and sequence of this region are critical for functioning of the core
   transporter. Specifically, they point to essential roles of His, and the
   distance of His, to the amino group of the peptide chain in metal
   recognition. (C) 2010 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) deficiency is a rare neurometabolic disorder,
   characterized by neurological impairment and refractive seizures, due to
   toxic accumulation of sulfite in the brain. Earlier it was suggested
   that in Moco-deficient humans maternal clearance of neurotoxic
   metabolites prevents prenatal brain damage. However, limited data are
   available about the time profile in which neurophysiologic deterioration
   occurs after birth. The amplitude-integrated electroencephalography
   (aEEG) is a bedside method in neonates to monitor cerebral recovery
   after hypoxic-ischemic insults, detect epileptic activity, and evaluate
   antiepileptic drug treatment. We describe a chronological series of
   changes in aEEG tracings in a neonate with Moco deficiency. He presented
   with myoclonic spasms and hypertonicity a few hours after birth,
   however, the aEEG pattern was still normal. Within 2 days, the aEEG
   rapidly changed into a burst suppression pattern with repetitive
   seizures. After antiepileptic treatment, the aEEG remained abnormal. In
   this patient, the normal aEEG pattern at birth may have been due to
   maternal clearance of sulfite in utero. After birth, accumulation of
   sulfite causes progressive brain damage, reflected by the progressive
   depression of the aEEG tracings. This is in agreement with the results
   from a Moco-deficient mouse model, suggesting that maternal sulfite
   clearance suppresses prenatal brain damage. To our knowledge, this is
   the first case report describing the chronological changes in the aEEG
   pattern in a Moco-deficient patient. Insight into the time profile in
   which neurologic deterioration in Moco-deficient humans occurs is
   essential, especially when potential treatment strategies are being
   evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{A high-performance W/B4C multilayer mirror with 80 periods of nominally
   1.37 nm was measured by grazing-incidence small-angle X ray scattering
   (GISAXS) in order to analyse the lateral and vertical correlations of
   the interface roughness within the framework of a scaling concept of
   multilayer growth. A dynamic growth exponent z = 2.19 (7) was derived,
   which is close to the value predicted by the Edwards-Wilkinson growth
   model. The effective number of correlated periods indicates a partial
   replication of the low interface roughness frequencies. A simulation of
   the GISAXS pattern based on the Born approximation suggests a zero Hurst
   fractal parameter H and a logarithmic type of autocorrelation function.
   The as-deposited mirror layers are amorphous and exhibit excellent
   thermal stability up to 1248 K in a 120 s rapid thermal vacuum annealing
   process. At higher temperatures, the B4C layers decompose and poorly
   developed crystallites of a boron-rich W-B hexagonal phase are formed,
   and yet multilayer collapse is not complete even at 1273 K. Ozone
   treatment for 3000 s in a reactor with an ozone concentration of 150 mg
   m-3 results in the formation of an oxidized near-surface region of a
   thickness approaching similar to 10\% of the total multilayer thickness,
   with a tendency to saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Reports of therapy-related adverse events suggest an elevated
   rate of malignancy in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)
   treated with biologic therapies. However, the scarcity of data on the
   underlying risk of malignancy in JIA hampers interpretation of these
   signals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the risk of
   cancer in patients with JIA as compared with that in the general
   population.
   Methods. Through linkage with a national database, the Swedish Patient
   Register (comprising inpatient discharges in 1969-2007 and specialist
   outpatient visits in 2001-2007 in Sweden), a national JIA cohort (n =
   9,027) was identified, and each JIA case was matched with 5 general
   population comparators. Using data from the Swedish Cancer, Census,
   Death, and Biologics Registers, the occurrence of cancer, vital status,
   and start of a biologic therapy were identified. The relative risk (RR)
   of first occurrence of a primary cancer in patients who had not been
   treated with biologics (biologics-naive patients with JIA) was estimated
   using Poisson regression, stratified a priori by year of earliest
   identification of JIA (before 1987 versus 1987 and thereafter). In
   sensitivity analyses, the data were followed up to 1999, when biologics
   first became available.
   Results. In this biologics-naive JIA cohort, 60 malignancies were
   observed during 131,144 person-years of followup, compared with 266
   cancers observed during 661,758 person-years in the general population
   comparator (0.46 cases/1,000 person-years versus 0.40 cases/1,000
   person-years; RR 1.1, 95\% confidence interval {[} 95\% CI] 0.9-1.5).
   Patients with JIA identified before 1987 were not at increased risk of
   cancer, whereas JIA identified in 1987 and thereafter was significantly
   associated with incident lymphoproliferative malignancies (RR 4.2, 95\%
   CI 1.7-10.7) and cancers overall (RR 2.3, 95\% CI 1.2-4.4). Sensitivity
   analyses did not reveal any ready explanation for this heterogeneity.
   Conclusion. Although absolute risks were low, an elevated risk of
   malignancy was observed among biologics-naive patients in whom the
   diagnosis of JIA was made in the past 20 years, which may have
   implications for the interpretation of cancer signals in patients with
   JIA treated with newer therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Desmoglem 1 (Dsg1) is a desmosomal cadherin that is essential to
   epidermal integrity In the blistering diseases bullous impetigo and
   staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome pathogenesis depends on cleavage of
   Dsg1 by a bacterial protease exfoliative toxin A which removes residues
   1 to 381 of the Dsg1 ectodomain However the cellular responses to Dsg1
   cleavage that precipitate keratinocyte separation to induce blister
   formation are unknown Here we show that ectodomain deleted Dsg1 (Delta
   381 Dsg1) mimics the toxin cleaved cadherin disrupts desmosomes and
   reduces the mechanical integrity of keratinocyte sheets In addition we
   demonstrate that truncated Dsg1 remains associated with its catenin
   partner plakoglobin and causes a reduction in the levels of endogenous
   desmosomal cadherins in a dose de pendent manner leading us to
   hypothesize that plakoglobin sequestration by truncated Dsg1
   destabilizes other cadherins Accordingly a triple point mutant of the
   ectodomain deleted cadherin which is uncoupled from plakoglobin does not
   impair adhesion indicating that this interaction is essential to the
   pathogenic potential of truncated Dsg1 Moreover we demonstrate that
   increasing plakoglobin levels res cues cadherin expression desmosome
   organization and functional adhesion m cells expressing Delta 381 Dsg1
   or treated with exfoliative toxin A Finally we report that histone
   deacetylase Inhibition up regulates desmosomal cadherins and prevents
   the loss of adhesion induced by Dsg1 truncation These findings further
   our understanding of the mechanism of exfoliative toxin induced
   pathology and suggest novel strategies to suppress blistering in bulbous

Abstract = {{In this paper, we construct trigonometric functions in the form of a sum
   T (p) (h, k) which is referred to as a Dedekind-type DC-(Dahee and
   Changhee) sum. We establish analytic properties of this sum, find its
   trigonometric representations, and prove a reciprocity theorem for these
   sums. Furthermore, we obtain relationships between the Clausen
   functions, polylogarithm function, Hurwitz zeta function, generalized
   Lambert series (G-series), Hardy-Berndt sums, and the sum T (p) (h, k).
   We also give some applications related to these sums and functions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses a directional distance function and a single truncated
   bootstrap approach to investigate inefficiency of lowland farming
   systems in the Benin Republic First, we employed a dual approach to
   estimate and decompose short-run profit inefficiency of each farming
   system into pure technical, allocative and scale inefficiency and also
   into input and output inefficiency Second, an econometric analysis of
   factors affecting the inefficiency was generated using a single
   truncated bootstrap procedure to improve inefficiency analysis
   statistically and obtain consistent estimates In the short run, scale,
   allocative and output inefficiency were found to be the main sources of
   inefficiency Based on inefficiency results, the inefficiency of lowland
   farming systems is the most diverse Compared to a vegetable farming
   system, technical inefficiency is significantly higher if farmers switch
   to a rice farming system Scale, allocative, output, and input
   inefficiency are significantly lower with an integrated rice-vegetable
   farming system and there was high prevalence of increasing returns to
   scale in the integrated rice-vegetable farming system Water control and
   lowland farming systems are complements and play a significant role in
   the level of inefficiency Input inefficiency shows the difficulty that
   the producers face in adjusting the quality and quantity of seeds and
   fertilizers The paper provides empirical support for efforts to promote
   an integrated rice-vegetable farming system in West Africa lowlands to
   increase food security}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, open source software (OSS) development has
   gained a huge popularity and has attracted a large variety of
   developers. According to software engineering folklore, the architecture
   and the organization of software depend on the communication patterns of
   the contributors. Communication patterns among developers influence
   knowledge sharing among them. Unlike in a formal organization, the
   communication network structures in an OSS project evolve unrestricted
   and unplanned. We develop a non-cooperative game-theoretic model to
   investigate the network formation in an OSS team and to characterize the
   stable and efficient structures. Developer heterogeneity in the network
   is incorporated based on their informative value. We find that there may
   exist several stable structures that are inefficient and there may not
   always exist a stable structure that is efficient. The tension between
   the stability and efficiency of structures results from developers
   acting in their self-interest rather than the group interest. Whenever
   there is such tension, the stable structure is either underconnected
   across types or overconnected within type of developers from an
   efficiency perspective. We further discuss how an administrator can help
   evolve a stable network into an efficient one. Empirically, we use the
   latent class model and analyze two real-world OSS projects hosted at
   Source Forge. For each project, different types of developers and a
   stable structure are identified, which fits well with the predictions of
   our model. Overall, our study sheds light on how developer abilities and
   incentives affect communication network formation in OSS projects.}},

Abstract = {{Human lingual mucosa reveals a highly differentiated papillary
   organization. The fungiform papillae are grouped as gustatory papillae
   as they contain taste buds and function as sensory end organs. Taste
   pores, the surface openings of the taste buds, play important roles both
   in preneural and neural phases of taste perception by receiving external
   chemical stimuli and its transduction. Scanning electron microscopy
   {[}SEM] of the dorsal lingual surface was used to study the morphology
   and ultrastructure of the fungiform papillae in human. The lingual
   samples were prepared from 20 unfixed cadavers at Burdwan Medical
   College and after proper processing they were examined under SEM at the
   University of Burdwan. The results demonstrated that these gustatory
   structures were dome shaped with round base and their diameters were
   approximately 300 - 800 mu m. They were surrounded by shallow circular
   furrow with small mucosal pad encircling the furrow. The study verified
   that the covering epithelium of the fungiform papillae is stratified
   squamous type and frequent desquamation of lining cells was also
   noticed. Elevated cell margin with distinct intercellular borders were
   evident in the lining epithelium. Single or multiple circular taste bud
   pores opened on the upper surface of some of these papillae while in
   others taste pores were absent. Taste bud pores had diameter of about
   3-6 mu m. On higher magnification SEM images established the presence of
   lattice patterned microridges over the epithelial cell surfaces. Within
   these microridges nnicrogrooves or mucous pits were observed. These
   observations were related with specific mechanical and gustatory roles.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic susceptibility (chi, mass specific) is useful for easy indirect
   estimation of other soil properties at a low cost. The aim of this study
   was to assess the use of chi as measured with an analytical balance for
   predicting properties with a substantial influence on the management of
   Typic Haplustalfs in southern Brazil. To achieve this 48 topsoil samples
   were taken at the intersection points in a rectangular grid of 20 m x 20
   m cells, with 38 of these used for calibration and 10 for validation in
   regression analyses. The obtained chi values were slightly higher than,
   and highly correlated (r = 0.970; P < 0.001) with those measured with a
   susceptibility meter. Highly significant (P < 0.001) correlations were
   also found between chi and other soil properties relevant to soil
   classification and management such as clay content (r = 0.68), cation
   exchange capacity (r = 0.62), P sorption capacity (r = 0.76) and
   haematite content (r = 0.82). Results from a principal component
   analysis of eight properties important for soil classification explained
   11\% of the variance in the data set. The good predictive ability of chi
   was consistent with current knowledge on the formation pathways for
   pedogenic ferrimagnets. In summary, chi, which can be readily measured
   with an analytical balance, has the potential for quantifying soil
   attributes and may therefore be used in pedotransfer functions.}},

Abstract = {{Species identification within the genus Globodera is based on the
   morphological and morphometrical characters of the cysts and second
   stage juveniles, and these are included in the majority of
   identification keys. Morphometrical methods are fast and can be applied
   to most of samples but they demand a trained and experienced specialist.
   Furthermore, some morphometrical characters may overlap between
   populations and between species, leading to inaccurate identification.
   To confirm and complement the morphometrical identification of Globodera
   species molecular methods have been developed. Sequences of the internal
   transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2 of the rDNA gene cluster proved
   to be useful for identifying nematode species identification. A PCR-RFLP
   molecular method was used to identify Globodera rostochiensis, G.
   pallida, G. tabacum and G. achilleae. Globodera rostochiensis, G.
   pallida, G. tabacum and G. achilleae can be distinguished with PCR-RFLP
   analysis of the rDNA ITS fragment using five restriction enzymes. The
   RFLP patterns of G. rostochiensis, G. tabacum and G. achilleae were
   species-specific, while those of G. pallida varied. South American
   populations of G. pallida differed from other populations as their RFLP
   patterns were demonstrated to be distinct by in silico restriction of
   the ITS sequences deposited at NCBI.}},

Abstract = {{Polynomial equation systems arising from real applications often have
   associated combinatorial information, expressible as graphs and
   underlying matroids. To simplify the system and improve its numerical
   robustness before attempting to solve it with numeric-algebraic
   techniques, solvers can employ graph algorithms to extract substructures
   satisfying or optimizing various combinatorial properties. When there
   are underlying matroids, these algorithms can be greedy and efficient.
   In practice, correct and effective merging of the outputs of different
   graph algorithms to simultaneously satisfy their goals is a key
   challenge.
   This paper merges and improves two highly effective but separate
   graph-based algorithms that preprocess systems for resolving the
   relative position and orientation of a collection of incident rigid
   bodies. Such collections naturally arise in many situations, for example
   in the recombination of decomposed large geometric constraint systems.
   Each algorithm selects a subset of incidences, one to optimize algebraic
   complexity of a parametrized system, the other to obtain a well-formed
   system that is robust against numerical errors. Both algorithms are
   greedy and can be proven correct by revealing underlying matroids. The
   challenge is that the output of the first algorithm is not guaranteed to
   be extensible to a well-formed system, while the output of the second
   may not have optimal algebraic complexity. Here we show how to reconcile
   the two algorithms by revealing well-behaved maps between the associated
   matroids.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that the majority of the catalytic electro-oxidation of
   small organic molecules presents oscillatory kinetics under certain
   conditions, there are few systematic studies concerning the influence of
   experimental parameters on the oscillatory dynamics. Of the studies
   available, most are devoted to C1 molecules and just some scattered data
   are available for C2 molecules. We present in this work a comprehensive
   study of the electro-oxidation of ethylene glycol on polycrystalline
   platinum surfaces and in alkaline media. The system was studied by means
   of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and
   chronoamperometry, and the impact of parameters such as applied current,
   ethylene glycol concentration, and temperature were investigated. As in
   the case of other parent systems, the instabilities in this system were
   associated with a hidden negative differential resistance, as identified
   by impedance data. Very rich and robust dynamics were observed,
   including the presence of harmonic and mixed mode oscillations and
   chaotic states, in some parameter region. Oscillation frequencies of
   about 16 Hz characterized the fastest oscillations ever reported for the
   electro-oxidation of small organic molecules. Those high frequencies
   were strongly influenced by the electrolyte pH and far less affected by
   the EG concentration. The system was regularly dependent on temperature
   under voltammetric conditions but rather independent within the
   oscillatory regime.}},

Title = {{Effects of Silicone Hydrogel Contact Lens Wear on Ocular Surface
   Sensitivity to Tactile, Pneumatic Mechanical, and Chemical Stimulation}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To determine the effects of silicone hydrogel lens wear and
   lens-solution interactions on ocular surface sensitivity.
   METHODS. Forty-eight adapted lens wearers completed the study, which
   comprised two phases. Phase 1 included habitual lens wear, no lens wear
   (7 +/- 3 days), and balafilcon A lenses (PV; PureVision; Bausch \& Lomb,
   Rochester, NY) with a hydrogen peroxide-based regimen for 2 weeks; phase
   2 included wear of PV with the use of a multipurpose solution containing
   either polyhexamethylene-biguanide (PHMB) or Polyquad/Aldox (Alcon
   Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX) preservative, each for 1 week, with a
   2-week washout period between solutions. Tactile and pneumatic
   (mechanical and chemical) stimuli were delivered, and thresholds were
   determined by Cochet-Bonnet (Luneau Ophthalmologie, Chartres, France)
   and Belmonte (Cooperative Research Centre for Eye Research and
   Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia) pneumatic esthesiometers,
   respectively. Corneal and conjunctival thresholds and staining scores
   were assessed at baseline, after 2 and 8 hours of lens wear on day 1 and
   at the end of each wearing cycle (2 hours).
   RESULTS. In phase 1, compared to the no-lens baseline, corneal tactile
   thresholds increased at the 1-day, 8-hour and the 2-week visits (P <
   0.05), whereas conjunctival mechanical thresholds decreased at the
   1-day, 2-hour and the 2-week visits (P < 0.05). In phase 2, the chemical
   thresholds were lower with PHMB-preserved solution compared with the
   Polyquad/Aldox system at the 1-day, 2-hour and the 1-week visits (P <
   0.05). Staining scores correlated inversely with conjunctival chemical
   thresholds (all P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS. Ocular surface sensitivity changed in adapted lens wearers,
   when lenses were refit after a no-lens interval and during lens wear
   with different care regimens. The corneal staining that was observed
   with certain lens-solution combinations was accompanied by sensory
   alteration of the ocular surface-that is, higher levels of staining
   correlated with increased conjunctival chemical sensitivity.

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the most widely used
   risk markers of cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. The
   contribution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to low-grade
   inflammation in diabetic patients and its significance for
   cardiovascular risk scoring remain unclear.
   OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship
   between HCV infection and CRP levels as one of the markers of
   cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS We compared patients with HCV infection and
   diabetes (n = 46) with HCV-negative type 1 (n = 56) or type 2 diabetic
   patients (n = 54), as well as HCV patients without diabetes (n = 54).
   RESULTS CRP levels in diabetic HCV patients were lower than in type 2
   diabetic patients (P <0.001), similar to those in the type 1 diabetic
   group (P = 0.747), and higher than in nondiabetic HCV subjects (P =
   0.002). The median values were 1.07, 2.58, 0.91, and 0.45 mg/l,
   respectively. White blood cell count in diabetic HCV subjects was lower
   than in those with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.029) and similar to that found
   in type 1 diabetic (P = 0.064) and nondiabetic HCV patients (P = 0.279).
   There was difference in erythrocyte sedimentation rate between diabetic
   and nondiabetic HCV groups (P = 0.025); the respective medians were 10
   and 5 mm/h.
   CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that HCV hepatitis may modulate
   chronic inflammatory state in diabetic patients. Moreover, these results
   suggest that screening for HCV should be considered prior to assessment
   of cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients, because the results may
   affect the cardiovascular risk scoring.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering aims to identify groups of similar objects. To evaluate the
   results of cluster algorithms, an investigator uses cluster-validity
   indices. While the theory of cluster validity is well established for
   vector object data, little effort has been made to extend it to
   relationship-based data. As such, this paper proposes a theory of
   reformulation for object-data validity indices so that they can be used
   to rank the results produced by the relational c-means clustering
   algorithms. More specifically, we create a class of relational validity
   indices, which is called dual-relational indices, that are guaranteed
   under certain, but easily met, constraints to produce the same results
   and, hence, the same cluster counts, as their object-data counterparts.}},

Title = {{Reasons for drop-out in rehabilitation treatment of native patients and

   medical file study}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL AND REHABILITATION MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{505-510}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim. Drop-out of rehabilitation treatment in non-native patients with
   chronic low back pain has been reported to be higher than in native
   Dutch patients. It was expected that drop-out in non-native patients
   would be due to different expectations on the content of rehabilitation
   treatment and due to language or communication problems. Aim of this
   study was to determine differences in reasons for drop-out between
   native patients and nonnative patients with chronic non-specific low
   back pain participating in a rehabilitation program.
   Methods. A retrospective study in medical files (N.=99) of patients who
   dropped out of treatment was performed in two rehabilitation centers and
   two rehabilitation departments of general hospitals. Patient files were
   checked for diagnosis, status of origin, gender, age and reason for
   drop-out. The differences in frequency in reasons for drop-out between
   native and non-native patients were tested by Chi-square tests.
   Results. Withdrawal due to different expectations on the content of
   rehabilitation treatment occurred significantly more frequently in
   non-native patients (P=0.035). Withdrawal due to refusal to participate
   (no further reason given) occurred more often (P=0.008) in native Dutch
   patients than in non-native patients. No significant differences between
   non-native patients and native Dutch patients were reported regarding
   withdrawal due to language or communication problems, and no show
   (patient did not show up at consultation sessions without informing
   about the reason and without making an appointment for a new
   consultation).
   Conclusion. The present study provided evidence that drop-out in
   non-native patients is often related to different expectations regarding
   the content of rehabilitation treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Antarctic soils are extremely cold, dry, and oligotrophic, yet harbour
   surprisingly high bacterial diversity. The severity of environmental
   conditions has constrained the development of multi-trophic communities,
   and species richness and distribution is thought to be driven primarily
   by abiotic factors. Sites in northern and southern Victoria Land were
   sampled for bacterial community structure and soil physicochemical
   properties in conjunction with the US and New Zealand Latitudinal
   Gradient Project. Bacterial community structure was determined using a
   high-resolution molecular fingerprinting method for 80 soil samples from
   Taylor Valley and Cape Hallett sites which are separated by five degrees
   of latitude and have distinct soil chemistry. Taylor Valley is part of
   the McMurdo Dry Valleys, while Cape Hallett is the site of a penguin
   rookery and contains ornithogenic soils. The influence of soil moisture,
   pH, conductivity, ammonia, nitrate, total nitrogen and organic carbon on
   community structure was revealed using Spearman rank correlation, Mantel
   test, and principal components analysis. High spatial variability was
   detected in bacterial communities and community structure was correlated
   with soil moisture and pH. Both unique and shared bacterial community
   members were detected at Taylor Valley and Cape Hallett despite the
   considerable distance between the sites.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of a spill of approximately 9800 L of diesel on a small
   stream and the River Ray (near Swindon, Wiltshire, UK) were examined
   using kick-net sampling of freshwater macroinvertebrate families at
   impacted and reference sites. Initial impacts (10 days after the spill)
   50 m downstream of the spill were severe, with only 9\% survival of
   individuals (excluding oligochaete worms) and 56\% survival of
   invertebrate families. The percentage survival of macroinvertebrates
   increased progressing downstream from the spill, with no detectable
   impacts beyond approximately 4 km downstream. The crustacean families
   Asellidae and Gammaridae were particularly sensitive to the diesel
   spill. The recovery of the macroinvertebrate community was assessed 13.5
   months after the spill. At this time, recovery was almost complete, with
   only minor impacts at the sites closest to the spill. The use of live
   laboratory sorting of samples from impacted sites provided essential
   information on the impacts of the diesel spill.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Although elevated urinary catecholamine levels have been
   reported in 90-95\% of patients with neuroblastoma, more recent studies
   of pediatric Horner syndrome caused by an underling neuroblastoma have
   reported normal values at presentation. The purpose of this
   population-based study is to report the percentage of cases of
   neuroblastoma with elevated urinary catecholamine levels at presentation
   and to suggest a recommended work-up for cases of idiopathic pediatric
   Horner syndrome.
   Methods The medical records of all pediatric (<19 years) residents of
   Olmsted County, Minnesota diagnosed with neuroblastoma from 1 January
   1969 through 31 December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed.
   Results A total of 14 patients <19 years of age were diagnosed with
   neuroblastoma as residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, during the
   40-year study period. A total of 10 (71\%) of the 14 cases manifested
   elevated urinary catecholamine metabolites at the initial presentation.
   Urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) levels were greater than twice the
   upper limit of normal in eight (57\%) of 14 cases, whereas homovanillic
   acid (HVA) levels were greater than two times the upper limit of normal
   in 10 (71\%) of the 14 cases. Three (75\%) of the four cases without
   significantly elevated urinary VMA or HVA levels were diagnosed with
   stage IV disease, whereas one (25\%) had stage II neuroblastoma.
   Conclusion Urinary catecholamine levels were significantly elevated at
   presentation in 10 (71\%) of the 14 neuroblastoma cases during the
   40-year study period, suggesting that greater emphasis be placed on
   performing a thorough physical examination and obtaining warranted
   imaging studies in cases of idiopathic pediatric Horner syndrome. Eye

Abstract = {{With increasing environmental consciousness and the establishment of
   environmental protection regulations, green product design not only
   plays a crucial role in a modern industry but is also becoming the main
   focus of the future market. In this paper, an innovative method is
   presented that uses the concepts of atomic theory to solve design
   modularization problems for green product design. With the developed
   method, products can be modularized based upon given green constraints,
   e.g., material compatibility, part recyclability, and part
   disassemblability. The developed method can help engineers effectively
   create green designs in the initial design stage, based on product
   lifecycle requirements. With green considerations incorporated into new
   modules, a new design can be created that improves upon an original
   design, with respect to environmental impacts. Product designers can use
   our method to compare differences between their original designs and the
   new green modules and then perform necessary design modifications. A
   table lamp and a motor are used as case study examples to show the
   effectiveness of the atomic-theory-based green product design method.

Abstract = {{A two-year-old Boerboel dog presented for a discolored left maxillary
   canine tooth. Dental radiographs revealed abnormally mineralized pulp
   within the discolored tooth. Similar radiographic findings were also
   seen in both maxillary third incisor teeth and in the remaining canine
   teeth to varying degrees. The discolored tooth was treated by surgical
   extraction and histopathology revealed abnormal dentin deposition within
   the canal indicative of dentin dysplasia. Although not previously
   documented in the dog, the pulpal changes in multiple teeth of the dog
   reported here were similar to those described for odontoblastic
   dysplasia in humans. This case report includes a review of developmental
   abnormalities of dentin in humans and pulpal response to inflammation
   and injury. J Vet Dent 27(4); 242 - 247, 2010}},

Title = {{Effects of transgenic rootstocks on growth and development of
   non-transgenic scion cultivars in apple}},
Journal = {{TRANSGENIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{933-948}},

Abstract = {{Although cultivation of genetic modified (GM) annual crops has been
   steadily increasing in the recent 10 years, the commercial cultivation
   of GM fruit tree is still very limited and reports of field trials on GM
   fruit trees are rare. This is probably because development and
   evaluation of GM fruit trees require a long period of time due to long
   life cycles of trees. In this study, we report results from a field
   trial on three rolB transgenic dwarfing apple rootstocks of M26 and M9
   together with non-transgenic controls grafted with five non-transgenic
   scion cultivars. We intended to investigate the effects of transgenic
   rootstock on non-transgenic scion cultivars under natural conditions as
   well as to evaluate the potential value of using the rolB gene to modify
   difficult-to-root rootstocks of fruit trees. The results showed that all
   rolB transgenic rootstocks significantly reduced vegetative growth
   including tree height regardless of scion cultivar, compared with the
   non-transgenic rootstocks. Flowering and fruiting were also decreased
   for cultivars grown on the transgenic rootstocks in most cases, but the
   fruit quality was not clearly affected by the transgenic rootstocks.
   Cutting experiment and RTPCR analysis showed that the rolB gene was
   stably expressed under field conditions. PCR and RT-PCR analyses
   displayed that the rolB gene or its mRNA were not detectable in the
   scion cultivars, indicating no translocation of the transgene or its
   mRNA from rootstock to scion. Our results suggest that rolB modified
   rootstocks should be used in combination with vigorous scion cultivars
   in order to obtain sufficient vegetative growth and good yield.
   Alternatively, the rolB gene could be used to dwarf vigorous rootstocks
   of fruit trees or produce bonzai plants as it can significantly reduce
   the vegetative growth of plants.}},

Abstract = {{The pozzolanic reaction of a natural zeolite-rich tuff and portlandite
   was investigated by means of IR spectroscopy. The zeolite tuff consisted
   mainly of Ca-rich clinoptilolite. A detailed analysis of the changes in
   the bonding environment during reaction presented by the IR spectra
   showed that the vibrations assigned to the reactant phases were
   progressively consumed and implied that Si-rich environments were
   preferentially depleted. The contemporaneous appearance and rise of
   vibration bands characteristic for calcium-silicate-hydrates and
   calcium-aluminate-hydrates demonstrated the formation of reaction
   products.
   Changes in bonding environment were spatially visualized by means of
   synchrotron-IR microspectroscopy. Promising results showed the
   distribution of reactants and reaction products and allowed to analyze
   spatial trends in IR-vibration frequencies. A shift in
   calcium-silicate-hydrate mean peak position from 972 to 968 cm(-1)
   indicated a decrease in silicate chain length with increasing distance
   from the clinoptilolite-matrix interface.}},

Abstract = {{Premise: Studies of hybridizing species are facilitated by the
   availability of species-specific molecular markers for identifying
   early-and later-generation hybrids. Cattails are a dominant feature of
   wetland communities, and a better understanding of the prevalence of
   hybrids is needed to assess the ecological and evolutionary effects of
   hybridization. Hybridization between Typha angustifolia and T. latifolia
   produce long-lived clones, known as Typha x glauca, which are considered
   to be invasive. Although morphological variation in cattails makes it
   difficult to recognize early-and later-generation hybrids, several
   dominant, species-specific RAPD markers are available. Our goal was to
   find codominant, species-specific markers with greater polymorphism than
   RAPDs, to identify later-generation hybrids more efficiently.
   Methods: We screened nine SSR (simple sequence repeat) loci that were
   described from populations in Ukraine, and we surveyed 31 cattail
   populations from the upper Midwest and eastern USA.
   Key results: Seven SSR loci distinguished the parent taxa and were
   consistent with known species-specific RAPD markers, allowing easier
   detection of backcrossing. We used linear discriminant analysis to show
   that F 1 hybrid phenotypes were intermediate between the parent taxa,
   while those of backcrossed plants overlapped with the hybrids and their
   parents. Log(leaf length/leaf width), spike gap length, spike length,
   and stem diameter explained much of the variation among groups.
   Conclusions: We provide the first documentation of backcrossed plants in
   hybridizing cattail populations in Michigan. The diagnostic SSR loci we
   identified should be extremely useful for examining the evolutionary and
   ecology interactions of hybridizing cattails in North America.}},

   modified versions obtained by the elimination of aftershocks and
   clusters, as well as nonoverlapping time series were used to study the
   stability of the models. The forward-prediction testing showed that in
   the models with weekly averaged initial data, periods of increased and
   reduced seismic activity lasting for several weeks are predicted with
   high confidence on an interval of up to 1.8\% of the education period.

Abstract = {{We present extensive radio and X-ray observations of the nearby Type Ic
   SN 2007gr in NGC 1058 obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the
   Chandra X-ray Observatory and spanning 5 to 150 days after explosion.
   Through our detailed modeling of these data, we estimate the properties
   of the blast wave and the circumstellar environment. We find evidence
   for a freely expanding and non-relativistic explosion with an average
   blast wave velocity, (v) over bar approximate to 0.2c, and a total
   internal energy for the radio emitting material of E approximate to 2 x
   10(46) erg assuming equipartition of energy between electrons and
   magnetic fields (is an element of(e) = is an element of(B) = 0.1). The
   temporal and spectral evolution of the radio emission points to a
   stellar wind-blown environment shaped by a steady progenitor mass loss
   rate of over dot (M) over dot approximate to 6x10(-7)M(circle dot)
   yr(-1) (wind velocity, v(w) = 10(3) km s(-1)). These parameters are
   fully consistent with those inferred for other SNe Ibc and are in line
   with the expectations for an ordinary, homologous SN explosion. Our
   results are at odds with those of Paragi et al. who recently reported
   evidence for a relativistic blast wave in SN 2007gr based on their claim
   that the radio emission was resolved away in a low signal-to-noise Very
   Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observation. Here we show that the
   exotic physical scenarios required to explain the claimed relativistic
   velocity-extreme departures from equipartition and/or a highly
   collimated outflow-are excluded by our detailed VLA radio observations.
   Moreover, we present an independent analysis of the VLBI data and
   propose that a modest loss of phase coherence provides a more natural
   explanation for the apparent flux density loss which is evident on both
   short and long baselines. We conclude that SN 2007gr is an ordinary Type
   Ibc supernova.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate how a motivational interviewing (MI) training
   course for child healthcare nurses in Sweden affected their work with
   children's weight issues and their attitudes to MI.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey, descriptive design.
   Setting: Nurses were recruited from 33 different child healthcare
   centres in Ostergotland, Sweden.
   Method: Seventy-six nurses who had participated in an MI training course
   (held in 2008) were approached one year later to answer a questionnaire
   by telephone. Most questions concerned the respondents' routine use of
   MI in clinical practice and their attitudes towards MI as a method.
   Results: The response rate was 82 per cent. Nearly half of the nurses
   had changed the content and structure of their discussions regarding
   weight issues. Three-quarters of the nurses stated that they had
   sufficient time to use MI and that they had support from leadership and
   colleagues to use MI in their routine practice. The nurses' attitudes to
   MI were positive, especially their perception that MI was consistent
   with their values and was better than traditional advice-giving
   approaches. Most MI techniques were found to be simple to use: 78 per
   cent found it very or quite simple to listen actively, 63 per cent
   believed it was very or quite simple to summarize parents' opinions, 63
   per cent found it very or quite simple to pay attention to parents'
   change talk, and 60 per cent said that it was very or quite simple to
   ask permission before providing information.
   Conclusion: MI training can have a substantial effect on child
   healthcare nurses' clinical work on paediatric weight issues.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Effective targeting and killing of intraperitoneally disseminated
   micrometastases remains a challenge.
   Objective/Methods: In this work, we evaluated the potential of
   antibody-labeled PEGylated large liposomes as vehicles for direct
   intraperitoneal (i.p.) drug delivery with the aim to enhance the
   tumor-to-normal organ ratio and to improve the bioexposure of cancer
   cells to the delivered therapeutics while shifting the toxicities toward
   the spleen. These targeted liposomes are designed to combine: (1)
   specific targeting to and internalization by cancer cells mediated by
   liposome-conjugated tumor-specific antibodies, (2) slow clearance from
   the peritoneal cavity, and (3) shift of normal organ toxicities from the
   liver to the spleen due to their relatively large size.
   Results: Conjugation of anti-HER2/neu antibodies to the surface of large
   (approximately 600 nm in diameter) PEGylated liposomes results in fast,
   specific binding of targeted liposomes to cancer cells in vitro,
   followed by considerable cellular internalization. In vivo, after i.p.
   administration, these liposomes exhibit fast, specific binding to i.p.
   cancerous tumors. Large liposomes are slowly cleared from the peritoneal
   cavity, and they exhibit increased uptake by the spleen relative to the
   liver, while targeted large liposomes demonstrate specific tumor uptake
   at early times. Although tissue and tumor uptake are greater for
   cationic liposomes, the tumor-to-liver and spleen-to-liver ratios are
   similar for both membrane compositions, suggesting a primary role for
   the liposome's size, compared to the liposome's surface charge.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that large targeted
   liposomes administered i.p. could be a potent drug-delivery strategy for
   locoregional therapy of i.p. micrometastatic tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is a member of the GST superfamily
   which has well-established multiple roles in various infectious and
   parasitic diseases The genetic regulation of GSTP1 has been extensively
   studied Thus its biological significance and disease association
   prompted us to investigate the role of GSTP1 polymorphisms in
   Plasmodium-mediated pathogenesis in Infected humans The genotypic
   distribution of IIe105Val in Plasmodium vivax infection was observed to
   be significant and strongly associated (OR = 4 5) with the progression
   of pathology whereas in P falciparum infection no significant
   association was observed compared to healthy subjects Interestingly we
   observed significant elevation of GST in vivax infection with both
   genotypes IIe105Val and Va1105Val compared to healthy subjects whereas
   in P falciparum infection we found marginally elevated GST levels of
   mutated genotypes but significantly depleted compared to healthy
   subjects Further during vivax and falciparum infection overall
   significant elevations of glutathione glutathione peroxidase and GST
   levels were observed Expression of both GSTP1 mRNA and protein was
   significantly upregulated during vivax infection compared to falciparum
   infection and both were significantly upregulated compared to the levels
   in healthy subjects as well These studies suggest that GSTP1
   polymolphism is involved in the pathogenesis of malaria and it may serve
   as a valuable molecular marker possessing a promising rationale for

Abstract = {{We show that suprathermal particles, termed pick-up ions (PUIs), might
   reduce the postshock temperature of the fast wind and jets in some
   planetary nebulae (PNs) and in symbiotic systems. The goal is to explain
   the finding that the temperature of the ``hot bubble{''} formed by the
   postshock gas in some PNs and symbiotic nebulae is lower, sometimes by
   more than an order of magnitude, than the value expected from simple
   hydrodynamical calculations. Although various explanations have been
   proposed, there is as yet no preferred solution for this ``low
   temperature problem.{''} PUIs have been invoked to explain the low
   temperature behind the termination shock of the solar wind. While in the
   case of the solar wind the neutral atoms that turn into PUIs penetrate
   the preshock solar wind region from the interstellar medium, in PNs the
   PUI source is more likely slowly moving clumps embedded in the fast wind
   or jets. These clumps are formed by instabilities or from backflowing
   cold gas. Our estimates indicate that in young PNs these PUIs will
   thermalize before leaving the system. Only in older PNs whose sizes
   exceed similar to 5000 AU and for which the fast wind mass loss rate is
   M-w less than or similar to 10(-7) M-circle dot yr(-1) do we expect the
   PUIs to be an efficient carrier of energy out of the postshock region
   (the hot bubble).}},

Abstract = {{Background Knowledge of skill-related risk factors for injury in
   football is limited.
   Objective To investigate whether there is an association between
   football skills and risk of injury in football. Study Design Prospective
   cohort study of the incidence of injuries and a retrospective evaluation
   of the players' skill-level.
   Methods Exposure and injuries were registered prospectively in 82 of 125
   football teams (1665 of 2540 female Norwegian amateur players aged 13-17
   years) throughout one football season (March-October 2007). A
   standardised questionnaire designed to assess the football skills of
   each player was completed by the coaches after the season.
   Results Across the different skill attributes, the injury incidence in
   the high-skilled players varied from 4.4 to 4.9 injuries per 1000 player
   hours, compared to 2.8 to 4.0 injuries per 1000 player hours in the
   low-skilled players. Players skilled at ball receiving, passing and
   shooting, heading, tackling, decision-making when in ball possession or
   in defence and physically strong players were at significantly greater
   risk of sustaining any injury, an acute injury and a contact injury than
   their less skilled teammates (rate ratio: 1.50-3.19, all p<0.05).
   Conclusions Players with high levels of football skill were at greater
   risk of sustaining injuries than their less skilled teammates.}},

Abstract = {{A ninth-subharmonic injection-locking scheme is proposed for local
   oscillator (LO) phase-shifting-based phased-array architectures
   operating in the ISM band at 24 GHz. The presented architecture employs
   a phase-shifter at the ninth subharmonic, a high-speed regenerative
   comparator, and a negative-g(m) oscillator to synthesize multiple phases
   of ninth-harmonic LO signals from a 2.41-GHz reference at the
   destination and in close proximity to the RF/millimeter-wave front-end
   mixers with first LO at 21.69 GHz. A digital phase-shift calibration
   technique is discussed. The reported LO phase-shifting and synthesis
   scheme is implemented in IBM's 130-nm CMOS technology and consumes a
   total of 32 mA per LO element from a 1.2-V supply. The injection-locked
   oscillators have a phase-noise performance of -107.17 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz
   offset from 21.51 GHz. The maximum phase-shift error at 21.69 GHz is
   9.86 degrees and 2.1 degrees before and after calibration, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study of oxidation reactions of bilirubin and its complex
   with albumin was carried out in aqueous solutions under the action of
   hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen at different pH values. Free
   radical oxidation of the pigment in both free and bound forms at pH 7.4
   was shown not to lead to the formation of biliverdin, but to be
   associated with the decomposition of the tetrapyrrole chromophore into
   monopyrrolic products. The effective and true rate constants of the
   reactions under study were determined. It was assumed that one possible
   mechanism of the oxidation reaction is associated with the interaction
   of peroxyl radicals and protons of the NH groups of bilirubin molecules
   at the limiting stage with the formation of a highly reactive radical
   intermediate. The binding of bilirubin with albumin was found to result
   in a considerable reduction in the rate of the oxidation reaction
   associated with the kinetic manifestation of the protein protection
   effect. It was found that the autoxidation of bilirubin by molecular
   oxygen with the formation of biliverdin at the intermediate stage can be
   observed with an increase in the pH of solutions.}},

   (12-1,080) days, 11 cases (7.4/100 cycles) experienced failure of SAP,
   including 5 cases during allo-SCT and 6 cases during chemotherapy,
   corresponding to cumulative incidence at 24.5\%. Multivariate logistic
   regression revealed two risk factors for failure of SAP: use of high

   duration of neutropenia a parts per thousand yen14 days (OR 7.47, 95\%

Title = {{Empirical test of an explanatory theory of postpartum fatigue in Korea}},

Abstract = {{P>Aim.
   This paper is a report of a study designed to test an explanatory theory
   of postpartum fatigue.
   Background.
   Postpartum fatigue is influenced by various factors and affects a
   mother's performance. A full understanding of postpartum fatigue is very
   important for developing effective nursing strategies to reduce
   postpartum fatigue and enhance mothers' performance.
   Methods.
   Healthy postpartum women were recruited from five medical centers and
   one midwifery office in urban area in Korea (n = 291) by convenience
   sampling. Data were collected at 4- to 8-week follow-up visits after
   childbirth in 2006, using a self-report questionnaire. The proposed
   fatigue theory incorporated postpartum fatigue, postpartum depression,
   sleep quality, childcare stress, unsatisfactory feeding, social support,
   infant difficulty and satisfaction with Sanhujori, the Korean
   traditional postpartum care provided for 3 weeks following delivery by
   non-professional caregivers. Structural equation modelling was used to
   test the explanatory theory of postpartum fatigue.
   Results.
   The modified fatigue theory showed good fit and high compatibility with
   the empirical data. In the final explanatory theory, postpartum
   depression and sleep quality directly affected postpartum fatigue, while
   childcare stress and the cultural phenomenon of Sanhujori had indirect
   effects on postpartum fatigue, via postpartum depression and sleep
   quality respectively.
   Conclusion.
   These findings suggest the potential role of comprehensive nursing
   focused on decreasing postpartum depression and improving sleep quality
   as a way to decrease postpartum fatigue. Also, nursing strategies for
   decreasing childcare stress and enhancing Sanhujori satisfaction may be
   helpful in reducing postpartum fatigue in Korean mothers.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing prevalence of obesity requires particularly primary care
   providers to take action. The aim of this study was to analyze general
   practitioners (GPs) encounters with overweight and obese patients in
   primary care to test the hypothesis that patients with a BMI >= 30
   kg/m(2) would have longer consultations focusing on lifestyle-related
   issues like nutrition and physical activity than those with a BMI < 30
   kg/m(2).
   Cross sectional comparison of audiotaped encounters of patients with a
   BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) and those with a BMI < 30 kg/m(2).
   Twelve GP surgeries in Berlin, Germany.
   Fifty patients who agreed to have preventive check-up encounters
   audiotaped.
   Based on the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) we assessed
   duration of encounter and the prevalence of GP statements regarding
   cardiovascular risks, nutrition and physical activity.
   An increased BMI was found to be a predictor for the length of
   encounters (P = 0.01), whereas the content of talks was mainly
   determined by the individual of GP and sex of the GP. Statements
   regarding cardiovascular risks were most frequent, followed by those
   regarding nutrition and physical activity. In this study the assessed
   physiological parameters were not associated with the specific contents

Abstract = {{The tube-dwelling polychaete fauna from a late early Campanian rocky
   shore at Ivo Klack, southern Sweden, comprises 10 genera and 17 species,
   plus eight unidentified taxa. Spirorbins predominated on the shore and
   are considered opportunistic forms, well adapted to a wide range of
   environmental conditions. Factors controlling the settlement of
   polychaete larvae on different kinds of hard substrate are water energy,
   competition for space, and substrate size and stability. Four different
   kinds of hard substrate, a large gneiss boulder, an oyster valve, a
   pectinid valve, and a bone fragment are mapped in order to document
   species composition, density, orientation and distribution of encrusting
   serpulids and sabellids. The location of tubes appears to be important
   because different species chose different positions on different
   substrates. Orientation of tube apertures, however, is random on all
   kinds of substrate probably reflecting that food was not a limiting
   factor. Very large serpulids were confined to a life encrusting
   boulders, which provided the only substrate which was sufficiently large
   and stable. Smaller species encrusted all kinds of substrate but were
   dependent on its stability and on the surrounding environment. The high
   density of tube-dwelling polychaetes which inhabited the rocky shore
   makes it possible to obtain an insight into settlement strategies of
   Late Cretaceous polychaetes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The overproduction of intestinal lipoproteins may contribute to the
   dyslipidemia found in diabetes. We studied the influence of diabetes on
   the fasting jejunal lipid content and its association with plasma lipids
   and the expression of genes involved in the synthesis and secretion of
   these lipoproteins. The study was undertaken in 27 morbidly obese
   persons, 12 of whom had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The morbidly
   obese persons with diabetes had higher levels of chylomicron (CM)
   triglycerides (P < 0.001) and apolipoprotein (apo) B48 (P = 0.012). The
   jejunum samples obtained from the subjects with diabetes had a lower
   jejunal triglyceride content (P = 0.012) and angiopoietin-like protein 4
   (ANGPTL4) mRNA expression (P = 0.043). However, the apoA-IV mRNA
   expression was significantly greater (P = 0.036). The jejunal
   triglyceride content correlated negatively with apoA-IV mRNA expression
   (r = -0.587, P = 0.027). The variables that explained the jejunal
   triglyceride content in a multiple linear regression model were the
   insulin resistance state and the apoA-IV mRNA expression. Our results
   show that the morbidly obese subjects with diabetes had lower jejunal
   lipid content and that this correlated negatively with apoA-IV mRNA
   expression.jlr These findings show that the jejunum appears to play an
   active role in lipid homeostasis in the fasting state.-Soriguer, F., S.

Abstract = {{Most of the proposals to compute the Euler number of a binary image have

   of these methods (in the case of images composed of hexagonal cells)
   have been reported in literature, although it is known that images
   composed of hexagonal cells do not suffer from the problems of
   connectivity frequently found in the case of images composed of squared
   cells. In this paper, a new way to compute the Euler number (E) of a
   binary image composed of hexagonal cells is presented. For this, the
   perimeter P of the isolated regions in the image, their contact
   perimeter P-c and the type T of a cell are used to obtain this important
   invariant. The proposal can be used alone or in combination with other
   features to describe any binary planar shape composed of hexagonal
   pixels for its further recognition.}},

Abstract = {{The LIFEBIZ theory and practice follow the natural life processes of
   intelligence LIFEBIZ is related to the Brain sciences. By adjusting the
   rate of triggering and the internal time constants, brain generates
   various brain event trains: Poisson; almost Poisson; uniform
   distribution; almost periodic. Many event trains are active
   simultaneously in the brain and mind tissue. The time intervals of
   trains cover a broad range from 0 to 1225 ins, with the peaks in 3,6;
   25; 175 and 1225 ms. These event trains support the links between the
   brain agents. The links and the agents support the brain functions in
   the Self Organization SO of Understanding U, Consciousness C, Emotions E
   and Knowledge K. This is a nested, fractal, dynamic, fuzzy loop of the
   trains and signs. The brain signs are the pieces of mosaic used to build
   the mind. The same concept is used to build the LIFEBIZ.. By treating
   biological., economical and technological systems alike, LIFEBIZ both
   advances and opens new job profiles and business. To be attractive for
   the market, consumer goods and industrial hardware of all kinds must be
   wrapped into LIFEBIZ package which includes: natural interface to the
   users based on non restrictive dialogue, speech and image; features of
   adaptability, learning, sensing the environment; human like behaviour
   offering the users a new sensation of mind and body, new experiences
   happenings and pleasures. These require qualities and status
   associations. The same equations and laws explain the Cell, Brain, Mind

Abstract = {{P>Like many bacteria, Bacillus subtilis cells contain three actin-like
   MreB proteins. We show that the three paralogues, MreB, Mbl and MreBH,
   have different filament architectures in a heterologous cell system, and
   form straight filaments, helices or ring structures, different from the
   regular helical arrangement in B. subtilis cells. However, when
   coexpressed, they colocalize into a single filamentous helical
   structure, showing that the paralogues influence each other's filament
   architecture. Ring-like MreBH structures can be converted into MreB-like
   helical filaments by a single point mutation affecting subunit contacts,
   showing that MreB paralogues feature flexible filament arrangements.
   Time-lapse and FRAP experiments show that filaments can extend as well
   as shrink at both ends, and also show internal rearrangement, suggesting
   that filaments consist of overlapping bundles of shorter filaments that
   continuously turn over. Upon induction in Escherichia coli cells, B.
   subtilis MreB (BsMreB) filaments push the cells into strikingly altered
   cell morphology, showing that MreB filaments can change cell shape. E.
   coli cells with a weakened cell wall were ruptured upon induction of
   BsMreB filaments, suggesting that the bacterial actin orthologue may
   exert force against the cell membrane and envelope, and thus possibly
   plays an additional mechanical role in bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Face recognition plays a vital role in authentication, monitoring,
   indexing, access control and other surveillance applications. Much
   research on face recognition with various feature based approaches using
   global or local features employing a number of similarity measurement
   techniques have been done earlier. Feature based approaches using global
   features can effectively preserve only the Euclidean structure of face
   space, that suffer from lack of local features which may play a major
   role in some applications. On the other hand, wtih local features only
   the face subspace that best detects the essential face manifold
   structure is obtained and it also suffers loss in global features which
   may also be important in some other applications. Measuring similarity
   or distance between two feature vectors is also a key step for any
   pattern matching application. In this work, a new combined approach for
   recognizing faces that integrates the advantages of the global feature
   extraction technique by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the local
   feature extraction technique by Locality Preserving Projections (LPP)
   with correlation based similarity measurement technique has been
   discussed. This has been validated by performing various experiments and
   by making a fair comparison with conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{Raman spectroscopy is well suited for non-invasive and non-destructive
   analysis. The spectra provide detailed information about the composition
   of the matter like a fingerprint on molecular level. Here, we have
   applied Raman spectroscopy for the characterization of meat spoilage.
   For this purpose, pork chops (musculus longissimus dorsi) were
   ice-stored at 5 A degrees C, and time-dependent Raman spectra were
   measured daily up to 3 weeks post mortem. A prototype Raman probe for
   meat was constructed featuring a miniaturized optical bench combined
   with a customized 671-nm microsystem diode laser for the integration
   into a handheld device. During the time-dependent investigations with
   this laser scanner, the Raman spectra preserve their basic spectral
   features, but small changes of the protein Raman signals occur during
   storage. The time correlation of the complex spectra were analyzed with
   principal components analysis leading to a distinction of spectra on the
   time scale between day 8 and 10 typically. This corresponds to the
   transition from unspoiled meat to meat at and beyond the end of shelf
   life identified by means of visual inspection.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Unintended pregnancy disproportionately affects younger,
   minority, and low-income women. The purpose of this analysis is to
   describe our recruitment strategies and to determine if targeted efforts
   to reach women at greatest risk for unintended pregnancy and sexually
   transmitted infection (STI) were successful.
   Methods: The Contraceptive CHOICE Project is a prospective cohort study
   providing reversible contraception at no cost to 10,000 women aged 14-45
   years in the St. Louis area in order to evaluate method satisfaction and
   continuation and to reduce unintended pregnancies in the region. We
   describe four strategies for effective outreach and recruitment of
   high-risk women, including forming strong community partnerships. We
   analyze the evolution of baseline demographic and behavioral
   characteristics over the three waves of enrollment of the first 2,500
   participants in order to assess whether our outreach efforts were
   successful.
   Results: Overall, >60\% of participants were aged <= 25 years. There was
   a significant increase in the percentage of minority participants
   enrolled throughout the first 2,500 subjects (p<0.001). The number of
   women who reported trouble paying for basic necessities significantly
   increased over the three waves (p - 0.025). Throughout the three waves
   of enrollment, there was a significant increase in the number of women
   who tested positive for an STI at baseline (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: A multiple method approach with collaboration of key
   community partners led to successful recruitment of hard to reach
   populations at high risk for unintended pregnancy and STI.}},

Abstract = {{Leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) nest on dynamic,
   erosion-prone beaches. Erosive processes and resulting nest loss have
   long been presumed to be a hindrance to clutch survival. In order to
   better understand how leatherbacks cope with unstable nesting beaches. 1
   investigated the role of beach erosion in leatherback nest site
   selection at Playa Gandoca, Costa Rica. I also examined the potential
   effect of nest relocation, a conservation strategy in place at Playa
   Gandoca to prevent nest loss to erosion, on the temperature of
   incubating clutches. I monitored changes in beach structure as a result
   of erosion at natural nest sites during the time the nest was laid, as
   well as in subsequent weeks. To investigate slope as a cue for nest site
   selection. I measured the slope of the beach where turtles ascended from
   the sea to nest, as well as the slopes at other random locations on the
   beach for comparison. I examined temperature differences between natural
   and relocated nest sites with thermocouples placed in the sand at depths
   typical of leatherback nests. Nests were distributed non-randomly in a
   clumped distribution along the length of the beach and laid at locations
   that were not undergoing erosion. The slope at nest sites was
   significantly different than at randomly chosen locations on the beach.
   The sand temperature at nest depths was significantly warmer at natural
   nest sites than at locations of relocated nests. The findings of this
   study suggest leatherbacks actively select nest sites that are not
   undergoing erosive processes, with slope potentially being used as a cue
   for site selection. The relocation of nests appears to be inadvertently
   cooling the nest environment. Due to the fact that leatherback clutches
   undergo temperature-dependent sex determination, the relocation of nests
   may be producing an unnatural male biasing of hatchlings. The results of
   this study suggest that the necessity of relocation practices, largely
   in place to protect nests from erosion, should be reevaluated to ensure
   the proper conservation of this critically endangered species. Rev.

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is good evidence indicating that group Cognitive
   Stimulation Therapy (CST) leads to generalised cognitive benefits for
   people with dementia. However, little is known about whether some
   aspects of cognition might change more than others and why.
   Methods: Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, a 14-session group treatment,
   has been evaluated in a multi-centre, single-blind, randomised
   controlled trial. This study looks at the subscales of the ADAS-Cog
   (memory and new learning, praxis and language) and compares the outcome
   of CST with a treatment as usual control group.
   Results: There was a significant difference between treatment and
   control groups in total ADAS-Cog score (p = 0.01) and in the language
   subscale (p = 0.01). There were no significant changes in memory and
   orientation or praxis.
   Conclusions: CST appears to have particular effects in promoting
   language function, which is likely to lead to generalised benefits. This
   may be through generating opinions and creating new semantic links
   through categorisation. Future research might use more sensitive
   psychometric tests to assess these effects in more depth. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Contemporary political philosophers discuss the idea of freedom in terms
   of two distinctions: Berlin's famous distinction between negative and
   positive liberty, and Skinner and Pettit's divide between liberal and
   republican liberty. In this essay I proceed to recast the debate by
   showing that there are two strands in liberalism, Hobbesian and Lockean,
   and that the latter inherited its conception of civil liberty from
   republican thought. I also argue that the contemporary debate on freedom
   lacks a perspicuous account of the various conceptions of freedom,
   mainly because it leaves aside the classic contrast between natural
   liberty and civil liberty. Once we consider both the negative/positive
   distinction and the natural/civil one, we can classify all conceptions
   of freedom within four basic irreducible categories. In light of the
   resulting framework I show that there are two distinct conceptions of
   republican liberty, natural and civil, and that the former is coupled
   with an ideal of individual self-control.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{720-728}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aluminium-epoxy systems are widely studied for uses as adhesive
   structural bonding. When an amine hardener is used as a curing agent for
   an epoxy resin, interactions between the hardener and the aluminium
   create a volume called an interphase, whose properties are distinct from
   the bulk resin and has a significant influence on the adhesive bond
   strength.
   This article reports on the influence of an aluminium surface treatment
   on the interphase formation and adhesive bond strength. The aluminium
   surface was degreased with acetone, and then the surface was activated
   by means of atmospheric plasma treatment with different nitrogen/oxygen
   gas mixtures. The characterization of the aluminium surface chemistry
   and surface energy was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) and a sessile drop test, respectively. The interphase formation
   was investigated by means of X-ray energy dispersion spectrometer (EDS)
   in a low vacuum scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM). Adhesive bond
   strength was measured by tensile testing of a single lap
   aluminium-epoxy-aluminium assembly.
   Atmospheric plasma treatment showed an improvement of the
   thermo-mechanical properties of the assembly. Several points were
   discussed to explain the effect of atmospheric plasma treatment on the
   adherence and on the interphase formation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Consolidation of extinction learning is a primary mechanism disrupted in
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), associated with hypoactivity of
   the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. A role for rapid eye
   movement (REM) sleep disturbances in this failure to consolidate
   extinction learning has been proposed. We performed functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous skin conductance response
   (SCR) measurements in 16 healthy participants during
   conditioning/extinction and later recall of extinction. The visual
   stimuli were basic geometric forms and electrical shocks functioned as
   the unconditioned stimulus. Between the conditioning/extinction and
   recall sessions, participants received a 90-min sleep window in the
   sleep laboratory. This daytime sleep was polysomnographically recorded
   and scored by professionals blind to the study design. Only seven out of
   16 participants had REM sleep; participants without REM sleep had a
   significantly slower decline of both SCR and neural activity of the
   laterodorsal tegmentum in response to electrical shocks during
   conditioning. At recall of fear extinction, participants with preceding
   REM sleep had a reduced SCR and stronger activation of the left
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and bilateral lingual gyrus in response
   to the extinguished stimulus than participants lacking REM sleep. This
   study indicates that trait-like differences in shock
   reactivity/habituation (mediated by the brainstem) are predictive of REM
   sleep disruption, which in turn is associated with impaired
   consolidation of extinction (mediated by the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex). These findings help understand the neurobiological basis and
   the temporal sequence of the relationship between shock exposure,
   disturbed sleep and impaired consolidation of extinction, as observed in
   PTSD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on the narratives of two dalit women which offer
   new, enabling imaginings of community that open up radical possibilities
   for rethinking questions of childhood and gender. These texts turn a
   critical gaze on an upper caste feminist practice and the discourses of
   childhood, schooling and emancipation that are tied to it. Childhood has
   been hegemonically represented as a state of innocence and vulnerability
   and is marked off from the world of adult anxieties and
   responsibilities. Such representations are generally implicated in
   abstract, internationalist notions of child rights and remain disengaged
   from the historical contexts that shape children's lives. The dominant
   discourse of the girl child does not problematize the field qualifying
   as childhood; instead, it proposes that the female child has been
   excluded from the same. The cause of this exclusion is identified as
   gender discrimination, reinforcing the primacy of sexual difference and
   allowing it to subsume all other forms of differences caste, class,
   region or community - that exist among children. The article argues that
   these two narratives disrupt the neat separation between the modernizing
   nation/emancipatory self and the regressive community. As each narrative
   takes us through the life of a dalit girl, it articulates a critique of
   gender as a category abstracted from material circumstances that
   constitute women's lives. Gender in these narratives emerges as
   complexly intermeshed with caste and community.}},

Abstract = {{The zeta potential generated at the interface between cement particle
   surfaces adsorbed with superplasticisers have been studied using

   ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and Portland pozzolanic (fly ash) cement
   (PPC) pastes along with the differential impacts of different types of
   superplasticisers on both the varieties of cement pastes. In the latter
   context, the effects of three different types of superplasticisers
   namely Ligno Sulphonate (IS), Sulphonated Melamine Formaldehyde (SMF)
   and Sulphonated Naphthalene Formaldehyde (SNF) have been specifically
   studied. The results show that the cement pastes with PPC shows better
   dispersion when compared with the OPC. The paper also endeavors to
   unfold the relationship and significance of cement interaction with

Abstract = {{We report the few hundred second anti-correlated soft lags between soft
   and hard energy bands in the source GX 339-4 using RXTE observations. In
   one observation, anti-correlated soft lags were observed using the
   ISGRI/INTEGRAL hard energy band and the PCA/RXTE soft energy band light
   curves. The lags were observed when the source was in hard and soft
   intermediate states, i.e., in a steep power-law state. We found that the
   temporal and spectral properties were changed during the lag timescale.
   The anti-correlated soft lags are associated with spectral variability
   during which the geometry of the accretion disk is changed. The observed
   temporal and spectral variations are explained using the framework of
   truncated disk geometry. We found that during the lag timescale, the
   centroid frequency of quasi-periodic oscillation is decreased, the soft
   flux is decreased along with an increase in the hard flux, and the
   power-law index steepens together with a decrease in the disk
   normalization parameter. We argue that these changes could be explained
   if we assume that the hot corona condenses and forms a disk in the inner
   region of the accretion disk. The overall spectral and temporal changes
   support the truncated geometry of the accretion disk in the steep
   power-law state or in the intermediate state.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of chemical bonding that is responsible for the disparity
   between the optical properties of the impurity ions in the pyrochlores,
   Y2Sn2O7 and Y2Ti2O7 has been quantified by computing in the density
   functional theory framework the structural, physical electronic and
   optical properties of the host lattices. The partial density of states
   calculations and the estimation of the Mulliken charges indicate the
   significant different behavior of the oxygen ions in the two different
   crystallographic positions (48f and 8b) of the pyrochlore lattice. The
   hybridization between the filled 2p orbital of oxygen ion on the 48f
   site (O-48f(2-)) and the empty 3d(o) orbital of Ti4+ results in an
   anomalously lower charge on O-48f(2-) in Y2Ti2O7 when compared with that
   in Y2Sn2O7 with filled Sn4+ 4d(10) orbital. This covalent mixing is
   chiefly responsible for the disparity between the optical properties of
   the impurity ions in Y2Sn2O7 and Y2Ti2O7. Additional information on the
   nature of chemical bonding is provided by calculating the influence of
   external hydrostatic pressure on the interatomic distances and the
   elastic properties of the pyrochlores. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Splash-form tektites are found with a wide range of sizes and in an
   intriguing array of shapes ranging from spheres to flat discs to
   dumbbells. Despite the considerable interest that exists in tektites,
   there has been relatively little effort to develop rational shape
   descriptors and to understand the origin of their shapes based on basic
   physics. Tektites represent a natural laboratory experiment that can be
   analyzed to better understand the physics of rotating fluid drops. In
   this paper, we propose a classification scheme based on the axial ratios
   of ellipsoids, and we analyze the frequency of tektite shapes using a
   database of over 1,000 measured tektites. We show that the shape
   distribution for tektites from Thailand and Vietnam are very similar and
   that the most common tektites are moderately deformed discs but there
   exist also a significant number of moderately deformed dumbbells, and we
   argue that this distribution comes about because fluid drops first
   deform as oblate forms and then undergo a non-axisymmetric instability
   to become prolate. We also find that the largest tektites are most
   likely to be weakly deformed oblate objects while the most strongly
   deformed and most highly prolate forms are considerably smaller. A

Abstract = {{Introduction. We examine relationships between information literacy and
   information ecology with regard to conceptual innovation in information
   science. We aim to expand our understanding of human information
   behaviour and relevance assessment in the electronic environment.
   Method. Conceptual analysis and conceptual mapping is used and
   relationships of main concepts are determined in a concept map. Earlier
   empirical research on information behaviour styles and relevance
   assessment using surveys and interviews are synthesized.
   Analysis. Two information styles (pragmatic and analytic) are
   characterized. Relevance assessment in the electronic environment is
   analysed. Relevance is considered as part of information literacy.
   Examples of students' information horizons and a concept map of
   relevance are given.
   Results. Ecological dimensions of information literacy are determined at
   semantic (relevance), visual (information horizon, concept maps) and
   behavioural and social levels (information styles). A model of
   ecological dimensions of information literacy is outlined based on
   triangle of values, tools and communities. Recommendations for
   development of students' information literacy are presented at levels of
   information seeking and relevance assessment.
   Conclusions Implications for information literacy development in the
   electronic environments and for information and educational strategies
   are derived. Relevance assessment should be actively trained as part of
   information literacy and guided inquiry. Ecological dimensions of
   information literacy can be used in new models of e-learning and digital

Title = {{Phosphorylation of Mouse Immunity-Related GTPase (IRG) Resistance
   Proteins Is an Evasion Strategy for Virulent Toxoplasma gondii}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Virulence of complex pathogens in mammals is generally determined by
   multiple components of the pathogen interacting with the functional
   complexity and multiple layering of the mammalian immune system. It is
   most unusual for the resistance of a mammalian host to be overcome by
   the defeat of a single defence mechanism. In this study we uncover and
   analyse just such a case at the molecular level, involving the
   widespread intracellular protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii and one of
   its most important natural hosts, the house mouse (Mus musculus).
   Natural polymorphism in virulence of Eurasian T. gondii strains for mice
   has been correlated in genetic screens with the expression of
   polymorphic rhoptry kinases (ROP kinases) secreted into the host cell
   during infection. We show that the molecular targets of the virulent
   allelic form of ROP18 kinase are members of a family of cellular
   GTPases, the interferon-inducible IRG (immunity-related GTPase)
   proteins, known from earlier work to be essential resistance factors in
   mice against avirulent strains of T. gondii. Virulent T. gondii strain
   ROP18 kinase phosphorylates several mouse IRG proteins. We show that the
   parasite kinase phosphorylates host Irga6 at two threonines in the
   nucleotide-binding domain, biochemically inactivating the GTPase and
   inhibiting its accumulation and action at the T. gondii parasitophorous
   vacuole membrane. Our analysis identifies the conformationally active
   switch I region of the GTP-binding site as an Achilles' heel of the IRG
   protein pathogen-resistance mechanism. The polymorphism of ROP18 in
   natural T. gondii populations indicates the existence of a dynamic,
   rapidly evolving ecological relationship between parasite virulence
   factors and host resistance factors. This system should be unusually
   fruitful for analysis at both ecological and molecular levels since both
   T. gondii and the mouse are widespread and abundant in the wild and are
   well-established model species with excellent analytical tools
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur mustard (SM), an alkylating chemical warfare agent, leads to
   tissue damage, including inflammation, blister formation, and impaired
   wound healing. Especially wound healing is of concern because after SM
   exposure, wound healing is prolonged. In this study, we focused on the
   effect of SM (30 and 100 mu M) on endothelial tube formation, apoptosis,
   and proliferation in mouse embryoid bodies (EBs), which provide an
   appropriate model for investigating vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. EBs
   were exposed to SM for 30 min on day 0, 3, or 6 of EBs' growth, were
   allowed to grow until day 7, then fixed, and immunostained (PECAM-1,
   Ki67, and activated caspase-3). SM significantly decreased endothelial
   tube formation compared with unexposed EBs. Additionally, we observed a
   significant increase of apoptosis. As the formation of reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) is discussed to be involved in the pathophysiology of SM
   toxicity, we evaluated the effect of ROS scavengers (alpha-linolenic
   acid {[}ALA] and N-acetyl cysteine {[}NAC]) in the same experimental
   setup. Temporary effects of both scavengers could be detected, in
   particular NAC seemed to have temporary significant positive effects on
   endothelial tube formation in 100 mu M SM-exposed EBs. ALA augmented
   proliferation when administered after 30 mu M SM exposure on day 3,
   whereas NAC treatment on day 0 decreased apoptosis induced by 100 mu M
   SM. Taken together, our findings pointed to a negative effect of SM on
   vascularization and endothelial tube formation. ROS scavengers NAC and
   ALA showed temporary, but not long-lasting, rescuing effects regarding
   endothelial tube formation after SM exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Overweight status after breast cancer treatment may increase a woman's
   risk for recurrent disease and/or early onset cardiovascular disease.
   Green tea has been proposed to promote weight loss and favourably modify
   glucose, insulin and blood lipids. This pilot study tested the effect of
   daily decaffeinated green tea consumption for 6 months on weight and
   body composition, select metabolic parameters and lipid profiles in
   overweight breast cancer survivors.
   Methods:
   The effect of daily decaffeinated green tea intake on weight, body
   composition and changes in resting metabolic rate, energy intake,
   glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance
   (HOMA-IR) and lipids was evaluated in overweight breast cancer
   survivors. Participants had a mean weight of 80.2 kg; body mass index
   (BMI) 30.1 kg m-2; and body fat 46.4\%. Participants (n = 54) were
   randomised to 960 mL of decaffeinated green or placebo tea daily for 6
   months.
   Results:
   Mean (SD) tea intake among study completers (n = 39) was 5952 (1176) mL
   week-1 and was associated with a significant reduction in energy intake
   (P = 0.02). Change in body weight of -1.2 kg (green tea) versus +0.2 kg
   (placebo) suggests a weight change effect, although this was not
   statistically significant. Decaffeinated green tea intake was associated
   with elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (P = 0.003) and
   nonsignificant improvements in the HDL/LDL ratio and HOMA-IR (-1.1 +/-
   5.9: green tea; +3.2 +/- 7.2: herbal).
   Conclusions:
   Intake of decaffeinated green tea for 6 months was associated with a
   slight reduction in body weight and improved HDL and glucose homeostasis
   in overweight breast cancer survivors.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorylated derivatives of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol
   (PtdIns), known as phosphoinositides (PIs), regulate membrane-proximal
   cellular processes by recruiting specific protein effectors involved in
   cell signalling, membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. Two PIs
   that are generated through the activities of distinct PI 3-kinases
   (PI3Ks) are of special interest in cancer research. PtdIns(3,4,5)P-3,
   generated by class I PI3Ks, functions as tumour promotor by recruiting
   effectors involved in cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility.
   Conversely, there is evidence that PtdIns3P, generated by class III
   PI3K, functions in tumour suppression. Three subunits of the class III
   PI3K complex (Beclin 1, UVRAG and BIF-1) have been independently
   identified as tumour suppressors in mice and humans, and their mechanism
   of action in this context has been proposed to entail activation of
   autophagy, a catabolic pathway that is considered to mediate tumour
   suppression by scavenging damaged organelles that would otherwise cause
   DNA instability through the production of reactive oxygen species.
   Recent studies have revealed two additional functions of PtdIns3P that
   might contribute to its tumour suppressor activity. The first involves
   endosomal sorting and lysosomal downregulation of mitogenic receptors.
   The second involves regulation of cytokinesis, which is the final stage
   of cell division. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of tumour
   suppression mediated by class III PI3K and PtdIns3P will identify novel
   Achilles' heels of the cell's defence against tumourigenesis and will be
   useful in the search for prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In the clinical routine, the diagnosis of preeclampsia is
   often challenging. Not all pregnant women with signs and symptoms of
   preeclampsia develop the disease. Recently, the assessment of the
   sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in the serum of pregnant women has been proposed as an
   aid in the diagnosis of preeclampsia.
   Patients and Methods: In a retrospective, monocentric case-control
   study, we reviewed 30 cases of patients who presented with the clinical
   symptoms of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the delivery ward.
   Next to the standard diagnostic algorithm for preeclampsia, the
   sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was determined using the automated Elecsys (R)
   platform.
   Results: In 12/30 cases (40 \%), the diagnosis of a hypertensive
   pregnancy disorder was confirmed with an sFlt1/PlGF ratio of >85. In
   18/30 (60 \%) cases, a ratio <85 excluded the diagnosis of preeclampsia
   at the time of presentation and allowed an adaptation of the patient's
   surveillance programme.
   Conclusion: In the clinical setting of ``suspected preeclampsia{''},
   determination of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio can serve as an aid in the
   diagnosis of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. The reliable exclusion
   of the diagnosis ``preeclampsia{''} can help in an appropriate and
   cost-effective management of patients with signs and symptoms of the
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of 2-photon microscopy (TPM), which excites
   tissue autofluorescence, in detecting and calculating the grade of
   collagen corneal crosslinks, which are not visible through the slitlamp
   and in vivo confocal microscopy.
   SETTING: Departments of Ophthalmology, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, and
   University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.
   DESIGN: Experimental study.
   METHODS: Corneas of rabbits were treated with different crosslinking
   (CXL) protocols. Two weeks after treatment, the corneas were evaluated
   in vivo by confocal microscopy. Eyes were enucleated and TPM was
   performed at 710 nm and 826 nm excitation wavelengths to detect tissue
   autofluorescence, second harmonic generation, and fluorescence lifetime
   measurements (FLIM). Eyes were then fixed and analyzed by histology.
   RESULTS: Cross linking following the standard protocol generated a
   strong autofluorescence signal in the stroma that was detected by TPM.
   This signal was weakly present in the control specimens, and a sharp
   transition zone between the peripheral zone and the CXL zone was seen.
   On FLIM, an increase in corneal crosslinks was measured when the
   standard protocol was used.
   CONCLUSIONS: Two-photon microscopy, a noninvasive method, was able to
   detect the effects of therapeutic CXL and measure the grade of CXL. In
   addition to postoperative treatment control, the technique has
   possibilities for use in online dosimetry during 2-photon triggered CXL.}},

   published September 22, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00398.2010. Astrocytic
   inwardly rectifying K+ currents (I-KIR) have an important role in
   extracellular K+ homeostasis, which influences neuronal excitability,
   and serum extravasation has been linked to impaired K-IR-mediated K+
   buffering and chronic hyperexcitability. Head injury induces acute
   impairment in astroglial membrane I-KIR and impaired K+ buffering in the
   rat hippocampus, but chronic spontaneous seizures appear in the
   perilesional neocortex-not the hippocampus-in the early weeks to months
   after injury. Thus we examined astrocytic K-IR channel pathophysiology
   in both neocortex and hippocampus after rostral parasaggital fluid
   percussion injury (rpFPI). rpFPI induced greater acute serum
   extravasation and metabolic impairment in the perilesional neocortex
   than in the underlying hippocampus, and in situ whole cell recordings
   showed a greater acute loss of astrocytic I-KIR in neocortex than
   hippocampus. I-KIR loss persisted through 1 mo after injury only in the
   neocortical epileptic focus, but fully recovered in the hippocampus that
   did not generate chronic seizures. Neocortical cell-attached recordings
   showed no loss or an increase of I-KIR in astrocytic somata. Confocal
   imaging showed depletion of KIR4.1 immunoreactivity especially in
   processes-not somata-of neocortical astrocytes, whereas hippocampal
   astrocytes appeared normal. In naive animals, intracortical infusion of
   serum, devoid of coagulation-mediating thrombin activity, reproduces the
   effects of rpFPI both in vivo and at the cellular level. In vivo serum
   infusion induces partial seizures similar to those induced by rpFPI,
   whereas bath-applied serum, but not dialyzed albumin, rapidly silenced
   astrocytic K-IR membrane currents in whole cell and cell-attached
   patch-clamp recordings in situ. Thus both acute impairment in astrocytic
   I-KIR and chronic spontaneous seizures typical of rpFPI are reproduced
   by serum extravasation, whereas the chronic impairment in astroglial
   I-KIR is specific to the neocortex that develops the epileptic focus.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new performance capture approach that incorporates a
   physically-based cloth model to reconstruct a rigged fully-animatable
   virtual double of a real person in loose apparel from multi-view video
   recordings. Our algorithm only requires a minimum of manual interaction.
   Without the use of optical markers in the scene, our algorithm first
   reconstructs skeleton motion and detailed time-varying surface geometry
   of a real person from a reference video sequence. These captured
   reference performance data are then analyzed to automatically identify
   non-rigidly deforming pieces of apparel on the animated geometry. For
   each piece of apparel, parameters of a physically-based real-time cloth
   simulation model are estimated, and surface geometry of occluded body
   regions is approximated. The reconstructed character model comprises a
   skeleton-based representation for the actual body parts and a
   physically-based simulation model for the apparel. In contrast to
   previous performance capture methods, we can now also create new
   real-time animations of actors captured in general apparel.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:
   The risk of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis B virus (HBV) in
   Switzerland by testing blood donors for hepatitis B surface antigen
   (HBsAg) alone has been historically estimated at 1:160,000 transfusions.
   The Swiss health authorities decided not to introduce mandatory antibody
   to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) testing but to evaluate the
   investigation of HBV nucleic acid testing (NAT).
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:
   Between June 2007 and February 2009, a total of 306,000 donations were
   screened routinely for HBsAg and HBV DNA by triplex individual-donation
   (ID)-NAT (Ultrio assay on Tigris system, Gen-Probe/Novartis
   Diagnostics). ID-NAT repeatedly reactive donors were further
   characterized for HBV serologic markers and viral load by quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction. The relative sensitivity of screening for
   HBsAg, anti-HBc, and HBV DNA was assessed. The residual HBV transmission
   risk of NAT with or without anti-HBc and HBsAg was retrospectively
   estimated in a mathematical model.
   RESULTS:
   From the 306,000 blood donations, 31 were repeatedly Ultrio test
   reactive and confirmed HBV infected, of which 24 (77\%) and 27 (87\%)
   were HBsAg and anti-HBc positive, respectively. Seven HBV-NAT yields
   were identified (1:44,000), two pre-HBsAg window period (WP) donations
   (1:153,000) and five occult HBV infections (1:61,000). Introduction of
   ID-NAT reduced the risk of HBV WP transmission in repeat donors from
   1:95,000 to 1:296,000.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Triplex NAT screening reduced the HBV WP transmission risk approximately
   threefold. NAT alone was more efficacious than the combined use of HBsAg
   and anti-HBc. The data from this study led to the decision to introduce
   sensitive HBV-NAT screening in Switzerland. Our findings may be useful
   in designing more efficient and cost-effective HBV screening strategies
   in low-prevalence countries.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Research on the neural circuitry underlying fear extinction
   has led to the examination of D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at
   the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in the amygdala, as a method to
   enhance exposure therapy outcome. Preliminary results have supported the
   use of DCS to augment exposure therapy in adult anxiety disorders;
   however, no data have been reported in any childhood anxiety disorder.
   Thus, we sought to preliminarily examine whether weight-adjusted DCS
   doses (25 or 50 mg) enhanced the overall efficacy of
   cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pediatric obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD).
   Method: Participants were 30 youth (aged 8-17) with a primary diagnosis
   of OCD. The study design was a randomized, double-blinded,
   placebo-controlled augmentation trial examining CBT + DCS versus CBT +
   Placebo (15 youth per group). All patients received seven exposure and
   response prevention sessions paired with DCS or placebo taken 1 hour
   before sessions.
   Results: Although not significantly different, compared with the CBT +
   Placebo group, youth in the CBT + DCS arm showed small-tomoderate
   treatment effects (d = .31-.47 on primary outcomes). No adverse events
   were recorded.
   Conclusions: These results complement findings in adult OCD and non-OCD
   anxiety disorders and provide initial support for a more extensive study
   of DCS augmentation of CBT among youth with OCD.}},

Abstract = {{The conformational equilibria of cyclohexane (as well as its fluoro-,
   chloro-, methyl-, hydroxy-, and t-butyl derivatives), cyclohexanone,
   piperidine, tetrahydropyran (and its 2-hydroxy derivative) were studied
   by ab initio and DFT procedures. The transition states were calculated
   at HF/6-31G, B3LYP/6-31+G{*}, and B3LYP/6-311+G{*}{*} levels, whereas
   the intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRCs) were evaluated at the
   B3LYP/6-31+G{*} level. The degree of puckering and energy data was
   nearly not basis set-dependent (using B3LYP) in most of the cases.
   However, DFT methods gave better agreement with experimental data than
   HF methods, as expected from electron correlation inclusion.
   Fluorocyclohexane and 2-hydroxytetrahydropyran showed the largest basis
   set-energy dependence. It was found that the conversion from chair to
   skew is direct in some cases, whereas in others it goes through the
   pseudorotational (skew/boat) pathway. The case of t-butylcyclohexane,
   with a skew form as stable as one of the chairs, is especially
   interesting. In this compound, as well as in cyclohexanone and
   2-hydroxytetrahydropyran, large deviations from the known
   pseudorotation/inversion scheme are observed. Copyright (C) 2010 John

Abstract = {{Study Design. Review Article.
   Objective. The goal of this review article is to discuss the steps taken
   to minimize and reduce complications from surgery in children and
   adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis.
   Summary of Background Data. A majority of children and adolescents with
   idiopathic scoliosis are otherwise healthy. Most lead relatively normal
   active lives. Assessing the functional impact of surgery is difficult
   due to the fact that most patients function at a high level before
   surgery. Surgery is geared to prevent the long-term problems associated
   with scoliosis. Complications do occur in the treatment of idiopathic
   scoliosis. Understanding the nature of these complications may help to
   improve long-term outcome.
   Methods. Children and adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis were
   assessed using radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, computed
   tomography scans, pain assessment, pulmonary assessment, surgical notes,
   history, and physical examinations.
   Results. No true agreement exists in the literature for standard
   preoperative assessment of idiopathic scoliosis to reduce and prevent
   adverse events and surgical complications.
   Conclusion. The treating surgeon must be aware of the potential risks,
   adverse events, and complications associated with the procedure, and
   must be able to convey this to the patient and their family in a clear
   and concise manner.}},

Abstract = {{``Candidatus Mycoplasma haemobos{''} is a hemoplasma species found in
   cattle and has been recently reported in Switzerland and Japan. In this
   study, ``Candidatus Mycoplasma haemobos{''} was shown to occur in cattle
   and buffalo in tropical China by PCR amplification and sequence analysis
   of the 16S rRNA gene from blood samples. Based on the 16S rDNA sequence,
   a specific PCR assay was developed. Occurrence of ``Candidatus
   Mycoplasma haemobos{''} in cattle and buffalo in Guangxi, China, was
   determined by examining 25 buffalo blood samples, 12 yellow cattle blood
   samples and 42 dairy cow blood samples. The results showed that 32\%
   (8/25) of buffalo, 41.7\% (5/12) of yellow cattle, and 14.3\% (6/42) of
   dairy cows were positive for ``Candidatus Mycoplasma haemobos{''},
   respectively. Direct sequencing of representative PCR products confirmed
   that the amplified partial 16S rDNA sequence represented ``Candidatus
   Mycoplasma haemobos{''}. This is the first report of ``Candidatus

Abstract = {{The effect of nano-crystallization on the oxidation behavior was
   examined in 0.1 MPa pure oxygen at different temperatures for two
   Fe-0.5Si and two Cu-1.0Si alloys prepared by CC (conventional casting)
   and MA (mechanical alloying). The grain sizes of both MA Fe-00.5Si and
   MA Cu-1.0Si alloys are about 50 nm, while the grain sizes of both CC
   Fe-0.5Si and CC Cu-1.0Si alloys are larger than 200 Am. After 24 h
   oxidation, the oxide scales were examined by XRD, SEM and EDX. The
   results show that from the outermost layer to the innermost layer, the
   Fe-0.5Si alloys formed complex scales, consisting of Fe2O3 -> Fe3O4 +
   FeO -> FeO -> FeO + SiO2, and the Cu-1.0Si alloys formed scales of CuO
   -> Cu2O -> Cu2O + SiO2 -> internal oxidation zone. From the oxidation
   kinetics it is shown that nano-crystallization reduces the oxidation
   resistance of the Fe-0.5Si alloy but improves the oxidation resistance
   of the Cu-1.0Si alloy. The effect of nano-crystallization on the
   oxidation has two aspects: positive impact and negative impact. Whether
   nano-crystallization can improve the high-temperature oxidation
   resistance of alloys is determined by which of the two aspects
   predominates.}},

Abstract = {{In synchronous circuit designs, clock skew is difficult to minimize
   because a single physical layout of a clock tree must satisfy multiple
   constraints in a complicated power mode environment where certain
   modules may operate with different voltages. In this paper, we use
   adjustable delay buffers (ADB) whose delays can be tuned or adjusted to
   minimize clock skew under different power modes. Assuming that the
   positions of k ADBs are already determined, we first propose a
   linear-time optimal algorithm which assigns the values of ADBs so that
   the skew is optimal among all possible ADB assignments with a
   possibility of latency penalty. Then, we propose a modified optimal
   algorithm without latency penalty. We also propose an efficient
   heuristic to determine good positions for ADBs. Our results show
   significant improvement when compared to cases without ADBs.}},

Abstract = {{The island of Simeulue was the first landfall of the tsunami of December
   2004. The tsunami destroyed many villages on the island, leaving one
   third of the population homeless. Malaria is endemic in Simeulue and an
   epidemic was reported to have occurred three months prior to the
   tsunami. Information concerning malaria was, however, not easily
   available. The earthquakes related to the tsunami may have created
   extensive potential breeding sites of Anopheles sundaicus, the probable
   vector, and increased vulnerability of the human population; a
   possibility of increased transmission made a further outbreak possible.
   Consequently, subsequent to the tsunami, considerable amounts of aid,
   including anti-malarial measures such as insecticide treated
   mosquito-nets, were deployed on the island. A series of island-wide
   cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2005-2007 to determine whether
   these had had any effect on malaria prevalence. Larval sampling, and CDC
   light-trap and landing collections of hungry mosquitoes were also
   undertaken. The results indicate that despite the continuing presence of
   potential vectors in some places the anti-malaria measures introduced
   following the tsunami have controlled, and may be close to eliminating,
   malaria from the island. (C) 2010 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and

Abstract = {{The variations in the chemical characteristics of asphalt constituents
   and styrene butadiene styrene triblock copolymer (SBS) in the polymer
   modified asphalt (MA) during degradation process should be clarified to
   design the effective recycle method of MA. In this study, the chemical
   characteristics of MA during thermal degradation process were studied in
   detail. The effects of the period of thermal degradation of MA, the
   content of asphaltene constituent in MA and the kind of substrate
   instead of the straight asphalt were discussed from the yield and
   thermogravimetry (TG) curves of four constituents in MA and the
   molecular weight distribution of SBS. As a result, the yield of polar
   constituent (asphaltene) increased gradually with decomposition of SBS
   during thermal degradation of MA. Decomposition of SBS was enhanced by
   the low molecular weight substrate, such as aromatic oil. On the other
   hand, decomposition of SBS was inhibited by MA of high asphaltene
   content.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a polystyrene-based well-of-the-well (WOW) system
   using injection molding to track individual embryos throughout culture
   using time-lapse cinematography (TLC). WOW culture of bovine embryos
   following in vitro fertilization was compared with conventional droplet
   culture (control). No differences between control- and WOW-cultured
   embryos were observed during development to the blastocyst stage.
   Morphological quality and inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE)
   cell numbers were not different between control- and WOW-derived
   blastocysts; however, apoptosis in both the ICM and TE cells was reduced
   in WOW culture (P < 0.01). Oxygen consumption in WOW-derived blastocysts
   was closer to physiological level than that of control-derived
   blastocysts. Moreover, WOW culture improved embryo viability, as
   indicated by increased pregnancy rates at Days 30 and 60 after embryo
   transfer (P < 0.05). TLC monitoring was performed to evaluate the
   cleavage pattern and the duration of the first cell cycle of embryos
   from oocytes collected by ovum pickup; correlations with success of
   pregnancy were determined. Logistic regression analysis indicated that
   the cleavage pattern correlated with success of pregnancy (P < 0.05),
   but cell cycle length did not. Higher pregnancy rates (66.7\%) were
   observed for animals in which transferred blastocysts had undergone
   normal cleavage, identified by the presence of two blastomeres of the
   same size without fragmentation, than among those with abnormal cleavage
   (33.3\%). These results suggest that our microwell culture system is a
   powerful tool for producing and selecting healthy embryos and for
   identifying viability biomarkers.}},

Abstract = {{An initial qualitative investigation was undertaken to determine the
   parameters defining professional written and spoken communication in
   industry, professional engineering and built environment bodies and
   other potential employers of graduates from the Faculty of Engineering
   and the Built Environment. The study questioned whether these parameters
   are met by the current courses offered by Professional Communication
   Studies (PCS) at the University of Cape Town (UCT). PCS aims to equip
   all students graduating from the faculty with communication skills to
   meet the demands their future careers will make on their ability to
   write and present technical data. Research into curricula for
   Professional Communication is founded in current casework. All courses
   combine established theory with case studies and examples to provide a
   realistic context for participants to practise their skills. A sample of
   interviewees was drawn from the professional accreditation boards, for
   example, the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA), the South
   African Council for the Quantity Surveying Profession (SACQSP), allied
   professional bodies, industry stakeholders and potential employers.
   Comments from respondents were related to the PCS course and an
   assessment made of its relevance compared with the stated needs. It was
   concluded that technical professionals write extensively, often present
   complex data to varied audiences, and that communication skills taught
   in the PCS course are relevant.}},

Abstract = {{The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in response to various
   microenvironmental stimuli that regulate the survival and proliferation
   of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cells, including triggering of
   the B-cell receptor (BCR). Although this pathway is frequently targeted
   in cancer, no significant alterations have yet been identified in CLL.
   We now show that the phosphatase PH domain leucin-rich repeat protein
   phosphatase (PHLPP1), a recently identified tumor suppressor and
   negative regulator of the Akt kinase, is absent or expressed at
   substantially reduced levels in CLL B-cells. To determine what the
   consequences of PHLPP1 loss on BCR signaling are, we downregulated or
   re-expressed PHLPP1 in lymphoma cell lines and primary CLL B-cells,
   respectively. Downregulation of PHLPP1 increased BCR-induced
   phosphorylation and activation of the Akt, GSK3 and ERK kinases, whereas
   re-expression had the opposite effect. Importantly, re-expression of
   PHLPP1 in primary CLL cells prevented upregulation of Mcl-1 and
   inhibited the increase in leukemic cell viability induced by sustained
   BCR engagement. Enforced expression of PHLPP1 also affected the response
   to other microenvironmental stimuli, particularly in terms of ERK
   phosphorylation. Collectively, these data show that CLL cells lack an
   important negative regulator of the Akt and ERK pathways, which could
   confer them a growth advantage by facilitating the propagation of
   crucial microenvironment-derived stimuli. Leukemia (2010) 24, 2063-2071;

Abstract = {{Chronic injury to intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells (BDECs)

Abstract = {{Objective
   To investigate the incidence of caudal cruciate ligament (CaCL) damage
   in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR).
   Study Design
   Prospective clinical study.
   Animals
   Dogs (n=24) admitted for surgical stabilization of the stifle after CCLR
   and 8 healthy dogs with intact cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) and CaCL
   studied as controls.
   Methods
   Preoperative radiographs and stifle joint images (arthrotomy, 6;
   arthroscopy, 18) were collected from dogs with CCLR. Severity of
   arthritis, synovitis, CCL damage, and CaCL damage were assessed using
   numerical rating scales. The CaCL was probed to determine whether minor
   fraying or a full thickness defect in the ligament was present. Data
   collected from the study population were compared with the control
   population of dogs.
   Results
   The CaCL was damaged in 21/24 (88\%) of dogs with CCLR; 6/24 (25\%) had
   a full thickness defect in the CaCL. Severity of stifle synovitis and
   severity of damage to the CaCL were positively correlated (P <.05).
   Conclusions
   The CaCL is damaged in a high percentage of dogs with CCLR. A
   significant and positive correlation exists between the degree of
   synovitis present and the extent of CaCL damage.
   Clinical Relevance
   In dogs with CCLR, cruciate ligament pathology typically involves both
   the CCL and CaCL. As the severity of synovitis and the extent of CaCL
   damage are related, this observation supports the hypothesis that stifle
   synovitis may contribute to CCL and CaCL degeneration and subsequent
   damage.}},

Abstract = {{The titanium titanium alloy TA15(Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V) has been
   experimentally investigated to gain insight into the modeling of hot
   deformation via a microstructural evolution law. To predict grain size
   in the primary a phase of TA15 titanium alloy, computer code written in
   FORTRAN has been developed to exploit an improved back-propagation (BP)
   neural network model. A training paradigm inherent in this type of model
   was programmed in accordance with data from hot simulation experiments
   and quantitative metallurgic techniques. Results show that the models
   developed are highly accurate and estimation errors for the BP neural
   network model after training are less than 5\%. With additional
   interface subroutines, the code for this model has been embedded in the
   software DEFORM. A simulation module for microstructure evolution has
   been established and proved to be feasible. Isothermal extrusion of the
   TA15 alloy has been simulated and grain size predicted. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Auditory processing during sleep was investigated in premature infants
   by auditory event related potentials (AERPs). Twenty-six premature
   infants (mean GA 30 week- range 25-35) admitted to a neonatal intensive
   care unit were studied, prior to discharge, in active and quiet sleep at
   a mean post-conceptional age of 35 weeks. Infant state was determined by
   behavioral observation according to standard criteria. An auditory
   odd-ball paradigm was used with frequently occurring `standard' tones at
   1000 Hz and infrequent `deviant' tones at 2000 Hz. Waveforms were
   recorded at Fz. Cz, Pz, T3 and T4 scalp locations. Measurements were
   performed in 18 patients because 8 preterm infants were excluded since
   they had less than the required artifact-free deviant trials in each
   sleep state. The responses to standard tones were equally recorded in
   both active and quiet sleep, but auditory responses to deviant tones
   consisting of an increased frontal negativity in the time period from
   200 to 300 ms after the stimulus were recorded only in active sleep. A
   significant effect of electrode placement, for frontal location by sleep
   condition and sleep condition by 50 ms time windows was shown by
   repeated measures analyses of variance. The significance of these
   findings on evoked potential methodology in preterm infants admitted to
   neonatal intensive care unit is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland

   levels of NAA induce inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) to produce nitric

   several mutations including base change G -> T and deletion and enhances
   protein interaction in several genes. Therefore we hypothesize that

Abstract = {{To document the demographics, mechanisms and outcome of traumatic
   pancreatitis in children at a single large tertiary referral centre in
   Australia.
   We undertook a 10-year retrospective audit of children admitted to the
   Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia with a hospital coded
   diagnosis which included pancreatic injury between 1993 and 2002. Data
   included patient demographics, source of admission, mechanism of injury,
   pancreatic complications, associated injuries, intensive care unit
   admission, results of any operative findings, results of any acute
   computed tomography and/or ultrasound imaging of pancreas, selected
   laboratory findings and length of stay.
   We identified two distinct groups of patients in the 91 documented cases
   of pancreatic trauma (median age 8.0 years, range 0.6-15.8 years; M:F
   2.5:1.0): 59 had a history of abdominal trauma and elevated serum lipase
   but no CT or ultrasound evidence of pancreatic injury (Group A); 32 had
   a history of abdominal trauma, elevated serum lipase but also had CT
   scan and/or ultrasound evidence of pancreatic injury (Group B). Patients
   with ``less severe{''} injury based on normal imaging had a lower
   initial lipase level {[}Group A, median 651 U/L (interquartile range
   520-1,324) vs. Group B, 1,608 U/L (interquartile range 680-3,526); p =
   0.005] and shorter admission time {[}Group A, 9.0 days (interquartile
   range 5.5-15.5) vs. Group B, 13.4 days (interquartile range 6.8-23.8); p
   = 0.04]. There were no differences with respect to mortality (Group A,
   13.5\% vs. Group B, 12.5\%), but patients with evidence of injury on
   imaging were more likely to have surgical intervention (p = 0.0001). The
   single most important overall cause of pancreatic trauma was involvement
   in a motor vehicle accident as a passenger or pedestrian. However, in
   children with high-grade ductal injury, bicycle handlebar injuries were
   most common. Associated injuries were common in both groups.
   Significant pancreatic injury can occur in the absence of abnormality on
   medical imaging. Pancreatic trauma commonly occurs in the context of
   multiple injuries after motor vehicle accidents in children and bicycle
   handlebar injuries, especially in boys. Most children can be treated
   conservatively, with surgical intervention being limited to high-grade
   ductal injury.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   There is heightened recognition that the environment is an important
   driver of human reproductive health. This article provides an overview
   of the nature and extent of the science in the field of reproductive
   environmental health and its implications for OB/GYN clinical practice.
   Recent findings
   Women of childbearing age incur ubiquitous contact to numerous toxic
   environmental contaminants. Even subtle perturbations caused by chemical
   exposures during critical and sensitive windows of development may lead
   to increased risks of disease and disability across the entire span of
   human life. The strength of the evidence is sufficiently high that
   leading scientists and clinicians have called for timely action to
   prevent harm.
   Summary
   OB/GYNs are uniquely poised to intervene in critical stages of human
   development (i.e., preconception and during pregnancy) to prevent harm.
   Efforts are underway to provide clinicians with the evidence-based
   foundation to develop recommendations for prevention. If adopted,
   current directions in toxicity testing, risk assessment and policy are
   likely to create important changes in how environmental chemicals are
   evaluated and regulated in the future. Together, these changes have the
   potential to assist in clinical assessment of patient risk and
   reductions in patient exposure to environmental contaminants linked to
   adverse reproductive health outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Turbulent mixing in regular and fractal grid turbulence is investigated
   in this work by using direct numerical simulation (DNS). Two types of
   turbulence-generating grids are used: a biplane square grid (regular
   grid) and a square fractal grid. The thickness ratios t(r) of the
   fractal grids are set at 5.0 and 8.5. The grid solidity is maintained at
   sigma = 0.36 for all the grids. The mesh Reynolds number, Re-M =
   U0Meff/nu, is set at 2500 for all cases, where U-0 is the
   cross-sectionally averaged mean velocity; M-eff, the effective mesh
   size; and nu, the kinematic viscosity. The grids are numerically
   generated using the immersed boundary method at 4M(eff) downstream of
   the entrance to the computational domain. The computational domain size
   normalized by M-eff is 64 x 8 x 8 in the streamwise, vertical and
   spanwise directions for the regular grid and 64 x 16 x 16 for the
   fractal grids. Scalar mixing layers that initially have a step profile
   develop downstream of the grids. The Prandtl number is set at Pr = 0.71
   considering the heat transfer in air flow. Instantaneous temperature
   fields, instantaneous fluctuating temperature fields and fundamental
   turbulent statistics are presented. The results show that turbulent
   mixing is more strongly enhanced in fractal grid turbulence than in
   regular grid turbulence for the same Re-M. In fractal grid turbulence,
   turbulent mixing is more strongly enhanced at t(r) = 8.5 than at t(r) =
   5.0.}},

Abstract = {{Annihilation behaviors of irradiation defects induced by gamma-ray in
   Li2TiO3 were studied by means of ESR and compared to those by thermal
   neutron. The ESR spectra indicated that E `- and O--centers were formed
   after the gamma-ray irradiation and isochronal annealing experiments
   showed that the amounts of E `-and O--centers, which are Frenkel pair,
   decreased in the temperature range of 550-650 K for the gamma-ray
   irradiated sample, while for the thermal neutron irradiated one, those
   decreased in the lower temperature range of 400-500K. The activation
   energies of recombination reaction of E `-center and O--center were 0.68
   +/- 0.01 and 0.31 +/- 0.04 eV for the gamma-ray and the thermal neutron
   irradiated samples, respectively. In the gamma-ray irradiated sample,
   the formation of defects is resulted from electron-excitations but that
   in thermal neutron irradiated one is mainly resulted from collision of
   energetic particles. Comparing with the gamma-ray irradiated sample, it
   was found for the thermal neutron irradiated sample that O-2(-)-center
   would be easily formed and the recombination process of E `- and
   O-2(-)-centers would also take place. The processes of different defect
   formations like electron-excitation and collision processes, would
   produce the different defects such as O-- and O-2(-)-centers, leading to
   the different annihilation behaviors of irradiation defects. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES To identify the risk factors that would aid in the
   identification of patients at the greatest risk of developing
   postoperative paralytic ileus (POI). POI is a common complication after
   radical cystectomy and can result in a prolonged hospital stay and
   delayed recovery.
   METHODS A retrospective cohort study design was used to analyze data
   from consecutive patients presenting to our institution for radical
   cystectomy with pelvic nodal dissection. POI was declared if patients
   were without evidence of bowel function beyond the anticipated discharge
   goal of 6 days. The association between several clinical features and
   the occurrence of POI was examined.
   RESULTS Of 283 patients, 43 (15.2\%) developed POI. Of the 43 patients,
   38 (88.4\%) were given total parenteral nutrition for nutritional
   supplementation. No difference in the incidence of POI was observed
   between the sexes, previous abdominal operations, estimated blood loss,
   transfusion requirement, operative time, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or
   previous radiotherapy. POI was observed in 11.3\% of normal and
   overweight patients (body mass index {[}BMI] <30.0 kg/m(2)) compared
   with 25.6\% of obese patients (BMI >= 30.0 kg/m(2); P = .005). On
   multivariate analysis adjusted for the influence of competing variables,
   increasing age (hazard ratio 1.09, 95\% confidence interval 1.02-1.16, P
   = .008) and BMI (hazard ratio 1.09, 95\% confidence interval 1.03-1.17,
   P = .007) were significantly associated with the presence of POI.
   CONCLUSIONS Our results showed that increasing age and BMI were
   significantly associated with the presence of POI in patients undergoing
   radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. UROLOGY 76: 1419-1424, 2010.

Abstract = {{The cathodoluminescence (CL) intensities of Y(2)SiO(5): Ce(3+),
   Gd(2)O(2)S:Tb(3+) and SrAl(2)O(4):Eu(2+),Dy(3+) phosphor thin films that
   were grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) were investigated for
   possible application in low voltage field emission displays (FEDs) and
   other infrastructure applications. Several process parameters
   (background gas, laser fluence, base pressure, substrate temperature,
   etc.) were changed during the deposition of the thin films. Atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) was used to determine the surface roughness and
   particle size of the different films. The layers consist of agglomerated
   nanoparticle structures. Samples with good light emission were selected
   for the electron degradation studies. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)
   and CL spectroscopy were used to monitor changes in the surface chemical
   composition and luminous efficiency of the thin films. AES and CL
   spectroscopy were done with 2 keV energy electrons. Measurements were
   done at 1 x 10(-6) Torr oxygen pressure. The formation of different
   oxide layers during electron bombardment was confirmed with X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). New non-luminescent layers that formed
   during electron bombardment were responsible for the degradation in
   light intensity. The adventitious C was removed from the surface in all
   three cases as volatile gas species, which is consistent with the
   electron stimulated surface chemical reaction (ESSCR) model. For
   Y(2)SiO(5):Ce(3+) a luminescent SiO(2) layer formed during the electron
   bombardment. Gd(2)O(3) and SrO thin films formed on the surfaces of

Abstract = {{It has recently been proposed that prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), the
   cytosolic serine peptidase with neurological implications, binds GAP43
   (Growth-Associated Protein 43) and is implicated in neuronal growth cone
   formation, axon guidance and synaptic plasticity. We investigated the
   interaction between GAP43 and POP with various biophysical and
   biochemical methods in vitro and studied the co-localisation of the two
   proteins in differentiated HeLa cells. GAP43 and POP showed partial
   co-localisation in the cell body as well as in the potential growth cone
   structures. We could not detect significant binding between the
   recombinantly expressed POP and GAP43 using gel filtration, CD, ITC and
   BIACORE studies, pull-down experiments, glutaraldehyde cross-linking and
   limited proteolysis. However, glutaraldehyde cross-linking suggested a
   weak and transient interaction between the proteins. Both POP and GAP43
   interacted with artificial lipids in our in vitro model system, but the
   presence of lipids did not evoke binding between them. In native
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. GAP43 interacted with one of the
   three forms of a polyhistidine-tagged prolyl oligopeptidase. The
   interaction of the two proteins was also evident in ELISA and we have
   observed co-precipitation of the two proteins during co-incubation at
   higher concentrations. Our results indicate that there is no strong and
   direct interaction between POP and GAP43 at physiological conditions.

Abstract = {{A new scaling approach, based on the convective velocity obtained from
   the sun-exposed eastern slopes and thus suited for steep and narrow
   Alpine valleys, is investigated with respect to pollutant dispersion.
   The capability of the new method is demonstrated with the operational
   emergency response system of MeteoSwiss, which consists of the COSMO
   (COnsortium for Small-scale MOdelling) numerical weather prediction
   model coupled with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM). The
   new scaling approach is introduced to the interface between COSMO and
   LPDM, and is compared to results of a classical similarity theory
   approach and to the operational coupling type, which uses the turbulent
   kinetic energy (TKE) from the COSMO model directly. For the validation
   of the modelling system, the TRANSALP-89 tracer experiment is used,
   which was conducted in highly complex terrain in southern Switzerland.
   The ability of the COSMO model to simulate the valley wind system is
   assessed with several meteorological surface stations, and the
   dispersion simulation is evaluated with the measurements from 25 surface
   samplers. The sensitivity of the modelling system towards the soil
   moisture, horizontal grid resolution, and boundary-layer height
   determination is investigated, and it is shown that, if the flow field
   is correctly reproduced, the new scaling approach improves the tracer
   concentration simulation when compared to classical coupling methods.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variability, heritability along with genetic advance of traits,
   their association and direct and indirect effects on yield are essential
   for crop improvement. Ten mungbean genotypes were studied to assess
   variability and degree to which various plant traits associate with seed
   yield. Primary and secondary branches, pods per cluster and pod length
   showed lesser variability while clusters per plant, 100 seed weight and
   harvest index exhibited intermediate range of variability. Sufficient
   genetic variability was observed for plant height, pods per plant, total
   plant weight and seed yield. Moderate to high heritability estimates
   were found for all traits. Primary and secondary branches per plant, pod
   length and 100-seed weight exhibited negative and non significant
   genotypic and phenotypic correlations with seed yield. Plant height
   showed positive non-significant and significant genotypic and phenotypic
   correlation. Pods per cluster correlated significantly negative with
   seed yield. Clusters per plant, pods per plant, total plant weight and
   harvest index showed positive significant genotypic and phenotypic
   correlations with seed yield. Positive direct effects were exerted
   through secondary branches, pods per plant, pod length, 100 seed weight,
   total plant weight and harvest index while primary branches, plant
   height, clusters per plant and pods per cluster had negative direct
   effects. The present findings could be useful for establishing selection
   criteria for high seed yield in the mungbean breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Cultivated European rice germplasm is generally characterized by
   moderate to high sensitivity to blast, and blast resistance is therefore
   one of the most important traits to improve in rice breeding. We
   collected a panel of 25 rice genotypes containing 13 broad range rice
   resistance genes that are commonly used in breeding programs around the
   world: Pi1, Pi2, Pi5, Pi7, Pi9, Pi33, Pib, Pik, Pik-p, Pita, Pita (2) ,
   Piz and Piz-t. The efficiency of the selected Pi genes towards Italian
   blast pathotypes was tested via artificial inoculation and under natural
   field infection conditions. To characterize haplotypes present in the
   chromosomal regions of the blast resistance genes, a polymorphism search
   was conducted in the sequence regions adjacent to the blast resistance
   by examining DNA from the Pi gene donors with a panel of 5-7 potential
   receivers (cultivated European rice genotypes). Seven InDel and 8
   presence/absence polymorphisms were directly detected by gel analysis
   after DNA amplification, while sequencing of 12.870 bp through 32 loci
   in different genotypes revealed 85 SNP (one SNP every 151 bp). Seven
   SSRs were additionally tested revealing 5 polymorphic markers between
   donors and receivers. Polymorphisms were used to develop 35 PCR-based
   molecular markers suitable for introgressing of Pi genes into a set of
   the European rice germplasm. For this last purpose, allelic molecular
   marker variation was evaluated within a representative collection of
   about 95 rice genotypes. Polymorphic combinations allowing introgression
   of the broad spectrum resistance genes into a susceptible genetic
   background have been identified, thus confirming the potential of the
   identified markers for molecular-assisted breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic allocation of resources to the best link in large multiuser
   networks offers considerable improvement in spectral efficiency. This
   gain, often referred to as multiuser diversity gain, can be cast as
   double-logarithmic growth of the network throughput with the number of
   users. In this paper, we consider large cognitive networks granted
   concurrent spectrum access with license-holding users. The primary
   network affords to share its underutilized spectrum bands with the
   secondary users. We assess the optimal multiuser diversity gain in the
   cognitive networks by quantifying how the sum-rate throughput of the
   network scales with the number of secondary users. For this purpose, we
   look at the optimal pairing of spectrum bands and secondary users, which
   is supervised by a central entity fully aware of the instantaneous
   channel conditions, and show that the throughput of the cognitive
   network scales double-logarithmically with the number of secondary users
   (N) and linearly with the number of available spectrum bands (M), i.e.,
   M log log N. We then propose a distributed spectrum allocation scheme,
   which does not necessitate a central controller or any information
   exchange among different secondary users and still obeys the optimal
   throughput scaling law. This scheme requires that some secondary
   transmitter-receiver pairs exchange log M information bits among
   themselves. We also show that the aggregate amount of information
   exchange between secondary transmitter-receiver pairs is asymptotically
   equal to M log M. Finally, we show that our distributed scheme
   guarantees fairness among the secondary users, meaning that they are
   equally likely to get access to an available spectrum band.}},

Abstract = {{Macrocyclic boronic esters of different sizes can be prepared
   selectively from the same starting diboronic acid and 1,2-diol by means
   of an interesting dynamic self-assembly phenomena. More specifically,
   two kinds of macrocyclic boronic esters could be formed
   diastereoselectively and nearly quantitatively under neutral conditions
   by the addition of an appropriate guest molecule that acts as a
   template. Although a mixture of tetrol 1 and di(boronic acid) 2 in
   methanol gave only insoluble polymeric boronic esters, a soluble
   macrocyclic boronic ester, homo-{[}2+2], was obtained selectively in the
   presence of toluene as a guest molecule. Furthermore, when benzene was
   employed as a guest molecule, the selective formation of another
   macrocyclic boronic ester, hetero-{[}3+3], occurred. Interestingly, each
   of these macrocycles could be converted into the other in the presence
   of methanol and the appropriate guest molecule; however, under aprotic
   conditions, guest molecules encaged by the macrocyclic boronic ester
   could be exchanged without affecting its structure. Thus the presence or
   absence of a protic solvent could be used as a regulator to switch on or
   off the dynamic equilibrium of the system. In addition, investigation of
   the effect of reaction time, direct observation of the reaction mixture
   by NMR spectroscopy, and carrying out the reaction using optically
   active tetrol suggested that precipitation plays an essentially
   important role in the selective formation of the macrocyclic boronic
   esters. Thus, although both of {[}2+2] and {[}3+3] were present as
   solutes in the reaction mixture, the type of added guest molecule
   induced the selective precipitation of only one form of macrocyclic
   boronic ester, hence displacing the equilibrium of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Vapor phase treatment (VPT) is a pretreatment with hydrofluoric acid
   vapor to raise the sensitivity of total reflection X-ray fluorescence
   spectroscopy (TXRF) for trace metal analysis on silicon wafers. The
   International Organization for Standardization/Technical Committee
   201/Working Group 2 (ISO/TC201/WG2) has been investigating the method to
   analyze 10(9) atoms/cm(2) level of metallic contamination on the silicon
   wafer surface. Though VPT can enhance the TXRF signal intensity from the
   metallic contamination, it has turned out that the magnitude of the
   enhancement varies with the type of methods and the process conditions.
   In this study, approaches to increase TXRF intensity by VPT are
   investigated using a fuming chamber in an automated VPD instrument.
   Higher signal intensity can be obtained when condensation is formed on
   the sample surface in a humidifying atmosphere and with a decreasing
   stage temperature. Surface observations with SEM and AFM show that
   particles with similar to 4 mu m in diameter are formed and unexpectedly
   they are dented from the top surface level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

   uses differentially coherent detection. We fabricated the modulator
   monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) and demodulator MMIC with
   0.1-mu m-gate InP HEMTs. The test element of the modulator had a static
   error-vector magnitude of 10\%. We mounted the modulator and demodulator

Abstract = {{A cognitive radio will have to sense and discover the spectral
   environments where it would not cause primary radios to interfere Be
   cause the primary radios have the right to use the frequency the
   cognitive radios as the secondary radios must detect radio signals
   before use How ever the secondary radios also need identifying the
   primary and other secondary radios where the primary radios are
   vulnerable to interference In this paper a method of simultaneously
   identifying signals of primary and secondary radios is proposed The
   proposed bandwidth differentiation assumes the primary and secondary
   radios use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the
   secondary radios use at the lower number of subcarriers than the primary
   radios The false alarm and detection probabilities are analytically
   evaluated using the characteristic function method Numerical evaluations
   are also conducted on the assumption the primary radio is digital
   terrestrial television broadcasting Result showed the pro posed method
   could achieve the false alarm probability of 0 1 and the detection
   probability of 0 9 where the primary and secondary radio powers were 2 5
   dB and 3 6 dB higher than the noise power In the evaluation the
   reception signals were averaged over the successive 32 snapshots and the
   both the primary and secondary radios used QPSK The power ratios were 4

Abstract = {{Negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) is one of the most
   powerful selective forces maintaining genetic polymorphisms in nature.
   Recently many prospective cases of polymorphisms by NFDS have been
   reported. Some of them are very complicated, although strongly
   supportive of the NFDS. Here we investigate NFDS in wild populations of
   the dimorphic damselfly Ischnura senegalensis, in which females occur as
   andromorphs and gynomorphs. Specifically, we (1) test fitness responses
   to morph frequencies, (2) built a simple population genetic model, and
   (3) compare the observed and predicted morph-frequency dynamics.
   Fitnesses of the two morphs are an inverse function of its own frequency
   in a population, and are about equal when their frequencies are similar.
   Thus the conditions necessary for NFDS are satisfied. The long-term
   field surveys show that the morph frequencies oscillate with a period of
   two generations. Morph frequencies in a small population undergo large
   oscillations whereas those in a large population do small oscillations.
   The demographic properties of the observed dynamics agree well with
   those of our model. This example is one of the simplest confirmed cases
   of NFDS maintaining genetic polymorphisms in nature.}},

Abstract = {{High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a monocyte-derived inflammatory
   mediator that is released in some conditions including shock, tissue
   injury, and endotoxin-induced lethality. In this study, we determined
   the plasma and hepatic tissue levels of HMGB1 in a drug-induced rat
   acute liver failure (ALF) model and investigated the effect of HMGB1
   blockade on ALF. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 250 to 300 g,
   were used for this study. D-galactosamine was injected into the penile
   vein to induce ALF. To determine HMGB1 levels, plasma and hepatic tissue
   samples were serially collected after the D-galactosamine injection. To
   test the effect of HMGB1 blockade, anti-HMGB1 polyclonal antibodies or
   control antibodies were injected into the penile vein right after
   injection of D-galactosamine. Levels of HMGB1 were increased in plasma
   and decreased in hepatic tissue after induction of ALF.
   Immunohistochemical examination for HMGB1 showed that liver from animals
   with ALF had little staining, whereas normal liver had strong staining
   in the nuclei. Injection of anti-HMGB1 antibodies resulted in
   significant suppression of plasma HMGB1 and hepatic enzymes, marked
   suppression of plasma inflammatory cytokines, marked improvement of
   histological findings, and significant improvement of survival. The
   decrease of hepatic HMGB1 was also significantly suppressed in the group
   injected with anti-HMGB1 antibodies. The present study suggests that in
   ALF, the liver may release HMGB1 into the plasma, and that neutralizing
   the released HMGB1 has a protective effect against injury.}},

Abstract = {{Podosomes are recently rediscovered highly dynamic actin-rich structural
   and functional modules that form close contact with the surrounding
   substrate. They play a role in the control of migration, tissue
   invasion, and matrix remodeling of highly motile cells, including
   lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts. In
   osteoclasts, the compaction of podosomes induces the formation of a
   tight adhesive contact, the sealing zone, which defines a
   subosteoclastic environment specialized for bone resorption. Integrins
   and the Rho family small GTPases are key regulators of podosome
   rearrangements. However, it remains to be determined how the activation
   of integrins and Rho family GTPases is regulated during osteoclast
   podosome rearrangements. Here, we demonstrate a crucial role for the
   FERM domain-containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), FARP2,
   in osteoclast podosome rearrangements and resorbing activity. We
   determine by live cell imaging and biochemical assays that FARP2 is
   required for localized activation of GTP-bound Rac1 into podosome-ring
   like structures. In addition, FARP2 is relevant to integrin beta 3
   activity during osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, FARP2 deficiency
   results in reduced formation of multinucleated osteoclasts and
   resorption pits compared to wild-type osteoclasts (controls).
   Collectively, our findings reveal an integral role of FARP2 for
   regulation of Rac1 and integrin beta 3 throughout podosome rearrangement
   in osteoclastogenesis.-Takegahara, N., Kang, S., Nojima, S., Takamatsu,

Abstract = {{The vocal tract shape is three-dimensionally complex. For accurate
   acoustic analysis, a finite-difference time-domain method was introduced
   in the present study. By this method, transfer functions of the vocal
   tract for the five Japanese vowels were calculated from
   three-dimensionally reconstructed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.
   The calculated transfer functions were compared with those obtained from
   acoustic measurements of vocal tract physical models precisely
   constructed from the same MRI data. Calculated transfer functions agreed
   well with measured ones up to 10 kHz. Acoustic effects of the piriform
   fossae, epiglottic valleculae, and inter-dental spaces were also
   examined. They caused spectral changes by generating dips. The amount of
   change was significant for the piriform fossae, while it was almost
   negligible for the other two. The piriform fossae and valleculae
   generated spectral dips for all the vowels. The dip frequencies of the
   piriform fossae were almost stable, while those of the valleculae varied
   among vowels. The inter-dental spaces generated very small spectral dips
   below 2.5 kHz for the high and middle vowels. In addition, transverse
   resonances within the oral cavity generated small spectral dips above 4
   kHz for the low vowels. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America. {[}DOI:

   Nb3Al were examined by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) because
   transgranular fracture prevents the observation of fractured cross
   sections of Nb3Al to statistically determine the grain size. The grain
   size distributions of body-centred-cubic supersaturated-solid-solution
   Nb(Al)(ss) and A15 Nb3Al filaments were measured for grains misoriented
   by more than 2 degrees, 5 degrees and 15 degrees. A mixed grain
   structure, which consists of a few large grains (>25 mu m) and many
   small grains (<1 mu m), was observed for an Nb3Al filament that had been
   transformed from non-deformed Nb(Al)(ss). Plastic deformation that had
   been made between the rapid heating and quenching steps and the
   transformation step apparently homogenized the grain size distribution
   and then reduced the average grain size. The misorientation angle
   distributions of Nb(Al)(ss) and Nb3Al were also measured and compared
   with each other. A clear relationship between the J(c) and the inverse
   grain size was not confirmed for the RHQT Nb3Al conductors examined in
   the present study, which indicates the importance of making a filament
   compositionally homogeneous to obtain a high J(c).}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Two cotton vacuolar-invertase genes were identified and sequenced. Both
   genes had seven exons, including an unusually small second exon typical
   of acid invertases. These genes encode peptides with many features
   shared by acid invertases from other species including, leader sequences
   that probably target the peptide to the vacuole, active site motifs and
   substrate binding motifs. Expression analyses indicated that one of the
   genes was expressed in roots during the starch filling stage of
   development. However, expression of the same gene fluctuated during the
   starch utilization stage of development. Therefore this gene was
   unlikely to play a role in determining sink strength of this tissue.
   Both genes were expressed in elongating fibers where they were likely to
   play a role in cell expansion. The invertase gene uniquely expressed in
   fiber had a simple sequence repeat (SSR) in the third intron that was
   polymorphic among various cotton species. An EST was identified with an
   expansion of the SSR that included the third intron indicating this SSR
   is associated with a splice variant. The polymorphic SSR may be useful
   in investigating the function of this gene in fiber development.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decades, different types of decompositions have been
   processed in the field of graph theory. In various problems, for example
   in the construction of recognition algorithms, frequently appears the
   so-called weakly decomposition of graphs.
   Polar graphs are a natural extension of some classes of graphs like
   bipartite graphs, split graphs and complements of bipartite graphs.
   Recognizing a polar graph is known to be NP-complete. For this class of
   graphs, polynomial algorithms for the maximum stable set problem are
   unknown and algorithms for the dominating set problem are also
   NP-complete.
   In this paper we characterize the polar graphs using the weakly
   decomposition, give a polynomial time algorithm for recognizing graphs
   that are both trivially perfect and polar, and directly calculate the
   domination number. For the stability number and clique number, we give
   polynomial time algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Among a number of urban adolescents in Malaysia, going online is a much
   valued practice. They are regularly drawn to the Internet to engage in
   activities across school, nonschool, mainstream and alternative domains.
   The aim of this study is to know more about what these adolescents do
   online. Data on the online activities were collected from 535
   adolescents (333 male and 202 female Year 10 students) in five urban
   secondary schools in Penang, Malaysia. It was found that while English
   was formally learnt as a second language in school, the percentages of
   language use on the Internet as indicated by them were: 77.06\% in
   English, 8.16\% in Bahasa Malaysia and 14.72\% in Chinese. The
   participants' Internet activities and popular websites showed their
   preference for entertainment and social networking. The overall trend
   was towards using the receptive skills of reading and listening rather
   than the productive skills of creating written output. Based on the
   trends observed, the paper concludes with some implications for ESL
   education, in Malaysia and other similar contexts. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   +CD8 T cells in the genital tract were positive for CD127 and KLRG1 and
   negative for CD62L and CCR7, thus confirming that HSV-specific CD8 cells
   were effector memory T cells that lack the capacity for homing to
   lymphoid tissues. Functionally, both memory CD8+ and CD4+ HSV-specific
   populations in the genital tract produced IFN gamma when stimulated in
   vitro and CD4+ cells also produced TNF alpha. Genital HSVgB-specific
   memory T cells expressed tissue-homing integrins CD103 (alpha E
   integrin) and CD49a (VLA-1 or alpha 1 integrin). Our findings suggest
   that HSV-specific memory T cells are retained in the genital tract,
   poised to act as an early line of defense against future virus
   encounter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A model is developed to represent mechanical strain, stress-enhanced
   dissolution, and shear dilation as innately hysteretic and interlinked
   processes in rough contacting fractures. The model is incorporated into
   a numerical simulator designed to examine permeability change and
   thermal exchange in chemically active and deformable fractured
   reservoirs. A candidate engineered geothermal reservoir system (EGS) is
   targeted. The mechanistic model is able to distinguish differences
   between the evolution of fluid transmission characteristics of (1) small
   scale, closely spaced fractures, and (2) large-scale, more widely spaced
   fractures. Alternate realizations of fracture frequency and scale,
   exhibiting identical initial bulk permeability, lead to significantly
   different conclusions regarding permeability evolution and thermal
   drawdown within the reservoir. Reactivation, primarily through
   mechanical shear, of pervasive, large-scale fractures is shown capable
   of causing both hydraulic and thermal short circuiting. Small variations
   in fracture scale impact the balance between the efficiency of thermal
   transfer and the rate of fluid circulation. Stress-enhanced chemical
   dissolution, initially at equilibrium within the reservoir, may be
   reactivated as fractures are forced out of equilibrium during hydraulic
   fracturing. At the conditions examined (250 degrees C reservoir with 70
   degrees C injection), however, shear dilation exerts dominant control
   over changes to permeability. Heterogeneity in permeability, generated
   from a normal distribution of fracture spacing, impacts thermal
   breakthrough times at the withdrawal well, as well as withdrawal rates.
   For the given conditions, spatial variability over similar to 1 order of
   magnitude leads to a reduction of similar to 10\% in withdrawal rates
   compared to a spatially uniform system. Permeability is a strongly
   dynamic property and at geothermal conditions is influenced by the full
   suite of THMC interactions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The recycling of suitable organic wastes can enhance soil fertility via
   effects on soil physical, chemical and biological properties. To compare
   the effects of digested (DS), thermally dried (TDS) and composted
   dewatered (CDS) sewage sludge on soil microbiological properties, an
   experiment was conducted at field sites for more than one year (401 d)
   when applied to two Mediterranean degraded soils (loam and loamy sand
   soils). All three types of sewage sludge had a significant effect on
   measured parameters. In a short time, the plots of both loamy sand and
   loam soils amended with TDS showed the highest microbial basal
   respiration (loam soil: P<0.01; loamy sand soil: P<0.001) and carbon
   mineralization coefficient (loam soil: P<0.01; loamy sand soil:
   P<0.001). Furthermore, on loamy sand soil, the plots amended with TDS
   showed the highest microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) (P<0.05). This
   study revealed that the addition of sludge caused transient
   non-equilibrium effects on almost all soil microbial properties.
   However, there were no differences one year later because the remaining
   organic carbon was stable and quite similar in all treatments. These
   results may have practical implications for the rehabilitation of
   degraded soils.}},

Abstract = {{To further understand the population structures of the Japanese badgers
   (Meles anakuma) on the Japanese islands, we analyzed their bi-parentally
   inherited microsatellites. Based on genotypes of nine microsatellite
   loci, the badgers were divided into five discrete clusters: three
   clusters from the Honshu Island, one from Kyushu and one from Shikoku.
   We propose that this genetic differentiation among badgers from the
   Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu Islands is as a consequence of geographical
   isolation caused by the Seto Inland Sea. Furthermore, the cluster
   containing individuals from Shikoku was more differentiated from the
   other clusters, plausibly attributable to the earlier geological
   separation of the Shikoku Island from the Honshu and Kyushu Islands. The
   three clusters in Honshu, however, did not correspond precisely with
   geographical locations. As indicated in previous studies, based on
   mitochondrial DNA analysis, the genetic relationships within the
   Japanese badgers might reflect recent population expansion, occurring
   over a relatively short evolutionary time-scale. The findings
   preliminarily indicate that the Japanese badgers do not possess the high
   levels of philopatry seen in the European badger (Meles meles), a
   closely related species, although further analyses using balanced sample
   sizes from a wider range is required.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To identify sociodemographic factors associated with patterns
   of incidence, remission and stability of depressive symptoms in
   community-dwelling elderly individuals.
   METHODS: prospective study was conducted, where 310 community-dwelling
   elderly individuals of the city of Juiz de Fora, Southeastern Brazil,
   were interviewed between 2002 and 2004. Follow-up (T2) was performed
   15.7 months after the first interview (T1). Depressive symptoms were
   evaluated with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.
   Elderly individuals were classified according to the progression of
   depressive symptoms and compared in terms of sociodemographic variables
   with Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's exact test.
   RESULTS: There were no differences in the prevalence of depressive
   symptoms between T1 and T2 (33.8\%). A total of four groups were
   identified, according to the progression of symptoms from the first to
   the second measure: without depressive symptoms (50.9\%); recurrence
   (19.7\%); incidence (15.2\%); and remission (14.2\%). Scoring for
   depression in T1, being female and having a low level of education
   represented risks of manifesting depressive symptoms in T2.
   CONCLUSIONS: The worst progressions of depressive symptoms (incidence
   and recurrence) were associated with the female gender.}},

Abstract = {{Model-driven methods have been quite effective for reducing the
   intricacies of embedded software development, since they provide
   effective means for property verification as well as automatic code
   generation. Nevertheless, regarding energy-constrained hard real-time
   systems, few model-driven methods are available and, usually, most
   methods (model-driven or not) consider simplified system specifications,
   such as absence of intertask relations. This paper presents a
   model-driven method for software synthesis of hard real-time embedded
   applications with energy constraints. A formal model based on time Petri
   nets is adopted in order to provide a basis for pre-runtime schedule
   generation and property analysis/verification}},

Abstract = {{Advances in piezoelectric materials have attracted interests among
   researchers to develop new non-destructive evaluation and monitoring
   techniques. In this study, piezoceramic (m) sensors were embedded in
   concrete by bonding the sensors on steel reinforcing bars to perform
   non-destructive monitoring. To evaluate the performance of the PZT
   sensors and electromechanical impedance (EMI) sensing technique, a
   series of experiments was carried out to monitor the bond development
   between steel rebar and concrete by measuring the electrical response of
   the Pit bonded to the steel rebar using an impedance analyzer. From the
   EMI measurements, the gradual adhesion between the steel rebar and fresh
   concrete could be detected via the measured changes in the conductance
   spectra of the Pit sensor bonded to the steel rebar. The bond
   development could be attributed to the transformation of concrete from
   liquid to solid state controlled by the hydration of cement and by
   monitoring the hydration of concrete with respect to time, the status of
   bonding can be estimated. The results show that the early-age
   development of bonding between steel rebar and concrete is affected by
   various factors such as varying water-cement ratio, low curing
   temperature and poor compaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Tidal evolution of close binary asteroid systems}},
Journal = {{CELESTIAL MECHANICS \& DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{108}},

Pages = {{315-338}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We provide a generalized discussion of tidal evolution to arbitrary
   order in the expansion of the gravitational potential between two
   spherical bodies of any mass ratio. To accurately reproduce the tidal
   evolution of a system at separations less than 5 times the radius of the
   larger primary component, the tidal potential due to the presence of a
   smaller secondary component is expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials
   to arbitrary order rather than truncated at leading order as is
   typically done in studies of well-separated system like the Earth and
   Moon. The equations of tidal evolution including tidal torques, the
   changes in spin rates of the components, and the change in semimajor
   axis (orbital separation) are then derived for binary asteroid systems
   with circular and equatorial mutual orbits. Accounting for higher-order
   terms in the tidal potential serves to speed up the tidal evolution of
   the system leading to underestimates in the time rates of change of the
   spin rates, semimajor axis, and mean motion in the mutual orbit if such
   corrections are ignored. Special attention is given to the effect of
   close orbits on the calculation of material properties of the
   components, in terms of the rigidity and tidal dissipation function,
   based on the tidal evolution of the system. It is found that accurate
   determinations of the physical parameters of the system, e.g.,
   densities, sizes, and current separation, are typically more important
   than accounting for higher-order terms in the potential when calculating
   material properties. In the scope of the long-term tidal evolution of
   the semimajor axis and the component spin rates, correcting for close
   orbits is a small effect, but for an instantaneous rate of change in
   spin rate, semimajor axis, or mean motion, the close-orbit correction
   can be on the order of tens of percent. This work has possible
   implications for the determination of the Roche limit and for spin-state
   alteration during close flybys.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Research on knowledge cultivation often focuses on explicit forms of
   knowledge. However, knowledge can also take a tacit form-a form that is
   often difficult or impossible to tease out, even when it is considered
   critical in an educational context. A review of the literature revealed
   that few studies have examined tacit knowledge issues in online learning
   environments. The purpose of this study was to develop a greater
   understanding of the conditions and processes that help promote the
   sharing or cultivation of tacit knowledge in a formal online course
   setting. Using naturalistic inquiry as the methodology of this study, an
   online graduate business course offered at a private, non-profit United
   States-based university was purposively selected as the research site.
   The study found that the online course encouraged processes and created
   conditions consistent with Nonaka's model of knowledge creation and the
   concept of ba (or shared context)-encouraging students to share, and to
   construct knowledge through socialization, externalization, combination,
   and internalization. The results suggest that purposefully developing a
   ba-like environment may be a useful approach to facilitating online
   learning, creating a strong potential to support learning processes
   necessary for students to cultivate tacit knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the optimal use of technical terms in advertising can help

   consumer attitudes towards the ad and consumer evaluation of the
   advertised product for thinking (products meeting consumer utilitarian
   needs) and high involvement products. For thinking and low involvement
   products, using two technical terms together with detailed/rough

   evaluation of the advertised product. Moreover, using two unexplained
   technical terms improves consumer attitudes towards the ad for feeling
   (those providing consumer gratification, social acceptance and sensory

Abstract = {{Introduction: Motorcycles vary in design and performance capability, and
   motorcyclists may select certain motorcycle types based on driving
   preferences. Conversely, motorcycle performance capability may influence
   the likelihood of risky driving behaviors such as speeding. Both
   mechanisms may affect fatal crash risk when examined by motorcycle type.
   Although it was not possible to estimate the effect of each mechanism,
   the current study analyzed fatal crash data for evidence of motorcycle
   type differences in risky driving behaviors and risk of driver death.
   Methods: Street legal motorcycles were classified into 10 types based on
   design characteristics and then further grouped as cruiser/standard,
   touring, sport touring, sport/unclad sport, supersport, and all others.
   For each motorcycle type, driver death rates per 10,000 registered
   vehicle years and the prevalence of fatal crash characteristics such as
   speeding were analyzed. Differences among motorcycle types concerning
   the effect of engine displacement were examined using Poisson
   regression. Results: Overall, driver death rates for supersport
   motorcycles were four times as high as those for cruiser/standard
   motorcycles. Fatally injured supersport drivers were most likely to have
   been speeding and most likely to have worn helmets, but least likely to
   have been impaired by alcohol compared with drivers of other motorcycle
   types. The patterns in driver factors held after accounting for the
   effects of age and gender. Increased engine displacement was associated
   with higher driver death rates for each motorcycle type. Conclusion:
   Strong effects of motorcycle type were observed on driver death rates
   and on the likelihood of risky driving behaviors such as speeding and
   alcohol impairment. Although the current study could not completely
   disentangle the effects of motorcycle type and rider characteristics
   such as age on driver death rates, the effects of both motorcycle type
   and rider age on the likelihood of risky driving behaviors were observed
   among fatally injured motorcycle drivers. Impact on Industry: Certain
   motorcycle designs, particularly supersport motorcycles, are associated
   with increases in risky driving behaviors and higher driver death rates.
   At present, there are no proven countermeasures for this situation.
   However, existing countermeasures such as helmet laws and automated
   speed enforcement could have a substantial benefit. (C) 2010 National

Abstract = {{Compact Dry X-SA (CD-XSA), a ready-to-use and self-diffusible dry medium
   sheet culture system for the detection and enumeration of Staphylococcus
   aureus, was evaluated. A total of 50 S. aureus strains, which were
   studied for the inclusivity study, grew as blue-colored colonies on the
   CD-XSA. When 114 bacteria other than S. aureus and 3 yeasts were
   inoculated for the exclusivity study, 37 strains produced white
   colonies, and 4 strains produced blue colonies, and 3 strains produced
   magenta colonies, while 73 other strains failed to grow.
   The CD-XSA method was compared with the mannitol salt agar with egg yolk
   (MSEY) method, the Baird-Parker agar (BP) method and the 3M Petrifilm
   (TM) STX (3M-STX) method in 105 artificially contaminated food samples.
   The correlation coefficients between CD-XSA and MSEY, CD-XSA and BP, and

Abstract = {{A front-tracking method for compressible multi-fluid flows is presented,
   where marker points are used both for tracking fluid interfaces and also
   for constructing the Riemann problem on the interfaces. The Riemann
   problem between the two fluid phases (defined in the interface normal
   direction) is solved using the exact Riemann solver on the marker
   points. The solutions are projected onto fixed grid points and then
   extrapolated into the corresponding ghost-fluid regions, to be used as
   boundary conditions. Each fluid phase is solved separately as in the
   ghost-fluid method. The proposed procedures, especially the projection
   of the exact Riemann solutions onto the fluid grids, are designed to be
   simple and consistent in any spatial dimensions. Several multi-fluid
   problems, including the breakup of a water cylinder induced by the
   passage of a shock wave were computed in order to demonstrate the
   capability of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We propose a conceptual framework for understanding the (lack of) energy
   saving efforts of private households based on Bandura's (1986) social
   cognitive theory Results from applying this framework on a sample of
   Danish private electricity consumers are presented and it is concluded
   (a) that households' electricity consumption depends on both structural
   and motivational factors, (b) that their electricity saving effort
   depends on the strength of their internalized norms or self-expectations
   and on self-efficacy related factors, and (c) that there are predictable
   patterns of interaction among household members that influence their
   electricity consumption The results suggest two approaches to promote
   electricity saving in households (1) to change the socio-structural
   environment to be more facilitating for energy saving and empower
   householders to be more effective in their striving towards this goal
   through improved feedback about their household's electricity
   consumption and (2) social norms marketing, communicating social
   expectations and others' successful electricity saving achievements (C)

Abstract = {{This clinical report reviews the currently known health benefits of
   probiotic and prebiotic products, including those added to commercially
   available infant formula and other food products for use in children.
   Probiotics are supplements or foods that contain viable microorganisms
   that cause alterations of the microflora of the host. Use of probiotics
   has been shown to be modestly effective in randomized clinical trials
   (RCTs) in (1) treating acute viral gastroenteritis in healthy children;
   and (2) preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea in healthy children.
   There is some evidence that probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis
   in very low birth weight infants (birth weight between 1000 and 1500 g),
   but more studies are needed. The results of RCTs in which probiotics
   were used to treat childhood Helicobacter pylori gastritis, irritable
   bowel syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and infantile colic, as well
   as in preventing childhood atopy, although encouraging, are preliminary
   and require further confirmation.
   Probiotics have not been proven to be beneficial in treating or
   preventing human cancers or in treating children with Crohn disease.
   There are also safety concerns with the use of probiotics in infants and
   children who are immunocompromised, chronically debilitated, or
   seriously ill with indwelling medical devices. Prebiotics are
   supplements or foods that contain a nondigestible food ingredient that
   selectively stimulates the favorable growth and/or activity of
   indigenous probiotic bacteria. Human milk contains substantial
   quantities of prebiotics. There is a paucity of RCTs examining
   prebiotics in children, although there may be some long-term benefit of
   prebiotics for the prevention of atopic eczema and common infections in
   healthy infants. Confirmatory well-designed clinical research studies
   are necessary. Pediatrics 2010;126:1217-1231}},

Pages = {{341-346}},

Abstract = {{Relatively few studies have aimed to test if invasive species have
   positive effects on native species, for example via formation of habitat
   or by amelioration of environmental stress-conditions. The red macroalga
   Graciloria vermiculophylla, from the West Pacific, is invading estuarine
   mudflat and scagrass habitats along East Pacific and East and West
   Atlantic coastlines. I tested if low (55-110 g WW m(-2)) and high
   (220-440 g WW m(-2)) densities of G. vermiculophylla have positive or
   negative effects on the macroinvertebrates (> 2 mm) that inhabit Zostera
   marina seagrass beds. The experiment was conducted over 34 days at both
   0.5 and 2 m depth at Snaptun Harbor, Denmark. I found positive effects
   of Gracilaria on most invertebrates, with statistically significant
   results for ``all invertebrates{''}, ``gastropods{''}, and
   ``bivalves{''}, and a near-significant result for ``crustaceans{''}.
   Both quantitative and qualitative habitat-resource models may explain
   these positive effects; i.e. ``more habitats{''} exist in the presence
   of Gracilaria and/or the ``habitat differs{''} between Gracilaria and
   Zostera vegetation. Future studies should test these two general
   explanatory models and quantify (a) if density thresholds exists were
   effects shift from positive to negative, (b) specific mechanism whereby
   positive effects occur, (c) if Gracilaria provide a novel or substitute
   drift algal habitat, and (d) the larger-scale ecosystem implications of
   this invasion.}},

Abstract = {{The reference design of the IFMIF target and test cell (TTC) which is
   summarized in the comprehensive design report (CDR) is reviewed and
   evaluated. Improved ITC conceptual designs, as well as a revision of the
   reference design, have been proposed in order to qualify precise and
   flexible positioning of test modules against the backplate in the ITC.
   As the result of evaluations on the existing design concepts, a
   referential table which addresses the design requirements and guidelines
   has been released and is outlined in this paper. Based on the
   referential table and the existing design concepts a modular TTC concept
   is introduced, developed, and improved aimed on providing variable

Abstract = {{In recent years, many research works indicate that human's visual
   attention is very helpful in some research areas that are related to
   computer vision, such as object recognition, scene understanding and
   object-based image/video retrieval or annotation. This paper presents a
   visual attention model for natural scenes based on a dynamic feature
   combination strategy. The model can be divided into three parts, which
   are feature extraction, dynamic feature combination and salient objects
   detection. First, the saliency features of color, information entropy
   and salient boundary are extracted from an original colored image. After
   that, two different evaluation measurements are proposed for two
   different categories of feature maps defined in this dynamic combination
   strategy, which measures the contribution of each feature map to
   saliency and carries out a dynamic weighting of individual feature maps.
   Finally, salient objects are located from an integrated saliency map and
   a computational method is given to simulate the location shift of the
   real human visual attention. Experimental results show that this model
   is effective and robust for saliency detection in natural scenes, also
   similar to the real human visual attention mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A 73-year-old male patient with hypertension and hyperglycemia was
   referred to our hospital because of a diagnosis regarding his left
   adrenal tumor. Because the levels of urinary metanephrine and
   normetanephrine were elevated, and 131I-MIBG scintigraphy showed intense
   uptake in the adrenal tumor, the tumor was diagnosed as a
   pheochromocytoma. An adrenalectomy was carried out. Severe polyuria,
   which was accompanied by a rapid decrease in central venous pressure,
   started 1 hour after the operation. Urine output of more than 8000
   mL/day continued until the 16th postoperative day. Plasma antidiuretic
   hormone (ADH) levels were within the normal range. Plasma human atrial
   natriuretic peptide (hANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were
   elevated postoperatively, and the elevation of these peptides was one
   possible cause for the severe polyuria. Because ADH levels in the tumor
   fluid were not elevated, the tumor was not an ADH-secreting tumor.
   Urinary beta 2-microglobulin was significantly elevated after the
   operation, thus suggesting that renal tubule dysfunction might also have
   been involved in the polyuria. However, the mechanism of polyuria after
   the resection of adrenal pheochromocytoma is not fully understood.
   Polyuria after the resection of adrenal pheochromocytoma is extremely
   rare, and the present subject is the second case to date.}},

Abstract = {{Prior to the creation of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families,
   federal legislation primarily positioned mothers in the private sphere
   of parenting and men in the public sphere of work. Welfare reform
   changed this citizenship construction dramatically, requiring mothers to
   work but failing to acknowledge their caretaking responsibilities. This
   article presents a discourse and content analysis of the welfare reform
   debate that directly referenced citizenship. Findings suggest that
   legislators emphasized paid work as a citizenship activity while rarely
   portraying parenting as such. Furthermore, legislators' endorsement of
   paid work as a duty of citizenship, and the manner in which they paired
   this endorsement with the minimizing of parenting as such a duty, may
   have further diminished the perception of parenting as a valuable
   citizenship activity. Welfare reform may have been possible because the
   heretofore recognized citizenship work of mothering was largely ignored
   in the congressional debate.}},

Abstract = {{Wavelet analysis has found widespread use in signal processing and many
   classification tasks. Nevertheless, its use in dynamic pattern
   recognition have been much more restricted since most of wavelet models
   cannot handle variable length sequences properly. Recently, composite
   hidden Markov models which observe structured data in the wavelet domain
   were proposed to deal with this kind of sequences. In these models,
   hidden Markov trees account for local dynamics in a multiresolution
   framework, while standard hidden Markov models capture longer
   correlations in time. Despite these models have shown promising results
   in simple applications, only generative approaches have been used so far
   for parameter estimation. The goal of this work is to take a step
   forward in the development of dynamic pattern recognizers using wavelet
   features by introducing a new discriminative training method for this
   Markov models. The learning strategy relies on the minimum
   classification error approach and provides re-estimation formulas for
   fully non-tied models. Numerical experiments on phoneme recognition show
   important improvement over the recognition rate achieved by the same
   models trained using maximum likelihood estimation. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Hybrid genetic algorithms (GA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) are
   not new in the machine learning culture. Such hybrid systems have been
   shown to be very successful in classification and prediction problems.
   However, little attention has been focused on this architecture as a
   feature selection method and the consequent significance of the ANN
   activation function and the number of GA evaluations on the feature
   selection performance. The activation function is one of the core
   components of the ANN architecture and influences the learning and
   generalization capability of the network. Meanwhile the GA searches for
   an optimal ANN classifier given a set of chromosomes selected from those
   available. The objective of the GA is to combine the search for optimum
   chromosome choices with that of finding an optimum classifier for each
   choice. The process operates as a form of co-evolution with the eventual
   objective of finding an optimum chromosome selection rather than an
   optimum classifier. The selection of an optimum chromosome set is
   referred to in this paper as feature selection. Quantitative comparisons
   of four of the most commonly used ANN activation functions against ten
   GA evaluation step counts and three population sizes are presented.
   These studies employ four data sets with high dimension and low
   significant datum instances. That is to say that each datum has a high
   attribute count and the unusual or abnormal data are sparse within the
   data set. Results suggest that the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation
   function outperforms other common activation functions by extracting a
   smaller, but more significant feature set. Furthermore, it was found
   that fitness evaluation sizes ranging from 20,000 to 40,000 within
   populations ranging from 200 to 300, deliver optimum feature selection
   capability. Again, optimum in this sense meaning a smaller but more
   significant feature set.}},

Abstract = {{Bioenergy generation by combustion is an alternative utilization of
   biomass from semi-natural grasslands no longer needed for forage
   production. Variability of fuel composition affects the suitability of
   grassland herbage for combustion, in terms of ash-related problems and
   harmful emissions of N, S and Cl compounds. A field experiment was
   established at six semi-natural grassland sites in southwest Germany to
   investigate the importance of botanical composition, harvest date and
   site effects in influencing fuel composition. The first growth at each
   site was harvested at five dates from June to October. Concentrations of
   N, S, K, Ca, Mg and ash were lower in grasses than forbs. Between June
   and October, K concentrations decreased and Ca concentrations increased
   in grasses and forbs. Ash concentration increased only in grasses, while
   yields remained stable. Considerable site effects were also found,
   particularly for K and Cl. The findings are discussed in relation to
   knowledge of combustion technology. Fuel composition of the investigated
   grassland biomass was less suitable for combustion than that of
   perennial energy grasses, but comparable to that of cereal straw. Most
   critical parameters were high N concentrations, cause of NOx emissions,
   and high ash, K and Cl concentrations, responsible for particle
   emissions, fouling and corrosion. Although combustion of semi-natural
   grassland biomass for small-scale residential boilers cannot be
   recommended currently, results of this study suggest that utilization in
   medium-scale combustion units may offer realistic perspectives, creating
   synergies between bioenergy production and biodiversity conservation.}},

   16, 2010; doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.01423.2009.-We quantified energy
   production in 7 prepubescent boys (11.7 +/- 0.6 yr) and 10 men (35.6 +/-
   7.8 yr) using P-31-magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate
   whether development affects muscle energetics, given that resistance to
   fatigue has been reported to be larger before puberty. Each subject
   performed a finger flexions exercise at 0.7 Hz against a weight adjusted
   to 15\% of their maximal voluntary strength for 3 min, followed by a
   15-min recovery period. The total energy cost was similar in both groups
   throughout the exercise bout, whereas the interplay of the different
   metabolic pathways was different. At the onset of exercise, children
   exhibited a higher oxidative contribution (50 +/- 15\% in boys and 25
   +/- 8\% in men, P < 0.05) to ATP production, whereas the phosphocreatine
   breakdown contribution was reduced (40 +/- 10\% in boys and 53 +/- 12\%
   in men, P < 0.05), likely as a compensatory mechanism. The anaerobic
   glycolysis activity was unaffected by maturation. The recovery phase
   also disclosed differences regarding the rates of proton efflux (6.2 +/-
   2.5 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.9 mM.pH unit(-1).min(-1), in boys and men,
   respectively, P < 0.05), and phosphocreatine recovery, which was
   significantly faster in boys than in men (rate constant of
   phosphocreatine recovery: 1.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4 min(-1); V-max:
   37.5 +/- 14.5 vs. 21.1 +/- 12.2 mM/min, in boys and men, respectively, P
   < 0.05). Our results obtained in vivo clearly showed that maturation
   affects muscle energetics. Children relied more on oxidative metabolism
   and less on creatine kinase reaction to meet energy demand during
   exercise. This phenomenon can be explained by a greater oxidative
   capacity, probably linked to a higher relative content in slow-twitch
   fibers before puberty.}},

Abstract = {{An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) combined with the Advanced Research
   Weather Research and Forecasting model (ARW-WRF; hereafter WRF) on a
   36-km Atlantic basin domain is cycled over six different time periods
   that include the 10 tropical cyclones (TCs) selected for the NOAA
   High-Resolution Hurricane (HRH) test. The analysis ensemble is generated
   every 6 h by assimilating conventional in situ observations, synoptic
   dropsondes, and TC advisory position and minimum sea level pressure
   (SLP) data. On average, observation assimilation leads to smaller TC
   position errors in the analysis compared to the 6-h forecast; however,
   the same is true for TC minimum SLP only for tropical depressions and
   storms. Over the 69 HRH initialization times. TC track forecasts from a
   single member of the WRF EnKF ensemble has 12 h less skill compared to
   other operational models; the increased track error partially results
   from the WRF EnKF analysis having a stronger Atlantic subtropical ridge.
   For nonmajor TCs, the WRF EnKF forecast has lower TC minimum SLP and
   maximum wind speed errors compared to some operational models,
   particularly the GFDL model, while category-3, -4, and -5 TCs are
   characterized by large biases due to horizontal resolution. WRF
   forecasts initialized from an EnKF analysis have similar or smaller TC
   track, intensity, and 34-kt wind radii errors relative to those
   initialized from two other operational analyses, which suggests that
   EnKF assimilation produces the best TC forecasts for this domain. Both
   TC track and intensity forecasts are deficient in ensemble variance,
   which is at least partially due to the lack of error growth in dynamical
   fields and model biases.}},

Abstract = {{The cover of large trees in African savannahs is rapidly declining,
   mainly due to human land-use practices. Trees improve grass nutrient
   quality and contribute to species and structural diversity of savannah
   vegetation. However, the response of herbivores to trees as habitat
   features is unknown We quantified the habitat use of wild and domestic
   ungulates in two eastern and southern African savannahs. We assessed
   grazing intensities and quantified dung depositions beneath and around
   canopies of different sized trees. Grasses were eaten and dung was
   deposited twice as frequently beneath large (ca. 5 m in height) and very
   large trees (7-10 m) than in open grasslands. Small trees (<2.5 m) did
   not show this trend. Grazing intensity and dung deposition decreased
   with distance away from trees at both study sites. These results suggest
   that large trees represent essential habitat features for domestic and
   wild herbivores. Increased dung depositions beneath large trees may
   further promote the maintenance of a patchy nutrient distribution in
   savannahs. Small trees cannot provide the same structural and functional
   advantages as large trees do. We recommend that land-use practices be
   promoted which conserve large single-standing trees to benefit the flora
   and fauna of African savannahs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{High-grade cervical dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) type
   16 is a lesion that should be susceptible to an HPV-specific immune
   response; disease initiation and persistence is predicated on expression
   of two viral Ags, E6 and E7. In immune-competent subjects, at least 25\%
   of HPV16(+) high-grade cervical dysplasia lesions undergo complete
   regression. However, in the peripheral blood, naturally occurring
   IFN-gamma T cell responses to HPV E6 and E7 are weak, requiring ex vivo
   sensitization to detect, and are not sufficiently sensitive to predict
   regression. In this study, we present immunologic data directly
   assessing cervical lymphocytes from this cohort. We found that nearly
   all cervical tissue T cells express the mucosal homing receptor,
   alpha(4)beta(7) surface integrin. T cells isolated from dysplastic
   mucosa were skewed toward a central memory phenotype compared with
   normal mucosal resident T cells, and dysplastic lesions expressed
   transcripts for CCL19 and CCL21, raising the possibility that the tissue
   itself sustains a response that is not detectable in the blood.
   Moreover, lesion regression in the study window could retrospectively be
   predicted at study entry by the ability of CD8(+) T cells to gain access
   to lesional epithelium. Vascular endothelial expression of mucosal
   addressin cell adhesion molecule-1, the ligand that supports entry of
   alpha(4)beta(+)(7) T cells into tissues, colocalized tightly with the
   distribution of CD8 T cells and was not expressed in persistent
   dysplastic epithelium. These findings suggest that dysregulated
   expression of vascular adhesion molecules plays a role in immune evasion
   very early in the course of HPV disease. The Journal of Immunology,
   2010, 185: 7107-7114.}},

Abstract = {{Completed in 1465, the Collectio antiquitatum ( Modena, Bibl. Estense
   Ms. Lat. 992) largely comprises illustrated transcriptions of ancient
   Latin and Greek inscriptions and monuments, and consequently its content
   has been identified as proto-archaeological. Its seeming historicism is
   belied by the inclusion of a series of full-page drawings depicting
   Roman sites that exhibit notable anachronisms and inventions. This
   article argues, rather, that many of them adapt a form of visual
   word-play originally used in classical rhetoric to recall past events.
   An examination of Marcanova's work in light of premodern theory about
   memory as mental process and Renaissance cultural practices further
   reveals how it functioned as a vehicle for historical commemoration
   rather than objective documentation.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic bone segmentation of computed tomography (CT) images is an
   important step in image-guided surgery that requires both high accuracy
   and minimal user interaction. Previous attempts include global
   thresholding, region growing, region competition, watershed
   segmentation, and parametric active contour (AC) approaches, but none
   claim fully satisfactory performance. Recently, geometric or
   level-set-based AC models have been developed and appear to have
   characteristics suitable for automatic bone segmentation such as
   initialization insensitivity and topology adaptability. In this study,
   we have tested the feasibility of five level-set-based AC approaches for
   automatic CT bone segmentation with both synthetic and real CT images:
   namely, the geometric AC, geodesic AC, gradient vector flow fast
   geometric AC, Chan-Vese (CV) AC, and our proposed density distance
   augmented CV AC (Aug. CV AC). Qualitative and quantitative evaluations
   have been made in comparison with the segmentation results from standard
   commercial software and a medical expert. The first three models showed
   their robustness to various image contrasts, but their performances
   decreased much when noise level increased. On the contrary, the CV AC's
   performance was more robust to noise, yet dependent on image contrast.
   On the other hand, the Aug. CV AC demonstrated its robustness to both
   noise and contrast levels and yielded improved performances on a set of
   real CT data compared with the commercial software, proving its
   suitability for automatic bone segmentation from CT images.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The objective of this study was to investigate the
   relationship between microvascular and macrovascular disturbances in
   patients with type 2 diabetes, as shown by results of ophthalmological
   examination and by vascular and perfusion examinations of the lower
   limbs.
   Material and methods: A total of 85 patients with type 2 diabetes and an
   additional cardiovascular risk factor were enrolled in the study. All
   patients underwent complex ophthalmological examination, including
   fundus colour photography and fluorescein angiography, and were divided
   into two groups: group I with signs of diabetic non-proliferative
   retinopathy (NPDR), and group II with signs of diabetic proliferative
   retinopathy (P/PDR). After collection of the general medical history and
   analysis of medical data, patients underwent vascular and muscle
   perfusion examination of the lower limbs.
   Results: In the P/PDR group, disturbances of lower-limb perfusion were
   more frequent than in the NPDR group. Analysis of the blood flow and
   results of lower-limb muscle perfusion for the two groups showed a
   significant relationship with the severity of microvascular
   complications observed in examination of the fundus.
   Conclusions: Ophthalmological assessment of the progression of diabetic
   retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes is a reliable indicator of
   the changes in peripheral vessel systems and perfusion defects in the
   lower limbs.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of foam cells in the intima is a hallmark of early-stage
   atherosclerotic lesions. Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) has been
   reported to exert anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties in
   atherosclerosis, yet the significance and the molecular mechanisms of
   action of EGb761 in the formation of macrophage foam cells are not fully
   understood.
   Treatment with EGb761 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in oxidized
   low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-mediated cholesterol accumulation in
   macrophages, a consequence that was due to a decrease in cholesterol
   uptake and an increase in cholesterol efflux. Additionally, EGb761
   significantly down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of class A
   scavenger receptor (SR-A) by decreasing expression of activator protein
   1 (AP-1); however, EGb761 increased the protein stability of ATP-binding
   cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) by reducing calpain activity without
   affecting ABCA1 mRNA expression. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting
   haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) abolished the EGb761-induced protective effects
   on the expression of AP-1, SR-A, ABCA1, and calpain activity.
   Accordingly, EGb761-mediated suppression of lipid accumulation in foam
   cells was also abrogated by HO-1 siRNA. Moreover, the lesion size of
   atherosclerosis was smaller in EGb761-treated, apolipoprotein
   E-deficient mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice, and the
   expression of HO-1, SR-A, and ABCA1 in aortas was modulated similar to
   that observed in macrophages.
   These findings suggest that EGb761 confers a protection from the
   formation of foam cells by a novel HO-1-dependent regulation of
   cholesterol homeostasis in macrophages.}},

Abstract = {{Variability and correlation among bulb yield and yield related traits of
   twenty five local garlic accessions was studied at Chilga, North Gondar
   Zone, Ethiopia during 2005 and 2006. Highly significant differences
   (P<0.01) among accessions were recorded for yield and its contributing

   Moreover, very little difference was found in between genotypic and
   phenotypic coefficient of variation indicating the variability among
   accessions were mainly characterized by their genetic constitution,
   whereas the environmental influence was very low. Comparatively high
   heritability coupled with high expected genetic advance as percent of
   mean was recorded for bulb dry weight, dry weight above ground, yield
   per plant, biological yield per plant, plant height, leaf length, weight
   of clove and cloves per bulb. Bulb yield per plant showed positive and
   significant phenotypic correlation with all characters except harvest
   index and days to maturity. Genotypic correlations were higher in
   magnitude than that of phenotypic correlations for the majority of the

   characters except leaf length, dry weight above ground and bulb dry
   weight exerted positive direct effect on bulb yield per plant at

Abstract = {{By applying a homogenization method based on systematic
   full-electrodynamic complex-band-structure calculations, we deduce the
   effective permittivity tensor of a uniaxial photonic crystal consisting
   of consecutive hexagonal arrays of aligned metallic nanorods of finite
   length. The form of the obtained permittivity tensor over a relatively
   broad low-frequency region, where homogenization is applicable, suggests
   the occurrence of unconventional refractive behavior, namely, negative
   refraction and self-collimation. This behavior is corroborated by
   straightforward calculation of the relevant group velocities in the
   actual photonic crystal. Moreover, it is shown that, in the frequency
   region where negative refraction occurs, a finite slab of the crystal
   possesses eigenmodes that form flat bands outside the light cone, as
   many as the number of its constituent layers. These eigenmodes allow for
   transfer of the evanescent components of an incident wave field to the
   other side of the slab, thus enabling subwavelength imaging. (C) 2010

   patients and 16 controls without neurological disorders were examined
   for frontal cognitive function and writing ability. To assess writing
   errors statistically, we scored them on their composition ability with
   the original writing error index (WEI). The ALS and control groups did
   not differ significantly with regard to age, years of education, or
   general cognitive level. Two patients could not write a letter because
   of disability of the dominant hand. The WEI and results of picture
   arrangement tests indicated significant impairment in the ALS patients.
   Auditory comprehension (Western Aphasia Battery; WAB IIC) and kanji
   dictation also showed mild impairment. Patients' writing errors
   consisted of both syntactic and letter-writing mistakes. Omission,
   substitution, displacement, and inappropriate placement of the phonic
   marks of kana were observed; these features have often been reported in
   Japanese patients with agraphia resulted from a frontal lobe lesion. The
   most frequent type of error was an omission of kana, the next most
   common was a missing subject. Writing errors might be a specific deficit
   for some non-demented ALS patients.}},

Abstract = {{The sentinel node (SN) concept has been found to be feasible in gastric
   cancer. However, the lymphatic network of gastric cancer may be more
   complex, and it may be difficult to visualize all the SN distributed in
   unexpected areas by conventional modalities. In this study, we evaluate
   the feasibility and efficacy of CT lymphography for the detection of SN
   in gastric cancer. A total 24 patients with early gastric cancer were
   enrolled in the study. Three modalities (CT lymphography, dye and
   radioisotope {[}RI] methods) were used for the detection of SN. The
   images of CT lymphography were obtained at 10 min after injection of
   contrast agents. The SN were successfully identified by CT lymphography
   in 83.3\% of patients; detection rates by the dye and RI methods were
   95\% and 100\%, respectively. Most patients, in whom SN were
   successfully detected by CT lymphography, had positive results at 5 min
   after injection of the contrast material. The SN stations detected by CT
   lymphography were consistent with or included those detected by dye
   and/or RI methods. In conclusion, CT lymphography for the detection of
   SN in gastric cancer is feasible and has several advantages. However,
   based on this initial experience, CT lymphography had a relatively low
   detection rate compared with conventional methods, and further efforts
   will be necessary to improve the detection rate and widen the clinical
   application of CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric
   cancer. (Cancer Sci 2010; 101: 2586-2590).}},

Abstract = {{Impairments of attention are cardinal features of attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and can seriously affect the daily life of
   children with ADHD. Despite effective treatment strategies, there is a
   need of further treatment options that can be added to available and
   well established treatments. Further treatment options are needed since
   available treatments are often time consuming, expensive and limited
   regarding their external validity. Recent research demonstrated that gum
   chewing has beneficial effects on cognition including certain aspects of
   attention. Therefore, gum chewing may benefit children with ADHD in
   situations requiring particular cognitive efforts. In a crossover study,
   attentional functioning of 32 children with ADHD and 32 children without
   the condition was examined. All participants were assessed with chewing
   gum and without chewing gum. A computerized test was used for the
   assessment of vigilance and sustained attention. The findings of the
   present study suggest that gum chewing during task execution has
   detrimental effects on vigilance of both healthy children and children
   with ADHD. Sustained attention was not affected by gum chewing. Chewing
   gum, therefore, appears not to improve attentional performance in
   children with ADHD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: After breast conservative treatment (BCT), young age is a
   predictive factor for recurrence in patients with Ductal Carcinoma In
   Situ (DCIS) of the breast. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
   predictive factors for recurrence and outcomes in these younger women
   (under 40 years) treated for pure DCIS.
   Methods: From 1974 to 2003, 207 cases were collected in 12 French Cancer
   Centers. Median age was 36.3 years and median follow-up 160 months.
   Seventy four (35.8\%) underwent mastectomy, 67 (32.4\%) lumpectomy alone
   and 66 (31.9\%) lumpectomy plus radiotherapy.
   Results: 37 recurrences occurred (17.8\%): 14 (38\%) were in situ and 23
   (62\%) invasive. After BCT the overall rate of recurrence was 27\% (33\%
   in the lumpectomy plus radiotherapy group vs. 21\% in the lumpectomy
   alone group). Comedocarcinoma subtype (p = 0.004), histological size
   more than 10 mm (p = 0.011), necrosis (p = 0.022) and positive margin
   status (p = 0.019) were statistically significant predictive factors for
   recurrence. The actuarial 15-year rates of local recurrence were 29\%,
   42\% and 37\% in the lumpectomy alone, lumpectomy and whole breast
   radiotherapy and lumpectomy + whole breast radiotherapy with additional
   boost groups respectively. After recurrence, the 10-year overall
   survival rate was 67.2\%.
   Conclusion: High recurrence rates (mainly invasive) after BCT in young
   women with DCIS are confirmed. BCT in this subgroup of patients is
   possible if clear and large margins are obtained, tumor size is under 11
   mm and necrosis- and/or comedocarcinoma-free. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The pathotypes of Cercospora beticola, causal agent of sugar beet leaf
   spot disease, were identified by application of pathogenicity test using
   100 isolates obtained from the provinces with intensive sugar beet
   cultivation. For the identification of pathotypes, five sugar beet
   cultivars were used each with different resistance factors. Cultivar
   reactions were determined by inoculation of cultivars with the isolates
   under controlled conditions and measuring disease severity on the 15(th)
   day according to the 1-9 KWS Scale. Based on the reactions of the five
   cultivars, a total of 15 pathotypes were detected. All employed sugar
   beet cultivars were resistant to Pathotype no:1 comprising most of the
   isolates. Genetic diversity of the causal agent was characterized by
   AFLP reaction. The products acquired at the end of AFLP reaction were
   detected by means of Beckman CEQ 8800 DNA Capillary Series Analysis and
   the results obtained were evaluated according to the similarity index
   UPGMA. For the genetic analysis of C. beticola isolates, 9874
   polymorphic fragments of sizes between 100 and 500 bp were analysed
   which were generated by nine primers. The dendrogram derived from AFLP
   analysis depicted the existence of five different subgroups. The
   polymorphism rate among isolates was 91.13\% and the dendrogram
   distribution of the pathotypes obtained by pathogenicity indicated that
   pathotypes were not discriminated and did not compose any groups.}},

Abstract = {{The dusty surfaces of post-flotation wastes contain high concentrations
   of toxic compounds and spread widely if appropriate vegetation is not
   introduced. It has been previously established that effective
   restoration of such waste areas are best met by xerothermic,
   mycorrhiza-assisted plants (Turnau et al. Plant and Soil 305:267-280,
   2008). The aim of the current study was to improve phytostabilisation
   practices by gaining insight into the elements uptake in plants after
   their change of habitat. Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence (TXRF) was
   employed to evaluate element concentration in the leaves of 23 plant
   species growing in the wild and on Zn-Pb waste. Higher levels of heavy
   metals (Zn, Y, As, Pb, Cu) in plants from tailings were usually
   accompanied by increased Ca concentration, suggesting a possible role of
   this element in detoxification mechanisms. Also, when compared to
   grassland specimens, plants from the tailings, exhibited
   potassium-deficiency. Thus, K-supplementation of the waste substrata
   should be considered to improve plant growth. Among all the introduced
   plants, three grass species (Melica transsilvanica, Bromus inermis,
   Elymus hispidus) and one legume (Anthylis vulneraria) were the most
   suitable for phytostabilisation. Heavy metal-accumulating properties of
   Verbascum thapsus need further investigation.}},

   basic philosophical idea of intuitionism is that mathematical entities
   exist only as mental constructions and that the notion of truth of a
   proposition should be equated with its verification or the existence of
   proof. However different intuitionists explained the existence of a
   proof in fundamentally different ways. There seem to be two main
   alternatives: the actual and potential existence of a proof. The second
   proposal is also understood in two alternative ways: as knowledge of a
   method of construction of a proof or as knowledge-independent and
   tenseless existence of a proof. This paper is a presentation and
   analysis of these alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: We studied the epidemiological trends of enteric fevers
   (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) in Singapore from 1990 to 2009 and
   carried out a review of the current prevention and control measures.
   Materials and Methods: Epidemiological records of all reported enteric
   fevers maintained by the Communicable Diseases Division, Ministry of
   Health from 1990 to 2009 were analysed. Results: A total of 2464
   laboratory confirmed cases of enteric fevers (1699 cases of typhoid and
   765 cases of paratyphoid) were reported. Of these, 75\% were imported,
   mainly from India and Indonesia. There had been a significant fall in
   the mean annual incidence rate of indigenous enteric fevers from 4.3 per
   100,000 population in 1990 to 0.26 per 100,000 population in 2009
   (P<0.005) with a corresponding increase in the proportion of imported
   cases from 71\% between 1990 and 1993 to 92\% between 2006 and 2009
   (P<0.0005). Imported cases involving foreign contract workers increased
   significantly from 12.8\% between 1990 and 1993 to 40.4\% between 2006
   and 2009 (P<0.0005). Conclusion: Singapore has experienced a marked
   decline in the incidence of enteric fevers that is now comparable to
   that of other developed countries. Continued vigilance and proactive
   measures that address the changing epidemiology of enteric fevers in
   Singapore are necessary to sustain the milestone achieved in the past 2
   decades. Ann Acad Med Singapore 2010;39:889-96}},

Abstract = {{Development of electrical insulation coatings, which insulate an induced

   for the research and development of self-cooled liquid metal blanket

   coating is extremely important from the viewpoint of the secure

   sol-gel (SG) method to fabricate an Al(2)O(3) coating, and discusses the
   feasibility of the SG coating as an electrical insulation coating for
   the PbLi through the electrical insulation test in the molten PbLi pool
   and the SEM with EDS analysis on the SG coating structure. The present
   study shows that the SG coating will be a potential electrical
   insulation coating for PbLi with both the operation time and the

Abstract = {{The quality of governance is known to have effects on deforestation,
   together with other social and economic factors. However, assessing the
   impact of governance quality is a challenging task due to the complex
   and diverse mechanisms of deforestation as well as limited data
   availability. In this paper, interrelations between governance quality
   and deforestation rates are analysed on a global scale, using national
   data on governance quality and deforestation. Results indicate an
   increase in governance quality tends to be associated with a decrease in
   deforestation rates (i.e., a lower level of deforestation). The paper
   then discusses the limitations of the quantitative assessment, including
   data issues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Measles virus (MV)-PNP H(blind)antiCD20 is a CD20-targeted and prodrug
   convertase-armed MV that temporarily controls growth of lymphoma
   xenografts in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice in
   combination with fludarabine phosphate (fludarabine). Herein, we examine
   the replication of this targeted virus and of a vaccine-lineage MV in
   disease bulks and circulating cells from mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
   patients, and show that only the targeted virus is specific for
   CD20-expressing cells. We then assessed the efficacy of different
   regimens of administration of this virus in combination with fludarabine
   and cyclophosphamide (CPA) in an MCL xenograft model. We show that CPA
   administration before the beginning of virus treatment enhances
   oncolytic efficacy, likely through temporary immunosuppression. An
   interval of 1 week between intravenous virus administration and
   fludarabine treatment further enhanced oncolysis, by synchronizing
   maximum prodrug convertase expression with fludarabine availability.
   Finally, three 23-day courses of triple sequential treatment with CPA,
   virus and fludarabine treatment resulted in complete regression of the
   xenografts. Secondary disease symptoms interfered with survival, but
   average survival times increased from 22 to 77 days. These studies
   document a reprogrammed oncolytic virus, consolidating the effects of
   two chemotherapeutics, a concept well suited for a phase I clinical
   trial for MCL patients for whom conventional therapies have failed. Gene

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the level of intraocular penetration of
   diclofenac sodium and ketorolac tromethamine into the aqueous humour and
   subretinal fluid.
   Design: Prospective randomized clinical trial.
   Participants: Twenty eyes scheduled for retinal detachment surgery and
   17 eyes scheduled for cataract surgery.
   Methods: Patients with retinal detachment were randomly assigned to
   receive either topical ketorolac (n = 11) or topical diclofenac (n = 9).
   Subretinal fluid samples were collected 30-60 minutes after the
   administration of the last dose. In addition, 17 patients with cataract
   were randomly assigned to receive topical ketorolac (n = 9) or topical
   diclofenac (n = 8). The aqueous humour samples were collected 30 minutes
   after the administration of the last dose. Drug concentrations were
   determined by high-performance liquid chromatography fluorescence.
   Results: The mean diclofenac concentration in the subretinal fluid was
   42.31 (SD 24.89) ng/mu L. Ketorolac was undetectable in the subretinal
   fluid in all patients who received it because ketorolac tromethamine
   levels were under the limit of detection. In the aqueous humour, mean
   diclofenac concentration was 4.98 (SD 4.56) ng/mu L, and mean ketorolac
   concentration was 20.17 (SD 12.21) ng/mu L. Topical administration of
   diclofenac sodium yielded 8.4 times greater drug concentration in the
   subretinal fluid than in the aqueous humour. Aqueous humour
   concentrations of ketorolac were higher than those of diclofenac (p =
   0.019).
   Conclusions: The concentration in the subretinal fluid of topically
   applied diclofenac was higher than that of ketorolac; and topical
   ketorolac penetrated into the aqueous humour better than diclofenac did.
   This suggests that diclofenac can be used more effectively in events
   related to posterior segment and ketorolac in anterior segment events.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, an increasing number of techniques have been
   developed to reproduce high dynamic range imagery on traditional
   displays. These techniques, known as Tone Mapping Operators (TMOs), have
   been compared and ranked in different ways according to several image
   characteristics. However, none of these algorithms has been developed
   specifically for small screen devices (SSD). In this paper, we present
   an evaluation of currently used TMOs to show that SSDs with limited
   size, resolution and colour depth require specific research to find or
   create an appropriate solution. The research described in this paper is
   based on psychophysical experiments; using three different types of
   displays (CRT, LCD and SSD). The obtained results show that rankings
   obtained are similar for the LCD and CRT but are significantly different
   for the SSD. Furthermore, these rankings show additionally that some
   characteristics of TMOs need to be emphasized to obtain better
   high-fidelity mapped images for SSDs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Various methods of impact assessment for health library
   services exist, including a toolkit developed for the UK. The Knowledge,
   Resource and Information service (KRIS) for health promotion, health
   service commissioning and public health (Bristol area, UK) commissioned
   an independent team at Aberystwyth University to provide an impact
   assessment and evaluation of their services and to provide evidence for
   future planning.
   Objective: The review aimed to provide an action plan for KRIS through
   assessing the impact of the current service, extent of satisfaction with
   existing services and views on desirable improvements.
   Methods: Existing impact toolkit guidance was used, with an adapted
   impact questionnaire, which was distributed by the KRIS staff to 244
   users (response rate 62.3\%) in early 2009. The independent team
   analysed the questionnaire data and presented the findings.
   Results: Users valued the service (93\% considered that relevant
   information was obtained). The most frequent impacts on work were advice
   to patients, clients or carers, and advice to colleagues. Literature
   searching and current awareness services saved staff time. Many users
   were seeking health promotion materials.
   Conclusion: The adapted questionnaire worked well in demonstrating the
   service impacts achieved by KRIS, as well as indicating desirable
   improvements in service delivery.}},

Abstract = {{During reflux cooling, proper evaluation of behavior of accumulated
   non-condensable gases in the steam generator (SG) U-tubes is important
   to predict the performance of the reflux cooling. Non-condensable gases
   are present in the pressurizer and the possibility of migration of air
   in the pressurizer to the SG U-tubes is not well known. Steam and air
   behavior in the pressurizer during reflux cooling was, therefore,
   analyzed numerically using FLUENT 6.3.26 and the possibility of
   migration of air to the hot leg was investigated. For the analysis, the
   pressurizer of the ROSA-IV/LSTF experiment was employed as a calculation
   domain, since experimental data about the loss of the residual heat
   removal event during mid-loop operation are available. Two stages were
   assumed. (1) Phase 1: latent heat accumulated in the wall of the
   pressurizer and was eventually released to the outside. (2) Phase 2: the
   wall was heated up to the saturated steam temperature, and only heat
   loss to the outside occurred. The prediction indicated that in Phase 1,
   the air did not migrate to the surge line in either laminar or turbulent
   flow calculations, while in Phase 2 the air migrated into the hot leg
   only in the laminar flow calculation. Judging from a previous experiment
   on an axisymmetric free jet, the flow pattern in the pressurizer seems
   to be turbulent. In addition, a comparison of the analytical results of
   the fluid temperatures near the wall of pressurizer with ROSA-IV/LSTF
   experiment results indicated that the turbulent flow calculation results
   were more realistic. It was therefore concluded that the turbulent flow
   calculation was more reasonable and the possibility of migration of air
   to the hot leg was low in a pressurizer during reflux cooling. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Purpose: To present outcomes of combined pars plana vitrectomy, silicone
   oil (SO) injection, and permanent keratoprosthesis (Kpro) procedure in
   prephthisical eyes.
   Methods: All 3 patients were monocular with chronic severe hypotony,
   aphakia, and total corneal opacity in their vital eye. Preoperative
   visual acuity ranged from light perception to counting fingers at 1
   foot. Two patients had a history of failed corneal grafts because of SO,
   and one had funnel retinal detachment. Pars plana vitrectomy and
   long-term SO tamponade were performed, and a permanent Boston type 1
   Kpro was used in lieu of a donor corneal transplantation.
   Results: No unexpected intraoperative complications were encountered.
   Patients were followed for a period of 11-13 months. All patients had
   anatomic success with an attached retina and a clear visual axis. The
   procedures resulted in increased visual function in all patients ranging
   from hand motions to 20/800. No case has progressed to phthisis bulbi
   during the follow-up period. At the last visit, biomicroscopic
   examination revealed clear Kpro with an attached retina.
   Conclusions: Boston type 1 Kpro implantation, as the primary corneal
   procedure with pars plana vitrectomy and intraocular SO, may be a viable
   option in selected patients with prephthisical eyes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a robust control of voltage fluctuation due to the

   system using Static Var Compensator (SVC) and Automatic Voltage

   system modeling, a normalized coprime factorization is applied to
   represent possible unstructured uncertainties in the power system such
   as variation of system parameters and generating and loading conditions.
   Based on the H-infinity loop shaping, the performance and robust
   stability conditions of the control system are formulated as the
   optimization problem. The genetic algorithm is applied to solve an
   optimization problem and to achieve PI control parameters of SVC and AVR

Title = {{A hybrid finite difference-finite element method to incorporate

Volume = {{183}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Finite difference (FD) and finite element (FE) approximations are two
   commonly used methods for solving Poisson's equation from a known
   electrical resistivity model. FD discretizes the model with rectangular
   blocks, while FE discretizes it with right triangular elements. The
   advantage of FD is that it requires less computational time and memory
   storage, while the advantage of FE is its ability to handle topography.
   Here we introduce a hybrid FD-FE algorithm which requires less
   computational resources than a typical FE algorithm but can still handle
   topography. The model is first discretized as FD rectangular blocks.
   Some of these FD rectangular blocks beneath topographical features are
   replaced with FE right triangular elements. A system of equations for
   the hybrid method is then formed according to the types of
   discretization used. The system is a linear combination of the FD and FE
   equations. All three methods are applied to several models with and
   without topography. Comparisons in terms of computational time, memory
   and accuracy show that, as expected, FD is a better choice when modeling
   without topography, whereas FE is more practical when modeling with
   topography. However, our developed hybrid FD-FE method is efficient in
   both circumstances. Without topography, it behaves exactly like FD. With
   topography, it is as accurate as FE but its speed and memory usage are
   slightly larger than FD. In addition, we describe a scheme for automatic
   mesh generation. This scheme has led to another variant method, a mixed
   grid hybrid method. Our hybrid scheme and the automatic grid generation
   can be used for slopes of up to 75 degrees. This hybrid method can be
   further extended and implemented for 3D DC resistivity modeling for more
   efficient computation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Passive fluid mounts have been in use for the purpose of cabin noise and
   vibration reduction in the automotive and the aerospace industry for
   many years. Cabin noise and vibration isolation are provided at a
   frequency coined ``notch frequency{''}. The design location of the notch
   frequency depends on the application, but in most applications, it is
   designed to coincide with the longest period of constant speed. To
   obtain the greatest reduction in cabin noise and vibration at any
   desired frequency, the notch frequency needs to be as close to that
   desired frequency as possible. Unfortunately, the conventional passive
   fluid mounts have some limitations. Firstly, due to tolerances on all
   the fluid mount dimensions, elastomer material property variations, and
   variation in elastomer molding processes, the notch frequency never ends
   up at the right location on the first manufacturing pass. To reduce the
   fluid mount notch frequency tuning cycle time, a new fluid mount design
   is proposed. This new design consists of a conventional single-pumper
   fluid mount and a 3-layer piezoelectric cantilever beam as a component
   that provides us a variable bottom chamber volumetric stiffness and in
   consequence a fluid mount with a tunable notch frequency. In this paper,
   the new design concept, and its mathematical model and simulation
   results will be presented.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Increased nasal nitric oxide (NO) is a marker for paranasal
   sinus ostial patency. However, there are no data evaluating the effect
   of systemic steroids on humming nasal NO in chronic rhinosinusitis with
   nasal polyposis (CRSNP).
   Objectives: To assess whether 2 weeks of oral steroids in CRSNP
   increases humming nasal NO, whether humming is a more sensitive
   indicator of this increase than other methods of measuring NO, and
   whether it correlates with improvements in clinical parameters for
   sinonasal disease.
   Methods: Adults with CRSNP (grade 2 and above) were treated with oral
   prednisolone, 25 mg/d for 2 weeks. Nasal NO was measured by aspiration,
   exhalation at 0.2 L.s(-1), and humming methods. Peak nasal inspiratory
   flow, Sinonasal Outcomes Test 20 score, symptoms, olfaction, and polyp
   grade were also measured before and after treatment.
   Results: Twelve patients (mean age, 49 years) completed the treatment.
   The differences in nasal NO before and after steroid treatment were
   significantly less pronounced as measured by geometric mean-fold ratio
   with aspiration (1.5; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.1 to 1.9; P =
   .009) and exhalation (2.1; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.9; P = .02) compared with
   the humming technique (4.9; 95\% CI, 2.2 to 10.7; P = .001). The
   standardized response means for the methods of NO estimation were 0.97
   for aspiration, 1.05 for exhalation, and 1.61 for humming.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that humming nasal NO increases

Abstract = {{This paper explores the role of translation in the informational era
   (Webster 2006a, 2006b; Castells 2009, 2010a, 2010b). The first section
   surveys the place of informative texts within Translation Studies,
   starting with Reiss's (1976) text type taxonomy. The second section
   discusses the concept of the informational society, as characteristic of
   the trend towards globalization brought about by technological advances,
   with particular attention to the spread of the Internet and the
   marketization of information. This is related to the explosion of news
   and information outlets that attempt to reach a global market. The final
   section turns specifically to the role of translation vis-a-vis the
   informational society, and mentions the problems arising from the
   invisible activity of translation rather than the invisibility of the
   professionals, since the producers of many of these media texts do not
   even consider themselves translators.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the impacts on fuel consumption and exhaust
   emissions of a diesel power generator operating with biodiesel. Fuel
   blends with 5\%, 20\%, 35\%, 50\%, and 85\% of soybean biodiesel in
   diesel oil, and fuel blends containing 5\%, 20\%, and 35\% of castor oil
   biodiesel in diesel oil were tested, varying engine load from 9.6 to
   35.7 kW. Specific fuel consumption (SFC) and the exhaust concentrations
   of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons (HC)
   were evaluated. The engine was kept with its original settings for
   diesel oil operation. The results showed increased fuel consumption with
   higher biodiesel concentration in the fuel. Soybean biodiesel blends
   showed lower fuel consumption than castor biodiesel blends at a given
   concentration. At low and moderate loads, CO emission was increased by
   nearly 40\% and over 80\% when fuel blends containing 35\% of castor oil
   biodiesel or soybean biodiesel were used, respectively, in comparison
   with diesel oil. With the load power of 9.6 kW, the use of fuel blends
   containing 20\% of castor oil biodiesel or soybean biodiesel increased
   HC emissions by 16\% and 18\%, respectively, in comparison with diesel
   oil. Exhaust CO(2) concentration did not change significantly, showing
   differences lower than +/- 3\% of the values recorded for diesel oil
   operation, irrespective of biodiesel type, concentration and the load
   applied. The results demonstrate that optimization of fuel injection
   system is required for proper engine operation with biodiesel. (C) 2010

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Oral estrogens reduce GH-induced IGF-1 production and preliminary
   studies have shown that adjuvant estroprogestin (EP) therapy with
   octreotide LAR may control disease activity in some female patients who
   are partially responsive to octreotide LAR. Our aim was to verify if EP
   alone or in combination with octreotide LAR can achieve remission of
   acromegaly in selected cases of patients uncontrolled by surgery. Eleven
   women with persistent active acromegaly following surgery participated
   in this unblinded open label pilot study. Their mean age was 49.8 +/- A
   4.3 years. Two patients were drug na < ve, two patients had stopped
   octreotide LAR because of intolerance and seven were treated with
   octreotide LAR. The patients received either EP (EP pill, 20 mu g
   ethinylestradiol, 100 mu g levonorgestrel) alone (4 patients) or added
   to octreotide LAR (7 patients). Fasting GH, IGF-1, glucose, HDL- and
   LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at baseline and at last
   visit. MRI was controlled at baseline and at last visit. Duration of
   estrogen treatment was 3.1 +/- A 0.5 years. Serum IGF-1 levels were
   normalized in 8/11 patients (73\%). Serum GH concentrations did not
   change significantly during treatment (11.6 +/- A 5.6 mu g/L prior to EP
   vs 5.5 +/- A 1.2 mu g/L following EP). In patients treated with EP
   alone, remission was achieved in 2/4 patients (IGF-1 percentages of the
   upper limit of normal age-matched range (\%ULN): 211 +/- A 40\% before
   EP compared to 95 +/- A 15\% after EP, P = 0.028). In the seven patients
   treated by EP added to octreotide LAR, remission was achieved in 6
   patients (IGF-1\%ULN: 158 +/- A 9\% before EP compared to 86 +/- A 4\%
   after EP, P = 0.0003). Glucose and cholesterol levels were unchanged by
   EP treatment (data not shown). MRI did not show any evidence of tumour
   progression with EP in patients who had a tumour remnant. In conclusion,
   oral estrogen treatment appears to normalize serum IGF-1 concentrations
   in over 70\% of women with acromegaly uncured by surgery irrespective of
   their sensitivity to octreotide LAR. We suggest that estrogens may be a
   temporary cost-effective and safe treatment for women with postoperative
   persistent acromegaly.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate the biotransformation of cat liver
   microsomes in comparison to dogs and humans using a high throughput
   method with fluorescent substrates and classical inhibitors specific for
   certain isozymes of the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme family. The
   metabolic activities associated with CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2D, CYP2E
   and CYP3A were measured. Cat liver microsomes metabolized all substrates
   selected for the assessment of cytochrome P450 activity. The activities
   associated with CYP3A and CYP2B were higher than the activities of the
   other measured CYPs. Substrate selectivity could be demonstrated by
   inhibition studies with alpha-naphthoflavone (CYP1A),
   tranylcypromine/quercetine (CYP2C), quinidine (CYP2D),
   diethyldithiocarbamic acid (CYP2E) and ketoconazole (CYP3A)
   respectively. Other prototypical inhibitors used for characterization of
   human CYP activities such as furafylline (CYP1A), tranylcypromine
   (CYP2B) and sulfaphenazole (CYP2C) did not show significant effects in
   cat and dog liver microsomes. Moreover, IC50-values of cat CYPs differed
   from dog and human CYPs underlining the interspecies differences. Gender
   differences were observed in the oxidation of
   7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (CYP2B) and 3-{[}2-(N,
   N-diethyl-N-methylamino)ethyl]-7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin (CYP2D), which
   were significantly higher in male cats than in females. Conversely,
   oxidation of the substrates dibenzylfluorescein (CYP2C) and
   7-methoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (CYP2E) showed significant higher
   activities in females than in male cats. Overall CYP-activities in cat
   liver microsomes were lower than in those from dogs or humans, except
   for CYP2B. The presented difference between feline and canine
   CYP-activities are useful to establish dose corrections for feline
   patients of intensively metabolized drugs licensed for dogs or humans.}},

Abstract = {{Serum concentrations of Cu, Mn, Mo, Se, vitamin A, and vitamin E were
   measured at the start and at the end of the summer grazing season in an
   observational field study of 791 commercial beef cows from 40 cow-calf
   herds from five community pastures. Copper and vitamin A were higher in
   the fall (P < 0.001), and Mo (P < 0.001) and selenium (P < 0.001) were
   lower in the fall compared with the spring. Cows aged 10-14 yr had lower
   concentrations of vitamin A (P < 0.001) and vitamin E (spring: P =
   0.010; fall: P < 0.001) than cows aged 4-9 yr. Cows with thin
   pre-breeding body condition scores were more likely to have lower
   pre-breeding Cu concentrations than cows that were not thin (P = 0.044).
   Cows that were thin at the end of the grazing season were more likely to
   have lower vitamin A concentrations at this time than cows that were not
   thin (P = 0.033). Trace mineral supplementation given before calving was
   associated with higher spring concentrations of Cu (P = 0.007). Season
   of sample collection and the physiological status of the animals should
   be considered when interpreting the serum micronutrient status of beef
   cows and developing supplementation programs.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades, eutrophication has become a major cause for concern
   in aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Apart from external nutrient loading,
   release of dissolved nutrients from sediment pore water into the water
   layer contributes importantly to eutrophication. Theory implies that
   pore water HCO3- and nutrient mobility are linked, because anaerobic
   organic matter breakdown stimulates release of HCO3- and nutrients,
   while HCO3- stimulates decay rates by increasing buffer capacity and pH.
   An investigation was performed on how HCO3- relates to commonly measured
   eutrophication-related variables in freshwater and marine sediments, by
   analyzing a database of 71 marine and 206 freshwater samples, using
   linear and non-linear regression. Results demonstrate that HCO3- is
   indeed strongly related with NH4+ and PO43- in both freshwater and
   marine pore waters. Moreover, HCO3- also correlated with sulfide levels
   in marine sediments. Contrastingly, no relationship was found with
   variables describing total nutrient content (i.e. organic matter, total
   P and N), suggesting that these do not reveal information on nutrient
   availability in aquatic sediments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) that was launched 10 years ago has become
   a first-line procedure for examining the small bowel, especially in the
   case of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Other major indications
   include Crohn disease (CD), celiac disease, and intestinal polyposis
   syndrome. In the case of small bowel diseases, the use of VCE must be
   integrated in a global diagnostic and therapeutic approach. More
   recently, wireless endoscopy has been adapted for examining the colon,
   opening up larger perspectives for colorectal cancer screening or colon
   examination. Technologic modifications of the second-generation colon
   capsule increase the sensitivity of this method for detecting polyps.
   Other new developments, including remote magnetic manipulation, power

Abstract = {{Rationale: Familial clustering of adult idiopathic interstitial
   pneumonias (IIP) suggests that genetic factors might play an important
   role in disease development. Mutations in the gene encoding surfactant
   protein C (SFTPC) have been found in children and families with
   idiopathic pneumonias, whereas cocarriage of a mutation in ATP-binding
   cassette subfamily A member 3 (ABCA3) was postulated to have a
   disease-modifying effect.
   Objectives: To investigate the contribution of SFTPC mutations to adult
   familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) and the disease-modifying effect of
   mutations in ABCA3 within their families.
   Methods: Twenty-two unrelated patients with FPF (10\%) were identified
   within our single-center cohort of 229 patients with IIP. SFTPC was
   sequenced in 20 patients with FPF and 20 patients with sporadic IIP. In
   patients with an SFTPC mutation, sequencing of ABCA3 was performed.
   Discovered variants were typed in more than 100 control subjects and 121
   additional patients with sporadic IIP.
   Measurements and Main Results: In 5/20 unrelated patients with FPF
   (25\%; confidence interval, 10-49) a mutation in SFTPC was detected:
   M71V, IVS4+2, and three times I73T. No mutations were detected in the
   sporadic or control cohort. Patients with SFTPC mutations presented with
   a histopathological pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia and nodular
   septa thickening and multiple lung cysts in combination with ground
   glass or diffuse lung involvement on chest high-resolution computed
   tomography. Two variants in ABCA3 were found in adult patients with FPF
   but not in affected children.
   Conclusions: Mutations in SFTPC are a frequent cause of FPF in adult
   patients in our cohort. Nonclassifiable radiological patterns with
   cystic changes and histopathological patterns of usual interstitial
   pneumonia are characteristics of adult SFTPC mutation carriers.}},

Abstract = {{How effective are policy interventions to fight crime and how valid is
   the policy theory that underlies them? This is the twofold research
   question addressed in this article, which presents an evidence-based
   evaluation of Dutch social safety policy. By bridging the gap between
   actual effects and assumed effects, this study seeks to make fuller use
   of the practical relevance of evidence-based evaluations. The results
   reveal promising interventions and mechanisms for policy practice. In
   addition, the chosen approach advances current practice using
   evidence-based outcomes to distinguish plausible from implausible policy
   assumptions. An urgent need is signaled for governments to provide
   substantive reasoning for their policy choices. Many of the assumptions
   that correspond with evidence from impact evaluations relate to general
   prevention, often found within the strategy of situational prevention.
   Contrary to any general preventive or short-term effects, the
   assumptions regarding long-term specific prevention through law
   enforcement cannot be taken as read.}},

Abstract = {{The present research sought to investigate the psychological dynamics
   underlying demonizing, that is, the tendency to see others as
   personifications of pure evilness. Building on an integrative
   theoretical framework, it is hypothesized that the extent to which a
   perpetrator matches prototypical expectations of evilness shapes
   demonizing responses to offenders particularly when cognitive resources
   are impaired. In two experiments, participants were asked to memorize
   either a difficult or an easy telephone number (cognitive load vs.
   control), and were then asked to evaluate a perpetrator who murdered a
   young woman (Experiment 1) or who kidnapped a child (Experiment 2).
   Results revealed that the extent to which the description of the
   perpetrator was consistent with a prototypical evilness scheme
   influenced demonizing particularly under conditions of cognitive load.
   It is concluded that impairment of cognitive resources increases the
   influence of prototypical evilness on demonizing.}},

Abstract = {{Notwithstanding the success of the traditional dietary phenylalanine
   restriction treatment in phenylketonuria (PKU), the use of large neutral
   amino acid (LNAA) supplementation rather than phenylalanine restriction
   has been suggested. This treatment modality deserves attention as it
   might improve cognitive outcome and quality of life in patients with
   PKU. Following various theories about the pathogenesis of cognitive
   dysfunction in PKU, LNAA supplementation may have multiple treatment
   targets: a specific reduction in brain phenylalanine concentrations, a
   reduction in blood (and consequently brain) phenylalanine
   concentrations, an increase in brain neurotransmitter concentrations,
   and an increase in brain essential amino acid concentrations. These
   treatment targets imply different treatment regimes. This review
   summarizes the treatment targets and the treatment regimens of LNAA
   supplementation and discusses the differences in LNAA intake between the
   classical dietary phenylalanine-restricted diet and several LNAA
   treatment forms.}},

Abstract = {{The refraction of a spectrum of short internal waves by a packet of
   inertia waves is considered. It is found that a short inertia-wave
   packet produces a larger net change in a spectrum of short waves than a
   long inertia-wave packet, provided the short waves are trapped at some
   time during the interaction. Specifically, an incident narrow-banded
   short-wave spectrum broadens more quickly and more fully when refracted
   by the short inertia-wave packet. The results are explained in terms of
   a frequency conservation law, which constrains short-wave change in the
   limit of a long inertia-wave packet. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the relationship(s) between overall and within-food
   group diversity and several indices of dietary quality, such as dietary
   adequacy, moderation and balance, in Belgian adults. Dietary quality
   indices were derived from the food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG).
   Design: Information on food intake was collected with two 24 h recalls.
   Setting: Average overall and within-food group diversity scores and
   dietary adequacy, moderation and balance scores were calculated.
   Subjects: A representative sample (n 3245) of the Belgian population at
   the age of 15 years and older was randomly selected from the National
   Register using a multistage stratified procedure.
   Results: For both men and women, total dietary diversity score increased
   with age and smokers had a significantly lower overall diversity score
   than non-or former smokers. A positive association was found between
   overall dietary diversity and both dietary adequacy and balance. For
   most food groups, especially bread and cereals, vegetables, dairy
   products and spreadable fats, within-food group dietary diversity was
   positively associated with the fulfilment of the specific recommendation
   for the intake of that food group. An inverse association was found
   between dietary diversity within the meat and the energy-dense,
   nutrient-poor food groups and dietary balance. Diversity within the
   dairy and spreadable fat group was responsible for the strongest
   increase in overall dietary adequacy and balance.
   Conclusions: Overall dietary diversity is a useful indicator of dietary
   quality in Belgium. For some food groups, within-food group dietary
   diversity is a useful indicator of compliance with the specific FBDG for
   intake of that food group.}},

   yields. The optimum ratio of the (+) and (-) mating types for the
   maximum pigment production (175.0 mg/g dry biomass at 8 days of

Abstract = {{The composition and structure of aktashite from the Aktash deposit,
   Gorny Altai, Russia, have been studied by electron microprobe and X-ray
   structural analysis. On the basis of close compositions and crystal
   structures, the identity of aktashite from the Gal-Khaya and Aktash
   deposits has been demonstrated. Crystals of aktashite are of trigonal
   symmetry; the unit-cell dimensions are: a = 13.7500(4), c = 9.3600(3)
   angstrom, V = 532.54(8) angstrom(3), space group R3, Z = 3 for the
   composition of Cu6Hg3As4S12, R = 0.043. The structure of aktashite as a
   framework of vertex-shared HgS4- and CuS4- tetrahedrons of the same
   orientation is intimately related to the sphalerite-type structure. The
   earlier identified uncommon cluster group {[}As-4] has been verified and
   its parameters have been refined. It is shown that the structure may be
   represented as construction blocks (As4S12)(12-) packed according to the
   law of the distorted cubic I-cell. DOI: 10.1134/S1075701510070184}},

Abstract = {{The composition of galkhaite from the Gal-Khaya deposit (Yakutia,

Abstract = {{Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) techniques are becoming more
   popular for the treatment of full thickness cartilage lesions of the
   knee joint. However, there is no systematic information for the efficacy
   of the new generation ACI techniques compared to other treatment
   options. A systematic review of the existing evidence from randomized
   clinical trials of ACI treatment would contribute to understanding the
   advantages and limitations of this method and would inform the planning
   of future studies. Using pre-defined criteria, we searched a number of
   electronic databases to identify all the existing randomized control
   trials of any type of ACI treatment. Risk of bias was assessed and an
   analysis of the reported outcomes was performed. Information on the
   clinical efficacy and safety of ACI compared to other interventions was
   collected and presented. Nine trials were identified with 626 patients.
   Patients ranged from 15 to 52 years, and the size of treated lesions was
   between 1 and 22 cm(2). ACI was associated with improvement in clinical
   outcomes compared to baseline. However, the body of evidence did not
   suggest any superiority of ACI over other treatments. Complication rates
   were comparable between interventions except from an increased rate of
   graft hypertrophies after ACI with periosteum. ACI is an effective
   treatment for full thickness chondral defects of the knee, providing an
   improvement of clinical outcomes. However, there is insufficient data to
   say whether ACI is superior to other treatment strategies. More high
   quality studies and harmonization in the reported outcomes are needed
   before specific suggestions for practice can be made.}},

Abstract = {{In this study possibility to form the layered compositions CoO(x) +

   shown. Compositions have been obtained by both one-stage PEO method
   (Method I) with addition of Co(CH(3)COO)(2) into silicate electrolyte
   and impregnation of preliminary obtained by the PEO method
   SiO(2)/TiO(2)/Ti systems in aqueous solutions containing cobalt salts
   with their following annealing (Method II). XRD, XPS and SEM/EDX were
   used to investigate the phase and element composition, microstructure of
   the coatings prepared by the two various methods. Catalytic activity of
   the cobalt-containing composites was investigated in the CO oxidation
   reaction. Under experimental conditions, the structures obtained by
   impregnation and annealing method were more active, than those obtained
   by one-stage PEO method. The surface structures of cobalt-containing
   coatings obtained by the PEO method and by impregnation and annealing
   differ in both quantitative and qualitative relation. The cobalt content
   on the surface of impregnating coatings is three times as much as that
   for those formed by one-stage PEO method. It is found that coatings
   obtained by the Method II have a more developed surface. The surface of
   CoO(x) + SiO(2)/TiO(2)/Ti compositions obtained by the PEO method
   contains, presumably Co(OH)(2) and Co(3)O(4). The surface of the similar
   compositions obtained by the Method II, possibly contains CoO, either
   Co(2)O(3), or CoOOH. The combination of these factors, perhaps, also
   provides a higher activity of the compositions formed by the Method II.

Abstract = {{Large-scale climate fluctuations reflected in the alternation of glacial
   and interglacial epochs have resulted in structural changes in the
   landscape shell. Differences in heat and moisture supply have accounted
   for specific features of soil-forming processes, zonality structure, and
   the ratio of soil formation and sedimentation processes. The sequence of
   types of soil formation epochs is most completely reflected in the
   structure of loess-soil cryogenic formations, where specific features of
   soil formation and sedimentation during no less than seven natural
   climatic macrocycles (over the past 800 ka, the Brunhes paleomagnetic
   epoch) have been revealed and analyzed. Within macrocycles, three main
   types of soil formation epochs have been distinguished: interglacial,
   interstadial, and pleniglacial (interphasial). Interglacial soil
   formation evolved from subtropical in the Eopleitocene and Early
   Pleistocene to subboreal and boreal in the Middle and Late Pleistocene.
   Interstadial dark-colored soils developed during early interstadial
   warmings at the beginning of glacial epochs and formed complexes with
   interglacial soils. Pleniglacial soil formation was characteristic of
   the coldest phase of the Valdai glaciation, when sedimentation and
   physical weathering absolutely prevailed over soil formation, leading to
   the development of specific synlithogenic soils. In the periods of
   climate softening, interstadial soils of cryo-gley genesis were formed.}},

Abstract = {{South Africa's government disability grants are considered important in
   providing income support to low-income AIDS patients Indeed, anecdotal
   evidence suggests that some individuals may opt to compromise their
   health by foregoing Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) to
   remain eligible for the grant In this study we examined the disability
   grant's importance to individual and household welfare, and the impact
   of its loss using a unique longitudinal dataset of HAART patients in
   Khayelitsha, Cape Town We found that grant loss was associated with
   sizeable declines in income and changes in household composition
   However, we found no evidence of individuals choosing poor health over
   grant loss Our analysis also suggested that though the grants officially
   target those too sick to work, some people were able to keep grants
   longer than expected, and others received grants while employed This has
   helped cushion people on HAART but other welfare measures need
   consideration}},

Abstract = {{In light of the increasing availability of generic highly active
   antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in India, further data are needed to
   examine variables associated with HAART nonadherence among HIV-infected
   Indians in clinical care. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 198
   HIV-infected South Indian men and women between January and April 2008
   receiving first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
   (NNRTI)-based HAART. Nonadherence was defined as taking less than 95\%
   of HAART doses in the last 1 month, and was examined using multivariable
   logistic regression models. Half of the participants reported less than
   95\% adherence to HAART, and 50\% had been on HAART for more than 24
   months. The median CD4 cell count was 435 cells per microliter. An
   increased odds of nonadherence was found for participants with current
   CD4 cell counts greater than 500 cells per microliter (adjusted odds
   ratio {[}AOR]: 2.22 {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\}: 1.04-4.75]; p =
   0.038), who were on HAART for more than 24 months (AOR: 3.07 {[}95\% CI:
   1.35-7.01]; p = 0.007), who reported alcohol use (AOR: 5.68 {[}95\% CI:

   3.58 {[}95\% CI: 1.20-10.66]; p - 0.021), and who had high distress
   (AOR: 3.32 {[}95\% CI: 1.19-9.26]; p - 0.022). This study documents
   several modifiable risk factors for nonadherence in a clinic population
   of HIV-infected Indians with substantial HAART experience. Further
   targeted culturally specific interventions are needed that address
   barriers to optimal adherence.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the adherence to a guideline for additional breast
   ultrasonography in a cross-sectional survey among hospitals in The
   Netherlands. Furthermore, consequences of current practice non-adherence
   for the patient outcome of diagnostic breast imaging were studied.
   Methods Current practice was compared with a guideline made up of three
   recommendations for the use of ultrasonography after mammography and
   three recommendations for not using ultrasonography. All patients
   referred for mammography to the radiology departments of the
   participating hospitals during 2 months in 2004 were eligible for the
   study. No data on the gold standard for breast cancer were analysed, but
   clinical consequences were estimated by using a probability model based
   on the data of a former prospective clinical study.
   Results In total, 17 of the 66 hospitals approached were participating
   in the study. Of the 13 694 patients assessed for eligibility, 6457 were
   included. High adherence rates (81-97\%, mean 94\%) were observed for
   the recommendations, which indicate additional ultrasonography, whereas
   lower adherence rates (68-94\%, mean 83\%) were seen for the
   recommendations which do not advise additional ultrasonography. Overall,
   in all included hospitals, non-adherence would result in 27.2
   false-positive and 1.1 false-negative imaging results.
   Conclusion Current daily practice of diagnostic breast imaging in the
   hospitals in this survey corresponds to a great extent to the guideline
   proposed. Non-adherence in current practice results in a relatively
   small number of false-positive and false-negative imaging results.}},

Abstract = {{Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) has been recently found in many
   solanaceous ornamental plant species. This study reports on the
   effectiveness of mechanical transmission between Brugmansia suaveolens,

   plant sap diluted in water, rubbing with contaminated finger tips and
   cutting with contaminated razor blades all resulted in transmission of
   PSTVd. Temperature, plant species and source of inoculum were found to
   be critical factors. An average temperature of 15 degrees C only
   resulted in a few infections, whereas transmission at 20 and 25 degrees
   C was more successful. Tomatoes were more susceptible to PSTVd than B.
   suaveolens, S. jasminoides and potatoes. Furthermore, S. jasminoides was
   a better source of inoculum than B. suaveolens. No transmission was
   obtained after repeated addition of inocula to tomato roots. These
   results indicate that PSTVd can be transmitted between plant species in
   practice by crop handling.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{507-520}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives:
   Parental attitudes are likely to play a role in achieving and
   maintaining a desired level of oral health in children. To be useful in
   individually delivered caries prevention programmes, parental attitudes
   should be identified at individual level. Q-methodology has been proved
   successful in identifying attitudes in a wide range of disciplines but
   in dentistry Q-studies are scarce. In this study Q-methodology was used
   to identify parents' prevailing attitudes towards the oral health of
   their children.
   Methods:
   Thirty-nine parents ranked 37 statements regarding the dental health
   behaviour they apply to their 6-year-old child. They later explained
   their rankings during a short interview. In Q-methodology, rather than
   reporting one average composite attitude and opinion, various
   combinations of opinions and attitudes concerning these statements are
   identified using by-person factor analysis.
   Results:
   Based on their beliefs, attitudes and cognitions, five categories of
   parents were found: (i) conscious and responsible, (ii) trivializing and
   fatalistic, (iii) appearance-driven and open-minded, (iv) knowledgeable
   but defensive and (v) conscious and concerned.
   Conclusions:
   Q-methodology appears to be a fruitful way to structure the complexity
   of parents' opinions and attitudes towards their children's dental
   health. It appears that Q-methodology provides comprehensive clusters of
   individual attitudes, based on various levels of responses to a wide
   range of questions. The five identified profiles may be useful in
   developing tailor-made prevention strategies in caries prevention.}},

Abstract = {{This paper details the construction of a simple model that estimates
   tourism income impacts for selected Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
   (APEC) member economies of future market-based measures to reduce
   international aviation emissions. The model was commissioned by the APEC
   Transport and Tourism Working Groups in order to inform sustainable
   policy approaches to international aviation emissions.
   At its heart, the model uses price elasticities which capture variations
   between demand responses for visitors from different regions. To make
   the model operational, we explore key intermediate relationships between
   emissions pricing and international tourism income. For example, an
   examination of the nature, magnitude and importance of international
   aviation movements shows a diversity of aviation flows and levels of
   dependence on tourism income across sample economies. Furthermore, the
   relationship between unit passenger costs of aviation, fuel prices and
   distance flown is found to be complex, with fuel costs per passenger
   increasing more rapidly than operating costs as distance increases.
   Model results suggest that - within sample economies - proposed pricing
   measures are likely to reduce international aviation demand reductions
   by a maximum of 5\%, while national income is expected to decline by a
   maximum 0.5\% as a result.}},

Abstract = {{Contents
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of dehydroleucodine
   (DhL), a new drug isolated from a medicinal herb used in Argentina, for
   activation of bovine oocyte. Several DhL concentrations and exposure
   times after ionomycin (Io) treatment were tested. The optimal DhL
   treatment, found for parthenogenetic development, was employed to
   produce bovine embryos by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and
   somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The best parthenogenic embryo
   developments were observed with 5 mu m Io for 4 min followed by 5 mu m
   DhL concentration and after 3-h exposure time (52.3\% cleavage; 17.4\%
   morulae; 7.3\% blastocyst; n = 109). This treatment generated no
   significant differences with standard Io plus 6-dimethylaminopurine
   (DMAP) treatment in preimplantation embryo development. In our
   conditions, the embryo development reached after ICSI and SCNT assisted
   by the DhL treatment did not differ in terms of cleavage and blastocyst
   development from activation with standard Io plus DMAP treatment (p >
   0.05). In conclusion, DhL utilization to activate oocytes and induce
   development of parthenogenotes, ICSI-embryos or SCNT-embryos is reported
   here for first time.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is considerable consensus that Finance, Management and
   Marketing are `science', some debate remains with regard to whether
   these three areas comprise autonomous, organized and settled scientific
   fields of research. In this paper we aim to explore this issue by
   analyzing the occurrence of citations in the top-ranked journals in the
   areas of Finance, Management, and Marketing. We put forward a modified
   version of the model of science as a network, proposed by Klamer and Van
   Dalen (J Econ Methodol 9(2):289-315, 2002), and conclude that Finance is
   a `Relatively autonomous, organized and settled field of research',
   whereas Management and (to a larger extent) Marketing are relatively
   non-autonomous and hybrid fields of research'. Complementary analysis
   based on sub-discipline rankings using the recursive methodology of
   Liebowitz and Palmer (J Econ Lit 22:77-88, 1984) confirms the results.
   In conclusions we briefly discuss the pertinence of Whitley's (The
   intellectual and social organization of the sciences, 1984) theory for
   explaining cultural differences across these sub-disciplines based on
   its dimensions of scholarly practices, `mutual dependency' and `task
   uncertainty'.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Capsular contracture is one of the most common complications
   associated with silicone breast implants. The surface of the implant is
   one of the factors often associated with the occurrence of capsular
   contracture. In this study, the authors evaluated the differences in
   morphologic and molecular characteristics of the capsule formed around
   polyurethane-coated versus textured-surface silicone implants in rats,
   mainly the modifications in angiogenesis and the expression of vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
   Methods: A pocket was performed on the animal's back, where the silicone
   implants were introduced. Two groups of animals received a
   polyurethane-coated silicone implant and the other groups received a
   textured-surface silicone implant, and the capsules around the
   prostheses were submitted to histologic and immunohistochemistry
   analysis, 30 or 90 days after surgery.
   Results: The capsules around the polyurethane-coated silicone prostheses
   were significantly thicker than the textured-surface silicone implants.
   Furthermore, the layer adjacent to the polyurethane-coated silicone
   implants was more cellular and irregular than the layer around the
   textured-surface silicone implants. Textured implant periprosthetic
   capsules presented fewer inflammatory cells and less vascularization
   than the polyurethane-coated silicone implants. The collagen layer of
   periprosthetic tissue of textured implants appears to be more continuous
   and aligned in parallel fashion than polyurethane-coated implants.
   Immunohistochemical analysis revealed high levels of transforming growth
   factor-beta and VEGF in the capsules around the polyurethane-coated
   silicone implants when compared with the textured-surface silicone
   implants.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that the intense VEGF expression in
   capsules around the polyurethane-coated silicone implant is able to
   improve the tissue vascularization, resulting in a softer capsule
   compared with the textured-surface silicone implant. (Plast. Reconstr.

Abstract = {{Early hatching has been shown to be associated with increased survival
   of Norwegian spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) larvae. We
   investigated whether the process behind this association is related to
   larval drift and ambient temperature. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic
   model was used to simulate the effect of hatching date on northward
   displacement and temperature conditions of larvae from spawning grounds
   off western Norway for 1989-2008. The simulations revealed that the
   displacement during a period of 60 d was greatest if the larvae hatched
   early in the season and if they were located near the surface. The
   relationship between drift speed and ambient temperature was
   significantly negative, but less so later in the season, because the
   coastal current became progressively warmer. Results from the simulated
   interannual variations in larval drift compared with the observed
   survival suggest that a rapid northward displacement to the main nursery
   area in the Barents Sea is more important for larval survival than
   ambient temperature. The significant effect of northward displacement on
   survival could be explained by reduced overlap with predators and/or
   higher prey densities, but the causal processes involved remain to be
   investigated.}},

Title = {{Disparities in Asthma Medication Dispensing Patterns: The Case of
   Pediatric Asthma in Puerto Rico}},

Abstract = {{Background. Disparities exist in asthma medication dispensing between
   children with public insurance and those with private insurance under a
   Managed Care Medicaid system in Puerto Rico. Objectives. Island-wide
   medical claims data were used to examine the extent to which differences
   between the private and public health care sectors affect medication
   dispensing and health care utilization among asthmatic children.
   Methods. Children 3-18 years old with at least one service claim
   {[}outpatient, hospitalization, or emergency department (ED) visit] for
   asthma or reactive airway disease from 2005 to 2006 were selected.
   Chi-square analyses compared medication dispensing and health care
   utilization between the public and private sectors. Negative binomial
   regression identified factors associated with the mean dispensing rate
   of prescriptions for anti-inflammatory controller medication (CM).
   Results. Private insurance families (n = 28,088) were dispensed
   significantly more CM (48.3\% vs. 12.0\%) and quick relief medication
   (47.4\% vs. 44.6\%) than public insurance families (n = 13,220). The
   dispensing of inhaled corticosteroids (24.4\% vs. 6.7\%) and leukotriene
   modifiers and cromolyn (31.4\% vs. 5.7\%) was dramatically higher in the
   private sector. In contrast, emergency room use was significantly higher
   among public insurance children (51.7\% vs. 13.8\%). Multivariate
   analysis showed that age, number of beta-agonists, and type of insurance
   was associated with CM dispensing; private insurance showed the greatest
   effect. Conclusion. Asthmatic Puerto Rican children enrolled in public
   insurance were significantly less likely to be dispensed CM than
   children with private insurance; suggesting that under-treatment of
   public insured children may substantially contribute to increased asthma
   morbidity in this population as evidenced by significantly higher rates
   of ED visits.
   Capsule summary. A disparity exists in asthma medication dispensing
   between children with public insurance compared with those with private
   insurance under a Managed Care Medicaid system in Puerto Rico. If asthma
   disparities in medication dispensing are to be reduced, then a better
   understanding of the complex ways in which multiple variables related to
   the health care system policies, socioeconomic factors, family and
   provider interactions, as well as the relative weight that each one
   contributes to the observed inequalities is needed.}},

Abstract = {{In previous reports, we described germ line functional polymorphisms
   that differentiate Fas and FasL genes in two mouse strains (SEG/Pas and
   C57BL/6J) exhibiting extreme differences in susceptibility to gamma
   radiation-induced T-cell lymphomas. Here, we provide new data
   reinforcing the importance of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis
   mediated by Fas in T-cell lymphoma development and about the functional
   significance of polymorphisms located at intracellular and extracellular
   domains of Fas and FasL. Using DNA recombinant technology, we generate
   chimerical Fas and FasL proteins by combination of protein regions
   derived from the two strains and demonstrate that any Fas-FasL
   interaction involving chimerical proteins drive cell apoptosis to a
   significant lower extent than the wild-type SEG/Pas and C57BL/6J
   Fas-FasL systems. In addition, we report new polymorphisms in the coding
   sequence of Fadd and demonstrate that the interaction between Fas and
   Fadd is significantly stronger if Fas and Fadd are of SEG/Pas origin
   compared with the C57BL/6J system. Altogether, these results suggest a
   model in which functional polymorphisms at the three genes collaborate
   on the global ability of the Fas/FasL system to induce apoptosis. A
   complete analysis of these three genes in the pathway appears to be a
   sine qua non condition to accurately predict the effectiveness of the
   Fas system and to estimate susceptibility to T-cell lymphoma.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the effects of restricted feeding
   before puberty on reproduction, lactation and offspring growth
   performance in replacement ewe lambs over two breeding seasons. At
   weaning, 41 Dorset ewe lambs were assigned to one of three diets: an ad
   libitum control diet with medium-quality forage (MQF; 13.3\% crude
   protein (CP), 1.81 Mcal metabolizable energy per kg, 42.8\% ADF; diet
   A-MQF); a restricted diet with the same forage as A but less feed
   concentrate (diet R-MQF); or a high-quality forage (HQF) diet (14.8\%
   CP, 2.15 Mcal ME/kg, 34.7\% ADF; diet F-HQF). The quantity of
   concentrate offered to the group R-MQF and F-HQF ewe lambs was adjusted
   to obtain 70\% of the control ewe lambs' growth rate. The diets were
   offered for 75 days following weaning to cover the allometric phase of
   mammary gland development. Prepubertal restriction did not affect (P >
   0.10) the gestation rate, number of lambs born or the body weight and
   body condition score of ewes at lambing or at the end of lactation. Ewes
   from groups R-MQF and F-HQF tended to produce more milk during their
   first lactation compared to those from group A-MQF (P = 0.07). During
   the second lactation, groups R-MQF and F-HQF had better standardized
   milk production than group A-MQF (P < 0.05), and group R-MQF produced
   more milk than group F-HQF (P < 0.05). Milk fat and protein content were
   not affected by treatments (P > 0.10) Fat and protein yield were
   affected by treatments only at the second lactation (P < 0.10 and P <
   0.05, respectively). Lamb birth and weaning weights were not affected by
   prepubertal restriction of feeding in their mother (P > 0.10). However,
   the average daily gain of second breeding season lambs was higher for
   the R-MQF group than the F-HQF group (P < 0.05), and a similar trend was
   observed for total gain (P < 0.10). Restricted feeding before puberty
   does not impair future reproductive performance; however, it has a
   positive impact on lactation and on lambs' growth performance.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of permanent inundation and storage of flood plain
   soils and aquatic sediments on metal mobility were studied. The main
   goal was to quantify kinetic mobilisation processes in order to pinpoint
   the conditions that pose emission risks to groundwater and surface
   waters.
   Anaerobic pore water compositions of six existing depots, containing
   sediments from either aquatic or terrestrial origin, were measured to
   obtain reliable field references. Reduction experiments were performed
   with SOFIE cells, in which time-dynamic measurements of reducing pore
   waters were carried out at the reigning redox conditions. A parallel
   experiment tested the possibility if sulfide-deficiencies could be
   compensated by the reduction of added gypsum, thus increasing the
   available pool of reactive S. Model calculations were performed to
   distinguish between the thermodynamic and kinetic processes.
   Reduction of flood plain soils showed that dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) concentrations increased up to 7-fold over time, as a result of
   nutrient-mediated metabolic boost of organic matter degrading
   microorganisms. The association of metals to DOM increased significantly
   due to the loss of reactive Mn-oxide and Fe-oxyhydroxide sorption phases
   during reduction. DOM released metals only slowly, therefore kinetically
   hindering the phase shifting to stable metal-sulfide precipitates. The
   observed effects lasted at least 10 months. In aquatic sediments,
   reduction rates of sulphates were six times faster, and the release of
   DOM occurred in lower amounts than in soils from terrestrial origin. It
   is shown that the addition of gypsum stimulates the formation of
   sulfides, thereby decreasing dissolved concentrations of most metals. On
   the short term however, the addition of gypsum leads to elevated
   concentrations of Zn and Cd due to increased electrolyte strength and
   subsequent Ca-metal-competition for sorption sites. This effect may be
   eliminated by not only adding an electron acceptor to the sediment, but
   also an effective donor, e.g., degradable organic matter.
   For depots containing flood plain soils, the same kinetic mechanisms
   were observed as in the reduction experiments (elevated production of
   DOM and associated metals). It was concluded that reduction of flood
   plain soils may not necessarily result in efficient metal trapping. When
   storage is considered, a distinction should be made between sediments of
   terrestrial and aquatic origin.}},

Abstract = {{Data generation increases at highly dynamic rates, making its storage,
   processing, and update costs at one central location excessive. The P2P
   paradigm emerges as a powerful model for organizing and searching large
   data repositories distributed over independent sources. Advanced query
   operators, such as skyline queries, are necessary in order to help users
   handle the huge amount of available data. A skyline query retrieves the
   set of nondominated data points in a multidimensional data set. Skyline
   query processing in P2P networks poses inherent challenges and demands
   nontraditional techniques, due to the distribution of content and the
   lack of global knowledge. Relying on a superpeer architecture, we
   propose a threshold-based algorithm, called SKYPEER and its variants,
   for efficient computation of skyline points in arbitrary subspaces,
   while reducing both computational time and volume of transmitted data.
   Furthermore, we address the problem of routing skyline queries over the
   superpeer network and we propose an efficient routing mechanism, namely
   SKYPEER+, which further improves the performance by reducing the number
   of contacted superpeers. Finally, we provide an extensive experimental
   evaluation showing that our approach performs efficiently and provides a
   viable solution when a large degree of distribution is required.}},

   First published June 16, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.01073.2009. Fluorescent
   calcium indicators are becoming increasingly popular as a means for
   observing the spiking activity of large neuronal populations.
   Unfortunately, extracting the spike train of each neuron from a raw
   fluorescence movie is a nontrivial problem. This work presents a fast
   nonnegative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely
   spike train of each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This
   algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on
   both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from
   restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an
   interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm runs in
   linear time, and is fast enough that even when simultaneously imaging
   >100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed
   traces faster than real time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on
   the images further refines the inferred spike train estimates.
   Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be
   estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to
   perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation in a rectangular

   continuous on the parallelepiped edges and have first derivatives
   satisfying the Lipschitz condition on each parallelepiped face, the
   resulting discrete solution of the Dirichlet problem converges uniformly
   and quadratically with respect to the mesh size. Assuming that the
   boundary values on the faces have fourth derivatives satisfying the
   Holder condition and the second derivatives on the edges obey an
   additional compatibility condition implied by Laplace's equation, the
   discrete solution has uniform and quartic convergence with respect to
   the mesh size. The convergence of the method is also analyzed in certain
   cases when the boundary values are of intermediate smoothness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Preclinical studies have demonstrated the over-the-scope
   clip (OTSC) to be feasible and safe for closure of gastric, duodenal,
   and colonic perforations. A retrospective clinical study demonstrated
   the feasibility and preliminary safety of the OTC for the treatment of
   GI bleeding and closure of acute GI perforations.
   Objective: Because the OTSC allows rapid and easy endoscopic organ wall
   closure, we hypothesized that it might be a useful tool to close GI
   fistulae.
   Design: Case series.
   Setting: Academic medical center.
   Patients: Four consecutive patients with GI fistulae.
   Interventions: In all patients, a 12-mm OTSC, in combination with the
   dedicated twin grasper, anchor device, or endoscopic suction, was used
   to facilitate endoscopic closure.
   Main Outcome Measurements: In 2 cases, OTSCs allowed complete closure of
   a posttraumatic esophagopulmonary fistula and a chronic gastrocutaneous
   fistula. Leak tests and follow-up examination demonstrated complete
   leakproof closures. In 1 esophagopulmonary fistula and 1 jejunocutaneous
   fistula, the initial closure attempts using OTSCs were not successful
   because of chronic fibrotic changes and scarring at the fistula site.
   Both OTSCs were removed by using an endoscopic grasping forceps. The
   mean procedure time was 54 minutes (range 24-93 minutes). There were no
   procedure-related complications.
   Limitations: Small sample size.
   Conclusions: The OTSC seems to be a feasible device to close chronic
   fistulae of the GI tract. It can achieve leakproof, full-thickness
   closure of transmural defects. Nevertheless, in circumstances of severe
   fibrosis and scarring, complete incorporation of the defect into the
   applicator cap and successful OTSC application might not be possible.}},

Abstract = {{Different harvesting methods have been developed for bony augmentation
   before implantation. The aim of the present study was to assess the
   viability of endochondral (femoral) and membranous (mandibular) bone
   cells harvested by different methods under standard conditions in an
   animal model, and to investigate the surface of the bone in the
   harvested area. Samples of mandibular and femoral bone were harvested
   using a drilling burr, a piezoelectrical device, or a Safescraper (R).
   Blocks of bone that had been harvested with cutting forceps were used as
   controls. The size of the samples was measured and they were examined by
   conventional microscopy and immunohistochemical analysis;
   osteoblast-like cells were also cultured. The surface of the harvested
   area was analysed with scanning and conventional microscopy. There was
   no significant difference between mandibular and femoral bone in the
   size of particles harvested, but bone chips were significantly smaller
   when a drilling device had been used in both harvesting areas. Viability
   of cells in these smaller particles was significantly less than among
   cells harvested with a piezoelectrical device or Safescraper (R).
   Scanning microscopy showed a smooth bony surface where a drilling burr
   or piezoelectrical device had been used, whereas small disruptions were
   observed after the Safescraper (R) had been used. Harvesting of
   particulate bone is feasible using a drilling burr, piezoelectrical
   device, or Safescraper (R) from mandibular and femoral bone. The
   piezoelectrical device and the Safescraper (R) gave comparable results
   concerning the viability of osteoblast-like cells, and so are preferred
   to a drilling burr. (C) 2009 The British Association of Oral and

   kinetic models of the gas-phase oxidation of simple organic substances
   are considered. Methods for regenerating the photocatalyst after its
   deactivation in the oxidation of sulfur-containing organic substances

   purification by the combination of photocatalytic oxidation with
   atmospheric electric discharges, the addition of gaseous hydrogen
   peroxide, and oxidation on photocatalysts existing in the aerosol state.
   As compared to pure TiO2, platinated titanium dioxide has a higher

Abstract = {{Here we present a spatial planning approach for the implementation of
   adaptation measures to climate change in conservation planning for
   ecological networks. We analyse the wetland ecosystems of the Dutch
   National Ecological Network for locations where the effectiveness of the
   network might be weakened because of climate change. We first identify
   potential dispersal bottlenecks where connectivity might be insufficient
   to facilitate range expansions. We then identify habitat patches that
   might have a too low carrying capacity for populations to cope with
   additional population fluctuations caused by weather extremes. Finally,
   we describe the spatial planning steps that were followed to determine
   the best locations for adaptation measures. An essential part of our
   adaptation strategy is to concentrate adaptation measures in a `climate
   adaptation zone'. Concentrating adaptation measures is a cost-effective
   planning strategy, rendering the largest benefit per area unit. Measures
   are taken where abiotic conditions are optimal and measures to enhance
   the spatial cohesion of the network are taken close to existing areas,
   thus creating the highest possible connectivity with the lowest area
   demands. Another benefit of a climate adaptation zone is that it
   provides a spatial protection zone where activities that will have a
   negative impact on ecosystem functioning might be avoided or mitigated.
   The following adaptation measures are proposed within the climate
   adaptation zone: (1) link habitat networks to enable species to disperse
   from present to future suitable climate zones, (2) enlarge the carrying
   capacity by either enlarging the size of natural areas or by improving
   habitat quality to shorten population recovery after disturbances, (3)
   increase the heterogeneity of natural areas, preferably by stimulating
   natural landscape-forming processes, to avoid large synchronised
   extinctions after extreme weather events. The presented approach can be
   generalised to develop climate adaptation zones for other ecosystem
   types inside or outside Europe, where habitat fragmentation is a
   limiting factor in biodiversity responses to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Azithromycin may reverse or halt the decline of pulmonary
   function (FEV(1)) in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) In this
   study we investigated the effects of long-term azithromycin treatment in
   lung transplant recipients with BOS
   METHODS A retrospective, observational cohort study was performed on 107
   patients with BOS (Stages 0p/1/2/3, n = 23/62/20/2), who were treated
   with azithromycin for 3 1 +/- 1 9 years Patients were evaluated 6 3 +/-
   3 8 years after transplantation and assessed for evolution of FEV(1),
   bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophilia and overall survival after
   initiation of azithromycin Survival curves were analyzed using the log
   rank test Cox proportional hazard survival regression analysis was
   performed to estimate hazard ratios of clinical variables predicting
   outcome
   RESULTS FEV(1), Increased >= 10\% after 3 to 6 months of treatment in
   40\% of patients, of whom 33\% later redeveloped BOS FEV(1) further
   declined in 78\% and stabilized in 22\% of the remaining non-responders
   Pre-treatment neutrophilia was higher in responders 293\% (93\% to
   697\%) vs 11 5\% (29\% to 438\%) (p = 0 025) in whom it significantly
   decreased to 42\% (1 8\% to 17 6\%) (p = 0 041) after 3 to 6 months of
   azithromycin Responders demonstrated better survival compared with
   non-responders (p = 0050), with 6 and 21 patients, respectively, dying
   during follow-up (p = 0 027) Multivariate analysis identified initial
   azithromycin response and earlier post transplant initiation of
   azithromycin to be protective for both BOS progression/relapse (hazard
   ratio {[}HR] = 0 12 {[}95\% confidence interval 005 to 028], p < 0 0001
   and HR = 098 {[}95\% confidence interval 097 to 098], p < 0 0001,

Abstract = {{The crystal chemistry of Fe ions in Cr-spinel from the largest Ural
   ultramafic massifs has been studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy at room
   temperature and the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen. The spectra
   substantially depend on the mineral composition (stoichiometry) and
   measurement temperature; Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) doublets significantly
   overlap; the Fe(2+) doublet lines are markedly broadened. According to
   the Mossbauer data, the degree of iron oxidation is 7-35\% and
   appreciably differs from that in the stoichiometric approximation. The
   disturbance of integral stoichiometry by di- and trivalent cations
   (deviation of the Me(3+)/Me(2+) value from 2.0) may be caused not only
   by partial inversion of the mineral structure but also by local
   micro-and nanoscale heterogeneity of the mineral, clustering of Fe(2+)
   and Al (Cr, Fe(3+)) cations, and the appearance of associates. Possible
   application of the QS-distribution method for analyzing nonequivalent
   nuclear iron states and the thermal dynamics of Mossbauer spectra for
   studying local clustering effects of iron cations is discussed. It is
   shown that these approaches give new information on local heterogeneity
   of structural sites occupied by iron ions. DOI:

Abstract = {{Objective: To present the initial clinical experience in children
   undergoing unilateral and bilateral laparoendoscopic single-site
   nephrectomy.
   Patients and Methods: We reviewed our experience with pediatric patients
   who had undergone single-port nephrectomy (SPN) at our institution since
   August of 2009. Access was obtained by using the Hassan technique to
   place a 2-cm SILS (TM) Port (Covidien Surgical Devices, Norwalk, CT),
   which contains a gas insufflation channel and three individual cannulas
   that can readily accommodate laparoscopic instruments up to 12 mm in
   diameter. Nephrectomy was performed using a standard set of laparoscopic
   instruments and a rigid 5 mm 30 degree laparoscope (Karl Storz,
   Tuttlingen, Germany) with an end-on light source. Patient demographics,
   operative details, and postoperative treatment parameters were collected
   and recorded.
   Results: SPN was successfully performed in three consecutive pediatric
   patients (one female and two male patients: aged 11, 10, and 13 years,
   respectively) without placement of additional trocars or conversion to
   open surgery. The operative time for the unilateral SPN was 188 minutes,
   whereas bilateral SPNs required 214 and 300 minutes, respectively.
   Estimated blood loss for the unilateral and bilateral SPNs was 25, 20,
   and 30 mL; whereas patients were discharged on postoperative days 1, 3,
   and 12, respectively. The prolonged hospital stay was secondary to fever
   and pseudomembranous colitis in a patient with dialysis who also
   required a blood transfusion.
   Conclusions: Laparoendoscopic single-site simple nephrectomy is a
   technically demanding yet feasible procedure in children. Further
   studies are necessary to define the indications, advantages, and
   limitations of this technique as compared with standard laparoscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The results of the study of hydrothermal noble opal are discussed. it
   has been established that hydrothermal opal differs in its nanostructure
   and formation conditions from exogenic noble opal. The former is
   composed of smaller globules without any structuring of closely packed
   nanoparticles characteristic of exogenic opal. In the course of
   formation, hydrothermal opal is affected by pneumatolytic annealing
   related to the effect of high-temperature vapors under an elevated
   pressure. At the same time, the thermal effect results in the formation
   of two-dimensional photon zones in the chaotic opal matrix. These photon
   zones are produced by grids, the cells of which arose from a thermal
   effect similar to what related to Benard cells. Precisely, these
   structured blocks and thin films lead to spectral dispersion of light
   and appearance of iridescence.}},

   using a sequence of problems solved by topology optimization techniques.
   Each problem in this sequence is constructed using the solution of the

   the unknown permittivities. Numerical examples illustrate the
   reconstruction procedure for the case when the sizes of the objects are
   of the same order as the wavelength. A good estimate of the

   permittivities vary within a given box and a bound on how lossy the

Title = {{Does cancellous bone compaction due to insertion of a blade implant

Abstract = {{Background: For the treatment of hip fractures helically shaped
   implants, like the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) Blade, are often used. One
   consequence of blade implantation, the compaction of cancellous bone, is
   still believed to increase cut-out resistance. This in vitro study
   investigates implant anchorage of Dynamic Hip Screw Blades in femoral
   heads due to insertion with or without predrilling under cyclic
   physiological loading conditions.
   Methods: Six pairs of fresh frozen (-20 degrees C) human cadaveric
   proximal femora were instrumented with DHS Blades. Bone pairs were
   randomly assigned to two study groups: 1) predrilled; 2) non-predrilled.
   Prior instrumentation, bone mineral density was determined in the center
   of the femoral head by Xtreme-CT measurement. After instrumentation
   biomechanical testing was performed under cyclic loading. The
   boneimplant interface was monitored by means of fluoroscopic imaging
   throughout the experiment. Paired t-tests were performed to identify
   differences regarding bone mineral density, stiffness and cycles to
   failure.
   Findings: No significant differences were found between study groups
   with regard to axial stiffness (P= 0.626) and number of cycles to
   failure (P= 0.961).
   Interpretation: This in vitro study did not show differences in
   biomechanical stability of proximal femora instrumented with a helical
   blade implant with or without predrilling. Clinically, the findings
   suggest that predrilling may be performed to ease the surgical procedure
   without compromising the implant anchorage. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   A ``newbie{''} algorithm is provided for embedding new objects into this

   a smoothing spline ANOVA penalized likelihood model, a support vector
   machine, or any model that will admit reproducing kernel Hilbert space

   Strategy to Protect Their Equity Value? A Study of the Adoption of ISO

Abstract = {{Theoretical as well as empirical evidence regarding the influence of
   institutional ownership on corporate environmental strategy not only is
   inconclusive but also reflects experience from either the Anglo-American
   context or other developed countries. The underlying assumption of most
   of this literature is that institutional shareholders are always
   `active' or `passive' in their actions towards corporate environmental
   strategy. However, this study argues that this relationship might be
   moderated by various motivations such as legitimizing existence and
   operations, conforming with industry norms or lessening managerial
   entrenchment. Econometric analysis, using a sample of Egyptian firms, as
   hypothesized, demonstrated that institutional ownership exerted positive
   and significant effects on a corporation's tendency to adopt
   environmental management standards only when financial resources are
   available and investment opportunities are limited. A possible
   explanation of this finding is that Egyptian institutional investors are
   more likely to use corporate environmental responsibility to offset
   their inability to confront managerial discretionary power. An
   implication of this finding is that not only will different types of
   stakeholder ask for different levels of social and environmental
   responsibility, but also the same type of stakeholder may ask for
   different levels of social and environmental responsibility in different
   contexts. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{639-657}},

Abstract = {{Few qualitative sociologists have considered how men who have sex with
   men hold diverse understandings of sexuality and how these matter in
   research encounters, especially as it regards `touchy' interview topics
   such as intimacy, intercourse and men's bodies. Drawing from transcripts
   and field notes concerning my experiences of interviewing 30
   male-for-male internet escorts in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto (Canada),
   Houston and New York (USA), as well as London (England), I analyse
   moments where, as the interviewer, I was sexualized by respondents. A
   first question was often posed to me at the start of interviews: `are
   you gay?' The `are you gay?' question not only seeks out a singular
   identity declaration but also flips over established
   researcher-respondent roles, indicating that the reflexivity of the
   respondent is as important as the reflexivity of the researcher in
   shaping the conversation to come. My analysis demonstrates why it is
   important to consider the impact of researcher bodies and speech acts
   during interviews. Arguing that there are specificities of talk and
   gesture concerning queer sexualities that researchers must be aware of
   during interviews, I focus on how my responses to respondent
   propositions and sexualization shaped and modified the meanings produced
   through the research encounter.}},

   a case study on Chinese yam (Dioscorea polystachya)}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bulbils serve as a means of vegetative reproduction and of dispersal for
   many plants; this latter aspect making them analogous to seeds. However,
   germination of bulbils may differ considerably from seeds due to
   dissimilar anatomical structures and perhaps environmental cue
   perception. The few laboratory studies done on bulbils suggest that
   their germination is similar to that of seeds in the same habitats and
   to vegetative buds of winter-dormant plants. The present study is the
   first to examine how bulbil germination is controlled in nature in
   relation to dispersal (before vs. after winter of the same cohort) and
   to ambient temperatures.
   Under laboratory conditions, temperature and light requirements for root
   and shoot emergences from bulbils of Dioscorea polystachya collected in
   September, 2005, February, 2006 (produced in 2005) and July, 2006 were
   determined. Effects of cold stratification and dry storage for releasing
   dormancy were tested on September and July bulbils. The phenology of
   dormancy release and of root and shoot emergences and the persistence of
   bulbils in soil were followed over time under field conditions.
   Although a low percentage of bulbils collected in July or in September
   produced roots, but no shoots, in the laboratory and field, these roots
   died within approx. 1 month. Regardless of collection date, cold
   stratification markedly increased root and shoot emergences. Bulbils
   sown outdoors in October produced roots and shoots the following March
   and April, respectively. The soil bulbil bank is short lived.
   Bulbils of D. polystachya are similar to seeds of many temperate plants
   being mostly dormant when dispersed in summer or autumn and overcoming
   dormancy with cold stratification during winter. Adaptively, bulbil

Abstract = {{We describe the presentation of an adolescent with juvenile-onset
   Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) who presented with post-ictal
   psychosis in the context of a developing seizure disorder. After
   demonstrating mild gait disturbance beginning at the age of 4 years, he
   was diagnosed with NPC at age 12 on the basis of 95\% of cultured
   fibroblasts staining positive for filipin and a reduced fibroblast
   cholesterol esterification rate. He then developed a seizure disorder at
   age 15, where clusters of seizures produced typical psychotic symptoms,
   including hallucinations and delusions. His seizure disorder responded
   to valproate, which resulted in a settling of his psychotic symptoms.
   Whilst post-ictal psychosis is rarely reported prior to the age of 16,
   NPC in adolescents and adults is particularly psychotogenic and may
   increase the risk for post-ictal psychosis in the pediatric population.}},

Abstract = {{Lipofibromatosis is a rare, benign fibrofatty tumor of childhood. Since
   the tumor was first characterized in 2000, only a few additional cases
   have been reported. The classic presentation of lipofibromatosis is a
   slow-growing mass arising in a distal extremity, with boys more commonly
   affected than girls. We report a 16-month-old girl who presented with a
   lipofibromatosis in her left scapular region that increased 30\% in size
   during a 6-week period. Although previous case reports of
   lipofibromatosis have emphasized immunohistological findings, this paper
   focuses on imaging findings and discusses the utility of imaging in the
   differential diagnosis of pediatric soft-tissue tumors.}},

Abstract = {{A simple method to fabricate gold nanotube by means of a direct
   electrodeposition is constructed, utilizing anodic aluminum oxide (AAO)
   as a template. The performances of gold nanoelectrode have been
   characterized with cyclic voltammetric technique and scanning electron
   microscope (SEM). The SEM image of as-prepared gold nanoelectrode shows
   that the surface of electrode was covered with honeycomb gold tube with
   average pore diameter 200 nm. Its cyclic voltammetric shows the peak
   current is 6.25 times larger than the bare Au electrode, so the new
   honeycomb gold nanoelectrode was obviously better than conventional gold
   electrode. Microperoxidase-11 (MP-11) was immobilized on the electrode
   and characterized with cyclic voltammetric technique. It was
   demonstrated that the gold nanotube not only could offer a friendly
   environment to immobilize MP-11, but also enhance the electron transfer
   ability between protein molecules and the underlying electrodes.}},

Abstract = {{Saline water has been Included as an important substitutable resource
   for fresh water in agricultural irrigation in many fresh water scarce
   regions In order to make good use of saline water for agricultural
   irrigation in North China a semi-humid area a 3-year field experiment
   was carried out to study the possibility of using saline water for
   supplement irrigation of cucumber Saline water was applied via mulched
   drip irrigation The average electrical conductivity of irrigation water
   (ECIw) was 1 1 22 29 3 5 and 4 2 dS/m in 2003 and 2004 and 11 2 2 3 5 42
   and 49 dS/m in 2005 Throughout cucumber-growing season the soil matric
   potential at 02 m depth immediately under drip emitter was kept higher
   than -20 kPa and saline water was applied after cucumber seedling stage
   The experimental results revealed that cucumber fruit number per plant
   and yield decreased by 5 7\% per unit increase in ECiw, The maximum
   yield loss was around 25\% for ECiw of 4 9 dS/m compared with 1 1 dS/m
   Cucumber seasonal accumulative water use decreased linearly over the
   range of 1 5-69\% per unit increase in ECiw As to the average root zone
   ECe (electical conductivity of saturated paste extract) cucumber yield
   and water use decreased by 108 and 103\% for each unit of ECe increase
   in the root zone (within 40 cm away from emitter and 40 cm depths)
   respectively After 3 years irrigation with saline water there was no
   obvious tendency for ECe to increase in the soil profile of 0-90 cm
   depths So in North China or similar semi-humid area when there is no
   enough fresh water for irrigation saline water up to 4 9 dS/m can be
   used to irrigate field culture cucumbers at the expense of some yield

Abstract = {{The effects of trace Ca addition on microstructure and high-temperature
   creep resistance of as-cast Mg-12Zn-4Al-0.3Mn alloy were investigated.
   Results show that the as-cast microstructure of the base alloy consists
   of alpha-Mg matrix and block quasicrystalline phase at gain boundaries.
   The composition of this quasicrystalline phase is closed to that of the
   equilibrium tau phase (Mg-32(Al,Zn)(49)) in the Mg-Zn-Al ternary system.
   A small amount of Ca addition to the base alloy results in the formation
   of a lamellar eutectic phi(Al2Mg5Zn2) and the transformation of the
   quasicrystalline phase to the equilibrium tau phase in the as-cast
   microstructure of the alloy. The volume fraction of the phi phase
   increases with the increase of Ca addition. The creep resistance of the
   alloys is significantly improved by Ca addition. The optimum creep
   resistance of the alloy is obtained by 0.6\% Ca addition under the creep
   condition of 175 degrees C, 70 MPa, whose steady state creep rate is
   approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of its base alloy.}},

   monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) or antibodies induced by carcinoembryonic
   antigen (CEA) vaccination One hundred and thirty CRC patients were

   anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibody (edrecolomab) (n=17) or rCEA vaccination
   therapeutic cancer vaccine (TCV) (n=21) inducing anti-CEA IgG antibodies
   Ninety-two patients had metastatic disease and received anti-EpCAM MAb
   based therapies Fc gamma R genotypes were analysed using genomic DNA and
   PCR ADCC was tested in a standard 18 h Cr-51 release assay In all
   adjuvant-treated patients, Fc gamma RIIIa158V carriers (V/V and V/F) had
   a significantly better overall survival compared to F/F homozygous
   patients (p<0 05), Fc gamma RIIa R carriers vs H/H (p=0 05) as well as V
   and R carriers combined compared to the others (p<0 05) Similar findings
   were obtained when antibody and TCV-treated patients were analysed
   separately No impact on the prognosis of Fc gamma R polymorphisms was
   noted in advanced disease Fc gamma RIIIa V carriers had a significantly
   higher ADCC activity compared to F/F patients (p=0 001) Our model study
   might support the notion that Fc gamma RIIIa V carriers as well as Fc
   gamma RIIa R carriers receiving adjuvant, passively or actively
   (TCV)-induced antibody treatment might have a better prognosis than the
   others Prospective extended clinical trials are warranted to study the
   predictive/prognostic Impact of Fc gamma R polymorphisms in

Title = {{Correlation and quantitation of microRNA aberrant expression in tissues

Journal = {{GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{586-593}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been underlined as a promising
   potential biomarker for breast cancer but are limited to tissue
   specimens. Clinical specimens of sera are more abundant and more
   conveniently collected than tissues. This work was designed to
   investigate the expression and correlation of a selected panel of miRNAs
   associated with breast tumor in tissues and matching serum samples.
   Methods. Tumor tissues, adjacent non-tumor tissues and matching serum
   samples were collected from 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast
   tumors. Normal control sera were collected from 40 healthy subjects. A
   panel of 6 miRNAs (miRNA-21, 106a, 126, 155, 199a and 335) were selected
   and their aberrant expression levels were quantified by using real-time
   PCR technique.
   Results. A high correlation of miRNA expression level was found between
   breast tumor tissues and sera. MiR-21, miR-106a and miR-155 were
   significantly over-expressed in the tumor specimens compared with those
   in normal controls (P<0.05), whereas miR-126, miR-199a and miR-335 were
   significantly under-expressed (P<0.05). Furthermore, the relative
   expression of miR-21, miR-126, miR-155, miR-199a and miR-335 was closely
   associated with clinicopathologic features of breast cancer (P<0.05),
   such as histological tumor grades and sex hormone receptor expression.
   Conclusions. Selective expression and modulation of miRNAs could be
   potential blood-based biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis, grading
   and prognosis. Our results should encourage further studies on the use
   of miRNAs in serum samples as an easy and convenient method of breast
   cancer screening. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the clam
   Meretrix lusoria (Bivalvia: Veneridae) was determined. It comprises
   20,268 base pairs (bp) and contains 13 protein-coding genes, including
   ATPase subunit 8 (atp8), two ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and a
   non-coding control region. The atp8 encodes a protein of 39 amino acids.
   All genes are encoded on the same strand. A putative control region (CR
   or D-loop) was identified in the major non-coding region (NCR) between
   the tRNA(Gly) and tRNA(Gln). A 1087 bp tandem repeat fragment was
   identified that comprises nearly 11 copies of a 101 bp motif and
   accounts for approximately 41\% of the NCR. The 101 bp tandem repeat
   motif of the NCR can be folded into a stem-loop secondary structure.
   Samples of eight individuals from Hainan and Fujian provinces were
   collected and their NCR regions were successfully amplified and
   sequenced. The data revealed a highly polymorphic VNTR (variable number
   of tandem repeats) associated with high levels of heteroplasmy in the
   D-loop region. The size of the CR ranged from 1942 to 3354 bp depending
   upon the copy number of the repeat sequence. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A new method for the discrimination of varieties of corn was proposed
   based on the data set of near-infrared spectroscopy range from 4 000 to
   12 000 cm(-1) of corn seed varieties. Principal component analysis (PCA)
   method was used to study the feature of the data, and the authors found
   that the near-infrared spectroscopy of corn seed varieties has a clear
   feature of zonal distribution, so the correlativity between the change
   in the distribution of the principal component and the discrimination
   result was studied, according to which the normalized principal
   component analysis (NPCA) method was proposed. Besides, principal
   direction biomimetic pattern recognition (PBPR) was proposed according
   to the feature, which got a better discrimination result. The average
   correct recognition rate attained 97.67\% for test set I, and the
   average correct rejection rate attained 98.40\%, with 13 of the 30
   varieties reaching the correct recognition rate of 100\%; The average
   correct rejection rate attained 98.90\% for the test set II, and 11 of
   the 30 varieties reached the correct rejection rate of 100\%. It was
   proved that the method had a high correct discrimination rate.}},

   Dysfunction: A Meta-Analysis}},

Abstract = {{Introduction.
   Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common disorder noted for affecting
   quality of life. Several studies have reported the influence of
   endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) polymorphisms on ED
   susceptibility. However, results of association studies with
   individually low statistical power are conflicting.
   Aim.
   Our study aimed to carry out a meta-analysis estimating the association
   between eNOS variants and the risk of ED.
   Methods.
   Studies regarding the association between eNOS polymorphisms and ED were
   searched in Medline and Embase databases. The relevant studies that met
   the inclusion criteria were eligible for the analysis.
   Main Outcome Measures.
   Five genetic models and a generalized odds ratio (ORG) were used to
   estimate the association between eNOS G894T and variable number of 27-bp
   tandem repeats in intron 4 (4 VNTR) and the risk of ED.
   Results.
   Nine articles were included in our meta-analysis. Overall, significant
   association between the 894T variant and an increased risk of ED was
   derived for all genetic contrasts except for the recessive model (allele
   contrast: OR = 1.64, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.03-2.60). The
   meta-analysis based on the ORG also produced significant results: ORG =
   1.64, 95\% CI: 1.03-2.61. Significant heterogeneity and publication bias
   were detected. The cumulative meta-analysis showed the OR increased from
   2003 to 2009 and then declined in 2010. Instability in the relative
   change of OR was observed. Regarding 4 VNTR and its association with ED,
   the overall analysis showed a lack of significant association (OR =
   0.96, 95\% CI: 0.72-1.28). No evidence for heterogeneity among studies
   was observed. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity and recruitment strategy
   also yielded nonsignificant results.
   Conclusion.
   The result supports that G894T variant is associated with an increase in
   the risk of ED. No evidence for a significant association between 4VNTR
   and ED is observed. The results of the present meta-analysis should be
   interpreted with caution. Further confirmation in large and
   well-designed studies is needed. Wang J-L, Wang H-G, Gao H-Q, Zhai G-X,

Abstract = {{On the basis of currently available data, approximately 97\% of
   generator-related carbon monoxide (CO) fatalities are caused by
   operating currently marketed, carbureted spark-ignited gasoline-powered
   generators (not equipped with emission controls) in enclosed spaces. To
   better understand and to reduce the occurrence of these fatalities,
   research is needed to quantify CO generation rates, develop and test CO
   emission control devices, and evaluate CO transport and exposure when
   operating a generator in an enclosed space. As a first step in these
   efforts, this paper presents measured CO generation rates from a
   generator without any emission control devices operating in an enclosed
   space under real weather conditions. This study expands on previously
   published information from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   Thirteen separate tests were conducted under different weather
   conditions at half and full generator load settings. It was found that
   the CO level in the shed reached a maximum value of 29,300 +/- 580
   mg/m(3), whereas the oxygen (O-2) was depleted to a minimum level of
   16.2 +/- 0.02\% by volume. For the test conditions of real weather and
   generator operation, the CO generation and the O-2 consumption could be
   expressed as time-averaged generation/consumption rates. It was also
   found that the CO generation and O-2 consumption rates can be correlated
   to the O-2 levels in the space and the actual load output from the
   generator. These correlations are shown to agree well with the
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, three hybrid harmony search (HS) algorithms, namely,
   hybrid harmony search (hHS) algorithm, hybrid globalbest harmony search
   (hgHS) algorithm and hybrid modified globalbest harmony search (hmgHS)
   algorithm, are developed for solving the flow shop scheduling with
   blocking to minimize the total flow time. Firstly, a largest position
   value (LPV) rule is proposed to convert continuous harmony vectors into
   job permutations. Secondly, an initialization scheme based on a variant
   of the NEH heuristic is presented to construct the initial harmony
   memory with certain quality and diversity. Thirdly, HS is employed to
   evolve harmony vectors in the harmony memory to perform exploration,
   whereas a local search algorithm based on the insert neighborhood is
   embedded to enhance the local exploitation ability. In addition, some
   new pitch adjustment rules are developed to well inherit good structures
   from the globalbest harmony vector. Based on a set of well-known
   benchmark instances, extensive computational experiments are carried
   out. Computational results show the effectiveness of the hybrid harmony
   search algorithms, especially the (hmgHS) algorithm, in solving the
   blocking flow shop scheduling with total flow time criterion. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the generality of the velocity structure along the
   gradients of several field variables in scalar form, such as the passive
   scalar, the Cartesian projections of the velocity vector, kinetic energy
   and energy dissipation. These scalar variables behave differently, which
   can be explained mathematically by the fact that the source terms in
   their governing equations are different. Consequently, it is reasonable
   to expect some generalities among different scalars if the respective
   source terms are instantaneously small. The validity of this expectation
   has been discussed for individual cases, especially at high Reynolds
   numbers. It is found that the pointwise mean strain rates along
   gradients of various scalars are always negative. By analyzing the
   scalar gradient orientations, it is seen that statistically the gradient
   vectors with large magnitudes align with each other, whereas those with
   small magnitudes tend to be randomly organized. In terms of the
   two-point velocity increment, for the passive scalar it has recently
   been derived that there exists a nearly linear scaling of the velocity
   difference with respect to the arc length of gradient trajectories (Wang
   2009 Phys. Rev. E 79 046325). Theoretically, this scaling can also be
   extended to other scalars with satisfactory agreement with numerical
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The whitefly Bemisia tabaci has a global distribution and extensive
   genetic diversity. Recent phylogenetic analyses as well as crossing
   experiments suggest that B. tabaci is a complex composed of > 20 cryptic
   species, but more crossing studies are required to examine the
   reproductive compatibility among the putative species and thus further
   clarify the systematics of this species complex. We conducted crossing
   experiments and behavioral observations to investigate the reproductive
   compatibility between the Mediterranean, Asia II 3, and Asia II 1
   putative species of B. tabaci collected from Zhejiang, China. Female
   progeny were never produced in inter-species crosses, demonstrating a
   lack of egg fertilization; while 55\%-75\% females were produced in all
   the intra-species treatments. Continuous behavioral observations showed
   that frequent courtship events occurred in both intra-species treatments
   and inter-putative species crosses. However, copulation events occurred
   only in the three intra-species treatments with one exception: that one
   copulation event occurred between Asia II 3 and Mediterranean in the
   crosses where two cohorts of females and males of different putative
   species were enclosed together in a small arena but were not allowed
   access to their intra-specific mates for a long period of time. These
   data demonstrated complete reproductive isolation between the
   Mediterranean, Asia II 3, and Asia II 1 putative species, and further
   showed that the isolation is due to lack of copulation. Demonstration of
   reproductive isolation between the Mediterranean and two indigenous
   putative species from China provides further evidence for the existence
   of cryptic species within the B. tabaci complex.}},

Abstract = {{Wild Thinopyrum grasses are important gene pools for forage and cereal
   crops. Knowledge of their chromosome organizations is pivotal for
   efficient utilization of this important gene pool in germplasm
   enhancement programs. Expressed sequence tags derived simple sequence
   repeat (EST-SSR) markers for Thinopyrum bessarabicum, T. elongatum, and
   T. junceum chromosomes were identified among amplicons produced from
   three series of wheat-Thinopyrum addition lines using 193 primer pairs
   designed from the Leymus EST unigenes. The homology of T. junceum
   chromosomes in 13 wheat addition lines was tentatively established to
   reveal that homologous groups 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were represented by
   HD3515, HD3505, AJDAj11, AJDAj1, and HD3508, whereas groups 1 and 2 were
   represented by AJADj7-AJDAj9 and AJDAj2-AJDAj4, respectively. AJDAj5 and
   AJDAj6 had complexly reconstituted T. junceum chromosomes that might
   have resulted from fusion or translocations of large chromosomal
   segments from two or more chromosomes, that is (1+5) and (2+5+1),
   respectively. The identified EST-SSR markers will be useful in
   comparative gene mapping, chromosome tracing, taxonomic studies, gene
   introgression, and cultivar identification.}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamics was applied to investigate propane dry reforming (DR) and
   steam reforming (SR) Equilibrium calculations employing the Gibbs free
   energy minimization were performed upon a wide range of pressure (1-5
   atm) temperature (700-1100 K) carbon dioxide to propane ratio (CPR 1-12)
   and water to propane ratio (WPR 1-18) From a thermodynamic perspective,
   it is demonstrated that DR is promising for production of synthesis gas
   with low hydrogen content as opposite to SR which favours generation of
   synthesis gas with high hydrogen content Complete conversion of propane
   was obtained for the range of pressure temperature CPR and WPR
   considered in this study Atmospheric pressure is shown to be preferable
   for both DR and SR Approximately 10 mol of synthesis gas can be produced
   per mole of propane at a temperature greater than 1000 K from DR when
   CPR is higher than 6 The optimum conditions for synthesis gas production
   from DR are found to be 975 K (CPR = 3) for a H-2/CO ratio of 1 and 1100
   K (CPR = 1) for a H-2/CO ratio of 2 The greatest CO2 conversion (95\%)
   can be obtained also at 1100 K and CPR = 1 Preferential conditions for
   hydrogen production from SR are achieved with the temperatures between
   925 and 975 K and WPRs of 12-18 The maximum number of moles of hydrogen
   produced is 9 1 (925 K and WPR = 18) Under conditions that favour
   hydrogen production methane and carbon formation can be eliminated to

   There are few public key encryption algorithms and cryptographic

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{Iodine is essential for the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T-3) and
   thyroxine (T-4). Iodine deficiency leads to inadequate thyroid hormone.
   Hypothyroidism induced by iodine deficiency during gestation and
   postnatal period leads to cognitive deficits in learning and memory.
   However, the mechanism underlying these deficits is unclear.
   Calcium-dependent calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) known as a potential
   memory molecule regulates important neuronal functions including
   learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that hypothyroidism
   alters phosphorylation of CaMKII in hippocampus or even in sympathetic
   ganglia of rats. Though the entorhinal cortex (EC) is an important
   functional structure within the neuronal network responsible for
   learning and memory, little is known about the effect of hypothyroidism
   on phosphorylation of CaMKII in the EC. Here, we report that iodine
   deficiency and propylthiouracil treatment through gestation and
   lactation reduce phosphorylation of CaMKII in the EC of pups. The
   increase of calcineurin, as well as reduction of neurogranin and
   calmodulin, may account for the reduced phosphorylation of CaMKII
   induced by developmental iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism. These
   findings in the EC may contribute to understanding the mechanisms that
   underlie impairment of learning and memory induced by developmental
   iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism.}},

Abstract = {{We proposed a simple method to improve the thermal stability of
   BaMgAl10O17;Eu2+ (BAM) phosphors by the substitution of Si-N bonds for
   Al-O bonds in the host lattice. Both photoluminescence properties and
   thermal stability under ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)
   excitation could be significantly improved through Si-N incorporation.
   After thermal degradation at 600 degrees C for 1 h in air atmosphere,
   the Si-N doped sample (Ba0.88Eu0.12MgAl9.97Si0.03O16.97N0.03) had the
   highest emission intensity which was 22\% and 40\% stronger than that of
   as-received sample under UV and VUV excitation, respectively. This could
   be attributed to the stable local structure surrounding the Eu2+ ions
   and the lower electronegativity of nitrogen.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: The blood perfusion of peripheral nerves plays
   an important role in regeneration after nerve injury. Previous studies
   have shown that it is possible to quantitatively assess the blood
   perfusion of the tissue using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of CEUS for
   quantitative assessment of the blood perfusion of the sciatic nerve in
   normal New Zealand white rabbits and to compare these parameters to
   those of surrounding skeletal muscle and the main artery in the thigh.
   Materials and Methods: CEUS of the bilateral sciatic nerves was
   performed in 12 normal New Zealand white rabbits after a bolus injection
   of SonoVue (0.13 mL/kg). Pulse-inversion harmonic imaging was used for
   real-time CEUS. The blood perfusion of the left sciatic nerve was
   compared to that of its surrounding muscle, the arterial branch in the
   thigh, and the contralateral side.
   Results: The supplying arteries in the sciatic nerve could be
   demonstrated during the early phase of CEUS, followed by the homogeneous
   enhancement of the whole nerve. The area under the curve and the
   perfusion index of the sciatic nerve were higher than those of the
   surrounding muscle and lower than those of the arterial branch in the
   thigh (both P values = .000). The maximum intensity of the sciatic nerve
   was similar to that of skeletal muscle and lower than that of the
   arterial branch. The time to peak was not significantly different among
   the sciatic nerve, skeletal muscle, and arterial branch (P = .551).
   There were no differences in area under the curve, mean transit time,
   perfusion index, maximum intensity, and time to peak between the left
   and right sciatic nerves (P > .05).
   Conclusions: CEUS may be a feasible method for the quantitative
   assessment of blood perfusion of the peripheral nerves.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic properties of hydrogen-saturated GaN nanowires with
   different orientations and sizes are investigated using first principles

   electronic properties of nanowires in all three directions are extremely
   similar. All the hydrogen-saturated GaN nanowires show semiconducting
   behavior with a direct band gap larger than that of bulk wurtzite GaN.
   Quantum confinement leads to a decrease in the band gap of the nanowires
   with increasing nanowire size. The {[}0 0 1]-oriented nanowires with
   hexagonal cross sections are energetically more favorable than the {[}1

Abstract = {{This study is based on a new approach for an advanced microproduction
   system or highly flexible production systems where all necessary
   production and assembly processes are connected in a very flexible way
   using autonomous mobile transport and handling robots. Each robot has to
   follow its planned paths while avoiding collisions with other robots. In
   addition, problem-specific constraints for a defined microproduction
   system, such as limitations of the velocity and accelerations of the
   robots, have to be fulfilled. This paper focuses on a two-level model
   predictive optimizing approach. On a global long-term level, simple
   dynamic models of the robots are used to compute optimal paths under
   differential constraints where a safety distance between all robots is
   achieved. Since many uncertainties and unforeseen events could occur,
   all robots also use a nonlinear model predictive control approach on a
   local real-time level. This control approach solves the path following
   and the collision avoidance problems in parallel, while also taking into
   account differential constraints of the single robots.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: These analyses were designed to characterize
   renal disease progression in untreated adults with Fabry disease.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: Data from the Fabry
   Registry for 462 untreated adults (121 men and 341 women) who had at
   least two estimated GFR (eGFR) values over a span >= 12 months before
   starting enzyme replacement therapy were included.
   Results: Most men (86 of 121, 71\%) had more rapid loss of kidney
   function than the normal adult population (loss of eGFR > -1 ml/min per
   1.73 m(2) per year), whereas fewer women (133 of 341, 39\%) had rapid
   loss of kidney function. Patients with rapid progression had
   significantly higher mean averaged urinary protein to urinary creatinine
   ratios (UP/Cr) than patients with slower progression (1.5 versus 0.2 for
   men; 1.4 versus 0.5 for women; P < 0.0001). Patients were grouped into
   quartiles based on averaged UP/Cr; renal function in men declined more
   rapidly with higher UP/Cr, with the steepest declines observed in men
   with UP/Cr > 1.5 (mean eGFR slope, -5.6 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year; n
   = 30). eGFR slope declined more slowly in women, with the steepest
   declines observed in women with UP/Cr > 1.2 (mean eGFR slope, -1.3
   ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year; n = 85). Regression models of eGFR slope
   indicated that UP/Cr is the most important indicator of renal disease
   progression in adult Fabry patients. In women, lower baseline eGFR and
   age were also associated with renal disease progression. Women who had
   clinical events had more rapid loss of kidney function.
   Conclusions: Urinary protein excretion is strongly associated with renal
   disease progression in men and women with Fabry disease. Clin J Am Soc

   compound seemed to be (R, S)-1N-{[}(2,6-dimethyl) phenoxyethyl]
   amino-2-butanol, which displayed anti-MES activity (in mice, i.p.) with
   protective index (TD50/ED50) of 5.712, corresponding to that of
   phenytoin (6.6), carbamazepine (4.9) and valproate (1.7). The
   lipophilicity of compounds 1-17 exhibiting anticonvulsant activity was
   investigated. Their lipophilicities (R-M0) were determined using
   reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (RP-TLC) with a mixture of
   acetone and water as mobile phases. The partition coefficients of 1-17
   (logP) were also calculated using two computer programs (Pallas and
   ALOGPS) and compared with RM0. The relationship between anticonvulsant
   activity and lipophilicity of the tested substances was estimated.

Abstract = {{Infections caused by Human Rhinoviruses (HRVs) account for 25-50\% of
   respiratory illnesses among individuals presenting influenza-like
   illness (ILI). HRVs could be classified in at least three species:
   HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C. The HRV-C species has frequently been described
   among children and has led to severe illness resulting in
   hospitalization; however, the occurrence among adults is unknown. The
   aim of this study was to assess the clinical presentation and species
   distribution of HRV infections in different populations during
   2001-2008. A total of 770 samples were collected. Subjects consisted of
   136 adults from the general community and 207 health-care workers
   (2001-2003), 232 renal-transplanted outpatients (2002-2004), 70 children
   with congenital heart disease (2005) and 125 children from a day-care
   center (2008). Amplification of HRV genes was performed by reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and followed by
   sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. HRV was detected in 27.4\% of
   samples (211/770), with 72 children (36.9\%) and 139 adults infected
   (24.2\%). A total of 89.61\% (138/154) unknown HRV strains were
   sequenced, and 79.22\% (122/138) were analyzed. We identified 74
   isolates (60.7\%) of the HRV A species, 21(17.2\%) of the HRV B species
   and 27 isolates (22.1\%) of the HRV C species. HRV species A and B
   caused ILI among adult patients, whereas HRV-C did not. The dynamics of
   infection among different species deserve further analysis. J. Med.

Abstract = {{Wave reflection by a uniformly moving stress-free edge is discussed for
   all three types of incident plane SH, P and SV-waves, and the Rayleigh
   surface wave on the moving edge is also discussed. Focusing on the
   Doppler effect and ray angles for the reflected wave, all frequency
   shifts and reflection angles are expressed in the closed form of simple
   algebraic equations. It is found that the Rayleigh surface wave on the
   moving stress-free edge has its complex velocity. This complex velocity
   means that the Rayleigh wave decays when the edge is expanding, but
   grows exponentially when the edge is shrinking. This is a completely new

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles stabilized with thioglucose (TGlu-AuNPs), which have
   carboxyl groups on the particle surface as anchoring sites for covalent
   immobilization of biomolecules, were prepared by the chemical reduction
   of HAuCl4 using 1-thio-beta-D-glucose as a reducing and stabilizing
   agent, and their application to colorimetric bioassay was demonstrated
   using the carbohydrate-lectin system. p-Aminophenyl alpha-D-mannose
   (Man-NH2) was covalently attached by a conventional method to the
   activated carboxyl groups on the TGlu-AuNPs. On addition of Con A to the
   Man-AuNPs, multiple binding events occurred between Con A and the
   mannoses immobilized on the particle surface. This Con A-induced
   aggregation resulted in a significant red shift in local surface plasmon
   resonance. The binding isotherm showed a sigmoidal curve, indicating
   cooperativity in the binding of Con A and the Man-AuNPs. In addition,
   Hill plots showed two nonequivalent binding modes, with the K-d values
   for high- and low-affinity binding of 11.3 and 66.5 pM, respectively,
   which was significantly lower than that for methyl-alpha-D-mannose
   binding to Con A. The enhanced binding affinity between Man-AuNPs and
   Con A involves the cluster effect of the carbohydrate groups on the
   AuNPs. A linear correlation curve was obtained in the range 10-100 nM
   (R-2 =0.983). The limit of detection (LOD) for Con A was 9.0 nM in
   aqueous buffer, which is comparable to that of other conventional
   methods such as ELISA. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{4-(p-Sulphamoylphenyl)androstenedione (3) and 6 alpha-p-sulphamoylphenyl
   analogues 12-14 were synthesised and tested as aromatase inhibitors as
   well as oestrone sulphatase inhibitors in human placental microsomes.
   All of the p-sulphamoylphenyl compounds synthesised were powerful
   inhibitors of aromatase with apparent K-i values ranging between 30 and
   97 nM. In addition, the aromatase inhibitory activities of 6
   alpha-p-hydroxyphenyl compounds 9-11, which may be produced from their
   respective sulphamoylphenyl compounds by action of oestrone sulphatase,
   were also high in a range of 23 and 75 nM of the K-i values. On the
   other hand, all of the sulphamoylphenyl compounds were poor inhibitors
   of oestrone sulphatase with more than about 200 mu M of IC25 values.
   Although the present findings of the oestrone sulphatase inhibition are
   disappointing, such attempts may be valuable to develop a new class of
   drugs having a dual function, aromatase inhibitor and oestrone
   sulphatase inhibitor, for the treatment of oestrogen-dependent breast

Abstract = {{Resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) represents a major contributor to
   cancer-related mortality in advanced colorectal cancer patients. Genetic
   variations and expression alterations in genes involved in 5-FU
   metabolism and effect have been shown to modulate 5-FU sensitivity in
   vitro, however these alterations do not fully explain clinical
   resistance to 5-FU-based chemotherapy. To determine if alterations of
   DNA copy number in genes involved in 5-FU metabolism-impacted clinical
   resistance to 5-FU-based chemotherapy, we assessed thymidylate
   synthetase (TYMS) and thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) copy number in
   colorectal liver metastases. DNA copy number of TYMS and TYMP was
   evaluated using real time quantitative PCR in frozen colorectal liver
   metastases procured from 62 patients who were pretreated with 5-FU-based
   chemotherapy prior to surgical resection (5-FU exposed) and from 51
   patients who received no pretreatment (unexposed). Gain of TYMS DNA copy
   number was observed in 18\% of the 5-FU exposed metastases, while only
   4\% of the unexposed metastases exhibited TYMS copy gain (p = 0.036). No
   significant differences were noted in TYMP copy number alterations
   between 5-FU-exposed and -unexposed metastases. Median survival time was
   similar in 5-FU-exposed patients with metastases containing TYMS
   amplification and those with no amplification. However, TYMS
   amplification was associated with shorter median survival in patients
   receiving post-resection chemotherapy (hazard ratio = 2.7, 95\%
   confidence interval = 1.1-6.6; p = 0.027). These results suggest
   amplification of TYMS amplification as a putative mechanism for clinical
   resistance to 5-FU-based chemotherapy and may have important
   ramifications for the post-resection chemotherapy choices for metastatic
   colorectal cancer. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The popularity of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) is increasing
   rapidly. In order to make learning environments more efficient,
   researchers have been exploring the possibility of an automatic

   One of the possible adaptation techniques is adaptive item sequencing by
   matching the difficulty of the items to the learner's knowledge level.
   This is already accomplished to a certain extent in adaptive testing
   environments, where the test is tailored to the person's ability level
   by means of the item response theory (IRT). Even though IRT has been a
   prevalent computerized adaptive test (CAT) approach for decades and
   applying IRT in item-based ITSs could lead to similar advantages as in
   CAT (e.g. higher motivation and more efficient learning), research on
   the application of IRT in such learning environments is highly
   restricted or absent. The purpose of this paper was to explore the
   feasibility of applying IRT in adaptive item-based ITSs. Therefore, we
   discussed the two main challenges associated with IRT application in
   such learning environments: the challenge of the data set and the
   challenge of the algorithm. We concluded that applying IRT seems to be a
   viable solution for adaptive item selection in item-based ITSs provided
   that some modifications are implemented. Further research should shed
   more light on the adequacy of the proposed solutions.}},

Title = {{Effects of tree species and N additions on forest floor microbial
   communities and extracellular enzyme activities}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2161-2173}},

Abstract = {{Forest nitrogen (N) retention and soil carbon (C) storage are influenced
   by tree species and their associated soil microbial communities. As
   global change factors alter forest composition, predicting long-term C
   and N dynamics will require understanding microbial community structure
   and function at the tree species level. Because atmospheric N deposition
   is increasing N inputs to forested ecosystems across the globe,
   including the northeastern US, it is also important to understand how
   microbial communities respond to added N. While prior studies have
   examined these topics in mixed-species stands, we focused on the
   responses of different tree species and their associated microbial
   communities within a single forest type a northern hardwood forest in
   the Catskills Mountains, NY. Based on prior studies, we hypothesized
   that N additions would stimulate extracellular enzyme activities in
   relatively labile litters, but suppress oxidative enzyme activities in
   recalcitrant litters, and tested for independent tree species effects
   within this context. During the 2007 growing season (May June), we
   measured enzyme activities and microbial community composition (using
   phospholipid fatty acid analysis - PLEA) of the forest floor in
   single-species plots dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharurn), yellow
   birch (Betula alleghaniensis), red oak (Quercus rubra), American beech
   (Fagus granchfolia) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), species
   whose litters range from relatively labile to recalcitrant. Half the
   plots were fertilized with N by adding NH4NO3 (50 kg ha(-1)y(-1)) from
   1997 to 2009. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and
   multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) were used to examine
   microbial community structure and relationship to enzyme activities.
   We found that in response to N additions, both microbial community
   composition and enzyme activities changed: however the strength of the
   changes were tree species-specific and the direction of these changes
   was and not readily predictable from prior studies conducted in
   mixed-species stands. For example, in contrast to other studies, we
   found that N additions caused a significant overall increase in fungal
   biomass that was strongest for yellow birch (24\% increase) and weakest
   for sugar maple (1\% increase). Contrary to our initial hypotheses and
   current conceptual models, N additions reduced hydrolytic enzyme
   activities in hemlock plots and reduced oxidative enzyme activity in
   birch plots, a species with relatively labile litter. These responses
   suggest that our understanding of the interactions between microbial
   community composition, enzyme activity, substrate chemistry, and
   nutrient availability as influenced by tree species composition is
   incomplete. NMS ordination showed that patterns in microbial community
   structure (PISA) and function (enzyme activity) were more strongly
   influenced by tree species than by fertilization, and only partially
   agreed with the structure function relationships found in other studies.
   This finding suggests that tree species-specific responses are likely to
   be important in determining the structure and function of northeastern
   hardwood forests in the future. Enhanced understanding of microbial
   responses to added N in single and mixed-species substrates with varying
   amounts of lignin and phenols may be needed for accurate predictions of
   future soil C and N dynamics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Nucleosomes that contain the histone variant H2A.Z are enriched around
   transcriptional start sites, but the mechanistic basis for this
   enrichment is unknown. A single octameric nucleosome can contain two
   H2A.Z histones (homotypic) or one H2A.Z and one canonical H2A
   (heterotypic). To elucidate the function of H2A.Z, we generated
   high-resolution maps of homotypic and heterotypic Drosophila H2A.Z
   (H2Av) nucleosomes. Although homotypic and heterotypic H2A.Z nucleosomes
   mapped throughout most of the genome, homotypic nucleosomes were
   enriched and heterotypic nucleosomes were depleted downstream of active
   promoters and intron-exon junctions. The distribution of homotypic H2A.Z
   nucleosomes resembled that of classical active chromatin and showed
   evidence of disruption during transcriptional elongation. Both homotypic
   H2A.Z nucleosomes and classical active chromatin were depleted
   downstream of paused polymerases. Our results suggest that H2A.Z
   enrichment patterns result from intrinsic structural differences between
   heterotypic and homotypic H2A.Z nucleosomes that follow disruption
   during transcriptional elongation.}},

Abstract = {{Four spontaneous rye sourdough fermentations were performed over a
   period of ten days with daily back-slopping. Samples taken at all
   refreshment steps were used for culture-dependent and
   culture-independent characterization of the microbiota present.
   Furthermore, an extensive metabolite target analysis was performed
   through a combination of various chromatographic methods, including
   liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas
   chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Spearman's rank
   correlation coefficients were calculated and a principal component
   analysis (PCA) was performed on the data obtained in this study combined
   with data obtained previously for wheat and spelt sourdoughs. In
   general, the establishment of a stable microbial ecosystem occurred
   through a three-phase evolution, with mainly Lactobacillus plantarum and
   Lactobacillus fermentum dominating the rye sourdough ecosystems. PCA
   revealed that ornithine and mannitol were positively correlated with rye
   sourdoughs, contributing to bacterial competitiveness at the onset of
   sourdough production. Wheat and spelt sourdoughs showed a high degree of
   similarity, although certain compounds (e.g. indolelactic acid) appeared
   to be specific for spelt sourdoughs. The production of amino acid
   metabolites, mainly hydroxy acids (e.g. phenyllactic acid) and alcohols
   (e.g. 3-methyl-1-butanol), contributed to the equilibration of the redox
   balance and further enhanced the competitiveness of dominant species in
   stable sourdoughs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive computer use amongst office workers has lead to an increase in
   work-related neck pain. Aberrant activity within the three portions of
   the trapezius muscle and associated changes in scapular posture have
   been identified as potential contributing factors. This study compared
   the activity (surface electromyography) of the three portions of the
   trapezius in healthy controls (n = 20) to a neck pain group with poor
   scapular posture (n = 18) during the performance of a functional typing
   task. A scapular postural correction strategy was used to correct
   scapular orientation in the neck pain group and electromyographic
   recordings were repeated. During the typing task, the neck pain group
   generated greater activity in the middle trapezius (MT) (p = 0.02) and
   less activity in the lower trapezius (LT) (p = 0.03) than the control
   group. Following correction of the scapula, activity recorded by the
   neck pain group was similar to the control group for the middle and
   lower portions (p = 0.09: p = 0.91). These findings indicate that a
   scapular postural correction exercise may be effective in altering the
   distribution of activity in the trapezius to better reflect that

   specified ellipsoidal sets. The aim of the addressed filtering problem
   is to develop a recursive algorithm based on the semi-definite programme
   method such that, for the admissible time-delays, nonlinear parameters
   and external bounded noise disturbances, the quadratic estimation error
   is not more than a certain optimized upper bound at every time step. The
   filter parameters are characterized in terms of the solution to a convex
   optimization problem that can be easily solved by using the
   semi-definite programme method. A simulation example is exploited to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short noncoding RNAs that participate
   in mastering the balance of gene-regulating networks. By targeting and
   controlling expression of messenger RNA, miRNAs can control highly
   complex signal transduction pathways and other biological pathways.
   Unique aberrant expression of miRNA at each stage of cancer development
   suggests that miRNA could play a novel role in cancer diagnosis and
   therapeutic strategies. Accumulated information on epigenetic
   modification of miRNA suggests a promising platform for miRNA in cancer
   therapy. Clinical applications exploiting the understanding of miRNA's
   function will be the next great challenge in cancer research.}},

Abstract = {{In Malaysia, the major consumers of energy are the industrial and
   transport sectors. The demand is expected to increase steadily in tandem
   with the growth of the economy. As such, alternative sources of energy
   need to be developed, in particular energy from renewable sources, to
   meet the energy requirements. Fatty acid methyl esters, commonly known
   as biodiesel, derived from oils and fats have long been known as a
   potential diesel substitute. Biodiesel is suitable to be used neat or
   blended with petroleum diesel in any proportion in an unmodified diesel
   engine. However, the many concerns related to the emissions from the
   production and use of biodiesel have been discussed globally. Thus, this
   life cycle assessment study was conducted to investigate the
   environmental impacts from the production and use of palm biodiesel
   produced using MPOB's production technology. The results show that the
   environmental impact from the production of palm biodiesel is related to
   the use of methanol, while the use of palm biodiesel contributes to the
   impact categories of respiratory inorganics and
   acidification/eutrophication. In spite of these, the production and use
   of palm biodiesel is more environmental-friendly as compared to
   petroleum diesel.}},

Abstract = {{Killer whales Orcinus orca are considered to be relatively uncommon in
   tropical waters. Few sightings have been reported from the west coast of
   Africa due to a paucity of survey coverage. We present data on 32 killer
   sightings from tropical waters off Angola (N = 18), Gabon (N = 7), Sao
   Tome (N = 6) and Cameroon (N =1), comprising a combination of dedicated
   survey sightings (N = 21) and reliable anecdotal records (n = 11).
   Killer whales were reported from coastal waters, the shelf edge and
   deep, oceanic areas. Sightings indicate a probable year-round occurrence
   of killer whales within the region. Mean group size was 5.6 animals.
   There was no difference in group size between sightings in waters >200 m
   deep and those on the continental shelf. No photo-identification matches
   were found between Angola, Gabon and Sao Tome. Re-sightings of two
   individuals occurred annually in Sao Tome during 2002-2004. Killer
   whales had external appearance consistent with the Type A nominate
   species form. Antagonistic encounters were recorded between killer
   whales and humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae off Angola, Gabon and
   Cameroon, and with sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus off Angola.
   Predation on ocean sunfish Mola mola was recorded in Sao Tome, and
   possible predation on sharks was recorded twice in Gabon.}},

Abstract = {{We report new observations of atomic and molecular gas in a
   volume-limited sample of elliptical galaxies. Combining the elliptical
   sample with an earlier and similar lenticular one, we show that cool gas
   detection rates are very similar among low-luminosity E and S0 galaxies
   but are much higher among luminous S0s. Using the combined sample we
   revisit the correlation between cool gas mass and blue luminosity which
   emerged from our lenticular survey, finding strong support for previous
   claims that the molecular gas in ellipticals and lenticulars has
   different origins. Unexpectedly, however, and contrary to earlier
   claims, the same is not true for atomic gas. We speculate that both the
   active galactic nucleus feedback and merger paradigms might offer
   explanations for differences in detection rates, and might also point
   toward an understanding of why the two gas phases could follow different
   evolutionary paths in Es and S0s. Finally, we present a new and puzzling
   discovery concerning the global mix of atomic and molecular gas in
   early-type galaxies. Atomic gas comprises a greater fraction of the cool
   interstellar medium in more gas-rich galaxies, a trend which can be
   plausibly explained. The puzzle is that galaxies tend to cluster around
   molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratios near either 0.05 or 0.5.}},

Abstract = {{The new superconducting system Sr2VO3-delta FeAs has been fabricated at
   different oxygen contents. It is found that the superconducting
   transition temperature drops monotonically with the increase of oxygen
   deficiency and the residual resistivity, indicating an anomalous pair
   breaking effect by disorders. Magnetotransport measurements reveal that
   the superconducting transition evolves from one-step-like at low field
   to two-step-like at high field. The first step corresponds to the upper
   critical field, while the second one is related to the irreversibility
   line. A vortex phase diagram is thus derived, which shows a large area
   of vortex liquid state. This indicates a high anisotropy of the system.
   Finally we present the specific heat of the optimally doped sample
   (delta approximate to 0.1) with T-c = 40 K. A high residual specific
   heat coefficient appears in the superconducting state, suggesting the
   existence of large amount of unpaired electrons which may derive from
   the V-band. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Self-Mating in the Definitive Host Potentiates Clonal Outbreaks of the

Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Tissue-encysting coccidia, including Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis
   neurona, are heterogamous parasites with sexual and asexual life stages
   in definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. During its sexual
   life stage, T. gondii reproduces either by genetic out-crossing or via
   clonal amplification of a single strain through self-mating.
   Out-crossing has been experimentally verified as a potent mechanism
   capable of producing offspring possessing a range of adaptive and
   virulence potentials. In contrast, selfing and other life history
   traits, such as asexual expansion of tissue-cysts by oral transmission
   among intermediate hosts, have been proposed to explain the genetic
   basis for the clonal population structure of T. gondii. In this study,
   we investigated the contributing roles self-mating and sexual
   recombination play in nature to maintain clonal population structures
   and produce or expand parasite clones capable of causing disease
   epidemics for two tissue encysting parasites. We applied high-resolution
   genotyping against strains isolated from a T. gondii waterborne outbreak
   that caused symptomatic disease in 155 immune-competent people in Brazil
   and a S. neurona outbreak that resulted in a mass mortality event in
   Southern sea otters. In both cases, a single, genetically distinct clone
   was found infecting outbreak-exposed individuals. Furthermore, the T.
   gondii outbreak clone was one of several apparently recombinant progeny
   recovered from the local environment. Since oocysts or sporocysts were
   the infectious form implicated in each outbreak, the expansion of the
   epidemic clone can be explained by self-mating. The results also show
   that out-crossing preceded selfing to produce the virulent T. gondii
   clone. For the tissue encysting coccidia, self-mating exists as a key
   adaptation potentiating the epidemic expansion and transmission of newly
   emerged parasite clones that can profoundly shape parasite population
   genetic structures or cause devastating disease outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic tree-search is a major aspect of many evolutionary studies.
   Several tree rearrangement algorithms are available for tree-search, but
   it is hard to draw general conclusions about their relative performance
   because many effects are data set specific and can be highly dependent
   on individual implementations (e.g., RAxML or phyml). Using only the
   structure of the rearrangements proposed by the Nearest Neighbor
   Interchange (NNI) algorithm, we show tree-search can prematurely
   terminate if it encounters multifurcating trees. We validate the
   relevance of this result by demonstrating that in real data the majority
   of possible bifurcating trees potentially encountered during tree-search
   are actually multifurcations, which suggests NNI would be expected to
   perform poorly. We also show that the star-decomposition algorithm is a
   special case of two other popular tree-search algorithms, subtree
   pruning and regrafting (SPR) and tree bisection and reconnection (TBR),
   which means that these two algorithms can efficiently escape when they
   encounter multifurcations. We caution against the use of the NNI
   algorithm and for most applications we recommend the use of more robust
   tree-search algorithms, such as SPR and TBR.}},

Abstract = {{Communicable and vaccine-preventable airway infections are a major
   public and occupational health issue. The epidemiology of pertussis has
   changed, with unprotected adults being the main source of infections.
   Thus, the prevention of a transmission from health care workers (HCWs)
   to patients is an important strategy to control this communicable
   infection. The Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) at the Robert
   Koch-Institute in Germany has explicitly recommended that HCWs ought to
   be vaccinated against pertussis. However, vaccination rates among HCWs
   remain low. This study was meant to evaluate the attitudes of HCWs
   towards the pertussis vaccination and to determine the correlation
   between the influenza and pertussis vaccination status of HCWs.
   An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to HCWs at a German
   university hospital.
   Overall, we found a disturbingly low level of awareness concerning
   official recommendations as to immunizations (35.6\%) and the personal
   risk assessment of acquiring a work-related pertussis infection
   (23.2\%). In general, both aspects were frequently associated with a
   refusal to get immunized. A strong correlation between the immunization
   status of pertussis and influenza was found among physicians: overall,
   93.1\% of physicians who were vaccinated against pertussis were also
   vaccinated against influenza. Nurses showed significantly weaker
   correlation rates as well as lower vaccination rates (p < 0.05).
   Misconceptions about pertussis and low vaccination rates were prevalent
   among HCWs, particularly nurses. Hospital-based pertussis vaccination
   campaigns should focus on the risk of nosocomial pertussis transmission
   and on the new recommendations for pertussis immunization among adults
   and HCWs.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the influence
   of theoretically important dimensions of stability and change in
   economic hardship during early middle years on decade-long health
   problems of husbands and wives. Method: The study used prospective data
   collected from 360 middle-aged husbands and wives during a 12-year
   period. The variables included self-reported economic hardship (22
   items), mental and physical health, and physical impairment. Results:
   The results supported the hypothesis that the dynamics of family
   economic hardship (in terms of stability and change) during the early
   middle years contribute to subsequent onset of health problems of
   middle-aged husbands and wives. These health problems in turn progress
   as an interrelated process through intrahealth-domain continuities,
   cross-health domain proliferations, and dyadic associations as they pass
   through midlife. Discussion: A better understanding of these processes
   may aid in the formation and effective implementation of health
   promotion programs for middle-aged husbands and wives.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to examine the moderating effect of coping
   strategies on the relationship between work-related dimensions (i.e.

   sample of 385 white-collar employees, full-time employed in various
   types of private sector organizations, belong to different industries
   and ranked at different levels within the organizations responded. The
   factor analysis led to identify four broad coping strategies that
   individuals use, namely, individual positive coping, workplace
   initiatives, workplace informal support and individual destructive
   coping. It was found that both individual positive coping and workplace
   initiatives moderate the relationship between `relationships with
   others' and job stress. However, none of the coping strategies have
   moderated the relationship between job stress and the other three

Abstract = {{Particles adsorb biomolecules such as proteins and lipids from
   biological fluids. Accordingly, respirable particles (aerodynamic
   diameter <3 mu m) inside lung alveolae bind molecules from lung
   surfactant (LS) which is composed of lipids (90\%) and surfactant
   proteins (10\%). In this paper we show that particles impair lung
   function by adsorbing LS. To this aim, we suspended particles
   characterized by different surface sizes such as quartz DQ12 and
   amorphous silica HDKN20 in 0.9\% NaCl and tested the effect of a
   particle containing fluid bolus on the compliance of the isolated rat
   lung in the presence and absence of surfactant. A method was deviced in
   which the left lung of the rat was ventilated ex vivo by periodic
   negative pressure pulses. As an indirect measure of lung compliance the
   maximal expiratory volume flow of the isolated lung (MEF-IL) was
   measured. Experiments were carried out for 90 min during which MEF-IL
   showed a slight run down by about 20\%. Instillation of 0.9\% NaCl
   further reduced MEF-IL; this effect was attenuated if lung lavage fluid
   was used and was completely reversed by commercially available
   surfactant. Instillation of quartz DQ12 (5 mg) and HDK N20 (2 mg)
   suspended in 0.9\% NaCl lowered MEF-IL within 10 min by 50.3\% and
   58.2\%, respectively. In both cases pre-coating with or subsequent
   addition of surfactant abrogated the inhibitory effect of particles on
   MEF-IL. Experiments show that suspended particles affect lung compliance
   by adsorbing surfactant and that this effect can be quantified by an ex
   vivo lung model.}},

Abstract = {{This study used data from 3 sites to examine the invariance and
   psychometric characteristics of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 across
   Black, Hispanic, and White mothers of 5th graders (N = 4,711; M = 38.07
   years of age, SD = 7.16). Internal consistencies were satisfactory for
   all subscale scores of the instrument regardless of ethnic group
   membership. Mean and covariance structures analysis indicated that the
   hypothesized 3-factor structure of the instrument was not robust across
   ethnic groups. It provided a reasonable approximation to the data for
   Black and White women but not for Hispanic women. Tests for differential
   item functioning (DIF) were therefore conducted for only Black and White
   women. Analyses revealed no more than trivial instances of nonuniform
   DIF but more substantial evidence of uniform DIF for 3 of the 18 items.
   After having established partial strong factorial invariance of the
   instrument, latent factor means were found to be significantly higher
   for Black than for White women on all 3 subscales (somatization,
   depression, anxiety). In conclusion, the instrument may be used for mean
   comparisons between Black and White women.}},

Abstract = {{Background As the knowledge translation and comparative effectiveness
   research agendas gain momentum, we can expect more evidence on which to
   base quality improvement (QI) programmes. Unaided searches for such
   content in the literature, however, are likely to be daunting, with
   searches missing key articles while mainly retrieving articles that are
   irrelevant to the question being asked. The objective of this study was
   to develop and validate optimal Medline search filters for retrieving
   original and review articles about clinical QI.
   Methods Analytical survey in the McMaster Clinical Hedges database and
   Health Knowledge Refinery (HKR) of 161 clinical journals to determine
   the operating characteristics of QI search filters developed by
   computerised combinations of terms selected to detect original QI
   studies and systematic reviews meeting basic methodological criteria for
   scientific merit. Results from a derivation random subset of articles
   were tested in a validation random subset.
   Results The Clinical Hedges QI database contained 49 233 citations of
   which 471 (0.96\%) were original or review QI studies; of those, 282
   (60\%) were methodologically sound. Combinations of search terms reached
   peak sensitivities of 100\% at a specificity of 89.3\% for detecting
   methodologically sound original and review QI studies, and sensitivities
   of 97.6\% at a specificity of 53.0\% for detecting all original and
   review QI studies independent of rigour. Operating characteristics of
   the search filters derived in the development database worked similarly
   in the validation database, without statistical differences.
   Conclusion New empirically derived Medline search filters have been
   validated to optimise retrieval of original and review QI articles.}},

Abstract = {{Wood-derived silicon carbide (SiC) offers a specific biomorphous
   microstructure similar to the cellular pore microstructure of bone.
   Compared with bioactive ceramics such as calcium phosphate, however,
   silicon carbide is considered not to induce spontaneous interface
   bonding to living bone. Bioactivation by chemical treatment of
   biomorphous silicon carbide was investigated in order to accelerate
   osseointegration and improve bone bonding ability. Biomorphous SiC was
   processed from sipo (Entrandrophragma utile) wood by heating in an inert
   atmosphere and infiltrating the resulting carbon replica with liquid
   silicon melt at 1450 degrees C. After removing excess silicon by
   leaching in HF/HNO3 the biomorphous preform consisted of beta-SIC with a
   small amount (approximately 6 wt.\%) of unreacted carbon. The preform
   was again leached in HCl/HNO3 and finally exposed to CaCl2 solution.
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared
   analyses proved that oxidation of the residual carbon at the surface
   induced formation of carboxyl {[}COO-] groups, which triggered
   adsorption of Ca2+, as confirmed by XPS and inductively coupled plasma
   optical emission spectroscopy measurements. A local increase in Ca2+
   concentration stimulated in vitro precipitation of Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH (HAP)
   on the silicon carbide preform surface during exposure to simulated body
   fluid, which indicates a significantly increased bone bonding activity
   compared with SiC. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

   soccer performance test: Ball-sport Endurance and Sprint Test
   (BEAST(90)). Fifteen healthy male amateur soccer players participated
   and attended 5 testing sessions over a 10-day period to perform
   physiologic and soccer-specific assessments. This included
   familiarization sessions and 2 full trials of the BEAST(90), separated
   by 7 days. The total 90-minute distance, mean percent peak heart rate
   (HRpeak), and estimated percent peak oxygen uptake of the BEAST(90) were
   8,097 +/- 458 m, 85 +/- 5\% and 82 +/- 14\%, respectively. Measures
   obtained from trial 1 and trial 2 were not significantly different (p >
   0.05). Reliability of measures over 90 minutes ranged from 0.9-25.5\%
   (\% typical error). The BEAST(90) protocol replicated soccer match play
   in terms of time, movement patterns, physical demands (volume and
   intensity), distances, and mean and HRpeak values, as well as having an
   aerobic load similar to that observed during a soccer match.
   Reproducibility of key physical measures during the BEAST(90) were
   mostly high, suggesting good reliability. The BEAST(90) could be used in
   studies that wish to determine the effects of training or nutritional
   interventions on prolonged intermittent physical performance.}},

Abstract = {{The similarity in the genetic regulation of arthropod and vertebrate
   appendage formation has been interpreted as the product of a
   plesiomorphic gene network that was primitively involved in bilaterian
   appendage development and co-opted to build appendages (in modern phyla)
   that are not historically related as structures. Data from
   lophotrochozoans are needed to clarify the pervasiveness of
   plesiomorphic appendage-forming mechanisms. We assayed the expression of
   three arthropod and vertebrate limb gene orthologs, Distal-less (Dll),
   dachshund (dac), and optomotor blind (omb), in direct-developing
   juveniles of the polychaete Neanthes arenaceodentata. Parapodial Dll
   expression marks pre-morphogenetic notopodia and neuropodia, becoming
   restricted to the bases of notopodial cirri and to ventral portions of
   neuropodia. In outgrowing cephalic appendages, Dll activity is primarily
   restricted to proximal domains. Dll expression is also prominent in the
   brain. dac expression occurs in the brain, nerve cord ganglia, a pair of
   pharyngeal ganglia, presumed interneurons linking a pair of segmental
   nerves, and in newly differentiating mesoderm. Domains of omb expression
   include the brain, nerve cord ganglia, one pair of anterior cirri,
   presumed precursors of dorsal musculature, and the same pharyngeal
   ganglia and presumed interneurons that express dac. Contrary to their
   roles in outgrowing arthropod and vertebrate appendages, Dll, dac, and
   omb lack comparable expression in Neanthes appendages, implying
   independent evolution of annelid appendage development. We infer that
   parapodia and arthropodia are not structurally or mechanistically
   homologous (but their primordia might be), that Dll's ancestral
   bilaterian function was in sensory and central nervous system
   differentiation, and that locomotory appendages possibly evolved from
   sensory outgrowths.}},

Abstract = {{The social stigma toward people with epilepsy (PWE) varies greatly
   between cultures. In this study, 167 people (59 PWE, 62 relatives, 46
   villagers) in a rural area of northern Tanzania were interviewed at the
   hospital and in the community regarding their prevailing beliefs about
   epilepsy and attitudes toward PWE. Seventy-eight of those interviewed
   (46.7\%) thought that epilepsy was due to supernatural causes, but 86
   (51.5\%) assumed that epilepsy is caused by brain disorders or is
   inherited. According to the interviewees, epilepsy impacts on the lives
   of affected people. 65.3\% (n=109) thought that PWE should not attend
   school or go to work and 38.3\% (n=64) were of the opinion that PWE had
   decreased chances of getting married. A minority (11.4\%; n=19) thought
   that epilepsy was a reason not to have children. In summary,
   supernatural and more scientific ideas about the causes of epilepsy seem
   to coexist. Nevertheless, there is considerable stigma toward PWE, which
   needs to be interpreted within the sociocultural context of the study.

Abstract = {{Economists have recently recognised services offshoring as an important
   influence on domestic labour market outcomes. Services are of particular
   interest since their significance has grown in terms of both quantity
   and quality. Only one and a half decades ago, most services were
   considered non-tradable, but the emergence and development of new
   information and communication technologies has made many services
   internationally tradable. The liberalisation of international trade in
   services trade has further accelerated the volume of services trade. Our
   econometric estimations focus on services offshoring by German
   manufacturing sectors. We use revised input-output data from 1995 to
   2006. We first estimate the impact of services offshoring on labour
   productivity. We then measure the effects of services offshoring on
   labour demand. The results show that services offshoring increased
   sectoral labour productivity, but reduced German manufacturing
   employment. The overall results suggest that labour demand decreased
   over 1995-2006, because labour-reducing productivity and substitution
   effects dominated labour-augmenting scale effects from services
   offshoring.}},

   to address the question whether Auger-type processes significantly

   bridge the valence and conduction band allowing carrier multiplication a
   process that generates multiple charge carriers from the absorption of a
   single photon This has been suggested in literature for improving the
   efficiency of solar cells Here we show based on microscopic calculations
   within the density matrix formalism that Auger processes do play an
   unusually strong role for the relaxation dynamics of photoexcited charge
   carriers in graphene We predict that a considerable carrier

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nontraumatic haemarthrosis secondary to anticoagulant therapy is a
   recognized clinical problem. The involved joints are usually large
   weight-bearing joints, particularly the knee. We describe a case of
   spontaneous haemarthrosis in a 53-year-old female patient, who had been
   started on anticoagulant drugs after a pulmonary embolism in the past
   (international normalized ratio on admission: 2.4). The patient
   presented with acute onset of severe shoulder pain with no history of
   trauma. Her shoulder showed radiological signs of anterior dislocation.
   Attempts to relocate her shoulder under intravenous sedation with
   midazolam were unsuccessful. The patient subsequently underwent
   aspiration of the shoulder joint and made full recovery after a course
   of physiotherapy. The case is unusual because it occurred in a
   previously healthy shoulder joint and because the bleeding caused the
   shoulder to appear clinically and radiologically anteriorly dislocated.
   No history of trauma was reported before presentation; the apparent
   dislocation was caused solely by spontaneous haemarthrosis. This case
   emphasizes that it is important to consider spontaneous haemarthrosis as
   a possible diagnosis in patients with no history of trauma, particularly
   in those on anticoagulant drugs, who present with what appears to be an
   anterior shoulder dislocation. European Journal of Emergency Medicine

Journal = {{PHYSICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We consider several systems that are confined within a softly repulsive
   sphere. The first one is a model protein, crambin, which is described by
   a structure-based coarse grained model. We demonstrate that the folding
   process is accelerated by the hydrodynamic interactions (HI) in a way
   that depends on the radius of the sphere. The tighter the encompassing
   sphere, the smaller the effect, independent of the nature of the
   starting conformations. The second system is a protein surrounded by
   protein-like softly repulsive spheres that make the confined space
   crowded. In this case, the HI shorten the folding times in a way which
   depends on the degree of crowdedness only weakly. The third system is a
   collection of spheres that are meant to represent molecules. We show
   that confinement increases association times. We also observe that the
   HI either facilitate or obstruct association of two spheres depending on
   the crowding conditions. The dependence of the association time on
   crowdedness in the confining sphere is qualitatively distinct from that
   derived by Wieczorek and Zielenkiewicz for a cube with the periodic
   boundary conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) pursues a symbolic approach to
   reasoning about a spatial domain. Qualitative calculi are defined to
   capture domain properties in relation operations, granting a relation
   algebraic approach to reasoning. QSR has two primary goals: providing a
   symbolic model for human common-sense level of reasoning and providing
   efficient means for reasoning. In this paper, we dismantle the hope for
   efficient reasoning about directional information in infinite spatial
   domains by showing that it is inherently hard to decide consistency of a
   set of constraints that represents positions in the plane by specifying
   directions from reference objects. We assume that these reference
   objects are not fixed but only constrained through directional relations
   themselves. Known QSR reasoning methods fail to handle this information.

Abstract = {{Candida parapsilosis has emerged as one of the most common causes of
   bloodstream infection worldwide. The diagnosis of invasive candidiasis
   etiological agents to the species level remains a laboratory and
   clinical challenge. Thus, specific monoclonal antibodies to detect
   systemic candidiasis and to identify Candida virulence factors and
   associated pathogenesis through immunohistochemistry would be very
   useful. Inbred Balb/c mice were immunized with C. parapsilosis antigens,
   and blood was checked for the presence of reactive antibodies using
   ELISA. Fusion was performed using the harvested spleen cells and NS1
   myeloma cells, and the clones were screened for the presence of antibody
   producing hybrid cells by dot-blot. The 1B11 clone secreted IgG2a
   monoclonal antibody that was reactive with the C. parapsilosis antigen
   at MW of 59 kDa and cross-reacted with C. tropicalis but not with other
   fungal and bacterial antigens tested. Another 3D1 clone secreted IgG1
   monoclonal antibody that was reactive with C. parapsilosis antigen at MW
   of 30 kDa. The 3D1 monoclonal antibody was found to be species specific.
   Experimental systemic candidiasis in rats was induced through
   intravenous injection of C. parapsilosis, and all the vital organs were
   collected for immunohistochemistry study. These monoclonal antibodies
   were reactive against surface epitopes on the yeast cells, pseudohyphae,
   and immune complexes in tissue sections. Sandwich ELISAs using these
   antibodies were developed and were able to detect circulating antigens
   in experimental candiadiasis in rats at 0.2 mu g/mu L. These monoclonal
   antibodies may have potential as primary capture antibodies for the
   development of rapid diagnostic test for human systemic fungal
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{A fluorescent polymer sensor array (FPSA) was made from commercially
   available fluorescent polymers coated onto glass beads and was tested to
   assess the ability of the array to discriminate between different
   analytes in aqueous solution The array was challenged with exposures to
   17 different analytes, including the explosives trinitrotoluene (TNT),
   tetryl, and RDX, various explosive related compounds (ERCs), and
   nonexplosive electron withdrawing compounds (EWCs) The array exhibited a
   natural selectivity toward EWCs, while the non-electron withdrawing
   explosive 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) produced no
   response Response signatures were visualized by principal component
   analysis (PCA), and classified by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) RDX
   produced the same response signature as the sampled blanks and was
   classified accordingly The array exhibited excellent discrimination
   toward all other compounds, with the exception of the isomers of
   nitrotoluene and amino dinitrotoluene Of particular note was the ability
   of the array to discriminate between the three isomers of dinitrobenzene
   The natural selectivity of the FPSA toward EWCs, plus the ability of the
   FPSA to discriminate between different EWCs, could be used to design a
   sensor with a low false alarm rate and an excellent ability to
   discriminate between explosives and explosive related compounds}},

Abstract = {{A 10 kW, CW, 28 GHz gyrotron has been implemented on LDX to increase the
   plasma density and to more fully explore the potential of high beta
   plasma stability in a dipole magnetic configuration. This added power
   represents about a 60\% increase in ECRH to a new total of 26.9 kW with
   sources at 2.45, 6.4, and 10.5 GHz. The 1 Tesla resonances in LDX form
   small rings encompassing the entire plasma cross-section above and below
   the floating coil (F-coil) near the dipole axial region. A 32.5 mm
   diameter TE(01) waveguide with a partial Vlasov step cut launches a
   diverging beam from above the F-coil that depends on internal wall
   reflections for plasma coupling. Initial gyrotron only plasmas exhibit
   steep natural profiles with fewer hot electrons than with the other
   sources. The background scattered radiation suggests that only about
   half the power is being absorbed with the present launcher.}},

   1,500 mg/kg) on the reproduction performance. immunity and expression of
   Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of PRV-challenged mice. The mortality and
   abortion rate of PRV-challenged mice decreased with the increase in
   vitamin E consumption. Overall. PBS-injected mice had a higher live
   embryo number and live litter size than PRV-challenged mice. Both live
   embryo number and live litter size of PRV-challenged mice increased with
   increasing vitamin E levels. Vitamin E supplement resulted in decreased
   concentration of serum IL-2 and IFN-gamma, but increased concentration
   of serum IL-10. The concentration of serum IgG, IgA and IgM increased
   with increasing vitamin E levels. In the uterine and embryo mRNA
   abundance of TLR3, TLR7 and TUR9 was higher in PRV-challenged mice than
   that in PBS-injected mice fed on the same dosage of vitamin E. The mRNA
   abundance of embryonic TLR3, TLR7 and TER9 in PRV-challenged mice
   decreased with increasing vitamin E levels. Collectively, vitamin E
   supplement may improve reproductive performance of PRV-challenged mice

Abstract = {{Background: The Mus81 gene encodes a critical endonuclease involved in
   DNA repair and tumor suppression. In the present study, the role of
   Mus81 in gastric cancer was explored. Materials and Methods: Mus81

   tissues was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The correlations
   between Mus81 down-regulation and the clinicopathological data were also
   evaluated. Results: Mus81 expression was significantly lower in gastric
   cancer tissues than the corresponding normal tissues (p=0.018) and the
   down-regulation of Mus81 occurred in 51\% (27153) of the gastric
   carcinomas. More importantly, Mus81 down-regulation correlated
   significantly to invasion depth (p=0.015) and poorly-differentiated type
   (p=0.016) of gastric cancer. Conclusion: Mus81 might be a potential

Abstract = {{This paper is aiming to study the performances of reinforced
   high-strength concrete (HSC) short columns confined with aramid
   fibre-reinforced polymer (AFRP) sheets. An experimental program, which
   involved 45 confined columns and nine unconfined columns, was carried
   out in this study. All the columns were circular in cross section and
   tested under axial compressive load. The considered parameters included
   the concrete strength, amount of AFRP layers, and ratio of hoop
   reinforcements. Based on the experimental results, a prediction model
   for the axial stress-strain curves of the confined columns was proposed.
   It was observed from the experiment that there was a great increment in
   the compressive strength of the columns when the amount of AFRP layers
   increases, similar as the ultimate strain. However, these increments
   were reduced as the concrete strength increasing. Comparisons with other
   existing prediction models present that the proposed model can provide
   more accurate predictions.}},

Abstract = {{The probability-hypothesis-density (PHD) filter as a multitarget
   recursive Bayes filter has generated substantial interest in the visual
   tracking field due to its ability to handle a time-varying number of
   targets. But the target's trajectory cannot be identified within its own
   framework. To complement the ability of PHD, the auction algorithm is
   combined to calculate the object trajectories automatically. We present
   a motion detection, dynamic, and measurement equation, as well as visual
   multitarget tracking algorithm based on Gaussian mixture probability
   hypothesis density with trajectory computation in detail. Experimental
   results on a large video surveillance dataset show that the proposed
   multitarget tracking framework improves the tracker and recognizes
   tracks when a variable number of targets appear, merge, split, and
   disappear, even in cluttered scenes. (C) 2010 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Seed of Jatropha curcas is a major organ for oil storage, and oil
   production is directly related to its oil content. Establishing a method
   to determine the oil content provides a basis for investigation and
   analysis of it in seed of Jatropha curcas. In this study, the oil
   content in a single seed of Jatropha curcas was determined by NMR, which
   possessed advantages such as fast and simple determination, no injury
   and no contamination etc. The seed could also germinate and grow
   normally after detection by NMR. It was suggested that the content in
   seed of Jatropha curcas could be precisely and stably determined by NMR.
   Moreover, the values determined by NMR were highly correlated to those
   determined by Soxhlet extraction with insignificant difference (r =
   0.99). Therefore, it is feasible to determine the oil content in seed of
   Jatropha curcas by NMR, which can be widely applied in scientific
   research and detection of industrial materials.}},

Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2578-2597}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Drawing upon a sample of 772 migrant children and their parents in
   Shanghai, China, this study employed an ecological framework to
   investigate how social capital embedded in a range of social contexts
   (family, school, peer and community) influenced the academic achievement
   of Chinese migrant children. Using structural equation modelling (SEM),
   the study results suggested that higher levels of family and school
   social capital were associated with better academic achievement of
   migrant children. Community social capital did not present a significant
   direct effect; however, it predicted children's academic performance
   indirectly through the mediating effects of family and school social
   capital. Unexpectedly, peer social capital appeared not to be associated
   with children's academic achievements. This research advances social
   capital theory by unravelling the mechanism through which multiple
   dimensions of social capital operate on youth development. The findings
   imply utilising social capital building as an innovative approach in
   social work practice and policy to improving the education of migrant
   children.}},

Abstract = {{Measures were taken to protect the thermal regime of the roadbed
   embankment after construction and to lower permafrost temperatures in
   the rich-ice and warm permafrost regions along the Qinghai-Xizang
   Railway. However, these measures were taken only for some sections of
   the railway, leaving many sections unprotected. This article addresses
   those areas where no measures were taken and presents analysis of the
   variation of soil temperatures under the embankment in seasonal frozen
   soil areas, degrading permafrost areas, and warm and cold permafrost
   areas. The results show that soil temperatures, maximum seasonal
   freezing depth, and the permafrost table under the embankment differ
   according to the different frozen soil areas after embankment
   construction. In seasonal frozen soil areas and degraded permafrost
   areas, the seasonal frost layer remained frozen the next year under the
   shaded shoulder of the embankment. In degrading permafrost areas, a thaw
   layer between the permafrost table and the bottom of the seasonal frost
   formed under the embankment. In warm permafrost areas, the permafrost
   table under the embankment was unstable and soil temperatures near the
   permafrost table showed an obvious increasing trend. In cold permafrost
   areas, the permafrost table under the embankment was clearly raised and
   temperature lowered in the soil near the permafrost table, which is
   advantageous to permafrost thermal stability under the embankment. In
   particular, the difference in solar radiation from the slope exposed to
   the sun to the shady slope of the embankment is responsible for the
   difference in the soil thermal regime and the permafrost table, which
   potentially can affect roadbed stability.}},

Abstract = {{In an intensely competitive market, one way by which manufacturers
   attract consumers to their products is by providing warranties on the
   products. Consumers are willing to purchase a high-priced product only
   if they can be assured about the product's reliability. A longer
   warranty period usually indicates better reliability. However, offering
   an unlimited warranty is unrealistic because maintaining such a policy
   needs very high cost. In this article, we investigate a decision problem
   under the warranty which is a combination of free-replacement, and
   pro-rata policies. We use a Bayesian approach to determine the optimal
   warranty lengths. The Rayleigh distribution is employed to describe the
   product lifetime. An example with real data is presented for
   illustration.}},

   present study, 11 healthy volunteers performed a different target
   force-tracking task, which involved the index finger alone, index and
   middle finger together, and the combination of four fingers (i.e.,
   index, middle, ring, and little). The target force trace corresponded to
   3 levels of 20\% maximal voluntary changes (MVC), 30\% MVC, and 40\% MVC
   in 20 seconds. In the test, an unexpected single 120\% motor threshold
   transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the primary motor
   cortex (M1) during force tracking. Results revealed that peak force
   changes increased with increasing background force and the number of
   involved task fingers. These results demonstrate that M1 neural
   activities correlate with finger-force production, and M1 plays a role
   in finger-force control. Moreover, different neuronal networks were
   required for different finger patterns; a complicated task required
   multi-finger combinations and a complicated neuronal network comprised a

   BAA reached 40\% and 60\% of the added amount, respectively, after 40
   days of incubation. A total of six metabolites were isolated and
   characterized by solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which indicate that F. solani
   degraded both ANT and BAA via their respective quinone molecules to
   generate phthalic acid. Free extracellular laccase was detected during
   the degradation process without detectable lignin peroxidase (LiP) and
   manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP), suggesting that laccase might play
   an important role in the transformation of PAHs compounds. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Polymers based on dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (TBT) have received
   strong attention as the donor materials of polymer photovoltaic cells
   (PVs), since they can have a low band gap. But soluble small organic
   molecules based on TBT have been rarely studied. This paper reports the
   synthesis of two small organic molecules based on TBT and their
   application as the donor materials of solution-processed bulk
   heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). These compounds were
   soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene
   and tetrahydrofuran. They have band gaps comparable to
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and lower HOMO and LUMO (HOMO: highest
   occupied molecular orbital. LUMO: lowest unoccupied molecular orbital)
   levels than P3HT. These molecules and {[}6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid
   methyl ester (PCBM) were used as the donors and acceptor to fabricate
   bulk heterojunction OPVs through solution processing. After optimization
   of the experimental conditions, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of
   0.66\% was achieved on the solution-processed OPVs under AM 1.5G, 100 mW
   cm(-2) illumination. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the mid-1990s, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and common loons
   (Gavia immer) tram Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site
   (KNPNHS), Nova Scotia, Canada, had among the highest mercury (Hg)
   concentrations across North America. In 2006 and 2007, we re-examined 16
   lakes to determine whether there have been changes in Hg in the loon's
   preferred prey, yellow perch. Total Hg concentrations were measured in
   up to nine perch in each of three size classes (5-10 cm, 10-15 cm, and
   15-20 cm) consumed by loons. Between 1996/97 and 2006/07, polynomial
   regressions indicated that Hg in yellow perch increased an average of
   29\% in ten lakes, decreased an average of 21\% in three, and were
   unchanged in the remaining three lakes. In 2006/07, perch in 75\% of the
   study lakes had Hg concentrations (standardized to 12-cm fish length)
   equal to or above the concentration (0.21 mu g.g(-1) ww) associated with
   a 50\% reduction in maximum productivity of loons, compared with only
   56\% of these lakes in 1996/97. Mercury contamination currently poses a
   greater threat to loon health than a decade ago, and further reductions
   in anthropogenic emissions should be considered to reduce its impacts on
   ecosystem health.}},

   The relationships among the field vectors of the incident, reflected and

   derived based on the electromagnetic theory and the principle of special
   relativity. The numerical analysis shows that at a small mechanical
   velocity the reflection coefficient of the electromagnetic slow-wave can
   be close to unit by choosing an appropriate period and mode-order; this
   is obviously different from that of a fast wave. The results are
   significant for research on electromagnetics and electrodynamics, and

Abstract = {{Based on the new progenitor stars model, the influence of ion screening

   screening decreases slightly the fraction of leptons and prolongs
   slightly the shock propagation time. Moreover, simulation results are
   shown that ion screening increases the total energy loss and reduces the
   shock energy, eventually decreasing of explosion energy and becomes a
   negative factor to supernova explosion. In addition, comparison of
   slight perturbated variation of ion screening to leptons, but simulation
   results show that ion screening affects obviously explosion energy of
   type-II supernova, hence, it can also confirm that the variation of
   leptons is very sensitive to energy in supernova explosion.}},

Abstract = {{Saturation transfer difference (STD)-NMR has been widely used to screen
   ligand compound libraries for their binding activities to proteins and
   to determine the binding epitopes of the ligands. We report herein, a
   Clean STD-NMR method developed to overcome false positives (artifacts)
   observed in the STD-NMR spectrum due to the power spillover of RF
   irradiation. The method achieved higher degree of resonance saturation
   through digital editing of two STD-NMR spectra to generate a
   concatenated difference spectrum and three times of sensitivity
   enhancement for a loose binding complex involving DNA oligonucleotide
   and an RNA-binding protein, CUGBP-1ab (25.2 kDa). The interesting
   binding characteristics of the complex dCTGTCT-CUGBP1ab were obtained.
   The method was applied to a mixture of small ligand and bovine serum
   albumin protein (BSA, 66.3 kDa), and detected the intermolecular
   contacts at a BSA concentration as low as 0.1 mu M, a working
   concentration useful for the detection of proteins of low solubility at

Abstract = {{The linear theory and the post process program LIP are developed to
   describe the stimulated scattering in laser-plasma-interaction. The two
   damping rates, especially the collision damping rate, are included in
   the program LIP. The effects of the laser intensity and electron
   temperature are investigated in an ignition scale plasma. The importance
   of the collision damping is revealed, and it is found that the growth
   rate of the stimulated scattering is effectively reduced by the
   collision damping when the plasma density is close to one-quarter of
   critical density. Whereas, the electron temperature is responsible for
   the increase of the growth rate on the specific density scale. The
   results may provide the reference for the ignition design in reducing
   the reflectivity.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of Fe and C doping on the thermal release of helium from Al
   implanted with 10 keV, 4.0 x 10(21) ion/m(2) He at room temperature (RT)
   has been investigated by thermal helium desorption spectrometry (THDS)
   and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The results show that Fe and
   C doping have significant impact on the release of helium from Al and
   the extent depends on the doping fluence. Proper fluence of Fe and C
   doping would lead to the retardation of the release of helium from Al,
   while excessive fluence of Fe and C doping would result in more
   desorption peaks and the release of helium in lower temperature ranges.
   Fe and C doping have different influence on the release of helium from
   Al, and the difference is related with the secondary phases forming in
   the samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wave-induced soil liquefaction can cause serious damages to coastlines
   and coastal infrastructures. Although liquefaction caused by regular
   waves over flat sea beds has been extensively investigated, studies of
   tsunami-induced liquefaction of coastal sandy slopes have been
   relatively rare. In this work, parametric studies are conducted to
   investigate the liquefaction potential of coastal sandy slopes caused by
   breaking solitary waves. The dependence of the maximum liquefaction
   depth on soil permeability is studied at different cross-shore locations
   and for different offshore wave heights. The results suggest that
   tsunami can induce liquefaction failure of coastal sand slopes, and that
   the soil responses can be characterized by the ratio of the pore
   pressure diffusion time scale to the wave loading time scale. Under the
   same wave loading condition, an offshore soil column may experience the
   largest liquefaction depth, while the longest duration of liquefaction
   (which may physically correlate to the largest liquefaction volume)
   occurs in the seepage zone, because of the wave loading and unloading
   pattern above the seepage zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We propose a new scheme for cooperative wireless networking based on
   linear network codes. The network consists of multiple (M >= 2) users
   having independent information to be transmitted to a common basestation
   ( BS), assuming block-fading channels with independent fading for
   different codewords. The users collaborate in relaying messages. Because
   of potential transmission errors in links, resulting in erasures, the
   network topology is dynamic. To efficiently exploit the diversity
   available by cooperation and time-varying fading, we propose the use of
   diversity network codes (DNCs) over finite fields. These codes are
   designed such that the BS is able to rebuild the user information from a
   minimum possible set of coded blocks conveyed through the dynamic
   network. We show the existence of deterministic DNCs. We also show that
   the resulting diversity order using the proposed DNCs is 2M - 1, which
   is higher than schemes without network coding or with binary network
   coding. Numerical results from simulations also show substantial
   improvement by the proposed DNCs over the benchmark schemes. We also
   propose simplified versions of the DNCs, which have much lower design
   complexity and still achieve the diversity order 2M - 1.}},

Abstract = {{CD10 is a neutral endopeptidase, which cleaves various peptide
   substrates including substance P. CD10 expression has been detected in
   peritumoral fibroblasts (Fb) within the invasive area of various cancers
   such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, the biological
   significance of CD10-bearing Fb remains largely unknown. We examined
   dynamic interactions of Fb with tumorigenic A431 SCC cells or
   non-tumorigenic HaCaT squamous cells. The SCC and HaCaT cells did not
   synthesize CD10, while Fb constitutively expressed CD10. When
   co-cultured, SCC markedly upregulated fibroblastic CD10 expression
   compared with HaCaT, which was mainly attributable to SCC-derived
   interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). Both SCC and Fb autonomously secreted
   substance P, which eventually enhanced the invasive capacity of SCC in a
   matrigel invasion assay by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1
   and MMP-2, but not MMP-9. Transfection of siRNA for CD10 successfully
   knocked down the CD10 expression in Fb (CD10ND-Fb). In the presence of
   CD10ND-Fb, substance P levels in supernatants as well as MMP production
   and the invasive potency of SCC were significantly augmented compared
   with control scramble RNA-transfected Fb. We also transfected CD10
   vector to Fb and found that the matrigel invasive ability of SCC cells
   was downregulated co-cultured with CD10 vector-transfected Fb rather
   than empty vector-transfected Fb. In conclusion, the CD10-bearing Fb
   generated by SCC-derived IL-1 inhibited the invasive capacity of SCC by
   diminishing the microenvironmental concentration of substance P. (Cancer

Abstract = {{To explore the clinical classification of hamate hook fracture and the
   treatment strategy for different type of fractures, 12 patients who
   suffered from hamate hook fractures were followed up retrospectively.
   According to the fracture sites and the prognosis, we classified the
   hamate hook fractures into 3 types. Type I referred to an avulsion
   fracture at the tip of hamate hook, type II was a fracture in the middle
   part of hamate hook, and type III represented a fracture at the base of
   hamate hook. By the classification, in our series, only 1 fell into type
   I, 7 type II, and 4 type III. The results were evaluated with respect to
   the functional recovery, recovery time and the association among the
   clinical classification, pre-operative complications and treatment
   results. The average follow-up time of this group was 8.4 +/- 3.9
   months. Two cases were found to have fracture non-union and both of them
   were type. fractures. Six patients had complications before operation.
   Five cases were type II fractures and 1 case type III fracture. All the
   patients were satisfied with the results at the time of the last
   follow-up. Their pain scale and grip strength improved significantly
   after treatment. All the pre-operative complications were relieved. The
   recovery time of hamate hook excision was significantly shorter than
   that of the other two treatments. The incidences of both pre-operative
   complications and non-union in type II fractures were higher than those
   in type I and type III fractures. It was concluded that, generally, the
   treatment effects with hamate hook fracture are quite good. The
   complication incidence and prognosis of the fracture are closely related
   to the clinical classification. Early intervention is critical for type
   II fractures.}},

Abstract = {{The reforming of anisole (as model compound of bio-oil) was performed
   over the NiCuZn-Al2O3 catalyst, using a recently-developed
   electrochemical catalytic reforming (ECR). The influence of the current
   on the anisole reforming in the ECR process has been investigated. It
   was observed that anisole reforming was significantly enhanced by the
   current approached over the catalyst in the electrochemical catalytic
   process, which was due to the non-uniform temperature distribution in
   the catalytic bed and the role of the thermal electrons originating from
   the electrified wire. The maximum hydrogen yield of 88.7\% with a carbon
   conversion of 98.3\% was obtained through the ECR reforming of anisole
   at 700 degrees C and 4 A. X-ray diffraction was employed to characterize
   catalyst features and their alterations in the anisole reforming. The
   apparent activation energy for the anisole reforming is calculated as
   99.54 kJ/mol, which is higher than ethanol, acetic acid, and light
   fraction of bio-oil. It should owe to different physical and chemical
   properties and reforming mechanism for different hydrocarbons.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared physiological and growth responses to water stress
   of two legume species during the seedling stage. Potted alfalfa
   (Medicago sativa L. cv. Algonquin) and milkvetch (Astragalus adsurgens
   Pall. cv. Pengyang earlymaturing vetch) seedlings were grown under
   well-watered {[}soil water content (SWC) maintained at 14.92\% daily] or
   water-stressed conditions (drying) for 15 days. Net photosynthetic rate
   (P (N)), transpiration rate (E) and stomatal conductance (g (s)) of both
   species decreased parabolically. When SWC decreased to 7.2\% and 10.3\%,
   g (s) values for alfalfa and milkvetch were significantly different from
   those of the respective well-watered plants (p < 0.05). When SWC
   decreased to 6.6\% for alfalfa and 6.8\% for milkvetch, leaf water
   potentials (psi(L)) were significantly different from those of the
   well-watered plants (p < 0.05). Thus the difference between the SWC
   thresholds for a nonhydraulic root signal (nHRS) and a hydraulic root
   signal (HRS) were 0.6\% and 3.5\% for alfalfa and milkvetch,
   respectively. Milkvetch had a lower g (s) than alfalfa for a given SWC
   (p < 0.05). Although alfalfa seedlings had a higher dry mass (DM) and
   root:shoot ratio (R/S) than milkvetch in both treatments (p < 0.05), we
   concluded that milkvetch seedlings had greater drought tolerance than
   alfalfa.}},

Abstract = {{Nyquist ghost artifacts are a serious issue in echo planar imaging.
   These artifacts primarily originate from phase difference between even
   and odd echo images and can be removed or reduced using phase correction
   methods. The commonly used 1D phase correction can only correct phase
   difference along readout axis. 2D correction is, therefore, necessary
   when phase difference presents along both readout and phase encoding
   axes. However, existing 2D methods have several unaddressed issues that
   affect their practicality. These issues include uncharacterized noise
   behavior, image artifact due to unoptimized phase estimation, Gibbs
   ringing artifact when directly applying to partial k(y) data, and most
   seriously a new image artifact under tight field-of-view (i.e.,
   field-of-view slightly smaller than object size). All these issues are
   addressed in this article. Specifically, theoretical analysis of noise
   amplification and effect of phase estimation error is provided, and
   tradeoff between noise and ghost is studied. A new 2D phase correction
   method with improved polynomial fitting, joint homodyne processing and
   phase correction, compatibility with tight field-of-view is then
   proposed. Various results show that the proposed method can robustly
   generate images free of Nyquist ghosts and other image artifacts even in
   oblique scans or when cross-term eddy current terms are significant.

Abstract = {{This study was designed to characterize the viability and potential
   virulence of bofilm-forming Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
   under different pH levels, ranging from 5 to 7. The plate count method
   and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were used to evaluate
   the survival of S. Typhimurium grown in Trypticase soy broth (TSB)
   adjusted to pH 5, 6, and 7 (TSB-5, TSB-6, and TSB-7, respectively) at 37
   degrees C for 10 days. In TSB-5 and TSB-6, the numbers of viable cells
   estimated by using the real-time RT-PCR were greater than the culturable
   counts enumerated by the plate count method. Reflectance micro-Fourier
   transform infrared (micro-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to evaluate the
   biochemical changes in biofilm cells. Considerable changes in chemical
   components were observed in the biofilm cells grown in TSB-5 and TSB-6
   when compared to the cells grown in TSB-7. The enterotoxin production
   and invasive ability of planktonic and biofilm S. Typhimurium cells were
   inferred by the relative levels of expression of stn and invA. The
   levels of expression of stn and invA were significantly increased in
   biofilm S. Typhimurium cells grown in TSB-5 (1.9-fold and 3.2-fold) and
   TSB-6 (2.1-fold and 22.3-fold) after 10 days of incubation. These
   results suggest that the biofilm-forming S. Typhimurium under different
   pH levels might change the virulence production and stress response
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{We applied the Numerical Maxwell Model of three-dimensional simulations
   (NMM3D) in the Dense Media Radiative Theory (DMRT) to calculate
   backscattering coefficients. The particles' positions are
   computer-generated and the subsequent Foldy-Lax equations solved
   numerically. The phase matrix in NMM3D has significant
   cross-polarization, particularly when the particles are densely packed.
   The NMM3D model is combined with DMRT in calculating the microwave
   scattering by dry snow. The NMM3D/DMRT equations are solved by an
   iterative solution up to the second order in the case of small to
   moderate optical thickness. The numerical results of NMM3D/DMRT are
   illustrated and compared with QCA/DMRT. The QCA/DMRT and NMM3D/DMRT
   results are also applied to compare with data from two specific datasets
   from the second Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX II) in Alaska and
   Colorado. The data are obtained at the Ku-band (13.95 GHz) observations
   using airborne imaging polarimetric scatterometer (POLSCAT). It is shown
   that the model predictions agree with the field measurements for both
   co-polarization and cross-polarization. For the Alaska region, the
   average snow depth and snow density are used as the inputs for DMRT. The
   grain size, selected from within the range of the ground measurements,
   is used as a best-fit parameter within the range. For the Colorado
   region, we use the Variable Infiltration Capacity Model (VIC) to obtain
   the input snow profiles for NMM3D/DMRT.}},

Abstract = {{Locality preserving projection (LPP) is a manifold learning method
   widely used in pattern recognition and computer vision. The face
   recognition application of LPP is known to suffer from a number of
   problems including the small sample size (SSS) problem, the fact that it
   might produce statistically identical transform results for neighboring
   samples, and that its classification performance seems to be heavily
   influenced by its parameters. In this paper, we propose three novel
   solution schemes for LPP. Experimental results also show that the
   proposed LPP solution scheme is able to classify much more accurately
   than conventional LPP and to obtain a classification performance that is
   only little influenced by the definition of neighbor samples. (C) 2010

Title = {{Three-dimensional echocardiographic virtual endoscopy for the diagnosis

Abstract = {{Virtual endoscopy (VE) is a new post-processing method that uses
   volumetric data sets to simulate the tracks of a ``conventional{''}
   flexible endoscope. However, almost all studies of this method have
   involved virtual visualizations of the cardiovascular structures applied
   to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) datasets. This
   paper introduces a novel visualization method called the
   ``three-dimensional echocardiographic intracardiac endoscopic simulation
   system (3DE IESS){''}, which uses 3D echocardiographic images in a
   virtual reality (VR) environment to diagnose congenital heart disease.
   The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of VE in the
   evaluation of congenital heart disease in children and its accuracy
   compared with 2DE. Three experienced pediatric cardiologists blinded to
   the patients' diagnoses separately reviewed 40 two-dimensional
   echocardiographic (2DE) datasets and 40 corresponding VE datasets and
   judged whether abnormal intracardiac anatomy was present in terms of a
   five-point scale (1 = definitely absent; 2 = probably absent; 3 = cannot
   be determined; 4 = probably present; and 5 = definitely present).
   Compared with clinical diagnosis, the diagnostic accuracy of VE was
   98.7\% for ASD, 92.4\% for VSD, 92.6\% for TOF, and 94\% for DORV,
   respectively. Diagnostic accuracy of VE was significantly higher than
   that of 2DE for TOF and DORV except for ASD and VSD. The receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve for VE was closer to the optimal
   performance point than was the ROC curve for 2DE. The area under the ROC
   curve was 0.96 for VE and 0.93 for 2DE. Kappa values (range, 0.73-0.79)
   for VE and 2DE indicated substantial agreement. 3D echocardiographic VE
   can enhance our understanding of intracardiac structures and facilitate
   the evaluation of congenital heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Free flaps are presently the best way to treat advanced
   mandibular ostonecrosis. Nevertheless, the functional and morphological
   results can be improved. To avoid a mandibular resection, a free
   periosteal flap was envisioned. In a preliminary study, the authors
   opted for a pedicled periosteal flap and evaluated the effect of the
   latter on regeneration of a rabbit irradiated mandibular bone.
   Methods: Two bone fragments were taken from the basilar part of the
   mandible of 15 rabbits through skin incision. Those fragments were then
   exposed to a 30-Gy irradiation. One bone fragment was implanted in a
   pedicled periosteal flap elevated from the medial aspect of the femur
   while the other was subcutaneously fixed as a control. We retrieved the
   fragments at day 10, 20, 30 and 90 to make a histological analysis
   without prior decalcification using histomorphometry technique.
   Results: In the periosted fragments, an increased osteoblastic and
   osteoclastic activity as well as neovascularisation evoked intense
   remodelling. In the subcutaneous fragments, bone resorption was much
   more important than osteogenesis and vessels were absent.
   Conclusion: We have concluded than periosteum, which has already been
   proven to be efficient in normal bone regeneration, can be just as such
   efficient in irradiated bone regeneration. (C) 2010 British Association

Abstract = {{Image processing is generally based on grayscale information, such as
   statistical gray histograms, gradients, textures, etc. However, concrete
   techniques that use this co-occurrence processing have been chiefly
   limited to texture identification. Since the gray histogram is the most
   influential for extracting the global image properties, it has always
   been desirable to improve or extend it. From this viewpoint, Kashiwagi's
   proposal of a new frequency extraction paradigm called the frequency
   image (FI) is noteworthy. Along with other histograms, the co-occurrence
   histogram or co-occurrence matrix is also an influential basic image
   feature, especially for texture feature analysis. In this paper we
   introduce a new texture feature image paradigm called the
   ``co-occurrence frequency image{''} (CFI), which is a complete extension
   of the FI. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Electron Comm Jpn, 93(12):

Abstract = {{Overdamped NbTiN Josephson junctions with Ti-TiN bilayered normal-metal

   consisting of 32 768 NbTiN/Ti-TiN/NbTiN junctions were fabricated for

   height of about 0.5 mA was generated at around 8 K. The Ti layer was
   added to protect the base NbTiN electrode from nitrogen plasma during
   the deposition of the TiN layer. While the critical current I(c) and the
   junction resistance R(n) are mainly dominated by the thickness of the
   TiN barrier, I(c) can be also adjusted by changing the thickness of the
   Ti barrier to maximize the operating margin for voltage standard
   circuits. An optimization of the NbTiN film in terms of film stress is
   also described for fabrication of circuits containing such a large

Abstract = {{Prediction of the timing of platelet recovery after chemotherapy and
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) allows for optimal
   platelet transfusion. We assessed the clinical utility of the percentage
   value of the immature platelet fraction (IPF\%) monitored using an
   XE-2100 automated hematology analyzer to predict the timing of platelet
   recovery after chemotherapy and HSCT. The IPF\% was serially monitored
   in 31 patients with cancer who received 66 courses of chemotherapy and
   HSCT. In patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy and HSCT, a
   transient increase in IPF\% was observed 1-11 days prior to platelet
   recovery (>30 x 10(9)/l). In patients undergoing chemotherapy with a
   peak IPF\% >10\%, platelet recovery occurred significantly earlier than
   in those with IPF\% peak values <= 10\% (median periods were 2 and 5
   days; P < 0.05). Platelet recovery appears to occur earlier in patients
   undergoing HSCT with a peak IPF\% > 10\% than in those with IPF\% peak
   values <= 10\% (median periods were 2 and 6 days). Thus, the IPF\% peak
   value is a useful parameter for predicting the timing of platelet
   recovery after chemotherapy and HSCT and has the potential to facilitate
   optimal platelet transfusion.}},

   STRUCTURE AND EMISSIONS FROM STAR-FORMING GALAXIES AT HIGH REDSHIFT}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{High spatial resolution observations show that high-redshift galaxies
   are undergoing intensive evolution of dynamical structure and
   morphologies displayed by the H alpha, H beta, {[}O III], and {[}N II]
   images. It has been shown that supernova explosion (SNexp) of young
   massive stars during the star formation epoch, as kinetic feedback to
   host galaxies, can efficiently excite the turbulent viscosity. We
   incorporate the feedback into the dynamical equations through mass
   dropout and angular momentum transportation driven by the SNexp-excited
   turbulent viscosity. The empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt law is used for
   star formation rates (SFRs). We numerically solve the equations and show
   that there can be intensive evolution of structure of the gaseous disk.
   Secular evolution of the disk shows interesting characteristics: (1)
   high viscosity excited by SNexp can efficiently transport the gas from
   10 kpc to similar to 1 kpc forming a stellar disk whereas a stellar ring
   forms for the case with low viscosity; (2) starbursts trigger SMBH
   activity with a lag of similar to 10(8) yr depending on SFRs, prompting
   the joint evolution of SMBHs and bulges; and (3) the velocity dispersion
   is as high as similar to 100 km s(-1) in the gaseous disk. These results
   are likely to vary with the initial mass function (IMF) that the SNexp
   rates rely on. Given the IMF, we use the GALAXEV code to compute the
   spectral evolution of stellar populations based on the dynamical
   structure. In order to compare the present models with the observed
   dynamical structure and images, we use the incident continuum from the
   simple stellar synthesis and CLOUDY to calculate emission line ratios of
   H alpha, H beta, {[}O III], and {[}N II], and H alpha brightness of gas
   photoionized by young massive stars formed on the disks. The models can
   produce the main features of emission from star-forming galaxies. We
   apply the present model to two galaxies, BX 389 and BX 482 observed in
   the SINS high-z sample, which are bulge and disk-dominated,
   respectively. Two successive rings independently evolving are able to
   reproduce the main dynamical and emission properties of the two
   galaxies, such as the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram, the relation
   between line ratios, and H alpha brightness. The observed relation
   between turbulent velocity and the H alpha brightness can be explained
   by the present model. High viscosity excited by SNexp is able to
   efficiently transport the gas into a bulge to maintain high SFRs or to
   form a stellar ring close enough to the bulge so that it immigrates into
   the bulge of its host galaxy. This leads to a fast growing bulge.
   Implications and future work of the present models have been extensively
   discussed for galaxy formation in high-z universe.}},

   characterized, and their properties in vitro and in vivo were evaluated.
   These anticancer drug-loaded poly(carbonate-ester) nanospheres had
   steady drug release rates and good controlled release properties.
   Moreover, anticancer drug-loaded poly(carbonate-ester) nanospheres II
   had faster drug release rates than those of anticancer drug-loaded

Abstract = {{Current evidence shows that the CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40-CD40L) system
   plays a crucial role in the development, progression and outcome of
   acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this study is to investigate
   whether a CD40 gene (-1C/T) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is
   associated with ACS and CD40 expression. We included controls (n = 163)
   and patients with either ACS (n = 210) or stable angina (SA, n = 189) in
   the study. The gene polymorphism was measured using polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and
   identified by sequencing. CD40 expression on platelets was detected by
   flow cytometry. The results showed that the frequency of the CC genotype
   of CD40 gene in the ACS group was significantly higher than in the SA
   and control groups (P < 0.001), while the TT genotype frequency in the
   ACS group was significantly lower than that of the SA and control groups
   (P < 0.001). The C-allele frequency of the ACS group was higher than
   that of the SA and control groups (P < 0.001). The C allele increased
   the risk of ACS when compared with the SA group (OR = 1.841, 95\% CI:
   1.390-2.437) and the control groups (OR = 1.877, 95\% CI: 1.402-2.515).
   No significant differences in genotypes or allele frequencies were found
   between the SA and control groups. CD40 expression on platelets in
   patients with C-allele carriers was significant higher than in the
   T-allele carriers in each group. In conclusion, our results suggested
   that the CD40 gene (-1C/T) polymorphism was associated with ACS in
   Chinese people. The -1C-allele gene carriers had a higher expression of
   CD40 and an increased risk of suffering from ACS.}},

Abstract = {{A SiC/Si-Mo multilayer oxidation protective coating for carbon/carbon
   silicon carbide composites was prepared by chemical vapor deposition
   combined with slurry painting, and its thermal shock resistance between
   1673 and 373K was investigated through cooling the coated samples in
   boiling water. During the whole test, the coated samples lost weight
   slowly and steadily and the multilayer coating remained intact, with no
   spallation or peeling. The weight loss of the coated samples was only
   1.97\% after 50 cycles, and flexural strength test demonstrated that the
   residual strength retention rates were 95.73\% and 81.61\% after 25 and
   50 cycles, respectively. So an excellent thermal shock resistance had
   been observed for the SiC/Si-Mo multilayer coating and certain pores in
   the Si-Mo layers were proposed responsible for it.}},

Abstract = {{As many enterprises deal with orders of various products everyday and
   attend to maximize total profit or minimize total cost, a quick
   automatic dispatching tool is required for higher efficiency. In
   practical, the dispatching is not an easy task even for experienced
   experts; it is often determined depending on empirical knowledge, but
   usually would not be the optimal solution. It is due to the complex
   nature of the so-called ``multi-plant order allocation problem{''},
   which can be modeled as a typical mixed-integer programming problem.
   Considering companies with multiple plants, the large quantity of orders
   need to be distributed within a short time and the due dates of various
   orders shall be met such that the total costs can be minimized. In this
   research, an order allocation scheme for multi-plant to produce a
   variety of products is developed. The objective is to minimize total
   cost, including operation cost, setup cost, transportation cost, and the
   penalty cost of order delay under the constraint of capacity load. A
   mixed-integer programming model, named model of quasi-transportation
   problem, is proposed and solved. Several examples are presented and
   solved and compared by a general software LINDO and a genetic algorithm.
   Proposed genetic algorithm is demonstrated to be more efficient as the
   dimension of problem increases.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on high-rate nitrogen removal by the anaerobic
   ammonium oxidation (Anammox) process with a sufficient inorganic carbon
   (IC) source. Experiments were carried out in an up-flow column Anammox
   reactor fed with synthetic inorganic wastewater for 110 days. The IC
   source was added into the influent tank in the form of bicarbonate. The
   results confirmed the positive impact of inorganic matter on stimulating
   Anammox activity. After the addition of sufficient IC, the nitrogen
   removal rate sharply increased from 5.2 to 11.8 kg-N m(-3) day(-1)
   within only 32 days. NO(2)-N inhibition was not observed even at NO(2)-N
   concentrations greater than 460 mg N/L, indicating the enriched Anammox
   consortium adapted to high NO(2)-N concentrations. The ratio of NO(2)-N
   removal, NO(3)-N production and NH(4)-N removal for the reactor was
   correspondingly changed from 1.21:0.21:1 to 1.24:0.18:1. Simultaneously,
   the sludge volume index of the Anammox granules decreased markedly from
   36.8 to 21.5 mL/g, which was attributed to the implementation of proper
   operational strategy. In addition, DNA analysis revealed that a shift
   from the KSU-1 strain to the KU2 strain occurred in the Anammox
   community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Well-crystallized with excellent luminescent properties, Tb(BO2)(3)
   nanorods were first successfully synthesized by a simple solid-state
   method with Ag as catalyst. The result of Xray diffraction showed that
   the Tb(BO2)(3) nanorods could be well-crystallized at 700 degrees C.
   As-prepared straight nanorods of Tb(BO2)(3) had the typical diameters in
   the range of 100-200 nm, the thickness of 30-50 rim, and the length up
   to 3 mu m by transmission electron microscopy, and the corresponding
   selected area electron diffraction indicated that the nanorod calcined
   at 700 degrees C was single-crystalline. Based on the fact that Ag
   nanoparticles attached to the tips and middles of the Tb(BO2)(3)
   nanorods, a growth model of the Tb(BO2)(3) nanorods was proposed.
   Photoluminescence spectra under excitation at 369 urn showed that these
   Tb(BO2)(3) phosphors had a green emission at 546 nm, which is ascribed
   to D-5(4) -> F-7(5) transition. The effect of calcining temperature on
   the structures, morphologies, and luminescent properties of Tb(BO2)(3)
   phosphors were studied.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a strong-coupling approach is applied to simulate highly
   flexible flapping wings interacting with fluid flows Here, the fluid
   motion, solid motion, and their interaction are solved together by a
   single set of equations of motion on a fixed Eulerian mesh, with the
   elastic stress being solved on a Lagrangian mesh and projected back to
   the Eulerian mesh To provide necessary flapping mechanism, control cells
   are implemented in solid area (1 e, the wing) as ``skeleton ``The moving
   trajectory of the skeleton is therefore prescribed by a conventional
   direct forcing type of immersed boundary method, while the rest of the
   wing moves passively through elasticity and fluid structure interaction
   This combined algorithm is then used to study the propulsion
   characteristics of flexible flapping wings with different elastic moduli
   and at different flapping frequencies and amplitudes A two-dimensional
   NACA0012 airfoil is chosen as a model wing, and it is under active
   plunging defined by control cells and corresponding passive pitching
   motion With different input parameters, very different wake structures
   can be observed As a result, the coupled plunging-pitching motion can be
   either drag producing or thrust-producing Finally, passive pitching
   angle 0 and nominal angle of attack a for flexible wings are defined to
   characterize the flapping motion It is found that 0 needs to be greater

Abstract = {{A well-preserved permineralized osmundaceous fern was discovered from
   the Middle Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation of Beipiao, Liaoning Province,
   China. The rhizome is about 50 cm high and 35-41 cm in diameter and can
   be attributed to the genus Ashicaulis on the basis of its anatomy. The
   sterile pinnae are referable to Cladophlebis, the fertile pinnules are
   of the Todites type with in situ spores of the Osmundacidites type.
   Osmundaceous rhizomes have been found all over the world including the
   Jurassic strata of western Liaoning, China. Until now, however, no
   rhizomes have been reported to be organically connected with leafy
   organs. Although impressions and compressions of isolated osmundaceous
   sterile and fertile fronds are common, they were described under
   separate organ- or morpho-generic names, such as Todites and
   Cladophlebis. The new discovery provides an opportunity to study an

Abstract = {{The electromechanical (EM) impedance technique using piezoelectric lead
   zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers for structural health monitoring
   (SHM) has attracted considerable attention in various engineering
   fields. In the conventional EM impedance technique, the EM admittance of
   a PZT transducer is used as a damage indicator. Statistical analysis
   methods such as root mean square deviation (RMSD) have been employed to
   associate the damage level with the changes in the EM admittance
   signatures, but it is difficult to determine the location of damage
   using such methods. This paper proposes a new approach by dividing the
   large frequency (30-400 kHz) range into sub-frequency intervals and
   calculating their respective RMSD values. The RMSD of the sub-frequency
   intervals (RMSD-S) will be used to study the severity and location of
   damage. An experiment is carried out on a real size concrete structure
   subjected to artificial damage. It is observed that damage close to the
   PZT changes the high frequency range RMSD-S significantly, while the
   damage far away from the PZT changes the RMSD-S in the low frequency
   range significantly. The relationship between the frequency range and
   the PZT sensing region is also presented. Finally, a damage
   identification scheme is proposed to estimate the location and severity
   of damage in concrete structures.}},

   The topic map illustrated the delicate intertwining of subject areas and
   provided a more explicit illustration of the concepts within each

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of fentanyl on
   analgesic properties and respiratory responses during an epidural
   procedure. Sixty patients premedicated with oral brotizolam 0.25 mg were
   allocated to receive procedural analgesia with saline or 25 or 50 mu g
   of fentanyl. Five minutes after administration, an epidural procedure
   was started. Pain assessments were made immediately after the epidural
   catheter placement using a visual analog scale. The lowest SpO(2) levels
   during the procedure were recorded to evaluate respiratory depression,
   and cardiovascular complications were also recorded. The pain scores
   were significantly lower in the 25 and 50 mu g fentanyl groups than in
   the placebo group (P < 0.01). There was no difference in pain assessment
   between the 25 and 50 mu g fentanyl groups. The lowest SpO(2) value of
   the 50 mu g fentanyl group was significantly lower than those of the
   other groups (P < 0.001). Seven of 20 cases in the 50 mu g fentanyl
   group needed oxygen administration because of a decreased SpO(2) value
   (< 94\%). No cardiovascular complications were observed in any group
   during the entire study period. Thus, intravenous fentanyl at a dose of
   25 mu g provides effective procedural analgesia without the risk of
   hypoxemia during an epidural procedure in a patient with preanesthetic
   medication.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AAPOS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Children with Down syndrome (DS) have an increased prevalence
   of ocular disorders, including amblyopia, strabismus, and refractive
   error. Health maintenance guidelines from the Down Syndrome Medical
   Interest Group recommend ophthalmologic examinations every 1 to 2 years
   for these children. Photoscreening may be a cost-effective option for
   subsequent screening evaluations after an initial complete examination,
   but no study has evaluated the accuracy of photoscreening in children
   with DS. The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity,
   specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of
   photoscreening in detecting treatable ocular conditions in children with
   DS.
   METHODS Photoscreening and complete ophthalmologic evaluations were
   performed in 50 consecutive 3- to 10-year-old children with DS.
   Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values
   were calculated with the use of ophthalmologic examination findings as
   the reference standard.
   RESULTS Most children were able to complete photoscreening (94\% with
   Medical Technology and Innovations {[}MTI] and 90\% with Visiscreen
   OSS-C {[}VR]). Many children had an identified diagnosis on
   ophthalmologic examination (n = 46, 92\%). Of these, approximately
   one-half (n = 27, 54\%) had one or more condition(s) requiring
   treatment. Both the MTI and VR photoscreening devices had a sensitivity
   of 93\% (95\% confidence interval 0.76-0.99) for detecting treatable
   ocular conditions. The specificities for the MTI and VR photoscreening
   were 0.35 (0.18-0.57) and 0.55 (0.34-0.74), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS Photoscreening is sensitive but less specific at detecting
   treatable ocular conditions in children with DS. In specific instances,
   the use of photoscreening in the DS population has the potential to save
   time and expense related to routine eye examinations, particularly in
   children with a normal baseline comprehensive examination. (J AAPOS

Abstract = {{The fabrication and electrical properties of H-2 gas sensor with

   by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy

   showed that the amorphous SnO2 was uniformly coated onto the entire ZnO

   electrical properties of the core shell nanowires in 25-200 ppm of
   hydrogen (H2) were measured at temperature of 250 C. It was found that
   the ZnO-SnO2 core shell nanowires exhibited excellent hydrogen sensor
   performance, such as the sensitivity is up to 89\% against 200 ppm
   hydrogen. Such high sensitivity was believed to be controlled by the
