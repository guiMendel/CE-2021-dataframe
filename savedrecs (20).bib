Title = {{The Drosophila FoxA Ortholog Fork Head Regulates Growth and Gene
   Expression Downstream of Target of Rapamycin}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Forkhead transcription factors of the FoxO subfamily regulate gene
   expression programs downstream of the insulin signaling network. It is
   less clear which proteins mediate transcriptional control exerted by
   Target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling, but recent studies in nematodes
   suggest a role for FoxA transcription factors downstream of TOR. In this
   study we present evidence that outlines a similar connection in
   Drosophila, in which the FoxA protein Fork head (FKH) regulates cellular
   and organismal size downstream of TOR. We find that ectopic expression
   and targeted knockdown of FKH in larval tissues elicits different size
   phenotypes depending on nutrient state and TOR signaling levels. FKH
   overexpression has a negative effect on growth under fed conditions, and
   this phenotype is not further exacerbated by inhibition of TOR via
   rapamycin feeding. Under conditions of starvation or low TOR signaling
   levels, knockdown of FKH attenuates the size reduction associated with
   these conditions. Subcellular localization of endogenous FKH protein is
   shifted from predominantly cytoplasmic on a high-protein diet to a
   pronounced nuclear accumulation in animals with reduced levels of TOR or
   fed with rapamycin. Two putative FKH target genes, CG6770 and cabut, are
   transcriptionally induced by rapamycin or FKH expression, and silenced
   by FKH knockdown. Induction of both target genes in heterozygous TOR
   mutant animals is suppressed by mutations in fkh. Furthermore, TOR
   signaling levels and FKH impact on transcription of the dFOXO target
   gene d4E-BP, implying a point of crosstalk with the insulin pathway. In
   summary, our observations show that an alteration of FKH levels has an
   effect on cellular and organismal size, and that FKH function is
   required for the growth inhibition and target gene induction caused by
   low TOR signaling levels.}},

Abstract = {{Cdc7-Dbf4 is a conserved, two-subunit kinase required for initiating
   eukaryotic DNA replication. Recent studies have shown that Cdc7-Dbf4
   also regulates the mitotic exit network (MEN) and monopolar homolog
   orientation in meiosis I (Matos, J., Lipp, J. J., Bogdanova, A.,
   Guillot, S., Okaz, E., Junqueira, M., Shevchenko, A., and Zachariae, W.
   (2008) Cell 135, 662-678 and Miller, C. T., Gabrielse, C., Chen, Y. C.,
   and Weinreich, M. (2009) PLoS Genet. 5, e1000498). Both activities
   likely involve a Cdc7-Dbf4 interaction with Cdc5, the single Polo-like
   kinase in budding yeast. We previously showed that Dbf4 binds the Cdc5
   polo-box domain (PBD) via an similar to 40-residue N-terminal sequence,
   which lacks a PBD consensus binding site (S(pS/pT)(P/X)), and that Dbf4
   inhibits Cdc5 function during mitosis. Here we identify a non-consensus
   PBD binding site within Dbf4 and demonstrate that the PBD-Dbf4
   interaction occurs via a distinct PBD surface from that used to bind
   phosphoproteins. Genetic and biochemical analysis of multiple dbf4
   mutants indicate that Dbf4 inhibits Cdc5 function through direct
   binding. Surprisingly, mutation of invariant Cdc5 residues required for
   binding phosphorylated substrates has little effect on yeast viability
   or growth rate. Instead, cdc5 mutants defective for binding
   phosphoproteins exhibit enhanced resistance to microtubule disruption
   and an increased rate of spindle elongation. This study, therefore,
   details the molecular nature of a new type of PBD binding and reveals
   that Cdc5 targeting to phosphorylated substrates likely regulates
   spindle dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The Linked Multi-Component Robotic Systems (L-MCRS) consists of a group
   of mobile robots carrying a passive uni-dimensional object (a hose or a
   wire). It is a recently identified unexplored and unexploited category
   of multi-robot systems. In this paper we report the first effort on the
   modeling, control and visual servoing of L-MCRS. Modeling has been
   tackled from geometrical and dynamical points of view. The passive
   element is modeled by splines, and the dynamical modeling is achieved by
   the appropriate extension of Geometrically Exact Dynamic Splines (GEDS).
   The system's modeling allows realistic simulation, which can be used as
   a test bed for the evaluation of control strategies. In this paper we
   evaluate two such control strategies: a baseline global controller, and
   a fuzzy local controller based on the observation of the hose segment
   between two robots. Finally, we have performed physical experiments on a
   team of robots carrying a wire under a visual servoing scheme that
   provides the perceptual information about the hose for the fuzzy local
   controller. Visual servoing robust image segmentation is grounded in the
   Dichromatic Reflection Model (DRM). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), the major HIV coreceptor, is a G
   protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in cell activation and
   migration in response to chemokines. Blockade of CCR5 is an effective
   anti-HIV strategy, and potent anti-HIV chemokine analogs such as
   PSC-RANTES have been developed. These inhibitors act by interfering with
   receptor trafficking, thereby inducing prolonged intracellular
   sequestration of CCR5. Like many GPCRs, CCR5 is desensitized following
   agonist activation. The initial steps in this process are well
   understood, but later stages, including where CCR5 is sequestered during
   desensitization, and how anti-HIV chemokine analogs intervene to achieve
   prolonged sequestration, have yet to be elucidated in detail. In this
   study we demonstrate that CCR5 cycles to and from the cell surface via
   the endosome recycling compartment and the trans-Golgi network during
   desensitization, accumulating in the trans-Golgi network following
   internalization by both PSC-RANTES and CCL5, the native ligand from
   which it was derived. In addition, we show that unlike CCR5 sequestered
   by CCL5, CCR5 sequestered by PSC-RANTES cannot be induced to return to
   the cell surface by addition of the small molecule CCR5 inhibitor,
   TAK-779, and that association of PSC-RANTES with CCR5 is more durable
   than that of native CCL5 during desensitization. Our findings reconcile
   the previously conflicting descriptions of the location of sequestered
   CCR5 during desensitization, as well as providing more general insights
   into potential trafficking routes for endocytosed GPCRs and further
   elucidation of the unusual inhibitory mechanism of chemokine analogs
   with potent anti-HIV activity.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{In this study we describe a distinctive pigment ring that appears in
   spider eyes after ecdysis and successively decreases in size in the days
   thereafter. Although pigment stops in spider eyes are well known, size
   variability is, to our knowledge, reported here for the first time.
   Representative species from three families (Ctenidae, Sparassidae and
   Lycosidae) are investigated and, for one of these species (Cupiennius
   salei, Ctenidae), the progressive increase in pupil diameter is
   monitored. In this species the pupil occupies only a fourth of the total
   projected lens surface after ecdysis and reaches its final size after
   approximately ten days. MicroCT images suggest that the decrease of the
   pigment ring is linked to the growth of the corneal lens after ecdysis.
   The pigment rings might improve vision in the immature eye by shielding
   light rays that would otherwise enter the eye via peripheral regions of
   the cornea, beside the growing crystalline lens.}},

Abstract = {{Perceiving the environment is crucial in any application relatd to
   mobile robotics research. In this paper, a new approach to real-time
   human detection through processing video captured by a thermal infrared
   camera mounted on the autonomous mobile platform mSecurit (TM) is
   introduced. The approach starts with a phase of static analysis for the
   detection of human candidates through some classical image processing
   techniques such as image normalization and thresholding. Then, the
   proposal starts a dynamic image analysis phase based in optical flow or
   image difference. Optical flow is used when the robot is moving, whilst
   image difference is the preferred method when the mobile platform is
   still. The results of both phases are compared to enhance the human
   segmentation by infrared camera. Indeed, optical flow or image
   difference will emphasize the foreground hot spot areas obtained at the
   initial human candidates' detection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The Molecular Chaperone Hsp90 alpha Is Required for Meiotic Progression
   of Spermatocytes beyond Pachytene in the Mouse}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{The molecular chaperone Hsp90 has been found to be essential for
   viability in all tested eukaryotes, from the budding yeast to
   Drosophila. In mammals, two genes encode the two highly similar and
   functionally largely redundant isoforms Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta.
   Although they are co-expressed in most if not all cells, their relative
   levels vary between tissues and during development. Since mouse embryos
   lacking Hsp90 beta die at implantation, and despite the fact that Hsp90
   inhibitors being tested as anti-cancer agents are relatively well
   tolerated, the organismic functions of Hsp90 in mammals remain largely
   unknown. We have generated mouse lines carrying gene trap insertions in
   the Hsp90 alpha gene to investigate the global functions of this
   isoform. Surprisingly, mice without Hsp90 alpha are apparently normal,
   with one major exception. Mutant male mice, whose Hsp90 beta levels are
   unchanged, are sterile because of a complete failure to produce sperm.
   While the development of the male reproductive system appears to be
   normal, spermatogenesis arrests specifically at the pachytene stage of
   meiosis I. Over time, the number of spermatocytes and the levels of the
   meiotic regulators and Hsp90 interactors Hsp70-2, NASP and Cdc2 are
   reduced. We speculate that Hsp90 alpha may be required to maintain and
   to activate these regulators and/or to disassemble the synaptonemal
   complex that holds homologous chromosomes together. The link between
   fertility and Hsp90 is further supported by our finding that an Hsp90
   inhibitor that can cross the blood-testis barrier can partially
   phenocopy the genetic defects.}},

Abstract = {{Void formation as a function of resin moisture content was investigated
   to better understand and control process defects in composite parts made
   from prepreg. In this study, uncured prepreg was conditioned at 70\%,
   80\% and 90\% relative humidity and at 35 degrees C. Conditioned prepreg
   was laid up into quasi-isotropic laminates and cured using vacuum bag
   only (VBO) processing (low-pressure), and autoclave processing. Moisture
   uptake in the resin was measured using coulometric Fischer titration.
   Void content was measured by image analysis of polished sections of
   cured laminates. Void fractions increased substantially with increasing
   moisture content in VBO processed laminates, while autoclave-processed
   parts remained void-free. Experimental results were consistent with
   trends predicted using a diffusion-based analytical model. The findings
   are discussed in the context of causes of voids in prepreg composites.

Abstract = {{Prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) catalyze the hydroxylation of collagens and
   hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-alpha subunits. We studied the zebrafish
   homologue of the recently characterized human transmembrane P4H (P4H-TM)
   that can hydroxylate HIF-alpha, but not collagens, in vitro and
   influence HIF-alpha levels in cellulo. The zebrafish P4H-TM mRNA had its
   highest expression in the eye and brain and lower levels in other
   tissues, including the kidney. Morpholino knockdown of P4H-TM in embryos
   resulted in a reduction in the size of the eye and head and
   morphological alterations in the head from 2 days postfertilization
   onward. In addition, pericardial edema, regarded as a sign of kidney
   dysfunction, developed from 3 days postfertilization onward. The
   phenotype was dependent on the P4H-TM catalytic activity because similar
   results were obtained with morpholinos targeting either translation
   initiation or catalytic residues of the enzyme. Structural and
   functional analyses of the morphant pronephric kidneys revealed
   fragmented glomerular basement membranes (BMs), disorganized podocyte
   foot processes, and severely compromised pronephric kidney function
   leading to proteinuria. The opacity of the eye lens was increased due to
   the presence of extra nuclei and deposits, and the structure of the lens
   capsule BM was altered.}},

Abstract = {{The question as to the role that correlated activity plays in the coding
   of information in the brain continues to be one of the most important in
   neuroscience. One approach to understanding this role is to formally
   model the ensemble responses as multivariate probability distributions.
   We have previously introduced alternatives to linear assumptions of
   multivariate Gaussian dependence for spike timing in neural ensembles
   using the probabilistic copula approach. In probability theory the
   copula ``couples{''} marginal distributions to form flexible
   multivariate distribution functions for characterizing ensemble
   behavior. The parametric copula can be factored out of the joint
   probability density, and as such is independent and isolated from the
   marginal densities. This greatly simplifies the analysis, and allows a
   direct examination of the shape of the dependence independent of the
   marginals. The shape of the copula function goes beyond describing the
   dependence with a single summarizing statistic. In this review, we
   illustrate the construction of the copula, and how it contributes to the
   analysis of information conveyed by populations of neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Human natural killer (NK) cells express an abundant level of 2B4 and CD2
   on their surface. Their counter-receptors, CD48 and CD58, are also
   expressed on the NK cell surface, raising a question about the
   functional consequences of potential 2B4/CD48 and CD2/CD58 interactions.
   Using blocking antibodies specific to each receptor, we demonstrated
   that both 2B4/CD48 and CD2/CD58 interactions were essential for the
   development of NK effector functions: cytotoxicity and cytokine
   secretion. However, only 2B4/CD48, but not CD2/CD58, interactions were
   shown to be critical for the optimal NK cell proliferation in response
   to interleukin (IL)-2. IL-2-activated NK cells cultured in the absence
   of 2B4/CD48 or CD2/CD58 interactions were severely impaired for their
   ability to induce intracellular calcium mobilization and subsequent ERK
   activation upon tumor target exposure, suggesting that the early
   signaling pathway of NK receptors leading to impaired cytolysis and
   interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion was inhibited. Nevertheless, these
   defects did not fully account for the reduced proliferation of NK cells
   in the absence of 2B4/CD48 interactions, because anti-CD2 or anti-CD58
   monoclonal antibody (mAb)-treated NK cells, showing defective signaling
   and effector functions, displayed normal proliferation upon IL-2
   stimulation. These results propose the signaling divergence between
   pathways leading to cell proliferation and cytotoxicity/cytokine
   release, which can be differentially regulated by 2B4 and CD2 during
   IL-2-driven NK cell activation. Collectively, these results reveal the
   importance of homotypic NK-to-NK cell cross-talk through 2B4/CD48 and
   CD2/CD58 pairs and further present their differential and overlapping
   roles in human NK cells.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a simple route to produce monodisperse PbS hollow

   ethyltrimethylammonium chloride as co-monomer. X-ray diffraction (XRD).
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTRI) were used to
   characterize the structure of the obtained PbS/PS composites and hollow
   PbS spheres. It was found that the as-produced samples are well-defined
   core-shell structures with an average diameter of about 0.98 mu m. TEM
   showed that after the removal of the templates, the hollow structures
   were perfectly retained. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Protein-enriched meal replacements do not adversely affect liver, kidney
   or bone density: an outpatient randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is concern that recommending protein-enriched meal
   replacements as part of a weight management program could lead to
   changes in biomarkers of liver or renal function and reductions in bone
   density. This study was designed as a placebo-controlled clinical trial
   utilizing two isocaloric meal plans utilizing either a high
   protein-enriched (HP) or a standard protein (SP) meal replacement in an
   outpatient weight loss program.
   Subjects/methods: 100 obese men and women over 30 years of age with a
   body mass index (BMI) between 27 to 40 kg/m(2) were randomized to one of
   two isocaloric weight loss meal plans 1). HP group: providing 2.2 g
   protein/kg of lean body mass (LBM)/day or 2). SP group: providing 1.1 g
   protein/kg LBM/day. Meal replacement (MR) was used twice daily (one
   meal, one snack) for 3 months and then once a day for 9 months. Body
   weight, lipid profiles, liver function, renal function and bone density
   were measured at baseline and 12 months.
   Results: Seventy subjects completed the study. Both groups lost weight
   (HP -4.29 +/- 5.90 kg vs. SP -4.66 +/- 6.91 kg, p < 0.01) and there was
   no difference in weight loss observed between the groups at one year.
   There was no significant change noted in liver function {[}AST (HP -2.07
   +/- 10.32 U/L, p = 0.28; SP 0.27 +/- 6.67 U/L, p = 0.820), ALT (HP -1.03
   +/- 10.08 U/L, p = 0.34; SP -2.6 +/- 12.51 U/L, p = 0.24), bilirubin (HP
   0.007 +/- 0.33, U/L, p = 0.91; SP 0.07 +/- 0.24 U/L, p = 0.120),
   alkaline phosphatase (HP 2.00 +/- 9.07 U/L, p = 0.240; SP -2.12 +/-
   11.01 U/L, p = 0.280)], renal function {[}serum creatinine (HP 0.31 +/-
   1.89 mg/dL, p = 0.380; SP -0.05 +/- 0.15 mg/dL, p = 0.060), urea
   nitrogen (HP 1.33 +/- 4.68 mg/dL, p = 0.130; SP -0.24 +/- 3.03 mg/dL, p
   = 0.650), 24 hour urine creatinine clearance (HP -0.02 +/- 0.16 mL/min,
   p = 0.480; SP 1.18 +/- 7.53 mL/min, p = 0.400), and calcium excretion
   (HP -0.41 +/- 9.48 mg/24 hours, p = 0.830; SP -0.007 +/- 6.76 mg/24
   hours, p = 0.990)] or in bone mineral density by DEXA (HP 0.04 +/- 0.19
   g/cm(2), p = 0.210; SP -0.03 +/- 0.17 g/cm(2), p = 0.320) in either
   group over one year.
   Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that protein-enriched meals
   replacements as compared to standard meal replacements recommended for
   weight management do not have adverse effects on routine measures of
   liver function, renal function or bone density at one year.

Abstract = {{Expression profiling of target genes in patient blood is a powerful tool
   for RNA diagnosis. Here, we describe Genopal (TM), a novel platform
   ideal for efficient focused microarray analysis. Genopal (TM), which
   consists of gel-filled fibres, is advantageous for high-quality mass
   production via large-scale slicing of the Genopal (TM) block. We
   prepared two arrays, infectant and autoimmunity, that provided highly
   reliable data in terms of repetitive scanning of the same and/or
   distinct microarrays. Moreover, we demonstrated that Genopal (TM) had
   sensitivity sufficient to yield signals in short hybridization times
   (0.5 h). Application of the autoimmunity array to blood samples allowed
   us to identify an expression pattern specific to Takayasu arteritis
   based on the Spearman rank correlation by comparing the reference
   profile with those of several autoimmune diseases and healthy volunteers
   (HVs). The comparison of these data with those obtained by other methods
   revealed that they exhibited similar expression profiles of many target
   genes. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Genopal (TM) is an
   advantageous platform for focused microarrays with regard to its low
   cost, rapid results and reliable quality.}},

Abstract = {{A role for Cu2+ ions in Alzheimer disease is often disputed, as it is
   believed that Cu2+ ions only promote nontoxic amorphous aggregates of
   amyloid-beta (A beta). In contrast with currently held opinion, we show
   that the presence of substoichiometric levels of Cu2+ ions in fact
   doubles the rate of production of amyloid fibers, accelerating both the
   nucleation and elongation of fiber formation. We suggest that binding of
   Cu2+ ions at a physiological pH causes A beta to approach its
   isoelectric point, thus inducing self-association and fiber formation.
   We further show that Cu2+ ions bound to A beta are consistently more
   toxic to neuronal cells than A beta in the absence of Cu2+ ions, whereas
   Cu2+ ions in the absence of A beta are not cytotoxic. The degree of Cu-A
   beta cytotoxicity correlates with the levels of Cu2+ ions that
   accelerate fiber formation. We note the effect appears to be specific
   for Cu2+ ions as Zn2+ ions inhibit the formation of fibers. An active
   role for Cu2+ ions in accelerating fiber formation and promoting cell
   death suggests impaired copper homeostasis may be a risk factor in
   Alzheimer disease.}},

Abstract = {{Iterative extension of the thiophene ring unit leads to oligothiophenes.
   The coupling reaction at the CH bond of thiophene with halo-thiophene
   occurs at the 5-position of 2-bromothiophene with 2-iodothiophene in the
   presence of a palladium catalyst and AgNO3/KF as an activator to give
   the corresponding bithiophene, whose carbon-bromine bond remains.
   Halogen exchange converts the bromine atom to iodide, which also allows
   further reaction to form thiophene-thiophene bond. Oligothiophenes are
   obtained by repeating such sequense.}},

Title = {{Video-assisted mediastinoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy combined with
   laparoscopy for esophageal cancer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Minimally invasive transhiatal esophagectomy for esophageal
   cancer includes mediastinoscopic and laparoscopic transhiatal
   esophagectomy. It is inadequate in both two techniques. It is impossible
   to dissect the lower esophagus with single mediastinoscopy or the upper
   and middle esophagus with single laparoscopy. We use mediastinoscopy
   combined with laparoscopy to dissect the whole esophagus and stomach
   including lymph node dissection. In addition, laparoscopic gastric
   mobilization leads to less trauma than an open gastroplasty.
   Methods: 40 cases of video-assisted mediastinoscopic transhiatal
   esophagectomy were performed and divided into two groups. 32 patients
   were received surgical therapy of single mediastinoscopic esophagectomy
   with open gastroplasty in group A, while 8 patients were received
   surgical therapy of mediastinoscopic esophagectomy combined with
   laparoscopic lower esophageal and gastric dissection in group B. The
   perioperative complications were recorded.
   Results: Video-assisted mediastinoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy was
   performed successfully both in group A and B. It suggested that
   mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy be better than single
   mediastinoscopy because of less blood loss, less pain, shorter ICU stay
   and complete lower mediastinal lymph nodes resection.
   Conclusions: Video-assisted mediastinoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy
   combined with laparoscopy is a safe and minimally invasive technique
   with whole esophagus and mediastinal lymph node dissection in the clear
   visualization of the mediastinum, reducing the abdominal trauma.}},

Abstract = {{Ikiculter chojabaruensis is described on the basis of three specimens
   from the Miocene of Iki Island, Nagasaki, Japan, as a new genus and
   species of the family Cyprinidae. This new species possesses an elongate

   third dorsal spinelike fin ray with smooth posterior edge, apart tips of
   deeply forked basipterygium with a dorsal wing, elongated pterotic,
   smooth surface of opercle, large third vertebra twice as large as second
   one, 13 branched anal fin rays and 21 abdominal and 20 caudal vertebrae.
   A phylogenetic study using the character matrix of a previous study
   suggests that the species is related to leuciscins+phoxinins, Ecocarpia,
   Iquius, xenocyprinins and cultins and is probably a sister taxon to a
   clade of Iquius+xenocyprinins and cultrins. An extinct group closely

Abstract = {{In mammalian brain, D-serine is synthesized from L-serine by serine
   racemase, and it functions as an obligatory co-agonist at the glycine
   modulatory site of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-selective glutamate
   receptors. Although diminution in D-serine level has been implicated in
   NMDA receptor hypofunction, which is thought to occur in schizophrenia,
   the source of the precursor L-serine and its role in D-serine metabolism
   in adult brain have yet to be determined. We investigated whether
   L-serine synthesized in brain via the phosphorylated pathway is
   essential for D-serine synthesis by generating mice with a conditional
   deletion of D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh; EC 1.1.1.95).
   This enzyme catalyzes the first step in L-serine synthesis via the
   phosphorylated pathway. HPLC analysis of serine enantiomers demonstrated
   that both L-and D-serine levels were markedly decreased in the cerebral
   cortex and hippocampus of conditional knock-out mice, whereas the serine
   deficiency did not alter protein expression levels of serine racemase
   and NMDA receptor subunits in these regions. The present study provides
   definitive proof that L-serine-synthesized endogenously via the
   phosphorylated pathway is a key rate-limiting factor for maintaining
   steady-state levels of D-serine in adult brain. Furthermore, NMDA-evoked
   transcription of Arc, an immediate early gene, was diminished in the
   hippocampus of conditional knock-out mice. Thus, this study demonstrates
   that in mature neuronal circuits L-serine availability determines the
   rate of D-serine synthesis in the forebrain and controls NMDA receptor
   function at least in the hippocampus.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of Glycoprotein Charge in the Evolutionary History of Human
   Influenza}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Influenza viruses show a significant capacity to evade host
   immunity; this is manifest both as large occasional jumps in the
   antigenic phenotype of viral surface molecules and in gradual antigenic
   changes leading to annual influenza epidemics in humans. Recent mouse
   studies show that avidity for host cells can play an important role in
   polyclonal antibody escape, and further that electrostatic charge of the
   hemagglutinin glycoprotein can contribute to such avidity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We test the role of glycoprotein charge
   on sequence data from the three major subtypes of influenza A in humans,
   using a simple method of calculating net glycoprotein charge. Of all
   subtypes, H3N2 in humans shows a striking pattern of increasing positive
   charge since its introduction in 1968. Notably, this trend applies to
   both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins. In the late 1980s
   hemagglutinin charge reached a plateau, while neuraminidase charge
   started to decline. We identify key groups of amino acid sites involved
   in this charge trend.
   Conclusions/Significance: To our knowledge these are the first
   indications that, for human H3N2, net glycoprotein charge covaries
   strongly with antigenic drift on a global scale. Further work is needed
   to elucidate how such charge interacts with other immune escape
   mechanisms, such as glycosylation, and we discuss important questions
   arising for future study.}},

Abstract = {{FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify the oxochloride species of
   tantalum(V) in ionic liquids and to confirm the correlations between
   their presence in electrolytes and the changes in the route of
   electrochemical reduction of tantalum(V). Electrochemical behaviour of
   the mixtures (x)1-butyl-1-methyl-pyrrolidinium chloride-(1 - x)TaCl5 at
   x=0.80. 0.65, and 0.40 was investigated over the temperature range
   90-160 degrees C with respect to the electrochemical deposition of
   tantalum and was discussed in terms of spectroscopic data. The mechanism
   of electrochemical reduction of tantalum(V) in the basic and acidic
   electrolytes depends strongly on the structure and composition of the
   electro active species of tantalum(V) defined by the molar composition
   of ionic liquids and on the competition between tantalum(V) chloride and
   oxochloride species. In the basic mixture at x=0.80, with octahedral
   {[}TaCl6](-) ions as the electrochemically active species only the first
   reduction step Ta5+ -> Ta4+ at -0.31 V was observed. The competitive
   reduction of tantalum(V) oxochloride species occurs at more anodic
   potential (-0.01 V) than the reduction of the chloride complexes and can
   restrict the further reduction of tantalum(IV). In the basic ionic
   liquid at x=0.65, the cyclic voltammograms exhibit reduction peaks at
   -0.31 V and -0.51 V attributed to the diffusion controlled process as
   {[}TaCl6](-) + e(-) -> {[}TaCl6](2-) and {[}TaCl6](2-) + e(-) ->
   {[}TaCl6](3-). The further irreversible reduction of tantalum(III) to
   metallic state may occur at -2.1 V. In the acidic ionic liquids, at x =
   0.40 the electrochemical reduction of two species occurs,TaCl6- and
   Ta2Cl11- and it is limited by two electron transfer for both of them at
   -0.3 V and -1.5 V. respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   of O-2/H-2 or by increasing the treatment time of hydrogen plasma, the
   electrical resistivities of ZnO films were significantly reduced, and
   their transmittances and optical bandgap energies were blue-shifted in
   wavelength. These results were considered to be closely related to the
   passivation of oxygen vacancies as well as the formation of shallow
   donors that were induced by the injection of hydrogen in ZnO via gas
   addition and plasma treatment. In addition, the injection of
   hydrogen-including additive gas resulted in a decrease in grain size and
   crystallinity of ZnO films, whereas the plasma treatment hardly affected

Abstract = {{We report herein the effects of various surrounding confinements of Si
   nanoparticles on the electrochemical performance of Si nanoparticles
   based anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Three different types of
   surrounding confinements are incorporated onto or around the surface of

   via electrospinning, carbon nitride encapsulated Si nanoparticles with
   core/shell structure (Si@CND), and binder enriched Si
   nanoparticles-based anode (Si@RBD). Morphology and microstructure of the
   samples are characterized using X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron
   microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and the results were
   discussed in relation to the electrochemical performances. It is found
   that Si@CNF which has conducting hard surrounding confinements and
   Si@RBD exhibited high reversible specific capacity of 620 mA hg(-1) and
   1200 mA hg(-1), up to 30th cycle, respectively. Meanwhile, Si@CND that

Title = {{Early activation of wheat polyamine biosynthesis during Fusarium head
   blight implicates putrescine as an inducer of trichothecene mycotoxin
   production}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: The fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum causes Fusarium
   Head Blight (FHB) disease on wheat which can lead to trichothecene
   mycotoxin (e. g. deoxynivalenol, DON) contamination of grain, harmful to
   mammalian health. DON is produced at low levels under standard culture
   conditions when compared to plant infection but specific polyamines (e.
   g. putrescine and agmatine) and amino acids (e. g. arginine and
   ornithine) are potent inducers of DON by F. graminearum in axenic
   culture. Currently, host factors that promote mycotoxin synthesis during
   FHB are unknown, but plant derived polyamines could contribute to DON
   induction in infected heads. However, the temporal and spatial
   accumulation of polyamines and amino acids in relation to that of DON
   has not been studied.
   Results: Following inoculation of susceptible wheat heads by F.
   graminearum, DON accumulation was detected at two days after
   inoculation. The accumulation of putrescine was detected as early as one
   day following inoculation while arginine and cadaverine were also
   produced at three and four days post-inoculation. Transcripts of
   ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and arginine decarboxylase (ADC), two key
   biosynthetic enzymes for putrescine biosynthesis, were also strongly
   induced in heads at two days after inoculation. These results indicated
   that elicitation of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway is an early
   response to FHB. Transcripts for genes encoding enzymes acting upstream
   in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway as well as those of ODC and ADC,
   and putrescine levels were also induced in the rachis, a flower organ
   supporting DON production and an important route for pathogen
   colonisation during FHB. A survey of 24 wheat genotypes with varying
   responses to FHB showed putrescine induction is a general response to
   inoculation and no correlation was observed between the accumulation of
   putrescine and infection or DON accumulation.
   Conclusions: The activation of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway and
   putrescine in infected heads prior to detectable DON accumulation is
   consistent with a model where the pathogen exploits the generic host
   stress response of polyamine synthesis as a cue for production of
   trichothecene mycotoxins during FHB disease. However, it is likely that
   this mechanism is complicated by other factors contributing to
   resistance and susceptibility in diverse wheat genetic backgrounds.}},

   the chemical reaction kinetics of the curing reaction and, therefore,
   results in more realistic network structures. On the basis of the
   corresponding model structures, the equilibrium water content and the
   swelling ratio of amorphous PA-6 and of the DGEBA+IPD networks are
   calculated via computer simulation for different thermodynamic
   conditions. A hybrid method is used combining the molecular dynamics

Abstract = {{Several studies have reported associations between
   catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene Val158Met polymorphism and P300
   event-related potentials in schizophrenic patients. But there has been
   no research to study the association between the P300 component: and the
   Val158Met polymorphism in Chinese Han schizophrenia patients. Therefore,
   the present article was aimed at investigating the relationship of the
   Val158Met polymorphism with P300 in Chinese schizophrenic patients. The
   Val158Met polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 287
   schizophrenia patients and 84 healthy control subjects. P300 recordings
   were obtained in a subsample. A significant difference was not observed
   between the patients and control subjects in the genotype distributions
   and allele frequencies. P300 amplitude in schizophrenia patients was
   significantly lower than that of controls. The P300 latency in
   schizophrenia patients was also significantly longer than that of
   controls. The P300 latency of Met homozygotes was significantly shorter
   than that of Val/Met and of Val/Val carriers at Cz and Pz. The latency
   of Val/Met carriers was significantly shorter than that of Val/Val
   carriers at Pz. The results did not suggest an association between the
   polymorphism in the COMT gene and susceptibility to schizophrenia in the
   Chinese Han population. However, the COMT Val158Met polymorphism might
   be a susceptibility variant for P300 abnormality in Chinese Han
   schizophrenia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Repetitive questioning is among the most common and burdensome of the
   behavioral and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Regardless of the clinical significance of the repetitive questioning,
   the neural substrates involved remain unclear. Fifty-eight consecutive
   patients with AD participated in this study. The score of repetitive
   questioning behavior was evaluated by multiplying the severity by the
   frequency of the behavior. They underwent brain SPECT with
   Tc-99m-ethylcysteinate dimer. Scores of repetitive questioning behavior
   had a significant positive correlation with regional cerebral blood flow
   (rCBF) in the bilateral pericallosal regions. After removing the effect
   of memory test scores, we found a significant positive correlation of
   scores of repetitive questioning behavior to rCBF in the left
   pericallosal region. The pericallosal region includes the upper
   precuneus, cingulate, and posterior cingulate cortices on 3DSRT.
   Repetitive questioning behavior among AD patients might be a
   manifestation of mental state associated with a relative increase or
   preservation of rCBF in the left pericallosal region. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Toxoplasma gondii pathogenesis includes the invasion of host cells by
   extracellular parasites, replication of intracellular tachyzoites, and
   differentiation to a latent bradyzoite stage. We present the analysis of
   seven novel T. gondii insertional mutants that do not undergo normal
   differentiation to bradyzoites. Microarray quantification of the
   variation in genome-wide RNA levels for each parasite line and times
   after induction allowed us to describe states in the normal
   differentiation process, to analyze mutant lines in the context of these
   states, and to identify genes that may have roles in initiating the
   transition from tachyzoite to bradyzoite. Gene expression patterns in
   wild-type parasites undergoing differentiation suggest a novel
   extracellular state within the tachyzoite stage. All mutant lines
   exhibit aberrant regulation of bradyzoite gene expression and notably
   some of the mutant lines appear to exhibit high proportions of the
   intracellular tachyzoite state regardless of whether they are
   intracellular or extracellular. In addition to the genes identified by
   the insertional mutagenesis screen, mixture model analysis allowed us to
   identify a small number of genes, in mutants, for which expression
   patterns could not be accounted for using the three parasite states -
   genes that may play a mechanistic role in switching from the tachyzoite
   to bradyzoite stage.}},

Abstract = {{LiFePO4/Cnanosheet composite has been prepared via a low-temperature
   solvothermal reaction followed by high-temperature treatment. The
   as-prepared sample is characterized by XRD, FDR, Raman, SEM, and TEM. It
   is confirmed that the nanosheets are composed of ca. 50 nm thickness of
   crystalline LiFePO4-core coated with ca. 10 nm thickness of
   carbon-shell. The charge-discharge tests show that the as-fabricated
   LiFePO4/C nanosheet cathode in lithium-ion cell demonstrates high
   reversible capacity (164 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and good cycle stability
   (columbic efficiency 100\% during 100 cycles). The cyclic voltammetric
   analysis indicates Li+ diffusion determines the whole electrode reaction
   kinetics, and the diffusion coefficient estimated by EIS is comparable
   to the reported data. The enhanced kinetic behavior of the as-fabricated
   cathode is actually originated from the nano-dimensional sheet-like
   morphology, which facilitates Li+ migration due to the shortened
   diffusion distance, and simultaneously increased exchangeable Li+ amount
   considering more accessible active surface. In addition, the uniformly
   coated thin conductive carbons contribute a lot for this enhancement
   because of considerably improved electronic conductivity. (C) 2010

Title = {{A Comparison of the Epidemiology and Clinical Presentation of Seasonal

Abstract = {{Background: A new influenza A (H1N1) virus was first found in April 2009
   and proceeded to cause a global pandemic. We compare the epidemiology
   and clinical presentation of seasonal influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and
   2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (pH1N1) using a prospective
   surveillance system for acute respiratory disease in Guatemala.
   Methodology/Findings: Patients admitted to two public hospitals in
   Guatemala in 2008-2009 who met a pneumonia case definition, and
   ambulatory patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) at 10 ambulatory
   clinics were invited to participate. Data were collected through patient
   interview, chart abstraction and standardized physical and radiological
   exams. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from all enrolled patients for
   laboratory diagnosis of influenza A virus infection with real-time
   reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We identified 1,744
   eligible, hospitalized pneumonia patients, enrolled 1,666 (96\%) and
   tested samples from 1,601 (96\%); 138 (9\%) had influenza A virus
   infection. Surveillance for ILI found 899 eligible patients, enrolled
   801 (89\%) and tested samples from 793 (99\%); influenza A virus
   infection was identified in 246 (31\%). The age distribution of
   hospitalized pneumonia patients was similar between seasonal H1N1 and
   pH1N1 (P = 0.21); the proportion of pneumonia patients < 1 year old with
   seasonal H1N1 (39\%) and pH1N1 (37\%) were similar (P = 0.42). The
   clinical presentation of pH1N1 and seasonal influenza A was similar for
   both hospitalized pneumonia and ILI patients. Although signs of severity
   (admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation and death)
   were higher among cases of pH1N1 than seasonal H1N1, none of the
   differences was statistically significant.
   Conclusions/Significance: Small sample sizes may limit the power of this
   study to find significant differences between seasonal influenza A and
   pH1N1. In Guatemala, influenza, whether seasonal or pH1N1, appears to
   cause severe disease mainly in infants; targeted vaccination of children
   should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Plesiosaurs are recorded for the first time from the lower section of
   Mata Amarilla Formation, Santa Cruz Province, Patagonia, Argentina. The
   stratigraphic succession consists of mudstones and siltstones
   interbedded with medium to fine-grained sandstone, deposited in a
   littoral environment during the Cenomanian-Santonian; therefore the
   material is the oldest record of plesiosaurs from the lower Late
   Cretaceous rocks of Argentina. The remains include teeth, some
   vertebrae, and one propodium assigned to Elasmosauridae indet. and
   Plesiosauria indet. The status of Polyptychodon patagonicus Ameghino,
   1893, as well as its stratigraphic position are discussed, leading to
   the conclusion that the material described by Ameghino is probably from
   the Mata Amarilla Formation and can only be referred to Plesiosauria
   indet. Analysis of sedimentologic features suggests that the material
   described here was deposited in an estuarine environment, strongly
   influenced by tides. The characters of the inferred environment are
   consistent with the type of preservation of the materials.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new general technique for solving linear preserver
   problems. The idea is to localize a given linear preserver phi at each
   nonzero vector. In such a way we get vector-valued linear maps on the
   space of matrices which inherit certain properties from phi. If we can
   prove that such induced maps have a standard form, then phi itself has
   either a standard form or a very special degenerate form. We apply this
   technique to characterize linear preservers of full rank. Using this
   technique we further reprove two classical results describing the
   general form of linear preservers of rank one and linear preservers of
   the unitary (or orthogonal) group. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Epithelial cell-directed efferocytosis in the post-partum mammary gland
   is necessary for tissue homeostasis and future lactation}},
Journal = {{BMC DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mammary glands harbor a profound burden of apoptotic cells
   (ACs) during post-lactational involution, but little is known regarding
   mechanisms by which ACs are cleared from the mammary gland, or
   consequences if this process is interrupted. We investigated AC
   clearance, also termed efferocytosis, during postlactational remodeling,
   using mice deficient for MerTK, Axl, and Tyro3, three related receptor
   tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulating macrophage-mediated efferocytosis in
   monocytes. MerTK expression, apoptosis and the accumulation of apoptotic
   debris were examined in histological sections of MerTK-deficient,
   Axl/Tyro3-deficient, and wild-type mammary glands harvested at specific
   time points during lactation and synchronized involution. The ability of
   primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) to engulf ACs was assessed in
   culture. Transplant of MerTK-deficient mammary epithelium into cleared
   WT mammary fat pads was used to assess the contribution of WT mammary
   macrophages to post-lactational efferocytosis.
   Results: ACs induced MerTK expression in MECs, resulting in elevated
   MerTK levels at the earliest stages of involution. Loss of MerTK
   resulted in AC accumulation in post-lactational MerTK-deficient mammary
   glands, but not in Axl and Tyro3-deficient mammary glands. Increased
   vascularization, fibrosis, and epithelial hyperproliferation were
   observed in MerTK-deficient mammary glands through at least 60 days
   post-weaning, due to failed efferocytosis after lactation, but did not
   manifest in nulliparous mice. WT host-derived macrophages failed to
   rescue efferocytosis in transplanted MerTK-deficient mammary epithelium.
   Conclusion: Efferocytosis by MECs through MerTK is crucial for mammary
   gland homeostasis and function during the post-lactational period.
   Efferocytosis by MECs thus limits pathologic consequences associated
   with the apoptotic load following lactation.}},

Title = {{Identifying Object Categories from Event-Related EEG: Toward Decoding of
   Conceptual Representations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Multivariate pattern analysis is a technique that allows the decoding of
   conceptual information such as the semantic category of a perceived
   object from neuroimaging data. Impressive single-trial classification
   results have been reported in studies that used fMRI. Here, we
   investigate the possibility to identify conceptual representations from
   event-related EEG based on the presentation of an object in different
   modalities: its spoken name, its visual representation and its written
   name. We used Bayesian logistic regression with a multivariate Laplace
   prior for classification. Marked differences in classification
   performance were observed for the tested modalities. Highest accuracies
   (89\% correctly classified trials) were attained when classifying object
   drawings. In auditory and orthographical modalities, results were lower
   though still significant for some subjects. The employed classification
   method allowed for a precise temporal localization of the features that
   contributed to the performance of the classifier for three modalities.
   These findings could help to further understand the mechanisms
   underlying conceptual representations. The study also provides a first
   step towards the use of concept decoding in the context of real-time
   brain-computer interface applications.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{In one of the most remarkable feats of motor control in the animal
   world, some Diptera, such as the housefly, can accurately execute
   corrective flight maneuvers in tens of milliseconds. These reflexive
   movements are achieved by the halteres, gyroscopic force sensors, in
   conjunction with rapidly tunable wing steering muscles. Specifically,
   the mechanosensory campaniform sensilla located at the base of the
   halteres transduce and transform rotation-induced gyroscopic forces into
   information about the angular velocity of the fly's body. But how
   exactly does the fly's neural architecture generate the angular velocity
   from the lateral strain forces on the left and right halteres? To
   explore potential algorithms, we built a neuromechanical model of the
   rotation detection circuit. We propose a neurobiologically plausible
   method by which the fly could accurately separate and measure the
   three-dimensional components of an imposed angular velocity. Our model
   assumes a single sign-inverting synapse and formally resembles some
   models of directional selectivity by the retina. Using multidimensional
   error analysis, we demonstrate the robustness of our model under a
   variety of input conditions. Our analysis reveals the maximum
   information available to the fly given its physical architecture and the
   mathematics governing the rotation-induced forces at the haltere's end
   knob.}},

   coated substrates shows higher nucleation density and rate and finer
   grain structure than on uncoated substrates. Consequently,
   nanocrystalline diamond thin films can be formed on the CFE coated
   substrates under conventional microcrystalline diamond growth
   conditions. Among the three tested CFE interlayers, diamond has the
   highest nucleation density and rate on W layer and the lowest on Ti

   much higher than those on widely used metal nitride coated WC-Co. (C)

   chain parallel to tube axis to make Fe atom locates on the perpendicular
   of the tube wall through the center of a hexagon by carbon-carbon bonds
   all Fe@(n n) systems including the narrow Fe@(2 2) and Fe@(3 3) systems
   exhibit metallic character and the Fe atom chain maintains its magnetic
   moment Total density of states (DOS) and projected densities of states
   (PDOS) analyses show that the spin polarization and the magnetic moment
   of Fe@(n n) systems come mostly from the Fe atom chain And with
   increasing n and thus tube diameter the difference between the minority
   spin and the majority spin at the Fermi level Increases for the PDOS
   onto Fe atom and thus for the DOS of Fe@(n n) systems This trend is also
   indicated quantitatively by the magnetic moment on Fe atom and spin
   polarization for Fe@(n n) systems The higher magnetic moment and spin

Abstract = {{This paper reports the synthesis, characterization, and thermal
   stability of cation-exchange membranes based on naphthalenic
   copolyimides. To improve the mechanical stability, the membranes were
   cross-linked through the reaction of sulfonic acid groups with hydrogen
   atoms of activated phenyl groups located in neighboring chains using
   appropriate catalysts. The ion-exchange capacity of the membranes is
   higher than 2 meq/(g of dry membrane), and the number of molecules of
   water per ion-exchange group lies in the vicinity of 20. The response of
   the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) to electrical perturbation fields
   in a wide range of frequencies was measured, and the equivalent
   electrical circuit governing the response is discussed. The conductivity
   of the MEAs at 75 degrees C is of the order of 10(-2) S/cm. Hydrogen
   crossover in the membranes was determined by electrochemical
   measurements and the permeability coefficient of the gas in the
   membranes determined. Finally, the single cell exhibits a fair

Abstract = {{The thermal Curtius rearrangement of benzoyl azide in the presence of
   Lewis acids has been studied by DFT (PBE/TZ2P) method The complexation
   of Lewis acids (BF3 AlCl3 SbCl5) with benzoyl azide leads to the
   formation of 1 1 and 1 2 stable complexes with interaction of catalysts
   with O and N atoms of carbonyl azide group The potential energy surfaces
   of the catalytic rearrangement have been calculated for each complex and
   the relation between the complexes and the transition states on
   potential energy surface have been established by IRC calculation The
   energy barriers for catalytic reactions are significantly lower in the
   most cases in comparison with an uncatalyzed reaction The activation
   energy is decreasing in the range of Lewis acids AlCl3 > SbCl5 > BF3 and
   It correlates with the decreasing of Lewis acids strength The Mulliken
   bond population analysis has been done for three compounds RCON3 (R = H
   Me Ph) and for their corn plexes and for all corresponding transition
   states using the B3LYP/6-311G{*} approximation The interaction of Lewis
   acids with carbonyl azide group causes the decreasing of N1=N2 bond
   strength and it helps the thermal Curtius rearrangement to proceed (C)

Title = {{Population- and genome-specific patterns of linkage disequilibrium and
   SNP variation in spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are ideally suited
   for the construction of high-resolution genetic maps, studying
   population evolutionary history and performing genome-wide association
   mapping experiments. Here, we used a genome-wide set of 1536 SNPs to
   study linkage disequilibrium (LD) and population structure in a panel of
   478 spring and winter wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum) from 17
   populations across the United States and Mexico.
   Results: Most of the wheat oligo pool assay (OPA) SNPs that were
   polymorphic within the complete set of 478 cultivars were also
   polymorphic in all subpopulations. Higher levels of genetic
   differentiation were observed among wheat lines within populations than
   among populations. A total of nine genetically distinct clusters were
   identified, suggesting that some of the pre-defined populations shared
   significant proportion of genetic ancestry. Estimates of population
   structure (F-ST) at individual loci showed a high level of heterogeneity
   across the genome. In addition, seven genomic regions with elevated FST
   were detected between the spring and winter wheat populations. Some of
   these regions overlapped with previously mapped flowering time QTL.
   Across all populations, the highest extent of significant LD was
   observed in the wheat D-genome, followed by lower LD in the A-and
   B-genomes. The differences in the extent of LD among populations and
   genomes were mostly driven by differences in long-range LD (> 10 cM).
   Conclusions: Genome-and population-specific patterns of genetic
   differentiation and LD were discovered in the populations of wheat
   cultivars from different geographic regions. Our study demonstrated that
   the estimates of population structure between spring and winter wheat
   lines can identify genomic regions harboring candidate genes involved in
   the regulation of growth habit. Variation in LD suggests that breeding
   and selection had a different impact on each wheat genome both within
   and among populations. The higher extent of LD in the wheat D-genome
   versus the A-and B-genomes likely reflects the episodes of recent
   introgression and population bottleneck accompanying the origin of
   hexaploid wheat. The assessment of LD and population structure in this
   assembled panel of diverse lines provides critical information for the
   development of genetic resources for genome-wide association mapping of
   agronomically important traits in wheat.}},

Abstract = {{How to efficiently oxidize H2O to O-2 (H2O -> 1/2O(2) + 2H(+) + 2e(-))
   is a great challenge for electrochemical/photo water splitting owing to
   the high overpotential and catalyst corrosion. Here extensive periodic
   first-principles calculations integrated with modified-Poisson-Boltzmann
   electrostatics are utilized to reveal the physical origin of the high
   overpotential of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on
   RuO2(110). By determining the surface phase diagram, exploring the
   possible reaction channels, and computing the Tafel lines, we are able
   to elucidate some long-standing puzzles on the OER kinetics from the
   atomic level. We show that OER occurs directly on an O-terminated
   surface phase above 1.58 V vs NHE, but indirectly on a OH/O mixed phase
   below 1.58 V by converting first the OH/O mixed phase to the
   O-terminated phase locally. The rate-determining step of OER involves an
   unusual water oxidation reaction following a Eley-Rideal-like mechanism,
   where a water molecule from solution breaks its OH bond over surface Os
   with concurrent new O-OH bond formation. The free energy barrier is 0.74
   eV at 1.58 V, and it decreases linearly with the increase of potential
   above 1.58 V (a slope of 0.56). In contrast, the traditionally regarded
   surface oxygen coupling reaction with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism
   is energetically less favored and its barrier is weakly affected by the
   potential. Fundamentally, we show that the empirical linear barrier
   similar to potential relation is caused by the linear structural
   response of the solvated transition state to the change of potential.
   Finally, the general strategy for finding better OER anode is also
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{To improve science learning, science educators' teaching tools need to
   address two major criteria: teaching practice should mirror our current
   understanding of the learning process; and science teaching should
   reflect scientific practice. We designed a small-group learning (SGL)
   model for a fourth year university neurobiology course using these
   criteria and studied student achievement and attitude in five course
   sections encompassing the transition from individual work-based to SGL
   course design. All students completed daily quizzes/assignments
   involving analysis of scientific data and the development of scientific
   models. Students in individual work-based (Individualistic) sections
   usually worked independently on these assignments, whereas SGL students
   completed assignments in permanent groups of six. SGL students had
   significantly higher final exam grades than Individualistic students.
   The transition to the SGL model was marked by a notable increase in 10th
   percentile exam grade (Individualistic: 47.5\%; Initial SGL: 60\%;
   Refined SGL: 65\%), suggesting SGL enhanced achievement among the least
   prepared students. We also studied student achievement on paired
   quizzes: quizzes were first completed individually and submitted, and
   then completed as a group and submitted. The group quiz grade was higher
   than the individual quiz grade of the highest achiever in each group
   over the term. All students - even term high achievers -could benefit
   from the SGL environment. Additionally, entrance and exit surveys
   demonstrated student attitudes toward SGL were more positive at the end
   of the Refined SGL course. We assert that SGL is uniquely-positioned to
   promote effective learning in the science classroom.}},

Title = {{Oral Methylthioadenosine Administration Attenuates Fibrosis and Chronic
   Liver Disease Progression in Mdr2-/- Mice}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inflammation and fibrogenesis are directly related to
   chronic liver disease progression, including hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC) development. Currently there are few therapeutic options available
   to inhibit liver fibrosis. We have evaluated the hepatoprotective and
   anti-fibrotic potential of orally-administered 59-methylthioadenosine
   (MTA) in Mdr2(-/-) mice, a clinically relevant model of sclerosing
   cholangitis and spontaneous biliary fibrosis, followed at later stages
   by HCC development.
   Methodology: MTA was administered daily by gavage to wild type and
   Mdr2(-/-) mice for three weeks. MTA anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic
   effects and potential mechanisms of action were examined in the liver of
   Mdr2(-/-) mice with ongoing fibrogenesis and in cultured liver
   fibrogenic cells (myofibroblasts).
   Principal Findings: MTA treatment reduced hepatomegaly and liver injury.
   alpha-Smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity and collagen deposition were
   also significantly decreased. Inflammatory infiltrate, the expression of
   the cytokines IL6 and Mcp-1, pro-fibrogenic factors like TGF beta 2 and
   tenascin-C, as well as pro-fibrogenic intracellular signalling pathways
   were reduced by MTA in vivo. MTA inhibited the activation and
   proliferation of isolated myofibroblasts and down-regulated cyclin D1
   gene expression at the transcriptional level. The expression of JunD, a
   key transcription factor in liver fibrogenesis, was also reduced by MTA
   in activated myofibroblasts.
   Conclusions/Significance: Oral MTA administration was well tolerated and
   proved its efficacy in reducing liver inflammation and fibrosis. MTA may
   have multiple molecular and cellular targets. These include the
   inhibition of inflammatory and profibrogenic cytokines, as well as the
   attenuation of myofibroblast activation and proliferation.
   Downregulation of JunD and cyclin D1 expression in myofibroblasts may be
   important regarding the mechanism of action of MTA. This compound could
   be a good candidate to be tested for the treatment of (biliary) liver
   fibrosis.}},

   insults vanes greatly Among cells that survive a pathological insult,
   for example ischemia or brain trauma, some may undergo morphological
   and/or biochemical changes that may compromise brain function The
   present study is a follow up of our previous studies that investigated
   the effect of glutamate induced excitotoxicity on the GABA synthesizing
   enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65/67)'s expression in surviving
   DIV 11 cortical GABAergic neurons in vitro {[}Monnerie and Le Roux,
   (2007) Exp Neurol 205 367-382, (2008) Exp Neurol 213 145-153] An N
   methyl-D aspartate receptor (NMDAR) mediated decrease in GAD expression
   was found following glutamate exposure Here we examined which NMDAR
   subtype(s) mediated the glutamate-induced change in GAD protein levels
   Western blotting techniques on cortical neuron cultures showed that
   glutamate's effect on GAD proteins was not altered by NR2B-containing
   diheteromeric (NR1/NR2B) receptor blockade By contrast, blockade of
   triheteromeric (NR1/NR2A/NR2B) receptors fully protected against a
   decrease in GAD protein levels following glutamate exposure When
   receptor location on the postsynaptic membrane was examined,
   extrasynaptic NMDAR stimulation was observed to be sufficient to
   decrease GAD protein levels similar to that observed after glutamate
   bath application Blocking diheteromeric receptors prevented glutamate's
   effect on GAD proteins after extrasynaptic NMDAR stimulation Finally,
   NR2B subunit examination with site specific antibodies demonstrated a
   glutamate-induced, calpain mediated alteration in NR2B expression These
   results suggest that glutamate induced excitotoxic NMDAR stimulation in
   cultured GABAergic cortical neurons depends upon subunit composition and
   receptor location (synaptic vs extrasynaptic) on the neuronal membrane
   Biochemical alterations in surviving cortical GABAergic neurons in
   various disease states may contribute to the altered balance between
   excitation and inhibition that is often observed after injury (C) 2010

   the in vivo effects of cilostazol, a type 3 phosphodiesterase inhibitor
   known to activate the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)
   signaling, on neurogenesis in the ipsilateral SVZ and pen infarct area

   heterodimers in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, we observed
   retrovirus-induced RXR alpha-Nurr1 heterodimer interactions with, and
   transactivation of, the TH promoter region in cultured rat embryonic
   neural precursor cells. Interestingly, forced expression of RXR alpha
   with Nurr1 remarkably reduced Nurr1 activity in TH + dopaminergic neuron
   generation and significantly down-regulated TH promoter activity. These
   regulatory activities were altered in both Nurr1(dim-) and RXR
   alpha(dim-) that disrupted dimeric binding, verifying that the Nurr1-RXR
   alpha heterodimer represses TH promoter activity. Therefore, a plausible
   explanation for the inhibitory role of RXR alpha in Nurr1-induced TH
   expression is that RXR alpha differentially affects an inhibitory
   element of the TH promoter. NeuroReport 21: 1162-1166 (C) 2010 Wolters

Abstract = {{Purpose: We investigated the effect of ATP (ATP) encapsulated in
   liposomes (ATP-liposomes) on the level of inflammation and neuronal
   death in the retina induced by ischemia reperfusion (IR).
   Methods: Primary retinal ganglion cells treated with ATP-liposomes,
   empty liposomes, and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) were deprived of
   oxygen and glucose (OGD) for 6 h in vitro, in an anaerobic chamber.
   Plates were assessed for the proportion of necrotic versus apoptotic
   cells and for cell survival 12 h after OGD. For in vivo experiments, we
   induced retinal ischemia by unilateral elevation of intraocular pressure
   for 1 h by direct corneal canulation. Mice were injected with liposomes
   or PBS 24 h before IR, at the time of surgery, and every 24 h until
   sacrifice. Transmission electron microscopic analysis was used to
   identify necrotic and apoptotic cells in ischemic retinas. The changes
   in expression of pro-inflammatory genes 24 h post reperfusion were
   assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR). Corresponding changes in protein abundances were analyzed by
   immunohistochemistry. Cell death was evaluated by direct counting of
   neurons in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of flatmounted retinas 7 days
   post reperfusion.
   Results: Treatment with ATP-liposomes increases retinal ganglion cell
   (RGC) survival and decreases necrotic cell death following OGD.
   Injection of ATP-liposomes markedly decreased necrotic cell death in the
   GCL following retinal ischemia. The ATP-liposome treatment reduced the
   expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including that of interleukin 1
   beta (Il1 beta), interleukin 6 (Il6), tumor necrosis factor (Thf),
   chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (Ccl2), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5
   (Ccl5), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (Cxcl10), intercellular
   adhesion molecule 1 (Icam1), and nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2), in the
   retina 24 h after IR and significantly reduced the GCL neuron death rate
   7 days after reperfusion.
   Conclusions: ATP-liposome treatment of IR-challenged neural tissues
   suppressed necrosis and correlated with a significantly reduced level of
   inflammation and retinal damage.}},

Abstract = {{At the heart of protein-protein interactions are protein-protein
   interfaces where the direct physical interactions occur. By developing
   and applying an efficient structural alignment method, we study the
   structural similarity of representative protein-protein interfaces
   involving interactions between dimers. Even without structural
   similarity between individual monomers that form dimeric complexes,
   similar to 90\% of native interfaces have a close structural neighbor
   with similar backbone C-alpha geometry and interfacial contact pattern.
   About 80\% of the interfaces form a dense network, where any two
   interfaces are structurally related using a transitive set of at most
   seven intermediate interfaces. The degeneracy of interface space is
   largely due to the packing of compact, hydrogen-bonded secondary
   structure elements. This packing generates relatively flat interacting
   surfaces whose geometries are highly degenerate. Comparative study of
   artificial and native interfaces argues that the library of protein
   interfaces is close to complete and comprised of roughly 1,000 distinct
   interface types. In contrast, the number of possible quaternary
   structures of dimers is estimated to be about 10(4) times larger; thus,
   an experimentally determined database of all representative quaternary
   structures is not likely in the near future. Nevertheless, one could in
   principle exploit the completeness of protein interfaces to predict most
   dimeric quaternary structures. Finally, our results provide a structural
   explanation for the prevalence of promiscuous protein interactions. By
   side-chain packing adjustments, we illustrate how multiprotein
   specificity can be attained at a promiscuous interface.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of mesophase separation on the
   crystallization behavior of olefin block copolymers (OBCs) with
   different octene contents, which were synthesized by chain shuttling
   technology Crystallization always occurs simultaneously but
   competitively with mesophase separation in OBCs Because of the reason
   that the crystallization temperature is lower than the mesophase
   separation temperature for the OBCs, the mesophase separation can start
   first, large portions of the crystallizable hard blocks are confined in
   the mesophase-separated domains and could not contribute to the
   formation of radial lamellar stacks In addition, the mesophase
   separation creates a stereo-hindrance effect, crystal lamellae could
   only grow through the interstitial space between the dispersed domains
   As a result, large and compact crystals could not be formed As the
   octene content increased in the sample mesophase separation becomes more
   and more dominant, and the crystal morphology degrades sharply from
   spherulites to fragmentary lamella structures It is found that
   increasing the annealing time during development of the mesophase
   separated structure has a similar effect to increasing the octene
   content in the sample However, all of the OBCs can form nearly the same
   crystalline morphology if the mesophase separation is suppressed, from
   which we can postulate that the nature of crystallization due to the
   crystallizable hard blocks in OBCs should be similar}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and measurements show that Atlantic marine temperatures are
   rising; however, the low temporal resolution of models and restricted
   spatial resolution of measurements (i) mask regional details critical
   for determining the rate and extent of climate variability, and (ii)
   prevent robust determination of climatic impacts on marine ecosystems.
   To address both issues for the North East Atlantic, a fortnightly
   resolution marine climate record from 1353-2006 was constructed for
   shallow inshore waters and compared to changes in marine zooplankton
   abundance. For the first time summer marine temperatures are shown to
   have increased nearly twice as much as winter temperatures since 1353.
   Additional climatic instability began in 1700 characterized by similar
   to 5-65 year climate oscillations that appear to be a recent phenomenon.
   Enhanced summer-specific warming reduced the abundance of the copepod
   Calanus finmarchicus, a key food item of cod, and led to significantly
   lower projected abundances by 2040 than at present. The faster increase
   of summer marine temperatures has implications for climate projections
   and affects abundance, and thus biomass, near the base of the marine
   food web with potentially significant feedback effects for marine food
   security.}},

Abstract = {{The recent experimental fabrication of ultrastable glass films, via

   important questions about the possibility of manipulating the properties

   thermodynamics of amorphous materials. Central to both of these issues
   is the need to establish the essential physics that governs the
   formation of the ultrastable films and their subsequent response. In
   this paper, we demonstrate that a generic model of glassy dynamics can
   account for the formation of ultrastable films, the associated
   enhancement of relaxation rates by a factor of 105, the observation of
   frontlike response to temperature jumps and the temperature dependence
   of the front velocity. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{In the last few years, the development of high order harmonic generation
   sources and free electron lasers delivering ultra-intense and
   ultra-short VUV-XUV pulses has made it possible to study nonlinear
   processes in atoms and molecules on the electronic time scale. The
   theoretical support required by the ongoing experiments comes notably in
   the form of numerical tools intended to solve the time-dependent
   Schrodinger equation. The wavepacket produced in these approaches has a
   multichannel character and its analysis in terms of the observed
   physical channels is a problem in itself. Various solutions have been
   proposed so far, which all suffer from one or another inconvenience,
   ranging from very heavy computational costs to the inability to
   characterize differential cross sections. The purpose of this paper is
   to propose a new, low-cost and complete method of analysis. It consists
   in propagating the Fourier components of the wavepacket with respect to
   the hyper-radius all the way to the genuine asymptotic region where the
   various channels disentangle from each other based on their kinematics.
   We demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of this proposal by
   applying it to two different time-propagation codes in the case of
   one-photon double ionization of helium using short pulses.}},

Title = {{Molecular Basis for the Differences in Lipid and Lipoprotein Binding
   Properties of Human Apolipoproteins E3 and E4}},

Abstract = {{Human apolipoprotein (apo) E4 binds preferentially to very low-density
   lipoproteins (VLDLs), whereas apoE3 binds preferentially to high-density
   lipoproteins (HDLs), resulting in different plasma cholesterol levels
   for the two isoforms. To understand the molecular basis for this effect,
   we engineered the isolated apoE N-terminal domain (residues 1-191) and
   C-terminal domain (residues 192-299) together with a series of variants
   containing deletions in the C-terminal domain and assessed their lipid
   and lipoprotein binding properties. Both isoforms can bind to a
   phospholipid (PL)-stabilized triolein emulsion, and residues 261-299 are
   primarily responsible for this activity. ApoE4 exhibits better lipid
   binding ability than apoE3 as a consequence of a rearrangement involving
   the segment spanning residues 261-272 in the C-terminal domain. The
   strong lipid binding ability of apoE4 coupled with the VLDL particle
   surface being similar to 60\% PL-covered is the basis for its preference
   for binding VLDL rather than HDL. ApoE4 binds much more strongly than
   apoE3 to VLDL but less strongly than apoE3 to HDL3, consistent with apoE
   lipid interactions being relatively unimportant for binding to HDL. The
   preference of apoE3 for binding to HDL3 arises because binding is
   mediated primarily by interaction of the N-terminal helix bundle domain
   with the resident apolipoproteins that cover similar to 80\% of the HDL3
   particle surface. Thus, the selectivity in the binding of apoE3 and
   apoE4 to HDL3 and VLDL is dependent upon two factors: (1) the stronger
   lipid binding ability of apoE4 relative to that of apoE3 and (2) the
   differences in the nature of the surfaces of VLDL and HDL3 particles,
   with the former being largely covered with PL and the latter with
   protein.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we use a mathematical model for dengue transmission with
   the aim of analysing and comparing two dengue epidemics that occurred in
   Salvador, Brazil, in 1995-1996 and 2002. Using real data, we obtain the
   force of infection, L, and the basic reproductive number, R(0), for both
   epidemics. We also obtain the time evolution of the effective
   reproduction number, R(t), which results in a very suitable measure to
   compare the patterns of both epidemics. Based on the analysis of the
   behaviour of R(0) and R(t) in relation to the adult mosquito control
   parameter of the model, we show that the control applied only to the
   adult stage of the mosquito population is not sufficient to stop dengue
   transmission, emphasizing the importance of applying the control to the
   aquatic phase of the mosquito.}},

Abstract = {{Intracellular membrane fusion is mediated by the concerted action of
   N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs)
   and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. During fusion, SM proteins bind the
   N-terminal peptide (N-peptide) motif of the SNARE subunit syntaxin, but
   the function of this interaction is unknown. Here, using FRET-based
   biochemical reconstitution and Caenorhabditis elegans genetics, we show
   that the N-peptide of syntaxin-1 recruits the SM protein Munc18-1/nSec1
   to the SNARE bundle, facilitating their assembly into a fusion-competent
   complex. The recruitment is achieved through physical tethering rather
   than allosteric activation of Munc18-1. Consistent with the recruitment
   role, the N-peptide is not spatially constrained along syntaxin-1, and
   it is functional when translocated to another SNARE subunit SNAP-25 or
   even when simply anchored in the target membrane. The N-peptide function
   is restricted to an early initiation stage of the fusion reaction. After
   association, Munc18-1 and the SNARE bundle together drive membrane
   merging without further involving the N-peptide. Thus, the syntaxin
   N-peptide is an initiation factor for the assembly of the SNARE-SM
   membrane fusion complex.}},

Abstract = {{Read-through transcription from the adjacent E1a gene region is required

   early after infection read-through activation). However, whether a
   cellular chromosomal template can support read-through activation is not
   known. To address this issue, read-through activation was evaluated in
   the context of stably expressed templates in transfected cells.
   Inhibition of read-through transcription by insertion of a transcription
   termination sequence between the E1a and E1b promoters reduced
   downstream gene expression from stably integrated templates. The results
   indicate that the mechanism of read-through activation does not depend
   on the structure of early adenovirus nucleoprotein complexes, a
   structure that is likely to be different from that of cellular
   chromatin. Accordingly, this regulatory interaction could participate in
   the coordinated control of the expression of closely linked cellular

   heating in the 1-1 2 GPa range causes a cold crystallization transition
   near 500 K As a result, K increased similar to 15\% whereas the heat
   capacity per unit volume decreased similar to 7\% slowly with time
   during 4 h annealing at similar to 530 K The transformation is
   associated with a significantly increased crystallinity, from similar to
   35\% to 55-60\%, and a pressure-induced preferred orientation and
   increased size for the lamellae of monoclinic a crystalline structure
   This state has 8-10 K higher melting temperature and better formic acid

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide thin films were grown on c-sapphire substrates using pulsed
   laser deposition. Pump power dependence of surface emission spectra,
   acquired using a quadrupled 266 nm laser, revealed room temperature
   stimulated emission (threshold of 900 kW/cm(2)). Time dependent spectral
   analysis plus gain measurements of single-shot, side-emission spectra
   pumped with a nitrogen laser revealed random lasing indicative of the
   presence of self-forming laser cavities. It is suggested that random
   lasing in an epitaxial system rather than a three-dimensional
   configuration of disordered scattering elements was due to waveguiding
   in the film. Waveguiding causes light to be amplified within randomly
   formed closed-loops acting as lasing cavities. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Background. Acute rejection (AR) is associated with worse renal
   allograft outcomes. Therefore, this study investigated single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify genetic variants associated with AR,
   accounting for center variation, in a multicenter, prospective,
   observation study.
   Methods. We enrolled patients from six transplant centers, five in the
   United States and one in Canada. A total of 2724 SNPs were genotyped. We
   accounted for center variation in AR rates by stratifying by transplant
   center and using novel knowledge discovery methods.
   Results. There was significant center variation in AR rates across the
   six transplant sites (P < 0.0001). Accounting for this difference and
   clinical factors independently associated with AR, we identified 15
   novel SNPs associated with AR with stratification by transplant center
   (P < 0.05). We also identified 15 novel SNPs associated with severity of
   tubulitis scores, after adjusting for transplant center and other
   clinical factors independently associated with severity of tubulitis (P
   < 0.05). There was some overlap with one SNP associated with AR and also
   associated with severity of tubulitis, among the top 15 SNPs.
   Conclusion. Center-to-center variation is a major challenge to genomic
   studies focused on AR. The SNPs associated with AR and severity of
   tubulitis in this study will need to be validated in independent cohort
   of kidney transplant recipients.}},

Abstract = {{Background. In immunocompromized patients such as kidney transplant
   recipients, vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae is recommended
   by national guidelines. Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumonia and
   meningitis and is especially harmful after coinfection with influenza
   virus. The aim of this study was to define whether clinically stable
   kidney transplant recipients produce normal concentrations of antibodies
   after pneumococcal vaccination.
   Methods. Forty-three consecutive patients were immunized with Pneumovax
   23 and antibodies against 14 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides
   (serotypes) were determined before and 4 weeks after vaccination. For
   the first time, a commercially available serotype-specific assay
   (Luminex technology) was used for antibody detection in transplant
   recipients.
   Results. After vaccination, patients displayed a significant increase
   (P<0.0001) in total antibody concentration against these 14 serotypes
   from a median of 12.1 mg/L (range: 2.6-124.0) before vaccination to 51.9
   mg/L (4.0-160.7) 4 weeks after vaccination. In addition, they showed a
   significant increase (P<0.0001) in the number of serotypes recognized
   from a median of 9 (0-13) to 13 (3-14). Antibody responses after
   vaccination were only slightly lower than in a published cohort of
   vaccinated healthy controls (total antibody concentration: 61.5 mg/L
   {[}patients displayed 84\% antibodies of healthy controls]; number of
   serotypes recognized: 14 (3-14), P=0.003 {[}Borgers et al., Clin Immunol
   2010; 134: 198-205]). Spearman analysis indicated that the estimated
   glomerular filtration rate at the time of vaccination was significantly
   (P<0.05) correlated with the increase of antibody concentrations against
   several polysaccharides.
   Conclusions. Kidney transplant recipients can produce almost normal
   concentrations of antibodies against pneumococcal polysaccharides, and
   better renal function may lead to higher levels of protection.}},

Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{Stringent limits on the Myers-Pospelov timelike parameter for photons xi
   < 10(-15) coming from astrophysical tests suggest exploring more general
   preferred backgrounds, such as spacelike and lightlike. We take some
   steps in this direction. We allow the external four vector n
   characterizing the Lorentz symmetry breaking to have arbitrary
   directions in spacetime. We study the consistency for the effective
   field theories in each privileged frame by demanding causality,
   stability, and analyticity. When specializing to a timelike background
   we found runaway solutions leading to causality and unitarity
   violations. We show that the lightlike theory is a higher-derivative
   theory with more degrees of freedom and nonanalytic solutions leading to
   instabilities when interactions are turned on. We demonstrate by
   explicit calculation that both stability and analyticity are preserved
   for the purely spacelike case while microcausality is highly suppressed.
   This new anisotropic model opens the possibility to play a role in the
   search for Planck-scale effects.}},

Abstract = {{We propose lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) as a distinct
   class of materials for organic electronics. In water, the chromonic
   molecules stack on top of each other into elongated aggregates that form
   orientationally ordered phases. The aligned aggregated structure is
   preserved when the material is deposited onto a substrate and dried. The
   dried LCLC films show a strongly anisotropic electric conductivity of
   semiconductor type. The field-effect carrier mobility measured along the
   molecular aggregates in unoptimized films of LCLC V20 is 0.03 cm(2) V-1
   s(-1). Easy processibility, low cost, and high mobility demonstrate the
   potential of LCLCs for microelectronic applications. (C) 2010 American

Pages = {{1787-1794}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Late Quaternary stratigraphy, geomorphology and sedimentation in the
   Bengal Delta and the Damodar fan-delta have partly controlled
   groundwater arsenic contamination. The arsenic pollution is extensive at
   shallow depth in the low-land organic-rich Holocene sediments
   characterizing the southern parts of the Bengal Delta. The upland
   terraces within the Bengal Delta, mainly made up of the Pleistocene
   sediments topped by an oxidized impervious zone, are free of arsenic
   problem. These uplands extend as regionally persistent palaeo-interfluve
   areas dissected by Holocene sediment filled palaeochannels. The
   groundwater in palaeochannels is polluted in absence of protection by
   the impervious Pleistocene cover. The arsenic contamination in the
   Bengal Basin is geogenic and sourced mainly from the Himalaya. The
   Gondwana coal and minor sulphide occurrences from the Peninsular India
   might be sources for arsenic pollution in the Damodar fan-delta. No
   arsenic mineral is present in arsenic contaminated alluvial aquifer;
   instead arsenic occurs adsorbed on hydrated ferric oxide (HFO), which
   generally coat elastic grains. Arsenic is released to the groundwater
   mainly by bio-mediated reductive dissolution of HFO with corresponding
   oxidation of organic matter. Arsenic often remains locked in alluvium
   and not released to groundwater. Therefore, the release process is more
   important factor causing arsenic pollution rather than source.}},

   medium, self-gravity, star-formation, and supernovae feedback, the
   clumpy morphology, as well as the large-scale features, in observed l-v
   diagrams were naturally reproduced. We identified in our l-v diagrams
   with a number of not only large-scale peculiar features, such as the
   `3-kpc arm', `135-km s(-1) arm', and `Connecting arm', but also clumpy
   features, such as `Bania clumps', and then linked these features in a
   face-on view of our model. We give suggestions on the real structure of
   the Milky Way and on the fate of gas clumps in the central region.}},

Abstract = {{The radially expanding plasma plume generated in a Hot Refractory Anode
   Vacuum Arc was used to deposit thin Al and Zn films on glass substrates.
   The electrode separation was 10 mm, arc time varied up to 165 s, and
   current (I) was 100-225 A. The cathode was a water-cooled Al or Zn
   cylinder. A graphite anode with 9 or 30 mm height was used with the Al
   cathode, and 10 or 30 mm height Mo anode was used with the Zn cathode. A
   mechanical shutter controlled the substrate exposure onset and duration
   (15 s) to the anodic plasma. The distance from the arc axis to the
   substrate (L) was varied between 80 and 165 mm. The film thickness was
   measured with a profilometer, and macroparticle (MP) presence on the
   coating surface was examined by optical microscopy.
   It was found that the deposition rate increased as a function of time to
   a peak, and then decreased to a steady-state value. The peak occurred
   sooner using the 9 mm anode than with the 30 mm anode. The peak
   deposition rate increased and the peak time decreased with I. The
   steady-state deposition rate was larger for Zn (similar to 2 mu m/min)
   than for Al cathodes (similar to 1 mu m/min) at I = 225 A and L = 110
   mm. The arc voltage for Al was similar to 20-22 V and for Zn it was 11
   V. The deposition rate peak appeared due to MPs evaporating from the hot
   anode, where they had initially condensed during the conventional arc
   stage when the anode was still cold. This effect was significant with
   low melting temperature Al and Zn cathodes, and negligible with Cu and
   Ti cathodes studied previously. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{NiCoCrAlY alloys, commonly used as the bond coat layer in thermal
   barrier coatings, have been widely studied through experimentation. It
   is generally agreed that the major phases in the NiCoCrAlY are
   gamma-Ni(Co,Cr) matrix and beta-NiAl, with occasional presence of
   gamma'-Ni3Al, (Co, Cr)-rich sigma, and/or alpha-Cr precipitates,
   depending on the chemical composition and the temperature. It is noted,
   however, that the chemical compositions of the NiCoCrAlY alloys vary
   from one study to another. The present work reviews the literature on
   the experimental descriptions of the phases present in NiCoCrAlY and the
   corresponding phase transformations. To complement this literature
   review and, more importantly, to allow for consideration of alloy
   compositions not yet studied experimentally, equilibrium phases within
   the NiCoCrAl quaternary system are investigated in terms of the change
   in phase fractions as a function of temperature, isotherms at elevated
   temperatures (700-1100 degrees C) with a wide and continuous variation
   in composition (Co, Cr or Al content), and the phase compositions,
   through computation by Thermo-calc (R). The results are in good general
   agreement with the experimental findings, thus validating the approach.
   The gamma' and the sigma phases are emphasized in the analysis, because
   of their significant contributions to the thermo-mechanical properties
   of the NiCoCrAlY alloys. Results indicate that an increase in Co content
   leads to decreased stability of the gamma' phase in the temperature
   range of 700-1100 degrees C; while appropriate Co additions increase the
   stability of the sigma phase, with the appearance of a four-phase (gamma
   + gamma' + sigma + beta) co-existing region, at temperatures below 1000
   degrees C. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   chemometric procedure. The boric acid was used as a buffer to prevent pH
   changes due to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during
   electrodeposition. The results showed that Co(OH)(2) was formed as a
   parallel reaction to metallic Co formation under some experimental
   conditions. The analysis of the factorial design revealed that
   temperature and {[}CO2+:H3BO3] molar ratio were the critical variables
   that affect the mechanism of cobalt electrodeposition. At high
   temperatures (48 degrees C) and using a 5:1 molar ratio of
   {[}Co2+:H3BO3], the formation of cobalt hydroxide was detected
   simultaneously with cobalt deposition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: New developments in the treatment of lung cancer have
   necessitated the further histologic and cytologic subtyping of nonsmall
   cell lung carcinomas. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) long has
   served as the predominant marker for demonstrating lung origin. However,
   it is also expressed in a variety of other tumors, particularly
   neuroendocrine neoplasms and, to a much lesser degree, squamous cell
   carcinoma of the lung. Napsin-A, which is expressed in lung tissue, is a
   relatively new marker for lung adenocarcinoma. In this study, the
   authors examined the utility of napsin-A compared with TTF-1 in
   cytologic specimens of primary and metastatic, poorly differentiated
   lung adenocarcinomas. METHODS: The archives of the Department of
   Pathology at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were searched for cytologic
   cases of poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma that were
   histologically confirmed. In total, 75 patients (cases) along with 95
   controls were included, each of whom had adequate cell block material
   for TTF-1 and napsin-A staining. Tissue microarrays of lung
   adenocarcinoma also were examined. RESULTS: TTF-1 and napsin-A were
   detected in 61 of 75 cases (81.3\%) and in 49 of 75 cases (65.3\%),
   respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of TTF-1 were 81\% each;
   and napsin-A had a greater specificity of 96\%, and sensitivity of 65\%.
   Napsin-A was not detected in small cell carcinomas or in other
   carcinomas of nonlung origin except for renal cell carcinoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although TTF-1 had a higher sensitivity, napsin-A was
   useful as a surrogate marker when encountering a poorly differentiated
   lung adenocarcinoma or an unknown primary tumor, particularly in
   cytologic specimens and difficult cases. The current results indicate
   that the dual use of both markers may be necessary to improve diagnostic
   accuracy. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol) 2010; 118: 441-9. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine (NE) neoplasms of the lung are a spectrum of
   tumors including typical carcinoid (TC), atypical carcinoid tumor (ACT),
   small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and large cell NE carcinoma (LCNEC).
   Given the overlapping features within these tumors, misclassification is
   a known risk, with significant treatment consequences. METHODS: A search
   of the pathology archives from The Johns Hopkins Hospital yielded 390
   cases of TC diagnosed over 20 years. Sixty-three cytology cases with
   corresponding surgical material were identified. The cytology specimens
   were comprised of 49 cases of lung fine-needle aspiriation specimens and
   14 cases of lung brushings/washings. RESULTS: Among 63 paired cases, 32
   cases (51\%) demonstrated concordant and 31 cases (49\%) demonstrated
   discordant diagnoses. Among discordant cases, the most notable findings
   included overdiagnosis of TC as SCLC (4 cases; 6\%), ACT (4 cases; 6\%),
   and poorly differentiated carcinoma with NE features (5 cases; 8\%) as
   well as misdiagnosis of other lesions as TC (4 cases; 6\%) on cytology.
   CONCLUSIONS: The significant morphologic factors for distinguishing
   low-grade TC from ACT, SCLC, or carcinoma remain the critical evaluation
   of nuclear features, chromatin patterns, and assessment of nucleoli.
   Nuclear molding and crowding are not discernible features because they
   may be found on smears with increased cellularity. Crush artifact can
   occur in both low-grade and high-grade NE neoplasms and may cause a
   misinterpretation of SCLC. Other artifacts resulting from delayed
   fixation or poor processing and sampling error are potential causes of
   incorrect interpretations. Ki-67 staining may be useful in difficult
   cases. Cancer (Cancer Cytopathol) 2010; 118: 457-67. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{The mass transfer mechanisms in columns packed with old (55 mu m Zipax
   and 5 mu m Poroshell) and recently commercialized shell particles (2.7
   mu m Halo-C-18 and Kinetex-C-18) were investigated from a
   physico-chemical point of view. Combining a model of diffusion in
   heterogeneous packed beds (effective medium theory) with values of the
   heights equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETPs derived from the first
   and second central moments of the elution profiles) and of the peak
   variances provided by the peak parking method, we demonstrate that
   columns packed with current shell particles perform better than those
   packed with fully porous particles in resolving low molecular weight
   compounds because the eddy diffusion term of the van Deemter equation of
   the former is markedly smaller. The calculation of eddy diffusion in
   column beds suggests that the smaller A terms are due to smaller
   trans-column velocity bias in columns packed with shell particles. We
   also show that the mass transfer of large molecules (e.g., proteins) is
   faster when the internal volume accessible to the analyte increases.
   Therefore, it is suggested that shell particles made of concentric
   layers with average pore sizes increasing with increasing diameter would
   provide columns with higher efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Silver-ion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to
   atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) is
   used for the regioisomeric analysis of triacylglycerols (TGs). Standard
   mixtures of TG regioisomers are prepared by the randomization reaction
   from 8 mono-acid TG standards (tripalmitin, tristearin, triarachidin,
   triolein, trielaidin, trilinolein, trilinolenin and tri-gammalinolenin).
   In total, 32 different regioisomeric doublets and 11 triplets are
   synthesized, separated by silver-ion HPLC using three serial coupled
   chromatographic columns giving a total length of 75 cm. The retention of
   TGs increases strongly with the double bond (DB) number and slightly for
   regioisomers having more DBs in sn-1/3 positions. DB positional isomers
   (linolenic vs. gamma-linolenic acids) are also separated and their
   reverse retention order in two different mobile phases is demonstrated.
   APCI mass spectra of all separated regioisomers are measured on five
   different mass spectrometers: single quadrupole LC/MSD (Agilent
   Technologies), triple quadrupole API 3000 (AB SCIEX), ion trap Esquire
   3000 (Bruker Daltonics), quadrupole time-of-flight micrOTOF-Q(Bruker
   Daltonics) and LTQ Orbitrap XL(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The effect of
   different types of mass analyzer on the ratio of {[}M+H-RiCOOH](+)
   fragment ions in APCI mass spectra is lower compared to the effect of
   the number of DBs, their position on the acyl chain and the
   regiospecific distribution of acyl chains on the glycerol skeleton.
   Presented data on {[}M+H-RiCOOH](+) ratios measured on five different
   mass analyzers can be used for the direct regioisomeric determination in
   natural and biological samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the verification of simulations performed using
   the finite element method. More specifically, it addresses the
   calculation of strict bounds on the discretization errors affecting
   pointwise outputs of interest which may be non-linear with respect to
   the displacement field. The method is based on classical tools, such as
   the constitutive relation error and extraction techniques associated
   with the solution of an adjoint problem. However, it uses two specific
   and innovative techniques: the enrichment of the adjoint solution using
   a partition of unity method, which enables one to consider truly
   pointwise quantities of interest, and the decomposition of the
   non-linear quantities of interest by means of projection properties in
   order to take into account higher-order terms in establishing the
   bounds. Thus, no linearization is performed and the property that the
   local error bounds are guaranteed is preserved. The effectiveness of the
   approach and the quality of the bounds are illustrated with
   two-dimensional applications in the context of elastic fatigue problems.

Abstract = {{A discrete-element method is developed for applications involving
   interaction of spherical particles with a body of arbitrary shape in an
   electrostatic field. The electric field is induced both by charged
   particles and by other `macroscopic' bodies (e.g. electrodes). The
   electric field due to macroscopic bodies is computed using a
   boundary-element method that accounts for the particle influence. An
   algorithm using approximate particle images is introduced to improve
   electric field resolution for particles lying close to the body surface.
   The long-range electric field induced by particles is computed using an
   optimized, adaptive multipole expansion method. The method is applied to
   the formation of chain-like particle aggregates, with long-range
   particle attraction governed by the electric field and particle adhesion
   by van der Waals forces. The method is illustrated by simulation of the
   capture of uncharged particles on a cylindrical electrode. A local panel
   subdivision method is developed to mitigate particle drift toward panel
   edges induced by panel discretization errors. The particle deposition
   pattern at different cylinder surface charge levels is studied, which
   shows that long straight particle chains are formed under strong
   electric fields. The predicted particle capture efficiency agrees well
   with the experimental data. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LVI-PTV-GC-MS) was optimized for the
   determination of estrone (E1), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethynyl
   estradiol (EE2), mestranol (MeEE2) and estriol (E3) for their
   determination in environmental samples (estuarine water, wastewater,
   fish bile and fish homogenate) after derivatization with 25 mu L (BSTFA
   + 1\%TMCS) and 125 mu L of pyridine. Experimental designs such as
   Plackett-Burman (PBD) and central composite designs (CCDs) were used to
   optimize the LVI-PTV variables (cryo-focusing temperature, vent time,
   vent flow, vent pressure, injection volume, purge flow to split vent,
   splitless time and injection speed). Optimized conditions were as
   follows: 45 mu L of n-hexane extract are injected at 60 degrees C and 6
   mu L/s with a vent flow and a vent pressure of 50 mL/min and 7.7 psi,
   respectively, during 5 min; then the split valve is closed for 1.5 min
   and afterwards the injector is cleaned at 100 mL/min before the next
   injection. The method was applied to the determination of estrogenic
   compounds in environmental samples such as estuarine water, wastewater,
   and fish homogenate and bile. Limits of detection (0.04-0.15 ng/L for
   water samples, 0.04-0.67 ng/g for fish bile and 0.1-7.5 ng for fish
   homogenate) obtained were approx. ten times lower than those obtained by
   means of a common split/splitless inlet. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A station (FAGN) installed on a segment of the fault system that
   generated the April 2009 L'Aquila earthquakes shows larger ground
   motions compared to nearby stations. Spectral ratios using 304
   earthquakes result in a station amplification significantly varying
   event by event in the frequency band 1-8 Hz. The resulting pattern of
   amplitude dependence on causative earthquake location reveals that the
   strongest (up to a factor of 10) amplifications occur for tightly
   clustered aftershocks aligned with the fault dip beneath FAGN thus
   indicating a fault-guided effect. Fault models are investigated in a
   grid-search approach by varying velocity, Q, width and depth of the
   fault zone. Although the problem solution is not unique and there are
   strong trade-offs among the model parameters, constraints from
   observations yield a deep trapping structure model where the most likely
   values of velocity reduction, Q and damage zone width are 25\%, 20, and
   280 m, respectively. Citation: Calderoni, G., A. Rovelli, and R. Di

   2-morpholin-4-yl-1 H-quinolin-4-ones. The 8- and 9-substituents were

Abstract = {{Whether the bend and twist mechanics of DNA molecules are coupled is
   unclear. Here, we report the direct measurement of the resistive torque
   of single DNA molecules to study the effect of ethidium bromide (EtBr)
   intercalation and pulling force on DNA twist mechanics. DNA molecules
   were overwound and unwound using recently developed magnetic tweezers
   where the molecular resistive torque was obtained from Brownian angular
   fluctuations. The effect of EtBr intercalation on the twist stiffness
   was found to be significantly different from the effect on the bend
   persistence length. The twist stiffness of DNA was dramatically reduced
   at low intercalator concentration (<10 nM); however, it did not decrease
   further when the intercalator concentration was increased by 3 orders of
   magnitude. We also determined the dependence of EtBr intercalation on
   the torque applied to DNA. We propose a model for the elasticity of DNA
   base pairs with intercalated EtBr molecules to explain the abrupt
   decrease of twist stiffness at low EtBr concentration. These results
   indicate that the bend and twist stiffnesses of DNA are independent and
   can be differently affected by small-molecule binding.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction centers (RCs) from the photosynthetic bacterium.. Rhodobacter
   (Rb.) sphaeroides R-26 exhibit changes in the recombination kinetics of
   the charge-separated radical-pair state, P.+ Q(A)(.-), composed of the
   dimeric bacteriochlorophyll donor P and the ubiquinone-10 acceptor Q(A),
   depending on whether the RCs are cooled to cryogenic temperatures in the
   dark or under continuous illumination (Kleinfeld et al. Biochemistry
   1984, 23, 5780-5786). Structural changes near redox-active cofactors
   have been postulated to be responsible for these changes in kinetics and
   to occur in the course of light-induced oxidation and reduction of the
   cofactors thereby assuring a high quantum yield. Here we investigated
   such potential light-induced structural changes, associated with the
   formation of P.+ Q(A)(.-), via pulsed electron nuclear double resonance
   (ENDOR) at Q-band (34 GHz) and pulsed electron electron double resonance
   (PELDOR) at W-band (95 GHz). Two types of light excitation have been
   employed for which identical RC samples were prepared: (a) one sample
   was frozen in the dark and then illuminated to generate transient P.+
   Q(A)(.-), and (b) one was frozen under illumination which resulted in
   both trapped and transient P.+ Q(A)(.-) at 80 K. The hyperfine
   interactions between Q(A)(.-) and the protein were found to be the same
   in RCs frozen in the dark as in RCs frozen under illumination.
   Furthermore, these interactions are completely consistent with those
   observed in RC crystals frozen in the dark. Thus, QA remains in its
   binding site with the same position and orientation upon reduction. This
   conclusion is consistent with the result of our orientation-resolving
   PELDOR experiments on transient P.+ Q.; radical pairs. However, these
   findings are incompatible with the recently proposed similar to 60
   degrees reorientation of Q(A) upon its photoreduction, as deduced from
   an analysis of Q-band quantum-beat oscillations (Heinen et al. J. Am.
   Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 15935-15946). Such a large reorientation appears
   improbable, and our objections against this proposition are
   substantiated here in detail. Our results show that Q(A) is initially in
   an orientation that is favorable for its light-driven reduction. This
   diminishes the reorganization requirements for fast electron reduction
   and high quantum efficiency.}},

Title = {{Intrasexual competition facilitates the evolution of alternative mating
   strategies in a colour polymorphic fish}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Intense competition for access to females can lead to males
   exploiting different components of sexual selection, and result in the
   evolution of alternative mating strategies (AMSs). Males of Poecilia
   parae, a colour polymorphic fish, exhibit five distinct phenotypes:
   drab-coloured (immaculata), striped (parae), structural-coloured (blue)
   and carotenoid-based red and yellow morphs. Previous work indicates that
   immaculata males employ a sneaker strategy, whereas the red and yellow
   morphs exploit female preferences for carotenoid-based colours. Mating
   strategies favouring the maintenance of the other morphs remain to be
   determined. Here, we report the role of agonistic male-male interactions
   in influencing female mating preferences and male mating success, and in
   facilitating the evolution of AMSs.
   Results: Our study reveals variation in aggressiveness among P. parae
   morphs during indirect and direct interactions with sexually receptive
   females. Two morphs, parae and yellow, use aggression to enhance their
   mating success (i.e., number of copulations) by 1) directly monopolizing
   access to females, and 2) modifying female preferences after winning
   agonistic encounters. Conversely, we found that the success of the
   drab-coloured immaculata morph, which specializes in a sneak copulation
   strategy, relies in its ability to circumvent both male aggression and
   female choice when facing all but yellow males.
   Conclusions: Strong directional selection is expected to deplete genetic
   variation, yet many species show striking genetically-based
   polymorphisms. Most studies evoke frequency dependent selection to
   explain the persistence of such variation. Consistent with a growing
   body of evidence, our findings suggest that a complex form of balancing
   selection may alternatively explain the evolution and maintenance of
   AMSs in a colour polymorphic fish. In particular, this study
   demonstrates that intrasexual competition results in phenotypically
   distinct males exhibiting clear differences in their levels of
   aggression to exclude potential sexual rivals. By being dominant, the
   more aggressive males are able to circumvent female mating preferences
   for attractive males, whereas another male type incorporates subordinate
   behaviours that allow them to circumvent male aggression and female
   mating preferences. Together, these and previous results indicate that
   exploiting different aspects of social interactions may allow males to
   evolve distinct mating strategies and thus the long term maintenance of
   polymorphisms within populations.}},

Abstract = {{Prolyl-4-hydroxylase is an important nonheme iron-containing dioxygenase
   in humans involved in the regioselective hydroxylation of a proline
   residue in a peptide chain on the C-4 position. In biosystems this
   process is important to create collagen cross-linking and cellular
   responses to hypoxia. We have performed a series of density functional
   theory (DFT) studies into the origin of the regioselectivity of proline
   hydroxylation by P4H enzymes using a minimal active site model (where
   substrate is unhindered in the binding site) and a larger active site
   model that incorporates steric hindrance of the substrate by several
   secondary sphere aromatic residues. Our studies show that
   thermodynamically the most favorable hydrogen atom abstraction position
   of proline is from the C-5 position; hence, the small model gives a low
   reaction barrier and large exothermicity for this process. However,
   stereochemical repulsions of the substrate with aromatic residues of
   Tyr(140) and Trp(243) in the second coordination sphere prevent C-5
   hydroxylation and make C-4 hydroxylation the dominant mechanism, despite
   a lesser driving force for the reaction. These studies explain the
   remarkable regioselectivity of proline hydroxylation by P4H enzymes and
   show that the regioselectivity is kinetically controlled but not
   thermodynamically. In addition, we calculated spectroscopic parameters
   and found good agreement with experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the tissue iron overload and anemia previously
   reported in a human patient and mice that lack heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
   we studied iron distribution and pathology in HO-1(Hmox1)(-/-) mice. We
   found that resident splenic and liver macrophages were mostly absent in
   HO-1(-/-) mice. Erythrophagocytosis caused the death of HO-1(-/-)
   macrophages in in vitro experiments, supporting the hypothesis that
   HO-1(-/-) macrophages died of exposure to heme released on
   erythrophagocytosis. Rupture of HO-1(-/-) macro-phages in vivo and
   release of nonmetabolized heme probably caused tissue inflammation. In
   the spleen, initial splenic enlargement progressed to red pulp fibrosis,
   atrophy, and functional hyposplenism in older mice, recapitulating the
   asplenia of an HO-1-deficient patient. We postulate that the failure of
   tissue macrophages to remove senescent erythrocytes led to intravascular
   hemolysis and increased expression of the heme and hemoglobin scavenger
   proteins, hemopexin and haptoglobin. Lack of macro-phages expressing the
   haptoglobin receptor, CD163, diminished the ability of haptoglobin to
   neutralize circulating hemoglobin, and iron overload occurred in kidney
   proximal tubules, which were able to catabolize heme with HO-2. Thus, in
   HO-1(-/-) mammals, the reduced function and viability of
   erythrophagocytosing macrophages are the main causes of tissue damage

Title = {{Incidence of anogenital warts in Germany: a population-based cohort
   study}},
Journal = {{BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11 account for 90
   percent of anogenital warts (AGW). Assessment of a potential reduction
   of the incidence of AGW following introduction of HPV vaccines requires
   population-based incidence rates. The aim of this study was to estimate
   incidence rates of AGW in Germany, stratified by age, sex, and region.
   Additionally, the medical practitioner (gynaecologist, dermatologist,
   urologist etc.) who made the initial diagnosis of AGW was assessed.
   Methods: Retrospective cohort study in a population aged 10 to 79 years
   in a population-based healthcare insurance database. The database
   included more than 14 million insurance members from all over Germany
   during the years 2004-2006. A case of AGW was considered incident if a
   disease-free period of twelve months preceded the diagnosis. To assess
   regional variation, analyses were performed by federal state.
   Results: The estimated incidence rate was 169.5/100,000 person-years for
   the German population aged 10 to 79 years. Most cases occurred in the 15
   to 40 years age group. The incidence rate was higher and showed a peak
   at younger ages in females than in males. The highest incidence rates
   for both sexes were observed in the city-states Berlin, Hamburg and
   Bremen. In females, initial diagnosis of AGW was most frequently made by
   a gynaecologist (71.7\%), whereas in males, AGW were most frequently
   diagnosed by a dermatologist (44.8\%) or urologist (25.1\%).
   Conclusions: Incidence of AGW in Germany is comparable with findings for
   other countries. As expected, most cases occurred in the younger age
   groups. The frequency of diagnoses of AGW differs between sexes and
   women and men receive treatment by doctors of different specialties.}},

Abstract = {{Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp), a common cause of pneumonia, is associated
   with asthma; however, the mechanisms underlying this association remain
   unclear. We investigated the cellular immune response to Mp in mice.
   Intranasal inoculation with Mp elicited infiltration of the lungs with
   neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. Systemic depletion of
   macrophages, but not neutrophils, resulted in impaired clearance of Mp
   from the lungs. Accumulation and activation of macrophages were
   decreased in the lungs of MyD88(-/-) mice and clearance of Mp was
   impaired, indicating that MyD88 is a key signaling protein in the
   anti-Mp response. MyD88-dependent signaling was also required for the
   Mp-induced activation of NFkB, which was essential for macrophages to
   eliminate the microbe in vitro. Thus, MyD88-NF kappa B signaling in
   macrophages is essential for clearance of Mp from the lungs.}},

Title = {{Size Matters: Large Objects Capture Attention in Visual Search}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Can objects or events ever capture one's attention in a purely
   stimulus-driven manner? A recent review of the literature set out the
   criteria required to find stimulus-driven attentional capture
   independent of goal-directed influences, and concluded that no published
   study has satisfied that criteria. Here visual search experiments
   assessed whether an irrelevantly large object can capture attention.
   Capture of attention by this static visual feature was found. The
   results suggest that a large object can indeed capture attention in a
   stimulus-driven manner and independent of displaywide features of the
   task that might encourage a goal-directed bias for large items. It is
   concluded that these results are either consistent with the
   stimulus-driven criteria published previously or alternatively
   consistent with a flexible, goal-directed mechanism of saliency
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{A coarse-grained model of the action of a chaperonin cage of tunable
   hydrophobicity, h, upon a protein with the possibility of misfolding is
   studied with inherent structure (IS) analysis and statistical
   temperature molecular dynamics (STMD) simulation. Near the folding
   temperature, the equilibrium properties of the system may be understood
   in terms of <10 IS. The known phenomenon of an optimal cage
   hydrophobicity for productive folding, found at h = 0.25, is seen to
   arise from a striking suppression of the occupations of IS in the
   misfolding funnel, which in turn arises from a decrease in translational
   entropy due to confinement to the region of the cage wall. The kinetics
   of folding is correspondingly fastest at h = 0.25, where a minimum is
   found in the h-dependent barrier height. While true kinetics is
   determined by conventional MD, it is shown that the accelerated dynamics
   of STMD provide a valuable quantitative perspective.}},

   different forecasting tools are compared. During equinox, 1 day
   persistence information improves the forecast over climatology alone for
   most solar flux and geomagnetic activity conditions, with a significant
   improvement during periods at low solar flux. December solstice ESF
   observations show a high correlation with the lunar phase, with periods
   close to the full Moon presenting the highest probability of ESF
   occurrence. Using this information for geomagnetically quiet periods
   during December solstice, we further improve the forecast over the

   ESF, however, climatology still gives the best forecasting results.}},

Abstract = {{We study the routing of quantum information in parallel on
   multidimensional networks of tunable qubits and oscillators. These
   theoretical models are inspired by recent experiments in superconducting
   circuits. We show that perfect parallel state transfer is possible for
   certain networks of harmonic oscillator modes. We extend this to the
   distribution of entanglement between every pair of nodes in the network,
   finding that the routing efficiency of hypercube networks is optimal and
   robust in the presence of dissipation and finite bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{An improved ex situ presulfurization (EPRES) technique is developed for
   transforming metal oxides of hydrotreating catalyst to the corresponding
   metal oxy-sulfides/sulfides. The process involves preliminarily
   dispersing an organo-nitrogen substance onto the oxide catalyst,
   introducing elemental sulfur together with an organic solvent, and a
   subsequent multi-step heat treatment. The physicochemical properties of
   the obtained EPRES catalyst with respect to the in situ presulfurization
   (IPRES) counterpart are studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission
   electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and
   high pressure differential thermal analysis (HPDTA). XRD analysis
   indicates that the organo-nitrogen substance facilitates metal
   oxy-sulfide to disperse uniformly on gamma-Al(2)O(3) and the resulting
   metal oxy-sulfide species turn to be rather structurally amorphous. XPS
   together with TEM investigations reveal that higher content of active
   surface NiMoS/MoS(2) species, less metallic Ni fraction, and uniformly
   dispersed surface S species are the features of EPRES catalyst, well
   correlated with its higher catalytic activity. HPDTA study indicates
   that the concentrative exothermic effect can be effectively minimized by
   adopting mixed sulfurizing agents and appropriate introducing manner.
   The degree of sulfurization can also be obviously enhanced by tuning
   thermo-treatment. The EPRES process can considerably shorten the
   start-up procedure in pilot plant test and a wide range of commercial
   practices, exhibiting its economical advantage and low environmental
   impact. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The application of evolutionary theory to understanding the origins of
   our species' capacities for social learning has generated key insights
   into cultural evolution. By focusing on how our psychology has evolved
   to adaptively extract beliefs and practices by observing others,
   theorists have hypothesized how social learning can, over generations,
   give rise to culturally evolved adaptations. While much field research
   documents the subtle ways in which culturally transmitted beliefs and
   practices adapt people to their local environments, and much
   experimental work reveals the predicted patterns of social learning,
   little research connects real-world adaptive cultural traits to the
   patterns of transmission predicted by these theories. Addressing this
   gap, we show how food taboos for pregnant and lactating women in Fiji
   selectively target the most toxic marine species, effectively reducing a
   woman's chances of fish poisoning by 30 per cent during pregnancy and 60
   per cent during breastfeeding. We further analyse how these taboos are
   transmitted, showing support for cultural evolutionary models that
   combine familial transmission with selective learning from locally
   prestigious individuals. In addition, we explore how particular aspects
   of human cognitive processes increase the frequency of some non-adaptive
   taboos. This case demonstrates how evolutionary theory can be deployed
   to explain both adaptive and non-adaptive behavioural patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Betanodaviruses, the causative agents of viral nervous necrosis (VNN)
   disease, cause significant production losses in aquaculture worldwide.
   To improve the detection of betanodavirus, methods of extraction of the
   virus and its RNA from the tissues of sub-clinically infected barramundi
   (Lates calcarifer) and Australian bass (Macquaria novemaculeata) were
   evaluated. Compared to crude manual processing, the yield of
   betanodavirus was increased by 3.5-fold when tissues were disrupted by
   micro-bead beating and 2-fold using an optimised manual pestle grinding
   method (p<0.01). Both of these methods produced a tissue homogenate
   which was compatible with virus isolation in SSN-1 cells. The quantity
   of betanodavirus detected was at least 5.6 times higher when nucleic
   acids were purified using an automated magnetic particle method compared
   to two commonly used silica-adsorption spin column products (p<0.01).
   When used together, tissue disruption by micro-bead beating and nucleic
   acid purification using a magnetic particle processor was predicted to
   result in a 15-fold increase in yield of virus from tissues, and
   increased the speed of sample preparation 10-fold compared to the use of
   manual tissue grinding and a silica-adsorption spin column. The
   mechanised and automated methods required less manual handling of
   samples, which may reduce the potential for false positive and false
   negative results arising through sample cross contamination, degradation
   and operator error. High-throughput preparation of tissue samples and
   detection of betanodavirus with greater sensitivity will enable improved
   control of VNN in aquaculture. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Horizontal Gene Transfer of a ColV Plasmid Has Resulted in a Dominant

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Salmonella enterica continues to be a significant cause of foodborne
   gastrointestinal illness in humans. A wide variety of Salmonella
   serovars have been isolated from production birds and from retail
   poultry meat. Recently, though, S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar
   Kentucky has emerged as one of the prominent Salmonella serovars
   isolated from broiler chickens. Recent work suggests that its emergence
   apparently coincides with its acquisition of a ColV virulence plasmid.
   In the present study, we examined 902 Salmonella isolates belonging to
   59 different serovars for the presence of this plasmid. Of the serovars
   examined, the ColV plasmid was found only among isolates belonging to
   the serovars Kentucky (72.9\%), Typhimurium (15.0\%) and Heidelberg
   (1.7\%). We demonstrated that a single PFGE clonal type of S. Kentucky
   harbors this plasmid, and acquisition of this plasmid by S. Kentucky
   significantly increased its ability to colonize the chicken cecum and
   cause extraintestinal disease. Comparison of the completed sequences of
   three ColV plasmids from S. Kentucky isolated from different
   geographical locales, timepoints and sources revealed a nearly identical
   genetic structure with few single nucleotide changes or
   insertions/deletions. Overall, it appears that the ColV plasmid was
   recently acquired by a single clonal type S. Kentucky and confers to its
   host enhanced colonization and fitness capabilities. Thus, the potential
   for horizontal gene transfer of virulence and fitness factors to
   Salmonella from other enteric bacteria exists in poultry, representing a
   potential human health hazard.}},

Abstract = {{Professionalism may not be sufficient to drive the profound and
   far-reaching changes needed in the US health care system, but without
   it, the health care enterprise is lost. Formal statements defining
   professionalism have been abstract and principle based, without a clear
   description of what professional behaviors look like in practice. This
   article proposes a behavioral and systems view of professionalism that
   provides a practical approach for physicians and the organizations in
   which they work. A more behaviorally oriented definition makes the
   pursuit of professionalism in daily practice more accessible and
   attainable. Professionalism needs to evolve from being conceptualized as
   an innate character trait or virtue to sophisticated competencies that
   can and must be taught and refined over a lifetime of practice.
   Furthermore, professional behaviors are profoundly influenced by the
   organizational and environmental context of contemporary medical

Abstract = {{The effects of molecular weight and concentration of plasticizer on
   physicochemical properties and stability of shellac films were
   investigated. Type of plasticizer was previously reported to have some
   effects on the stability of shellac films, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   was the plasticizer of choice for plasticizing shellac films. In this
   study, different molecular weights of PEG (200, 400 and 4000) were
   chosen at a concentration of 10\% w/w of shellac films. Shellac in
   alcohol was prepared in a free film. The stability of shellac film was
   then performed at 75\% RH, 40 degrees C for 3 months. The comparison was
   made between the film with and without plasticizer. Shellac films were
   then determined for acid value, insoluble solid, mechanical properties
   and water vapor permeability coefficient. It was reported that different
   molecular weights of PEG had some influence on physicochemical
   properties of the shellac films. Among different molecular weights of
   PEG, PEG 400 showed a suitable molecular weight that could protect the
   shellac chain at the carboxylic and hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the
   molecular weight of plasticizer played a crucial role for the protective
   ability at active sites. Further study was performed to investigate the
   effect of concentrations of PEG 400 on the stability. The results
   demonstrated that PEG 400 at a concentration of 10\% (w/w) could prevent
   the polymerization process for only 4 months and a significant change of
   all parameters was then reported. However, a higher concentration, 20\%
   (w/w) of PEG 400, could prolong the stability of shellac for 6 months of
   study. Therefore, the drawback of shellac as a natural polymer in
   pharmaceutical and food industries could be tackled by the appropriate
   size and concentration of plasticizer.}},

Abstract = {{The butter flavorant diacetyl (2,3-butanedione) is implicated in causing

   diacetyl modifies arginine residues, an immunological basis for its

   N-alpha-acetylarginine (AcArg) were determined as a model for hapten
   formation, with characterization by mass spectrometry, NMR, and HPLC
   with UV detection and radiodetection. Four products were identified by
   LC-MS, each with a positive ion of m/z 303 (diacetyl + AcArg); one pair
   displayed an additional ion at m/z 217 (AcArg), the other pair at m/z
   285 (- H(2)O). Their (1)H-(13)C NMR correlation spectra were consistent
   with the addition of one or two of the guanidine nitrogens to form
   aminols. Open-chain pairs interconverted at pH 2, as did the cyclized,
   but all four interconverted at neutral pH. This is the first structural
   characterization of the covalent adducts between diacetyl and an

Title = {{Amyloid-beta Inhibits No-cGMP Signaling in a CD36-and CD47-Dependent
   Manner}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Amyloid-beta interacts with two cell surface receptors, CD36 and CD47,
   through which the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 inhibits
   soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Here we examine whether
   amyloid-beta shares this inhibitory activity. Amyloid-beta inhibited
   both drug and nitric oxide-mediated activation of soluble guanylate
   cyclase in several cell types. Known cGMP-dependent functional responses
   to nitric oxide in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells were
   correspondingly inhibited by amyloid-beta. Functional interaction of
   amyloid-beta with the scavenger receptor CD36 was indicated by
   inhibition of free fatty acid uptake via this receptor. Both soluble
   oligomer and fibrillar forms of amyloid-beta were active. In contrast,
   amyloid-beta did not compete with the known ligand SIRP alpha for
   binding to CD47. However, both receptors were necessary for amyloid-beta
   to inhibit cGMP accumulation. These data suggest that amyloid-beta
   interaction with CD36 induces a CD47-dependent signal that inhibits
   soluble guanylate cyclase activation. Combined with the pleiotropic
   effects of inhibiting free fatty acid transport via CD36, these data
   provides a molecular mechanism through which amyloid-beta can contribute
   to the nitric oxide signaling deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's
   disease.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{We present recent results obtained using angle-resolved photoemission
   spectroscopy performed on 1T-TiSe2. Emphasis is put on the peculiarity
   of the bandstructure of TiSe2 compared to other transition metal
   dichalcogenides, which suggests that this system is an excellent
   candidate for the realization of the excitonic insulator phase. This
   exotic phase is discussed in relation to the BCS theory, and its
   spectroscopic signature is computed via a model adapted to the
   particular bandstructure of 1T-TiSe2. A comparison between photoemission
   intensity maps calculated with the spectral function derived for this
   model and experimental results is shown, giving strong support for the
   exciton condensate phase as the origin of the charge density wave
   transition observed in 1T-TiSe2. The temperature-dependent order
   parameter characterizing the exciton condensate phase is discussed, both
   on a theoretical and an experimental basis, as well as the chemical
   potential shift occurring in this system. Finally, the transport
   properties of 1T-TiSe2 are analyzed in the light of the photoemission
   results.}},

Abstract = {{A strain of human CD3 epsilon transgenic mice, tg epsilon 26, exhibits

   integration site in tge26 mice. We found that multiple copies of the
   human CD3 epsilon transgene are inserted between the Sstr5 and Metrn
   loci on chromosome 17, and that this is accompanied by duplication of
   the neighboring genomic region spanning 323 kb. However, none of the

Abstract = {{A simple technique is described for isolating DNA from individual
   embryos or nauplii of the Black Tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. The
   protocol used a commercial prepGEM (TM) insect DNA extraction kit in
   combination with water bath ultrasonic disruption. DNA quality and
   yields were sufficient for multiplex PCR discrimination of up to six DNA
   microsatellites in a single test. The utility of the method was
   demonstrated in defining the parentage of 1279 embryos (7 h old) spawned
   from 21 females and 684 newly-hatched N1 to N2 nauplii spawned from 12
   females each inseminated artificially with the spermatophores of two
   different males. Overall, parentage assignments based on the six
   microsatellite markers were deduced to be 89.5 +/- 6.7\% and 93.0 +/-
   4.4\% effective using DNA isolated from individual embryos and nauplii,
   respectively. The technique is simple, cost-effective and should provide
   a robust means of isolating DNA from individual embryos and nauplii of
   aquatic invertebrates suitable for PCR-based genotyping. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{After incubation of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) with microbial
   transglutaminase (mTG) under high pressure (400-600 MPa for 30 min at 40
   degrees C), the formation of HEWL oligomers was observed via SDS
   electrophoresis. At atmospheric pressure, HEWL represents no substrate
   for mTG. Likewise, enzymatic treatment following a pretreatment with
   high pressure did not lead to oligomerization. Reactive amino acid side
   chains were identified by peptide mapping after tryptic digestion using
   RP-HPLC with ESI-TOF-MS. Isopeptide-containing peptide fragments were
   found only in HEWL samples simultaneously treated with enzyme and
   pressure. It was found that mTG exclusively cross-links HEWL under high
   pressure by formation of an isopeptide between lysine at position 1 and
   glutamine at position 121 in the peptide chain. Therefore, a
   pressure-induced partial and reversible unfolding of the protein with
   exposure of lysine and glutamine side chains has to occur, resulting in
   a site-directed oligomerization of HEWL by mTG. The enzymatic
   modification of HEWL by mTG under high pressure offers interesting
   perspectives for further functionalization reactions.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of starvation and re-feeding on compensatory growth, body
   composition, metabolism and energy budget were examined in juvenile
   tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis, at 22 degrees C for 64 days. Fish
   were divided into six groups including control group (continuously fed
   ad libitum group, C), starvation group (SO) and other four groups with
   food deprivation for 4 days (51), 8 days (S2), 16 days (S3) and 32 days
   (S4), respectively. Fish in S1, S2, S3 and S4 resumed feeding after the
   corresponding starvation period. At the end of the experiment, the
   weight of Si fish was highest but not significantly different with that
   of the control fish (P>0.05), indicating complete compensatory growth
   occurred. Although the specific growth rate in S2, S3 and S4 fish was
   greater than that in the control fish after re-feeding, S2, S3 and S4
   fish did not reach the same body weight of the control fish at the end.
   Food conversion efficiency of tongue sole was significantly higher in S1
   than that in the control fish (P<0.05). The feeding rate and apparent
   digestion in 52, S3 and S4 fish were significantly higher than those in
   the control fish, while no significant difference was found between Si
   and the control fish. There was no significant difference among Si, 52
   and C in the content of moisture, lipid, protein, ash and energy
   (P>0.05) at the end of the experiment. Upon re-feeding, metabolic rates
   of juvenile tongue sole increased rapidly except a time lag in nitrogen
   excretion for the fish starved for 32 days, and the peaks of these
   increases were directly proportional to the length of the starvation
   period. Estimated to energy budget during the period of the experiment,
   S1 fish exhibited significantly higher proportion of food energy
   assimilated in growth and lower proportion consumed for respiration than
   the control fish (P<0.05). Based on the results of the present study,
   the underlying mechanisms for complete compensatory growth in juvenile
   tongue sole could be attributed to an improved energetic efficiency
   resulting from reduced metabolic expenditure during the period of
   recovery. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous communication, kinetic beta-deuterium secondary isotope
   effects were reported that support a mechanism for substrate-activated
   turnover of acetylthiocholine by human butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)
   wherein the accumulating reactant state is a tetrahedral intermediate
   (Tormos, J. R.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 14538-14539). In
   this contribution additional isotope effect experiments are described
   with acetyl-labeled acetylthiocholines (CL3COSCH2CH2N+Me3; L = H or D)
   that also support accumulation of the tetrahedral intermediate in
   Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase (DmAChE) catalysis. In
   contrast to the aforementioned BuChE-catalyzed reaction, for this
   reaction the dependence of initial rates on substrate concentration is
   marked by pronounced substrate inhibition at high substrate
   concentrations. Moreover, kinetic beta-deuterium secondary isotope
   effects for turnover of acetylthiocholine depended on substrate
   concentration, and gave the following: (D3)k(cat)/K-m = 0.95 +/- 0.03,
   (D3)k(cat) = 1.12 +/- 0.02 and (D3)beta k(cat) = 0.97 +/- 0.04. The
   inverse isotope effect on k(cat)/K-m is consistent with conversion of
   the sp(2)-hybridized substrate carbonyl in the E + A reactant state into
   a quasi-tetrahedral transition state in the acylation stage of
   catalysis, whereas the markedly normal isotope effect on k(cat) is
   consistent with hybridization change from sp(3) toward sp(2) as the
   reactant state for deacylation is converted into the subsequent
   transition state. Transition states for Drosophila melanogaster
   AChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine were further
   characterized by measuring solvent isotope effects and determining
   proton inventories. These experiments indicated that the transition
   state for rate-determining decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate
   is stabilized by multiple protonic interactions. Finally, a simple model
   is proposed for the contribution that tetrahedral intermediate
   stabilization provides to the catalytic power of acetylcholinesterase.}},

Abstract = {{The Whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias furnieri, is commonly found in the
   estuary of Patos Lagoon, RS, Brazil. Like other cultivated Sciaenidae,
   M. furnieri has potential for aquaculture. However, several
   difficult-to-control ectoparasites have been shown to be serious fish
   culture pests. In this study, the parasite influence on M. furnieri is
   evaluated through examination of the relationship between abundance and
   host parasitism indexes, relative condition factor (Kn), and the
   hepatosomatic (RHS) and gonadosomatic relations (RGS). These indexes are
   qualitative fish welfare indicators. A total of 181 M. furnieri
   specimens were collected from the pre-limnic and estuarine sites of the
   Patos Lagoon. The parasites found were Gauchergasilus euripedesi
   (Copepoda). Myzobdella uruguayensis (Hirudinea). Neomacrovavitrema
   argentinensis and Neopterinotrematoides avaginata (both Monogenoidea).
   The relationship between the parasite abundance and the host indexes was
   verified, but no significant correlation was determined. This result
   suggests that the found parasite levels are tolerable. On the other
   hand, sample area differences affected the occurrence and intensity of
   parasitism, which suggests that the parasites have a preference for
   different salinities. This result suggests that different saline
   conditions could determine when the estuary would be optimal for M.

Abstract = {{We describe the fabrication and characterization of electromagnetic
   micropores. These devices consist of a micropore encompassed by a
   microelectromagnetic trap. Fabrication of the device involves multiple
   photolithographic steps, combined with deep reactive ion etching and
   subsequent insulation steps. When immersed in an electrolyte solution,
   application of a constant potential across the micropore results in an
   ionic current. Energizing the electromagnetic trap surrounding the
   micropore produces regions of high magnetic field gradients in the
   vicinity of the micropore that can direct motion of a ferrofluid onto or
   off of the micropore. This results in dynamic gating of the ion current
   through the micropore structure. In this report, we detail fabrication
   and characterize the electrical and ionic properties of the prepared
   electromagnetic micropores.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) functions as a diffusible transmitter in most tissues
   of the body and exerts its effects by binding to receptors harboring a
   guanylyl cyclase transduction domain, resulting in cGMP accumulation in
   target cells. Despite its widespread importance, very little is known
   about how this signaling pathway operates at physiological NO
   concentrations and in real time. To address these deficiencies, we have
   exploited the properties of a novel cGMP biosensor, named delta-FlincG,
   expressed in cells containing varying mixtures of NO-activated guanylyl
   cyclase and cGMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase activity. Responsiveness
   to NO, signifying a physiologically relevant rise in cGMP to 30 nM or
   more, was seen at concentrations as low as 1 pM, making cells by far the
   most sensitive NO detectors yet encountered. Even cells coexpressing
   phosphodiesterase-5, a cGMP-activated isoform found in many NO target
   cells, responded to NO in concentrations as low as 10 pM. The dynamics
   of NO capture and signal transduction was revealed by administering
   timed puffs of NO from a local pipette. A puff lasting only 100 ms,
   giving a calculated peak intracellular NO concentration of 23 pM, was
   detectable. The results could be encapsulated in a quantitative model of
   cellular NO-cGMP signaling, which recapitulates the NO responsiveness
   reported previously from crude cGMP measurements on native cells, and
   which explains how NO is able to exert physiological effects at
   extremely low concentrations, when only a tiny proportion of its
   receptors would be occupied.}},

Title = {{What induced the exceptional 2005 convection event in the northwestern
   Mediterranean basin? Answers from a modeling study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Open-sea convection occurring in the northwestern Mediterranean basin
   (NWMED) is at the origin of the formation of Western Mediterranean Deep
   Water (WMDW), one of the main Mediterranean water masses. During winter
   2004-2005, a spectacular convection event occurred, observed by several
   experimental oceanographers. It was associated with an exceptionally
   large convection area and unusually warm and salty WMDW. Explanations
   were proposed tentatively, relating the unusual characteristics of this
   event to the Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT) or to the atmospheric
   conditions during winter 2004-2005 in the NWMED. They could, however,
   not be supported until now. Here we used numerical modeling to
   understand what drove this convection event. The control simulation
   performed for the period 1961-2006 reproduces correctly the long-term
   evolution of the Mediterranean Sea circulation, the EMT, and the NWMED
   convection event of 2004-2005. Sensitivity simulations are then
   performed to assess the respective contributions of atmospheric and
   oceanic conditions to this event. The weakness of the winter buoyancy
   loss since 1988 in the NWMED prevented strong convection to occur during
   the 1990s, enabling heat and salt contents to increase in this region.
   This resulted in the change of WMDW characteristics observed in 2005.
   The strong buoyancy loss of winter 2004-2005 was responsible for the
   intensity of the convection observed this winter in terms of depth and
   volume of newly formed WMDW. The EMT did not fundamentally modify the
   convection process but potentially doubled this volume by inducing a
   deepening of the heat and salt maximum that weakened the preconvection
   stratification.}},

Title = {{Ozone diurnal variations in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere, based
   on measurements from SABER on TIMED}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{We report on derived results of global zonal mean ozone diurnal
   variations over 24 h of local solar time, based on satellite
   measurements from SABER on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere
   Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite, with focus on the
   stratosphere and lower mesosphere. On a global scale, results in this
   altitude range are new. We had previously reported on ozone diurnal
   variations, but the focus was at higher altitudes, where the variations
   can be relatively large. In the stratosphere, there can be systematic
   diurnal variations on the order of a few percent, with multiple local
   maxima over a day, and these can exist down to altitudes of similar to
   31 hPa (similar to 24 km) and lower. At these altitudes, photochemistry
   is expected to be less effective, and dynamics (e. g., tides) can be
   more important. The diurnal variations also depend on latitude and
   season. As a function of altitude, for low latitudes at least, the ozone
   diurnal variations show a pattern of local-time phase progression such
   that beginning at similar to 31 hPa the mixing ratios are smaller in the
   afternoon (compared to values at midnight), then (as the altitude
   increases) become mostly larger in the afternoon beginning from similar
   to 10 to 4.6 hPa, revert back to intermediate afternoon values near 2.2,
   1.5 hPa, and again return to lower daytime values at about 1 hPa, with
   this last trend continuing to higher altitudes in the mesosphere. This
   pattern of variation is generally supported by previous results by us
   and by others, based on data from MLS UARS, MLS Aura, rocket-borne, and
   ground-based measurements.}},

   Death Pathways Determines Cell Fate during Mitotic Arrest}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Variability in cell-to-cell behavior within clonal populations can be
   attributed to the inherent stochasticity of biochemical reactions. Most
   single-cell studies have examined variation in behavior due to
   randomness in gene transcription. Here we investigate the mechanism of
   cell fate choice and the origin of cell-to-cell variation during mitotic
   arrest, when transcription is silenced. Prolonged mitotic arrest is
   commonly observed in cells treated with anti-mitotic drugs. Cell fate
   during mitotic arrest is determined by two alternative pathways, one
   promoting cell death, the other promoting cyclin B1 degradation, which
   leads to mitotic slippage and survival. It has been unclear whether
   these pathways are mechanistically coupled or independent. In this study
   we experimentally uncoupled these two pathways using zVAD-fmk to block
   cell death or Cdc20 knockdown to block slippage. We then used time-lapse
   imaging to score the kinetics of single cells adopting the remaining
   fate. We also used kinetic simulation to test whether the behaviors of
   death versus slippage in cell populations where both pathways are active
   can be quantitatively recapitulated by a model that assumes stochastic
   competition between the pathways. Our data are well fit by a model where
   the two pathways are mechanistically independent, and cell fate is
   determined by a stochastic kinetic competition between them that results
   in cell-to-cell variation.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are commonly stabilized through the adsorption of
   acidic/basic polyelectrolytes around the surface of the particle. One
   example of these nanoparticles is poly(ethylenimine) (PEI)-capped Au
   nanoparticles. In this work, we have examined by means of
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of 2,6-dimethylphenylisocyanide
   (2,6-DMPI) how much the surface potential of Au nanoparticles is
   affected by the solution pH through the mediation of the protonation and
   deprotonation of PEI in contact with Au nanoparticles. In fact, the
   surface-potential-dependent isocyanide (NC) stretching peak of 2,6-DMPI
   has shifted sharply around pH 8.5, close to the plc value of the primary
   amine of PEI. When a negatively charged poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) was
   deposited onto the PEI, the peak shift of the NC stretching band took
   place around pH 6.5, close to the average pK(a) value of PEI and PAA.
   When additional PEI was deposited on PAA, the peak shift of the NC
   stretching band occurred once again around pH 8.5, indicative of the
   stronger interaction of upper two polyelectrolyte layers. These data
   clearly illustrate the usefulness of SERS in the elucidation of a
   delicate interaction of cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes,
   especially in layer-by-layer deposition.}},

Journal = {{BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: HLA-DRB1 allele polymorphisms have been reported to be
   associated with hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility, but the results
   of these previous studies have been inconsistent. The purpose of the
   present study was to explore whether specific HLA-DRB1 alleles
   (DRB1{*}07, DRB1{*}12, DRB1{*}15) confer susceptibility to
   hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Methods: Case-control studies on HLA-DRB1 alleles association with HCC
   were searched up to January 2010 through a systematic review of the
   literature. The odds ratios (ORs) of HLA-DRB1 allele distributions in
   patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed against healthy
   controls. The meta-analysis software REVMAN 5.0 was applied for
   investigating heterogeneity among individual studies and for summarizing
   all the studies. Meta-analysis was performed using fixed-effect or
   random-effect methods, depending on absence or presence of significant
   heterogeneity.
   Results: Eight case-control studies were included in the final analysis.
   Among the 3 HLA-DRB1 alleles studied, DRB1{*}07 and DRB1{*}12 were
   significantly associated with the risk of HCC in the whole populations
   (OR = 1.65, 95\% CI: 1.08-2.51, P = 0.02 and OR = 1.59, 95\% CI:
   1.09-2.32, P = 0.02, respectively). No significant association was
   established for DRB1{*}15 allele with HCC in the whole populations.
   Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed that DRB1{*}07, DRB1{*}12 and
   DRB1{*}15 alleles significantly increased the risk of hepatocellular

Abstract = {{Phase transitions in charged topological black holes dressed with a
   scalar field are studied. These black holes are solutions of the
   Einstein-Maxwell theory with a negative cosmological constant and a
   conformally coupled real self-interacting scalar field. Comparing, in
   the grand canonical ensemble, the free energies of the hairy and
   undressed black holes two different phase transitions are found. The
   first of them is one of second-order type and it occurs at a temperature
   defined by the value of the cosmological constant. Below this
   temperature an undressed black hole spontaneously acquires a scalar
   hair. The other phase transition is one of first-order type. The
   corresponding critical temperature, which is bounded from above by the
   one of the previous case, strongly depends on the coupling constant of
   the quartic self-interaction potential, and this transition only appears
   when the coupling constant is less than a certain value. In this case,
   below the critical temperature the undressed black hole is
   thermodynamically favored. However, when the temperature exceeds the
   critical value a hairy black hole is likely to be occur.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforcement, the strengthening of prezygotic reproductive isolation by
   natural selection in response to maladaptive hybridization {[}1-3], is
   one of the few processes in which natural selection directly favors the
   evolution of species as discrete groups (e.g., {[}4-7]). The evolution
   of reproductive barriers via reinforcement is expected to evolve in
   regions where the ranges of two species overlap and hybridize as an
   evolutionary solution to avoiding the costs of maladaptive hybridization
   {[}2,3,3]. The role of reinforcement in speciation has, however, been
   highly controversial because population-genetic theory suggests that the
   process is severely impeded by both hybridization {[}8-11] and migration
   of individuals from outside the contact zone {[}12,13]. To determine
   whether reinforcement could strengthen the reproductive barriers between
   two sister species of Drosophila in the face of these impediments, I
   initiated experimental populations of these two species that allowed
   different degrees of hybridization, as well as migration from outside
   populations. Surprisingly, even in The face of gene flow, reinforcement
   could promote the evolution of reproductive isolation within only five
   generations. As theory predicts, high levels of hybridization (and/or
   strong selection against hybrids) and migration impeded this evolution.
   These results suggest that reinforcement can help complete the process
   of speciation.}},

Title = {{The feasibility of introducing rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in
   drug shops in Uganda}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: National malaria control programmes and international
   agencies are keen to scale-up the use of effective rapid diagnostic
   tests (RDTs) for malaria. The high proportion of the Ugandan population
   seeking care at drug shops makes these outlets attractive as providers
   of malaria RDTs. However, there is no precedent for blood testing at
   drug shops and little is known about how such tests might be perceived
   and used. Understanding use of drug shops by communities in Uganda is
   essential to inform the design of interventions to introduce RDTs.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative study, with 10 community focus group
   discussions, and 18 in-depth interviews with drug shop attendants,
   health workers and district health officials. The formative study was
   carried out in Mukono district, central Uganda an area of high malaria
   endemicity from May-July 2009.
   Results: Drug shops were perceived by the community as important in
   treating malaria and there was awareness among most drug sellers and the
   community that not all febrile illnesses were malaria. The idea of
   introducing RDTs for malaria diagnosis in drug shops was attractive to
   most respondents. It was anticipated that RDTs would improve access to
   effective treatment of malaria, offset high costs associated with poor
   treatment, and avoid irrational drug use. However, communities did
   express fear that drug shops would overprice RDTs, raising the overall
   treatment cost for malaria. Other fears included poor adherence to the
   RDT result, reuse of RDTs leading to infections and fear that RDTs would
   be used to test for human immune deficiency virus (HIV). All drug shops
   visited had no record on patient data and referral of cases to health
   units was noted to be poor.
   Conclusion: These results not only provide useful lessons for
   implementing the intervention study but have wide implications for
   scaling up malaria treatment in drug shops.}},

Abstract = {{The information content of a non-enzymatic self-replicator is limited by
   Eigen s error threshold Presumably enzymatic replication can maintain
   higher complexity but in a competitive environment such i replicator is
   faced with two problems related to its twofold role as enzyme and
   substrate as enzyme it should replicate itself rather than wastefully
   copy non-functional substrates and as substiate it should preferably be
   replicated by superior enzymes instead of less-efficient mutants Because
   specific recognition can enforce these propensities we thoroughly
   analyze an idealized quasispecies model for enzymatic replication with
   replication rates that are either a decreasing (self specific) or
   increasing (cross-specific) function of the Hamming distance between the
   recognition or tag sequences of enzyme and substrate We find that very
   weak self-specificity suffices to localize a population about a master
   sequence and thus to preserve its information while simultaneous
   localization about complementary sequences in the cross-specific case is
   more challenging A surprising result is that stronger specificity
   constraints allow longer recognition sequences because the populations
   are better localized Extrapolating from experimental data we obtain
   rough quantitative estimates for the maximal length of the recognition
   or tag sequence that can be used to reliably discriminate appropriate
   and infeasible enzymes and substrates respectively (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{We report the development of a new templating molecule designed by the
   modification of a helix-forming beta-1,3-glucan polysaccharide to the
   cationic semiartificial one and its application to the fabrication of
   one-dimensional (1D) gold nanostructures by simple photoirradiation.
   Transmission electron microscopy observation showed that Au(III) ions
   are primarily reduced to gold nanoparticles self-assembling into the ID
   array with the aid of the cationic beta-1,3-glucan polysaccharide, which
   gradually fuse into the ID gold nanostructure with the tapelike
   structure. The gold nanotape structure could not be created by neutral
   beta-1,3-glucan polysaccharides or random coil synthetic cationic
   polymers. These findings consistently support the view that Au(III) ions
   are reduced by unmodified OH groups to gold nanoparticles under the
   photoirradiation, which are wrapped in the helical structure of the
   cationic beta-1,3-glucan polysaccharide and eventually fuse into gold
   nanotapes. One may regard, therefore, that this cationic beta-1,3-glucan
   polysaccharide can act as an ``all-in-one{''} template playing three
   roles of reduction, ID arrangement, and fusion of gold nanoparticles. In
   addition, we found an interesting phenomenon that the obtained gold
   nanotapes coated with cationic beta-1,3-glucan polysaccharides show
   unique surface-enhanced Raman scattering for anionic porphyrines
   organized on the surface of gold nanotapes through the electrostatic
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade microfluidics has created a versatile platform that
   has significantly advanced the ways in which micro-scale organisms and
   objects are controlled, processed and investigated, by improving the
   cost, compactness and throughput aspects of analysis. Microfluidics has
   also expanded into optics to create reconfigurable and flexible optical
   devices such as reconfigurable lenses, lasers, waveguides, switches, and
   on-chip microscopes. Here we present a new opto-fluidic microscopy
   modality, i.e., Holographic Opto-fluidic Microscopy (HOM), based on
   lensless holographic imaging. This imaging modality complements the
   miniaturization provided by microfluidics and would allow the
   integration of microscopy into existing on-chip microfluidic devices
   with various functionalities. Our imaging modality utilizes partially
   coherent in-line holography and pixel super-resolution to create
   high-resolution amplitude and phase images of the objects flowing within
   micro-fluidic channels, which we demonstrate by imaging C. elegans,
   Giardia lamblia, and Mulberry pollen. HOM does not involve complicated
   fabrication processes or precise alignment, nor does it require a highly
   uniform flow of objects within microfluidic channels. (C) 2010 Optical

Title = {{Increased plasma soluble endoglin levels as an indicator of
   cardiovascular alterations in hypertensive and diabetic patients}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Endoglin is involved in the regulation of endothelial
   function, but there are no studies concerning its relation with
   hypertension- and diabetes-associated pathologies. Thus, we studied the
   relationship between plasma levels of soluble endoglin and
   cardiovascular alterations associated with hypertension and diabetes.
   Methods: We analyzed 288 patients: 64 with type 2 diabetes, 159 with
   hypertension and 65 healthy patients. We assessed the relationship of
   soluble endoglin plasma levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
   assay with basal glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure,
   endothelial dysfunction (assessed by pressure wave velocity),
   hypertensive retinopathy (by Keith-Wagener classification), left
   ventricular hypertrophy (by Cornell and Sokolow indexes), cardiovascular
   risk and target organ (heart, vascular, kidney) damage.
   Results: There are significant correlations between endoglin and
   glycemia, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, pressure wave
   velocity and electrocardiographically assessed left ventricular
   hypertrophy. Endoglin levels were significantly higher in patients with
   diabetes who had nondipper and extreme dipper circadian blood pressure
   patterns than in dipper circadian patterns, in patients with
   hypertension and diabetes who had riser pattern than in the other
   patients, and in patients with diabetes but not hypertension who had
   extreme dipper pattern than in dipper, nondipper and riser groups. There
   was also a significant correlation between plasma-soluble endoglin and
   lower levels of systolic night-day ratio. Higher endoglin levels were
   found in patients with diabetes who had retinopathy, in patients with
   diabetes who had a high probability of 10-year cardiovascular risk, and
   in patients with diabetes and hypertension who had three or more damaged
   target organs (heart, vessels, kidney) than in those with no organs
   affected.
   Conclusions: This study shows that endoglin is an indicator of
   hypertension-and diabetes-associated vascular pathologies as endothelial
   dysfunction and cardiovascular damage.}},

Journal = {{BMC PEDIATRICS}},

Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: In anticipation of vaccine introduction, we assessed
   epidemiology of rotavirus disease among children visiting medical centre
   due to acute diarrhoea in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
   Methods: Between November 2008 and February 2010, stool specimens from
   447 children less than 5 years of age suffering from diarrhoea were
   tested for the presence of rotavirus by antigen detection using an
   immunochromatographic test. Sociodemographic, environmental and clinical
   factors were assessed during the study.
   Results: Rotavirus antigen was detected in 151 (33.8\%) of the patients.
   Most of the cases (94.2\%) were in children < 24 months of age. Fever
   and vomiting were the symptoms most commonly reported in association
   with rotavirus diarrhoea and the patients were often hospitalized.
   Rotavirus-associated diarrhoea occurred mostly during the season from
   December to April (dry season). Rotavirus infection was significantly
   less frequent in breast-fed than among bottle-fed babies.
   Conclusions: The results of this study underscore the need to control
   rotavirus infections among young children in Burkina Faso and may argue
   a decision on the introduction of rotavirus vaccine in Burkina Faso.}},

Title = {{Towards Universal Structure-Based Prediction of Class II MHC Epitopes
   for Diverse Allotypes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{The binding of peptide fragments of antigens to class II MHC proteins is
   a crucial step in initiating a helper T cell immune response. The
   discovery of these peptide epitopes is important for understanding the
   normal immune response and its misregulation in autoimmunity and
   allergies and also for vaccine design. In spite of their biomedical
   importance, the high diversity of class II MHC proteins combined with
   the large number of possible peptide sequences make comprehensive
   experimental determination of epitopes for all MHC allotypes infeasible.
   Computational methods can address this need by predicting epitopes for a
   particular MHC allotype. We present a structure-based method for
   predicting class II epitopes that combines molecular mechanics docking
   of a fully flexible peptide into the MHC binding cleft followed by
   binding affinity prediction using a machine learning classifier trained
   on interaction energy components calculated from the docking solution.
   Although the primary advantage of structure-based prediction methods
   over the commonly employed sequence-based methods is their applicability
   to essentially any MHC allotype, this has not yet been convincingly
   demonstrated. In order to test the transferability of the prediction
   method to different MHC proteins, we trained the scoring method on
   binding data for DRB1{*}0101 and used it to make predictions for
   multiple MHC allotypes with distinct peptide binding specificities
   including representatives from the other human class II MHC loci, HLA-DP
   and HLA-DQ, as well as for two murine allotypes. The results showed that
   the prediction method was able to achieve significant discrimination
   between epitope and non-epitope peptides for all MHC allotypes examined,
   based on AUC values in the range 0.632-0.821. We also discuss how
   accounting for peptide binding in multiple registers to class II MHC
   largely explains the systematically worse performance of prediction
   methods for class II MHC compared with those for class I MHC based on
   quantitative prediction performance estimates for peptide binding to
   class II MHC in a fixed register.}},

Abstract = {{Cluster randomized controlled trials are increasingly used to evaluate
   medical interventions. Research has found that cluster size variability
   leads to a reduction in the overall effective sample size. Although
   reporting standards of cluster trials have started to evolve, a far
   greater degree of transparency is needed to ensure that robust evidence
   is presented. The use of the numbers of patients recruited to summarize
   recruitment rate should be avoided in favour of an improved metric that
   illustrates cumulative power and accounts for cluster variability. Data
   from four trials is included to show the link between cluster size
   variability and imbalance. Furthermore, using simulations it is
   demonstrated that by randomising using a two block randomization
   strategy and weighting the second by cluster size recruitment, chance

Abstract = {{HSV-2-gD2 DNA vaccine was precisely delivered to immunologically
   sensitive regions of the skin epithelia using dry-coated microprojection
   arrays. These arrays delivered a vaccine payload to the epidermis and
   the upper dermis of mouse skin. Immunomicroscopy results showed that, in
   43 +/- 5\% of microprojection delivery sites, the DNA vaccine was
   delivered to contact with professional antigen presenting cells in the
   epidermal layer. Associated with this efficient delivery of the vaccine
   into the vicinity of the professional antigen presenting cells, we
   achieved superior antibody responses and statistically equal protection
   rate against an HSV-2 virus challenge, when compared with the mice
   immunized with intramuscular injection using needle and syringe, but
   with less than 1/10th of the delivered antigen. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{We have provided theoretical study on the spectral and temporal
   properties of the scattering of pulsed plane wave from a symmetrical
   groove doublet configuration. Based on the numerical calculation
   results, we show that the spectrum and the waveform of the scattered
   field are sensitive to the shape of the rectangular grooves when the
   grooves are deep enough. In both spectral and temporal domain, a damped
   oscillatory behavior occurs when the groove spacing increases.
   Furthermore, the spectral and temporal dependences of the angular
   distribution are consisted of interference-like fringe patterns. These
   patterns are sensitive to the size of the groove width and spacing
   rather than the groove shape when the depth is small enough. Our study
   takes the analysis of pulse scattering by finite grooves a step further
   on the theoretical side, and offers opportunities for the control of
   spectral and temporal properties of pulsed scattered wave in low
   frequency regime such as THz and microwave domain. (C) 2010 Optical

Abstract = {{The adsorption of a range of molecular species (water, pyridine, and
   ammonia) is found to reversibly modulate the conductivity of
   hydrogen-terminated silicon-on-insulator (H-SOI) substrates.
   Simultaneous sheet-resistance and Hall-effect measurements on moderately
   doped (10(15) cm(-3)) n- and p-type H-SOI samples mounted in a vacuum
   system are used to monitor the effect of gas exposure in the Torr range
   on the electrical-transport properties of these substrates. Reversible
   physisorption of ``hole-trapping{''} species, such as pyridine (C5H5N)
   and ammonia (NH3) produces highly conductive minority-carrier channels
   (inversion) on p-type substrates, mimicking the action of a metallic
   gate in a field-effect transistor. The adsorption of these same
   molecules on n-type SOI induces strong electron-accumulation layers.
   Minority/majority channels are also formed upon controlled exposure to
   water vapor. These observations can be explained by a classical
   band-bending model, which considers the adsorbates as the source of a
   uniform surface charge ranging from +10(11) to +10(12)q cm(-2). These
   results demonstrate the utility of DC transport measurements of SOI
   platforms for studies of molecular adsorption and charge-transfer
   effects at semiconductor surfaces.}},

Title = {{The provision of out-of-hours care and associated costs in an urban area
   of Switzerland: a cost description study}},
Journal = {{BMC FAMILY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: In Switzerland, General Practitioners (GPs) play an
   important role for out-of-hours emergency care as one service option
   beside freely accessible and costly emergency departments of hospitals.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the services provided and the
   economic consequences of a Swiss GP out-of-hours service.
   Methods: GPs participating in the out-of-hours service in the city of
   Zurich collected data on medical problems (ICPC coding), mode of
   contact, mode of resource use and services provided (time units;
   diagnostics; treatments). From a health care insurance perspective, we
   assessed the association between total costs and its two components
   (basic costs: charges for time units and emergency surcharge; individual
   costs: charges for clinical examination, diagnostics and treatment in
   the discretion of the GP).
   Results: 125 GPs collected data on 685 patient contacts. The most
   prevalent health problems were of respiratory (24\%), musculoskeletal
   (13\%) and digestive origin (12\%). Home visits (61\%) were the most
   common contact mode, followed by practice (25\%) and telephone contacts
   (14\%). 82\% of patients could be treated by ambulatory care. In 20\% of
   patients additional technical diagnostics, most often laboratory tests,
   were used. The mean total costs for one emergency patient contact were
   (sic)144 (95\%-CI: 137-151). The mode of contact was an important
   determinant of total costs (mean total costs for home visits: (sic)176
   {[}95\%-CI: 168-184]; practice contact: (sic)90 {[}95\%-CI: 84-98];
   telephone contact: (sic)48 {[}95\%-CI: 40-55]). Basic costs contributed
   83\% of total costs for home visits and 70\% of total costs for practice
   contacts. Individual mean costs were similarly low for home visits
   ((sic)30) and practice contacts ((sic)27). Medical problems had no
   relevant influence on this cost pattern.
   Conclusions: GPs managed most emergency demand in their out-of-hours
   service by ambulatory care. They applied little diagnostic testing and
   basic care. Our findings are of relevance for policy makers even from
   other countries with different pricing policies. Policy makers should be

Abstract = {{As a consequence to hypobaric hypoxic exposure skeletal muscle atrophy
   is often reported. The underlying mechanism has been suggested to
   involve a decrease in protein synthesis in order to conserve O-2. With
   the aim to challenge this hypothesis, we applied a primed, constant
   infusion of 1-C-13-leucine in nine healthy male subjects at sea level
   and subsequently at high-altitude (4559 m) after 7-9 days of
   acclimatization. Physical activity levels and food and energy intake
   were controlled prior to the two experimental conditions with the aim to
   standardize these confounding factors. Blood samples and expired breath
   samples were collected hourly during the 4 hour trial and vastus
   lateralis muscle biopsies obtained at 1 and 4 hours after tracer priming
   in the overnight fasted state. Myofibrillar protein synthesis rate was
   doubled; 0.041 +/- 0.018 at sea-level to 0.080 +/- 0.018\%.hr(-1)
   (p<0.05) when acclimatized to high altitude. The sarcoplasmic protein
   synthesis rate was in contrast unaffected by altitude exposure; 0.052
   +/- 0.019 at sea-level to 0.059 +/- 0.010\%.hr(-1) (p>0.05). Trends to
   increments in whole body protein kinetics were seen: Degradation rate
   elevated from 2.51 +/- 0.21 at sea level to 2.73 +/- 0.13 mu
   mol.kg-(1).min(-1) (p = 0.05) at high altitude and synthesis rate
   similar; 2.24 +/- 0.20 at sea level and 2.43 +/- 0.13 mu
   mol.kg(-1).min(-1) (p>0.05) at altitude. We conclude that whole body
   amino acid flux is increased due to an elevated protein turnover rate.
   Resting skeletal muscle myocontractile protein synthesis rate was
   concomitantly elevated by high-altitude induced hypoxia, whereas the
   sarcoplasmic protein synthesis rate was unaffected by hypoxia. These
   changed responses may lead to divergent adaptation over the course of
   prolonged exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Eighty-one wheat accessions including 50 southern regional performance

   semi-spring wheat accessions were confirmed based on their chilling
   days' requirement and polymorphism was found at VRN loci The Vrn-A1
   allele had the highest frequency in the RPN accessions and VA1-CAPs
   markers identified growth habit of RPN lines No polymorphism was found
   at the VRN3 loci and some polymorphism at the region of promoter and the
   first intron of VRN1 was not always consistent to growth habit in the

Abstract = {{This article focuses on the early book-length biographies of Darwin
   published from his death in 1882 up to 1900. By making 1900 the cutoff

   not yet set in stone, and before the rediscovery of Mendel's work in the
   early twentieth century and the anniversary celebrations of 1909 changed
   the way in which Darwin was regarded. Darwin's biographers dealt with
   three major themes. First, several biographers emphasized his scientific
   abilities, in particular his powers of observation and his prowess in
   conducting experiments. Second, many biographers discussed his
   character, a key issue in determining whether or not he could be trusted
   as a scientific guide. Finally, his scientific theories and religious
   beliefs, and how they related to the evolutionary controversy, formed a
   topic taken up by most biographers. By focusing on these three themes,
   the biographies published before 1900 were important in shaping the
   image of Darwin that was forming in American and British culture.}},

   The photonic chip consists of five optical ring resonators (ORRs) which
   are fully programmable using thermo-optical tuning. In this
   discriminator a drop-port response of an ORR is cascaded with a through
   response of another ORR to yield a linear phase modulation (PM) to
   intensity modulation (IM) conversion. The balanced photonic link
   employing the PM to IM conversion exhibits high second-order and
   third-order input intercept points of + 46 dBm and + 36 dBm,
   respectively, which are simultaneously achieved at one bias point.

Title = {{Contingency management to reduce methamphetamine use and sexual risk
   among men who have sex with men: a randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Methamphetamine use is associated with HIV acquisition and
   transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). Contingency
   management (CM), providing positive reinforcement for drug abstinence
   and withholding reinforcement when abstinence is not demonstrated, may
   facilitate reduced methamphetamine use and sexual risk. We compared CM
   as a stand-alone intervention to a minimal intervention control to
   assess the feasibility of conducting a larger, more definitive trial of
   CM; to define the frequency of behavioral outcomes to power such a
   trial; and, to compute preliminary estimates of CM's effectiveness.
   Methods: We randomly assigned 127 MSM from Seattle, WA who use
   methamphetamine to receive a 12-week CM intervention (n = 70) or
   referral to community resources (n = 57).
   Results: Retention at 24 weeks was 84\%. Comparing consecutive study
   visits, non-concordant UAI declined significantly in both study arms.
   During the intervention, CM and control participants were comparably
   likely to provide urine samples containing methamphetamine (adjusted
   relative risk {[}aRR] = 1.09; 95\% CI: 0.71, 1.56) and to report
   non-concordant UAI (aRR = 0.80; 95\% CI: 0.47, 1.35). However, during
   post-intervention follow-up, CM participants were somewhat more likely
   to provide urine samples containing methamphetamine than control
   participants (aRR = 1.21; 95\% CI: 0.95, 1.54, P = 0.11). Compared to
   control participants, CM participants were significantly more likely to
   report weekly or more frequent methamphetamine use and use of more than
   eight quarters of methamphetamine during the intervention and
   post-intervention periods.
   Conclusions: While it is possible to enroll and retain MSM who use
   methamphetamine in a trial of CM conducted outside drug treatment, our
   data suggest that CM is not likely to have a large, sustained effect on
   methamphetamine use.}},

Abstract = {{Human (h) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a potentially
   abundant source of blood cells, but how best to select iPSC clones
   suitable for this purpose from among the many clones that can be
   simultaneously established from an identical source is not clear. Using
   an in vitro culture system yielding a hematopoietic niche that
   concentrates hematopoietic progenitors, we show that the pattern of
   c-MYC reactivation after reprogramming influences platelet generation
   from hiPSCs. During differentiation, reduction of c-MYC expression after
   initial reactivation of c-MYC expression in selected hiPSC clones was
   associated with more efficient in vitro generation of CD41a(+)CD42b(+)
   platelets. This effect was recapitulated in virus integration-free
   hiPSCs using a doxycycline-controlled c-MYC expression vector. In vivo
   imaging revealed that these CD42b(+) platelets were present in thrombi
   after laser-induced vessel wall injury. In contrast, sustained and
   excessive c-MYC expression in megakaryocytes was accompanied by
   increased p14 (ARF) and p16 (INK4A) expression, decreased GATA1
   expression, and impaired production of functional platelets. These
   findings suggest that the pattern of c-MYC expression, particularly its
   later decline, is key to producing functional platelets from selected
   iPSC clones.}},

Title = {{The Influence of Natural Barriers in Shaping the Genetic Structure of
   Maharashtra Populations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background: The geographical position of Maharashtra state makes it
   rather essential to study the dispersal of modern humans in South Asia.
   Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the cultural,
   linguistic and geographical affinity of the populations living in
   Maharashtra state with other South Asian populations. The genetic origin
   of populations living in this state is poorly understood and hitherto
   been described at low molecular resolution level.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To address this issue, we have analyzed
   the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 185 individuals and NRY
   (non-recombining region of Y chromosome) of 98 individuals belonging to
   two major tribal populations of Maharashtra, and compared their
   molecular variations with that of 54 South Asian contemporary
   populations of adjacent states. Inter and intra population comparisons
   reveal that the maternal gene pool of Maharashtra state populations is
   composed of mainly South Asian haplogroups with traces of east and west
   Eurasian haplogroups, while the paternal haplogroups comprise the South
   Asian as well as signature of near eastern specific haplogroup J2a.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis suggests that Indian populations,
   including Maharashtra state, are largely derived from Paleolithic
   ancient settlers; however, a more recent (similar to 10 Ky older)
   detectable paternal gene flow from west Asia is well reflected in the
   present study. These findings reveal movement of populations to
   Maharashtra through the western coast rather than mainland where Western
   Ghats-Vindhya Mountains and Narmada-Tapti rivers might have acted as a
   natural barrier. Comparing the Maharastrian populations with other South
   Asian populations reveals that they have a closer affinity with the
   South Indian than with the Central Indian populations.}},

Title = {{Epigenetic-Genetic Chromosome Dosage Approach for Fetal Trisomy 21
   Detection Using an Autosomal Genetic Reference Marker}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: The putative promoter of the holocarboxylase synthetase
   (HLCS) gene on chromosome 21 is hypermethylated in placental tissues and
   could be detected as a fetal-specific DNA marker in maternal plasma.
   Detection of fetal trisomy 21 (T21) has been demonstrated by an
   epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach where the amount of
   hypermethylated HLCS in maternal plasma is normalized using a fetal
   genetic marker on the Y chromosome as a chromosome dosage reference
   marker. We explore if this method can be applied on both male and female
   fetuses with the use of a paternally-inherited fetal single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) allele on a reference chromosome for chromosome
   dosage normalization.
   Methodology: We quantified hypermethylated HLCS molecules using
   methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion followed by
   real-time or digital PCR analyses. For chromosome dosage analysis, we
   compared the amount of digestion-resistant HLCS to that of a SNP allele
   (rs6636, a C/G SNP) that the fetus has inherited from the father but
   absent in the pregnant mother.
   Principal Findings: Using a fetal-specific SNP allele on a reference
   chromosome, we analyzed 20 euploid and nine T21 placental tissue
   samples. All samples with the fetal-specific C allele were correctly
   classified. One sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were
   misclassified when the fetal-specific G allele was used as the reference
   marker. We then analyzed 33 euploid and 14 T21 maternal plasma samples.
   All but one sample from each of the euploid and T21 groups were
   correctly classified using the fetal-specific C allele, while correct
   classification was achieved for all samples using the fetal-specific G
   allele as the reference marker.
   Conclusions: As a proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated that the
   epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach can be applied to the
   prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 for both male and female fetuses.}},

Abstract = {{This study was carried out to evaluate and determine the differences in
   T and Z values of proximal femour (femoral neck, trochanter,
   intertrochanter and ward's triangle) region bone mineral density (BMD)
   among high level male athletes of different branches. The study was
   completed with the voluntary attendance of a total of 42 uninjured male
   national athletes in different branches (taekwondo 12, wrestling 8, judo
   10 and runners 12) whose ages vary between 18 to 25 and whose athletic
   carrier is intact with at least 8 to 10 years of regular exercise. BMD
   measurements of athletes were completed with the dual energy x- ray
   absorbtiometric (DEXA) technology using Hologic QDR 4500W device on
   proximal femour (femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter and ward's
   triangle) region. The recorded BMD and the T and Z values after
   measurements of the proximal femour region were completed and have been
   used for calculations of the statistical data. Comparison of the BMD and
   T and Z values in different athletic branches has indicated that the
   highest BMD and T and Z values are found in wrestlers, followed by judo,
   runners and lastly taekwondo. Between the different athletic branches,
   the statistical comparison of the proximal femour (femoral neck,
   trochanter, intertrochanter and ward's triangle) region of BMD and T and
   Z values was carried out and the differences were detected (P < 0.05).
   Generally, the values of BMD and T, Z among wrestlers are found to be
   higher than athletes of judo, taekwondo and runners (P < 0.05), but
   these values show statistical similarity with athletes of judo, while
   showing differences with runners and taekwondo (P < 0.05). Athletes of
   judo, taekwondo and runners are statisticaly similar to each other (P >
   0.05), and it is seen that the lowest value of BMD has been found in
   athletes of taekwondo, while the lowest value of T and Z has been found
   in runners. The reason why the values of BMD, T and Z are recorded
   higher among wrestlers than other athletes is thought to be the
   exercises that add more mechanical weight onto the bone as a matter of
   their athletic branch. These indicators show that there can be
   differences in the formation of proximal femour bone mineral density
   between different athletic branches, especially among the high level
   male athletes whose activity is mainly composed of intense weight
   loading exercises on the bones.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm is one of the known virulence factors of Candida, an important
   pathogen and commensal. Early detection of biofilm production may be
   useful for clinical decision because of its suggestive property for
   potential pathogenic capacity of Candida isolates. In this study, we
   simultaneously screened 411 clinical isolates of Candida spp. by
   microtiter plate (MTP), visual tube (TM) and congo red agar (CRA)
   methods for determining their ability to form biofilm and also evaluated
   the reliability of these methods in order to determine most suitable
   screening method. The accuracy of TM and CRA methods were also evaluated
   by using MTP as reference method. Of the 411 Candida spp., 159 (38.7\%)
   displayed a biofilm-positive phenotype by MTP method. Sensitivity and
   specificity of the tube method were 68 and 98\%, respectively and the
   positive predictive value (PPV) was 97\% and the negative predictive
   value (NPV) was 83\%. The sensitivity for congo red agar test was 79\%
   and the specificity was 99\%, and the PPV was 99\% and the NPV was 88\%.
   Tube method showed very good agreement for the isolates producing strong
   biofilm, whereas differentation of isolates producing weak biofilm was
   difficult. By the congo red method, classification of existing biofilm
   was problematic. Among the three methods studied, microtiter plate
   method may be suggested as the most sensitive method, which is easy to
   conduct and applicable as a routine process.}},

Abstract = {{Background Low values of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
   predispose to acute kidney injury, and proteinuria is a marker of kidney
   disease. We aimed to investigate how eGFR and proteinuria jointly
   modified the risks of acute kidney injury and subsequent adverse
   clinical outcomes.
   Methods We did a cohort study of 920 985 adults residing in Alberta,
   Canada, between 2002 and 2007. Participants not needing chronic dialysis
   at baseline and with at least one outpatient measurement of both serum
   creatinine concentration and proteinuria (urine dipstick or
   albumin-creatinine ratio) were included. We assessed hospital admission
   with acute kidney injury with validated administrative codes; other
   outcomes were all-cause mortality and a composite renal outcome of
   end-stage renal disease or doubling of serum creatinine concentration.
   Findings During median follow-up of 35 months (range 0-59 months), 6520
   (0.7\%) participants were admitted with acute kidney injury. In those
   with eGFR 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or greater, the adjusted risk of
   admission with this disorder was about 4 times higher in those with
   heavy proteinuria measured by dipstick (rate ratio 4.4 vs no
   proteinuria, 95\% CI 3.7-5.2). The adjusted rates of admission with
   acute kidney injury and kidney injury needing dialysis remained high in
   participants with heavy dipstick proteinuria for all values of eGFR. The
   adjusted rates of death and the composite renal outcome were also high
   in participants admitted with acute kidney injury, although the rise
   associated with this injury was attenuated in those with low baseline
   eGFR and heavy proteinuria.
   Interpretation These findings suggest that information on proteinuria
   and eGFR should be used together when identifying people at risk of
   acute kidney injury, and that an episode of acute kidney injury provides
   further long-term prognostic information in addition to eGFR and
   proteinuria.}},

Abstract = {{`Waan chak modlook' (Curcuma comosa Roxb.) is an important medicinal
   plant of Thailand, but the high similarity in morphological
   characteristics observed among Curcuma spp. may cause confusion in its
   utilization. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker
   was used to identify and elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among
   97 accessions of `Waan chak modlook' collected throughout Thailand. Nine
   AFLP primer combinations generated a total of 202 bands, of which, 158
   bands were polymorphic, with an average of 17.56 bands per primer pair.
   Pairwise similarity estimated between all samples ranged from 0.39 to
   1.00 with an average of 0.67. The phylogenetic tree derived from AFLP
   data showed that the `Waan chak modlook' accessions were divided into
   five clusters. Based on morphological characterizations, all samples
   could be assigned to four species: Curcuma sp.; Curcuma latifolia Rosc.;
   Curcuma elata Roxb.; and C. comosa. The results indicated that there
   were other Curcuma species that were misused as C. comosa. The DNA
   fingerprint data along with the morphological data provided the keys for
   the accurate identification of C. comosa from the other three related
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of concomitant use of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and
   beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) on periodontal regeneration were
   investigated in the beagle dog 1-wall periodontal defect model. One-wall
   periodontal defects were created in the mesial portion of both sides of
   the mandibular first molars, and 0.3\% FGF-2 plus beta-TCP or beta-TCP
   alone was administered. Radiographic evaluation was performed at 0, 3,
   and 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, the periodontium with the defect site was
   removed and histologically analyzed.
   Radiographic findings showed that co-administration of FGF-2
   significantly increased bone mineral contents of the defect sites
   compared with beta-TCP alone. Histologic analysis revealed that the
   length of the regenerated periodontal ligament, the cementum, distance
   to the junctional epithelium, new bone height, and area of newly formed
   bone were significantly increased in the FGF-2 group. No abnormal
   inflammatory response or ankylosis was observed in either group. These
   findings indicate the efficacy of concomitant use of FGF-2 and beta-TCP
   as an osteoconductive material for periodontal regeneration following
   severe destruction by progressive periodontitis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Reverse gyrase reanneals denatured DNA and induces positive supercoils
   in DNA, an activity that is critical for life at very high temperatures.
   Positive supercoiling occurs by a poorly understood mechanism involving
   the coordination of a topoisomerase domain and a helicase-like domain.
   In the parasitic archaeon Nanoarchaeum equitans, these domains occur as
   separate subunits. We express the subunits, and characterize them both
   in isolation and as a heterodimer. Each subunit tightly associates and
   interacts with the other. The topoisomerase subunit enhances the
   catalytic specificity of the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the
   helicase-like subunit, and the helicase-like subunit inhibits the
   relaxation activity of the topoisomerase subunit while promoting
   positive supercoiling. DNA binding preference for both single-and
   double-stranded DNA is partitioned between the subunits. Based on a
   sensitive topological shift assay, the binding preference of
   helicase-like subunit for underwound DNA is modulated by its binding
   with ATP cofactor. These results provide new insight into the mechanism
   of positive supercoil induction by reverse gyrase.}},

   lipopolysaccharide functioning as a selective TLR4 agonist and
   compactin, a statin inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Analyses of
   lipid molecular species by dynamic quantitative mass spectrometry and
   concomitant transcriptomic measurements define the lipidome and
   demonstrate immediate responses in fatty acid metabolism represented by
   increases in eicosanoid synthesis and delayed responses characterized by
   sphingolipid and sterol biosynthesis. Lipid remodeling of glycerolipids,
   glycerophospholipids, and prenols also take place, indicating that
   activation of the innate immune system by inflammatory mediators leads
   to alterations in a majority of mammalian lipid categories, including
   unanticipated effects of a statin drug. Our studies provide a
   systems-level view of lipid metabolism and reveal significant
   connections between lipid and cell signaling and biochemical pathways
   that contribute to innate immune responses and to pharmacological

   reaction IO + CH(3)O(2)-> products. Sensitive and selective
   laser-induced fluorescence detection of IO allows excess CH(3)O(2)

   from other fast IO reactions. The rate coefficients, k(5)(296 K)=(3.4

   well-characterised reference value (k(3) for IO + HO(2)). This result
   agrees well with a previous determination from this laboratory and
   demonstrates that the above reaction proceeds an order of magnitude
   slower than suggested in other recent experimental and theoretical
   studies. Implications for HOx production/O(3) destruction within the

Abstract = {{The porphyrin auxotrophic pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis obtains the
   majority of essential iron and porphyrin from host hemoproteins. To
   achieve this, the organism expresses outer membrane gingipains
   containing cysteine proteinase domains linked to hemagglutinin domains.
   Heme mobilized in this way is taken up by P. gingivalis through a
   variety of potential portals where HmuY/HmuR of the hmu locus are best
   described. These receptors have relatively low binding affinities for
   heme. In this report, we describe a novel P. gingivalis protein, HusA,
   the product of PG2227, which rapidly bound heme with a high binding
   constant at equilibrium of 7 x 10(-10) M. HusA is both expressed on the
   outer membrane and released from the organism. Spectral analysis
   indicated an unusual pattern of binding where heme was ligated
   preferentially as a dimer. Further, the presence of dimeric heme induced
   protein dimer formation. Deletional inactivation of husA showed that
   expression of this moiety was essential for growth of P. gingivalis
   under conditions of heme limitation. This finding was in accord with the
   pronounced increase in gene expression levels for husA with progressive
   reduction of heme supplementation. Antibodies reactive against HusA were
   detected in patients with chronic periodontitis, suggesting that the
   protein is expressed during the course of infection by P. gingivalis. It
   is predicted that HusA efficiently sequesters heme from gingipains and
   fulfills the function of a high affinity hemophore-like protein to meet
   the heme requirement for growth of P. gingivalis during establishment of
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{The foremost requirement of quantification of cellulases expressed in

   work investigates the feasibility of isotachophoresis for this purpose.
   An electrolyte system comprising a leading electrolyte of 10 mM formic
   acid at pH 9.0 and a terminating electrolyte of 10 mM beta-alanine was
   devised and used to perform isotachophoresis of cellulases. The use of a
   simple front cutting method removed a majority of interfering species in
   the juice, thereby resulting in the formation of a distinct zone of
   desired proteins. In comparison to techniques such as ultrafiltration
   and liming, the analysis time and loss of desired proteins was lower
   when the sample was prepared by using isotachophoresis. Hence,
   isotachophoresis was an ideal choice for purification of the proteins in
   question from the remaining components in the juice. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   energy conformers and scrutinizing the Kohn-Sham FMOs. The torsional
   deviation from coplanarity is predominantly influencing the electronic
   structure, i.e., by deviation from ideal overlap and maximal electron
   transmission. The reversible oxidation potentials assigned to the
   phenothiazinyl electrophores in most cases can thereby be qualitatively
   rationalized. All dumbbell-shaped diphenothiazines are strongly
   luminescent, which can be attributed to extended pi-electron conjugation
   with considerable excited state electronic coupling as a consequence of
   large structural and electronic distributional changes upon

Title = {{Effects of GABA agonist and antagonist injections into the oculomotor
   vermis on horizontal saccades}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1366}},
Pages = {{93-100}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{The oculomotor vermis (OMV) of the cerebellum is necessary for the
   generation of the accurate rapid eye movements called saccades. Large
   lesions of the midline cerebellar cortex involving the OMV cause
   saccades to become hypometric and more variable. However, saccades were
   not examined immediately after these lesions so the interpretation of
   the resulting deficits might have been contaminated by some adaptation
   to the saccade dysmetria. Therefore, to better understand the
   contribution of the OMV to normal saccades, we impaired its operation
   locally by injecting small amounts of either an agonist or antagonist of
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a ubiquitous neurotransmitter
   throughout the cerebellar cortex. Muscimol, a GABA agonist, inactivated
   part of the OMV, whereas bicuculline, an antagonist, disinhibited it.
   Muscimol caused all ipsiversive horizontal saccades from 5 to 30 degrees
   to become hypometric. In contrast, bicuculline produced an
   amplitude-dependent dysmetria: ipsiversive horizontal saccades elicited
   by target steps <10 degrees became hypometric, whereas those in response
   to larger steps became hypermetric. At the transition target amplitude,
   saccade amplitudes were quite variable with some being hypo- and others
   hypermetric. After most injections of either agent, saccades had lower
   peak velocities and longer durations than pre-injection saccades of the
   same amplitude. The longer durations were associated with a prolongation
   of the deceleration phase. Both agents produced inconsistent effects on
   contraversive saccades. These results establish that the oculomotor
   vermis helps control the characteristics of normal ipsiversive saccades
   and that GABAergic inhibitory processes are a crucial part of this

Abstract = {{The loss of GABAergic neurotransmission has been closely linked with
   epileptogenesis The modulation of the synaptic activity occurs both via
   the removal of GABA from the synaptic cleft and by GABA transporters
   (GATs) and by modulation of GABA receptors The tremor rat (TRM tm/tm) is
   the parent strain of the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER tm/tm) which
   exhibits absence-like seizure after 8 weeks of age However there are no
   reports that can elucidate the effects of GATs and GABA(A) receptors
   (GABARs) on TRMs The present study was conducted to detect GATs and
   GABAR alpha 1 subunit in TRMs hippocampus at mRNA and protein levels In
   this study total synaptosomal GABA content was significantly decreased
   in TRMs hippocampus compared with control Wistar rats by high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) mRNA and protein expressions of
   GAT-1 GAT-3 and GABAR alpha 1 subunit were all significantly increased
   in TRMs hippocampus by real time PCR and Western blot respectively GAT-1
   and GABAR alpha 1 subunit proteins were localized widely in TRMs and
   control rats hippocampus including CA1 CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG)
   regions whereas only a wide distribution of GAT-3 was observed in CA1
   region by immunohistochemistry These data demonstrate that excessive
   expressions of GAT-1 as well as GAT-3 and GABAR alpha 1 subunit in TRMs
   hippocampus may provide the potential therapeutic targets for genetic

   the resultant supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector can be orders

Abstract = {{Entry into mitosis in eukaryotes requires the activity of
   cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Cdk1 is opposed by protein
   phosphatases in two ways: They inhibit activation of Cdk1 by
   dephosphorylating the protein kinases Wee1 and Myt1 and the protein
   phosphatase Cdc25 (key regulators of Cdk1), and they also antagonize
   Cdk1's own phosphorylation of downstream targets. A particular form of
   protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) containing a B55 delta subunit (PP2A-B55
   delta) is the major protein phosphatase that acts on model CDK
   substrates in Xenopus egg extracts and has antimitotic activity. The
   activity of PP2A-B55 delta is high in interphase and low in mitosis,
   exactly opposite that of Cdk1. We report that inhibition of PP2A-B55
   delta results from a small protein, known as alpha-endosulfine (Ensa),
   that is phosphorylated in mitosis by the protein kinase Greatwall (Gwl).
   This converts Ensa into a potent and specific inhibitor of PP2A-B55
   delta. This pathway represents a previously unknown element in the
   control of mitosis.}},

Abstract = {{Islet beta cell dysfunction resulting from inflammation, ER stress, and
   oxidative stress is a key determinant in the progression from insulin
   resistance to type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was recently shown that the
   enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) promotes early cytokine-induced
   inflammation in the beta cell. DHS catalyzes the conversion of lysine to
   hypusine, an amino acid that is unique to the translational elongation
   factor eIF5A. Here, we sought to determine whether DHS activity
   contributes to beta cell dysfunction in models of type 2 diabetes in
   mice and beta cell lines. A 2-week treatment of obese diabetic
   C57BLKS/J-db/db mice with the DHS inhibitor GC7 resulted in improved
   glucose tolerance, increased insulin release, and enhanced beta cell
   mass. Thapsigargin treatment of beta cells in vitro induces a picture of
   ER stress and apoptosis similar to that seen in db/db mice; in this
   setting, DHS inhibition led to a block in CHOP (CAAT/enhancer binding
   protein homologous protein) production despite >30-fold activation of
   Chop gene transcription. Blockage of CHOP translation resulted in
   reduction of downstream caspase-3 cleavage and near-complete protection
   of cells from apoptotic death. DHS inhibition appeared to prevent the

Title = {{Conservation Physiology of the Plethodontid Salamanders Eurycea nana and

Journal = {{COPEIA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{540-553}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Eurycea sosorum and E. nano are plethodontid salamanders endemic to
   several karst springs in central Texas. Landscapes around these habitats
   are increasingly urbanized. At the Barton Springs complex, where E.
   sosorum occurs, average dissolved oxygen (DO) in the main flow is
   approximately 6.5 mg L-1. However, DO is quite variable, ranging between
   2.4 and 10 mg O-2 L-1, and recent data suggest a positive relationship
   between DO and spring discharge in Barton Springs Pool, though this
   relationship may not be as strong under extreme low-flow conditions.
   Here we examine sensitivity of a surrogate species, E. nano, to
   experimental variation in oxygen availability (DO); due to limited
   availability of E. sosorum, they were examined in only a subset of
   experiments. A suite of traits was measured on adults: spontaneous
   activity, metabolic rate, and mortality during 28 days of exposure. A
   separate experiment examined growth of Juveniles across levels of DO
   during 60 days of exposure. Levels of DO below 3.4 mg O-2 L-1 appeared
   to pose a grave threat to salamander survival over a 28-day study,
   whereas DO above 4.5 mg O-2 L-1 gave no observable effects in any
   experiment. Between these values is a critical range in which
   salamanders became progressively compromised. An ambient water quality
   criterion for DO in lentic systems (5 mg O-2 L-1, 24 hour minimum)
   appears adequate to protect Eurycea.}},

Abstract = {{Although a highly effective vaccine against smallpox, vaccinia virus
   (VV) is not without adverse events, some of which can be
   life-threatening, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. We have
   recently demonstrated that the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of
   Dryvax (R) in immunocompetent mice is preserved even when
   co-administered with ST-246, an orally bioavailable small-molecule
   inhibitor of orthopoxvirus egress and dissemination. In addition, ST-246
   markedly reduced the reactogenicity of the smallpox vaccine ACAM2000 and
   the highly neurovirulent VV strain Western Reserve (VV-WR). Here, we
   evaluated the impact of ST-246 co-administration on ACAM2000
   reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy in seven murine
   models of varying degrees of humoral and cellular immunodeficiency:
   BALB/c and B-cell deficient (JH-KO) mice depleted of CD4(+) or CD8(+) or
   both subsets of T cells. We observed that ST-246 reduced vaccine lesion
   severity and time to complete resolution in all of the immunodeficient
   models examined, except in those lacking both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.
   Although VV-specific humoral responses were moderately reduced by ST-246
   treatment, cellular responses were generally comparable or slightly
   enhanced at both 1 and 6 months post-vaccination. Most importantly, in
   those models in which vaccination given alone conferred protection
   against lethal VV challenge, similar levels of protection were observed
   at both time points when vaccination was given with ST-246. These data
   suggest that, with the exception of individuals with irreversible,
   combined CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell deficiency, ST-246 co-administered at
   the time of vaccination may help reduce vaccine reactogenicity even in
   those lacking humoral immunity without impeding the induction of
   protective immunity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Loxodontomys mieropus is a rodent that is widely distributed in Andean
   and Patagonian Argentina and Chile. This range covers a heterogeneous
   area that has been influenced by geologic and palaeoclimatic events,
   such as the glaciations during the Neogene. To investigate the genetic
   structure, phylogeographic pattern, and biogeographic history of this
   sigmodontine rodent we analyzed a 801-base-pair fragment of the
   mitochondrial genome (cytochrome-b gene) of 87 specimens from 24
   localities from Argentina and Chile. Results indicate that L. micropus
   has a shallow genealogy that is geographically structured and is a taxon
   characterized by an historical population expansion. We discuss the
   distribution of the genetic variation of L. micropus in relation to
   population history and the concordance with other codistributed
   sigmodontine rodents. On the basis of molecular evidence, we suggest
   that the L. piktimche, corresponding to the second extant species of the
   genus, could be a junior synonym of L. micropus. DOI:

Abstract = {{The Notch pathway is frequently activated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic
   leukemias (T-ALLs). Of the Notch receptors, Notch1 is a recurrent target
   of gain-of-function mutations and Notch3 is expressed in all T-ALLs, but
   it is currently unclear how these receptors contribute to T-cell
   transformation in vivo. We investigated the role of Notch1 and Notch3 in
   T-ALL progression by a genetic approach, in mice bearing a knockdown
   mutation in the Ikaros gene that spontaneously develop Notch-dependent
   T-ALL. While deletion of Notch3 has little effect, T cell-specific
   deletion of floxed Notch1 promoter/exon 1 sequences significantly
   accelerates leukemogenesis. Notch1-deleted tumors lack surface Notch1
   but express gamma-secretase-cleaved intracellular Notch1 proteins. In
   addition, these tumors accumulate high levels of truncated Notch1
   transcripts that are caused by aberrant transcription from cryptic
   initiation sites in the 3' part of the gene. Deletion of the floxed
   sequences directly reprograms the Notch1 locus to begin transcription
   from these 3' promoters and is accompanied by an epigenetic
   reorganization of the Notch1 locus that is consistent with
   transcriptional activation. Further, spontaneous deletion of 5' Notch1
   sequences occurs in approximately 75\% of Ikaros-deficient T-ALLs. These
   results reveal a novel mechanism for the oncogenic activation of the
   Notch1 gene after deletion of its main promoter. (Blood. 2010; 116(25):

Abstract = {{Coaxial electrospinning was used to encapsulate the complex hydride
   ammonia borane in polystyrene to improve its properties as a hydrogen
   storage material. A solvent selection system was developed by using the
   Hansen solubility parameters to facilitate the choice of compatible
   solvents for core and shell. This enabled systematic optimization of the
   parameters needed for successful coelectrospinning. This approach has
   general application for any multiphase electrospinning system, including
   ones where the core is highly conducting or nonpolymeric. The resulting
   fiber morphologies depend strongly on the degree of miscibility of core
   and shell solutions. Fibers spun from immiscible core shell solutions
   had a classic coaxial structure. Fibers produced from semimiscible
   core-shell solutions were highly porous, with inclusions extending
   through the fiber and an ordered radial and longitudinal distribution of
   nanoscale pores on the fiber surface. We suggest that this type of
   porosity may be due to an instability created in the nonaxisymmetric
   modes at the core shell interface, resulting in intrusion of the core
   into the shell polymer. These controllably porous structures have
   numerous potential applications including materials templating or drug
   delivery. In the porous fibers, the temperature of the first hydrogen
   release of ammonia borane is reduced to 85 degrees C. This result
   suggests a nanostructured hydride, but a large mass loss indicates that
   much of the ammonia borane is expelled on heating. The coaxial fibers,
   in contrast, appear to encapsulate the hydride successfully. The coaxial
   and porous fibers alike showed no significant release of borazine,
   suggesting two different suppression mechanisms for this impurity.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer (CC) depends on several factors

   had already heard of HPV, although 88.3\% (n = 834) from that know that
   is a risk factor for CC. 89\% students (n = 841) wants to be vaccinated
   against it, but only 13.8\% stated as main reason to be vaccinated
   ``prevention of the disease{''}. Mean scores of knowledge were
   calculated. Statistical differences were found, regarding ``CC
   knowledge{''}, in gender (p < 0.001) and between health sciences schools
   and non-health sciences schools (p < 0.001). Differences regarding the
   study area in ``knowledge and beliefs of HPV{''} (p < 0.001) and in
   ``relation between HPV and CC{''} (p < 0.001) were found. Therefore,
   these differences may help to develop effective strategies that lead to
   decline CC incidence and mortality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), an oncogenic herpesvirus that causes human
   malignancies, infects and immortalizes primary human B cells in vitro
   into indefinitely proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines, which
   represent a model for EBV-induced tumorigenesis. The immortalization
   efficiency is very low, suggesting that an innate tumor suppressor
   mechanism is operative. We identify the DNA damage response (DDR) as a
   major component of the underlying tumor suppressor mechanism.
   EBV-induced DDR activation was not due to lytic viral replication, nor
   did the DDR marks colocalize with latent episomes. Rather, a transient
   period of EBV-induced hyperproliferation correlated with DDR activation.
   Inhibition of the DDR kinases ATM and Chk2 markedly increased
   transformation efficiency of primary B cells. Further, the viral latent
   oncoprotein EBNA3C was required to attenuate the EBV-induced DDR. We
   propose that heightened oncogenic activity in early cell divisions
   activates a growth-suppressive DDR that is attenuated by viral latency
   products to induce cell immortalization.}},

Title = {{Response of Norwegian Sea temperature to solar forcing since 1000 AD}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{We report on a 1000 year long oxygen isotope record in sediments of the
   eastern Norwegian Sea which, we argue, represents the temperature and
   transport of warm Atlantic waters entering the Nordic Sea basin via the
   North Atlantic Drift and the large-scale Meridional Overturning
   Circulation. The single-sample resolution of the record is 2.5-10 years
   and age control is provided by Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating, identification
   of historic tephra, and a C-14 ``wiggle-match{''} dating method in which
   the surface reservoir 14C age in the past is constrained rather than
   assumed, thereby eliminating a large source of chronological
   uncertainty. The oxygen isotope results indicate decade- to
   century-scale temperature variations of 1-2 degrees C in the shallow
   (similar to 50 m deep) subsurface which we find to be strongly
   correlated with various proxies of past solar activity. The correlations
   are synchronous to within the timescale uncertainties of the ocean and
   solar proxy records, which vary among the records and in time with a
   range of about 5-30 years. The observed ocean temperature response is
   larger than expected based on simple thermodynamic considerations,
   indicating that there is dynamical response of the high-latitude ocean
   to the Sun. Correlations of our results with a gridded temperature
   reconstruction for Europe are greater in central Europe than in coastal
   regions, suggesting that the temperature and transport of warm Atlantic
   waters entering the Nordic Basin and the pattern of temperature
   variability over Europe are both the proximate responses to a change in
   the atmospheric circulation, consistent with a forced shift in the
   primary modes of high-latitude atmospheric variability.}},

   capabilities to improve their operational and environmental performance.
   The improvement leads to the enhancement of their financial performance.
   However, we cannot find such a business linkage in small and
   medium-sized firms. They improve their operational performance and then
   direct themselves toward the improvement of their environmental
   performance. Their environmental performance is, not the first priority,
   the second priority for the small and medium-sized firms even though
   Japanese government is currently making a policy pressure on all
   manufacturing firms to pay attention to various environmental issues
   related to the global warming and climate change. The environmental
   protection policy is effective on only large Japanese manufacturing
   firms that have technological and financial capabilities for
   environmental protection. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Time-resolved extinction spectra assisted with two-dimensional
   correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) analysis and principal component
   analysis (PCA) were employed to investigate the interaction between
   bovine serum albumin (BSA) and metal nanoparticles (NPs). A series of
   localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra of metal NPs were
   measured just after a small amount of BSA was added into metal colloids.
   Through 2DCOS analysis, remarkable changes in the intensities of the
   LSPR were observed. The interaction process was totally divided into
   three periods according to the PCA. Transmission electron microscopy,
   dynamic light scattering, and xi-potential measurements were also
   employed to characterize the interaction between BSA and metal NPs. The
   addition of BSA brings silver NPs to aggregate through the electrostatic
   interaction between them, but it has less effect on gold NPs. In a gold
   and silver mixed system, gold NPs can affect the interaction of silver
   NPs and BSA, leading it to weaken. The combination of 2DCOS analysis and
   LSPR spectroscopy is powerful for exploring the LSPR spectra of the
   metal NP involved systems. This combined technique holds great potential
   in LSPR sensing through analysis of slight, slim spectral changes of
   metal colloids.}},

Abstract = {{The self-assembly of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride
   (PTCDA) on graphene with coverage in the range of 0.3-3 monolayers (MLs)
   is characterized by a DFT-based ab initio calculation method. For alpha
   modification mode, with a critical thickness of 1 ML, the growth of
   PTCDA on graphene follows the Stranski-Krastanov (SK) mode. For beta
   modification mode, the PTCDA can form two complete MLs on a graphene
   substrate. From the thermodynamic viewpoint, a modification mode is more
   stable than beta modification mode. At 1 ML, the PTCDA follows a planar
   configuration on graphene, which is also almost unperturbed by typical
   defects in the graphene sheet. The PTCDA adlayer remains its planar and
   continuous herringbone structure on graphene with three typical defects.
   For alpha modification mode with 2 or 3 ML coverage, the molecular
   planes incline to the substrate plane with angles around 90 degrees and
   13 degrees, respectively, which indicates that a bulk-like phase
   appears. This also enhances the lateral intrinsic charge transport
   characteristics. For a modification mode, the total amount of charge
   transfer between PTCDA and graphene per 5 root 3 x 5 super cell at 2 MLs
   saturates with 0.42e, which is 0.1 and 0.06e larger than those of 1 and
   3 MLs, respectively.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{Sea ice is a very important indicator and an effective modulator of
   regional and global climate change. Current remote sensing techniques
   provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor the cryosphere routinely
   with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, we
   introduce a thermodynamic model to estimate sea and lake ice thickness
   with optical (visible, near-infrared, and infrared) satellite data.
   Comparisons of nighttime ice thickness retrievals to ice thickness
   measurements from upward looking submarine sonar show that this
   thermodynamic model is capable of retrieving ice thickness up to 2.8 m.
   The mean absolute error is 0.18 m for samples with a mean ice thickness
   of 1.62 m, i.e., an 11\% mean absolute error. Comparisons with in situ
   Canadian stations and moored upward looking sonar measurements show
   similar results. Sensitivity studies indicate that the largest errors
   come from uncertainties in surface albedo and downward solar radiation
   flux estimates from satellite data, followed by uncertainties in snow
   depth and cloud fractional coverage. Due to the relatively large
   uncertainties in current satellite retrievals of surface albedo and
   surface downward shortwave radiation flux, the current model is not
   recommended for use with daytime data. For nighttime data, the model is
   capable of resolving regional and seasonal variations in ice thickness
   and is useful for climatological analysis.}},

Abstract = {{CO poisoning of the Pt-based anodes (PtRu) of stationary proton exchange
   membrane fuel cells remains a severe problem for their realization. We
   tried to counteract this problem using a CO oxidation electrocatalyst.
   Rh porphyrins, which can catalyze electrochemical CO oxidation in low
   potential regions, were adsorbed on a carbon-supported PtRu catalyst
   (PtRu/C) to increase its CO tolerance. The combined electrocatalysts
   (Rh(porphyrin)-PtRu/C) exhibited significantly higher activity toward
   CO(2\%)-contaminated H-2 than the PtRu/C alone; the onset potential for
   H-2 oxidation reaches 0.2 V (vs a reversible hydrogen electrode) on the
   combined catalyst. In contrast, the composite of PtRu black and
   Rh(porphyrin) scarcely exhibited CO tolerance. This suggests that the
   enhancement of CO tolerance in Rh(porphyrin)-PtRu/C is mainly caused by
   Rh porphyrins on carbon. The significance of Rh porphyrins on carbon was
   shown by the findings that a mixed catalyst composed of carbon-supported
   Rh(porphyrin) (Rh(porphyrin)/C) and PtRu/C gave high oxidation activity
   toward CO(2\%)/H-2. Rh porphyrin on carbon would decrease the CO
   concentration around PtRu particles and thus reduce the CO poisoning of
   PtRu catalysts.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Abstract = {{Chemical doping is expected to substantially increase the density of
   free charge carriers by charge transfer and modify the Fermi level and
   screening effect of doped materials. Here, along with Raman
   identification of 3 and 4 graphene layers by a 633-nm laser excitation,
   we investigated charge transfer and optical phonon mixing in few layer
   graphenes in detail by utilizing sulfuric acid as an electron-acceptor
   dopant. Sulfuric acid molecules are found to be only physically adsorbed
   on the surface layers of graphenes without intercalations. The top and
   bottom layers of bilayer graphene can be intentionally doped differently
   by concentrated sulfuric acid. The difference of the hole doping between
   the top and bottom layers results in phonon mixing of symmetric and
   antisymmetric modes in bilayer graphene. The Raman frequency evolution
   with the doping level is in agreement with recent ab initio
   density-functional theory calculations {[}P. Gava, M. Lazzeri, A. M.

Abstract = {{Large volumes of greenhouse gases such as CH4 and CO2 form by contact
   metamorphism of organic-rich sediments in aureoles around sill
   intrusions in sedimentary basins. Thermogenic gas generation and
   dehydration reactions in shale are treated numerically in order to
   quantify basin-scale devolatilization. We show that aureole thicknesses,
   defined as the zone of elevated metamorphism relative to the background
   level, vary within 30-250\% of the sill thickness, depending on the
   temperature of the host-rock and intrusion, besides the sill thickness.
   In shales with total organic carbon content of >5 wt.\%, CH4 is the
   dominant volatile (85-135 kg/m(3)) generated through organic cracking,
   relative to H2O-generation from dehydration reactions (30-110 kg/m(3)).
   Even using conservative estimates of melt volumes, extrapolation of our
   results to the scale of sill complexes in a sedimentary basin indicates
   that devolatilization can have generated similar to 2700-16200 Gt CH4 in
   the Karoo Basin (South Africa), and similar to 600-3500 Gt CH4 in the
   Wring and More basins (offshore Norway). The generation of volatiles is
   occurring on a time-scale of 10-1000 years within an aureole of a single
   sill, which makes the rate of sill emplacement the time-constraining
   factor on a basin-scale. This study demonstrates that thousands of
   gigatons of potent greenhouse gases like methane can be generated during
   emplacement of Large Igneous Provinces in sedimentary basins. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A molecular dynamics (MD) approach was employed to simulate the
   imbibition of a designed nanopore by a simple fluid (i e a Lennard-Jones
   (LJ) fluid) The length of imbibition as a function of time for various
   interactions between the LJ fluid and the pore wall was recorded for
   this system (1 e the LJ fluid and the nanopore) By and large the
   kinetics of imbibition was successfully described by the Lucas-Washburn
   (LW) equation although deviation from it was observed in some cases This
   lack of agreement is due to the neglect of the dynamic contact angle
   (DCA) in the LW equation Two commonly used models (i e hydrodynamic and
   molecular-kinetic (MK) models) were thus employed to calculate the DCA
   It is demonstrated that the MK model is able to Justify the simulation
   results in which are not in good agreement with the simple LW equation
   However the hydrodynamic model is not capable of doing that Further
   investigation of the MD simulation data revealed an interesting fact
   that there is a direct relationship between the wall-fluid interaction
   and the speed of the capillary imbibition More evidence to support this
   claim is presented (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Ni-doped SnO2 nanoparticles prepared by a polymer precursor method have
   been characterized structurally and magnetically. Ni doping (up to 10
   mol\%) does not significantly affect the crystalline structure of SnO2,
   but stabilizes smaller particles as the Ni content is increased. A
   notable solid solution regime up to similar to 3 mol\% of Ni, and a Ni
   surface enrichment for the higher Ni contents are found. The room
   temperature ferromagnetism with saturation magnetization (MS) similar to
   1.2 x 10(-3) emu g(-1) and coercive field (H-C) similar to 40 Oe is
   determined for the undoped sample, which is associated with the exchange
   coupling of the spins of electrons trapped in oxygen vacancies, mainly
   located on the surface of the particles. This ferromagnetism is enhanced
   as the Ni content increases up to similar to 3 mol\%, where the Ni ions
   are distributed in a solid solution. Above this Ni content, the
   ferromagnetism rapidly decays and a paramagnetic behavior is observed.
   This finding is assigned to the increasing segregation of Ni ions
   (likely formed by interstitials Ni ions and nearby substitutional sites)
   on the particle surface, which modifies the magnetic behavior by
   reducing the available oxygen vacancies and/or the free electrons and
   favoring paramagnetic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are extensively being used to study the
   electrical properties of cells. Most of the MEAs use metal electrodes
   which are in direct contact with the cells. When using DC currents, this
   leads to undesirable chemical influencing of the cell. Also, metal
   electrodes are unsuitable for the measuring of constant potentials. A
   new kind of MEA is developed which replaces the metal electrodes by
   electrolyte-filled microchannels with Ag/AgCl-electrodes at their ends.
   The surface of the DCMEA consists of a nanoporous membrane that acts as
   a homogenous cell substrate, thus avoiding any topographical guidance of
   the cells. It is adhered to a polydimethylsiloxane layer with four
   electrode channels embedded in it, using a novel plasma bonding method.
   A transparent polymer ground plate connects the channels to the silver
   electrodes as shown in Fig. 1. This MEA allows for the stimulation of
   the cells with stationary, non-homogenous electric fields, e.g. to
   simulate the electrical environment near wounds in vitro. It has been
   proposed in the literature that intracellular ions are involved during
   cell migration. The DCMEA can be used to simulate in vitro electric
   fields to investigate intracellular ion changes. By loading cells with
   ion specific fluorescence dyes, real-time ion kinetic changes can
   directly be carried out on DCMEA. These studies will be performed by
   using a time lapse video microscope. In this paper we present the
   detailed fabrication and testing of the new DCMEA. Results on
   intracellular ion flows will be presented using this DCMEA. (C) 2010

Title = {{Regulatory polymorphisms in the bovine Ankyrin 1 gene promoter are
   associated with tenderness and intramuscular fat content}},
Journal = {{BMC GENETICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recent QTL and gene expression studies have highlighted
   ankyrins as positional and functional candidate genes for meat quality.
   Our objective was to characterise the promoter region of the bovine
   ankyrin 1 gene and to test polymorphisms for association with sensory
   and technological meat quality measures.
   Results: Seven novel promoter SNPs were identified in a 1.11 kb region
   of the ankyrin 1 promoter in Angus, Charolais and Limousin bulls (n = 15
   per breed) as well as 141 crossbred beef animals for which meat quality
   data was available. Eighteen haplotypes were inferred with significant
   breed variation in haplotype frequencies. The five most frequent SNPs
   and the four most frequent haplotypes were subsequently tested for
   association with sensory and technological measures of meat quality in
   the crossbred population. SNP1, SNP3 and SNP4 (which were subsequently
   designated regulatory SNPs) and SNP5 were associated with traits that
   contribute to sensorial and technological measurements of tenderness and
   texture; Haplotype 1 and haplotype 4 were oppositely correlated with
   traits contributing to tenderness (P < 0.05). While no single SNP was
   associated with intramuscular fat (IMF), a clear association with
   increased IMF and juiciness was observed for haplotype 2.
   Conclusion: The conclusion from this study is that alleles defining
   haplotypes 2 and 4 could usefully contribute to marker SNP panels used
   to select individuals with improved IMF/juiciness or tenderness in a
   genome-assisted selection framework.}},

Abstract = {{Progressing tumors in humans and mice are frequently infiltrated by a
   highly heterogeneous population of inflammatory myeloid-cells that
   contribute to tumor growth. Among these cells, inflammatory Gr-1(+)
   monocytes display a high developmental plasticity in response to
   specific microenvironmental signals, leading to diverse immune
   functions. These observations raise the question of the immune
   mechanisms by which inflammatory monocytes may contribute to tumor
   development. In this study, we found that adoptive transfer of normal
   inflammatory Gr-1(+) monocytes in tumor-bearing mice promotes tumor
   growth. In this tumoral environment, these monocytes can differentiate
   into tolerogenic dendritic cells ( DCs) that produce IL-10 and potently
   induce regulatory T cell responses in vivo. Moreover, diverting the
   differentiation of Gr-1(+) monocytes into tolerogenic DCs by forced
   expression of IL-10 soluble receptor and IL-3 in tumor cells improves
   host immunosurveillance by reducing the regulatory T cell frequency and
   by inducing immunogenic DCs in the tumor. As a consequence, tumor growth
   is strongly reduced. Our findings indicate that Gr-1(+) monocytes
   represent a valuable target for innovative immunotherapeutic strategies
   against cancer. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 7165-7173.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of substrate stiffness on the beating rate, force
   of contraction, and cytoskeletal structure of embryonic chicken cardiac
   myocytes by culturing them on laminin-coated polyacrylamide (PA)
   substrates. Cells cultured on PA substrates with elasticity comparable
   to that of the native myocardium (18 kPa) exhibited the highest beating
   rate during the first few days of culture. The initial beating rate of
   individual cells on all the substrates varied significantly but began to
   converge within 5 days. We also examined the focal adhesions (FAs) and
   cytoskeletal structure on different substrates via confocal microscopy
   and found a higher percentage of FAs on tissue culture (TC) plastic
   dishes compared with the softer PA gels. Furthermore, highly aligned
   sarcomeric striations were clearly visible on 18 kPa, 50 kPa, and TC
   dish, whereas cells on 1 kPa only showed nonaligned diffused striations.
   The force of contraction on these substrates was measured using a
   micro-electromechanical system force sensor, which showed that the force
   of contraction for the cells on TC dishes (F = 71.30 +/- 6.38 nN) was
   significantly larger than those cultured on the 18-kPa PA gel (F = 30.16
   +/- 3.83 nN). This is most likely due to the formation of higher
   percentage of FAs on the TC dishes compared with fewer FAs on the softer
   gels. Our cumulative findings can have a significant impact on the
   design of 3D cardiac tissue engineered scaffolds. (C) 2010 Wiley

Abstract = {{This review outlines the use of one-dimensional nanostructures (1D-NS)
   for the detection of biomolecules on a chip. The materials discussed
   here include carbon nanotubes, metallic and semiconducting nanowires and
   nanochannels. While nanotubes and naowires have predominantly been used
   as electrical detectors, nanochannels are promising frameworks for
   optical detection in applications such as separation, preconcentration
   and DNA mapping. The primary expectation for all the three types of
   1D-NS lies in the promise for ultimate single molecule detection.
   Furthermore, the electrical double layer governs the physics behind
   biosensing in all the three systems. The review starts by shedding light
   on the advantages arising due to the use of 1D nanostructures, followed
   by a discussion of fundamental aspects such as double layer effects and
   sensing methodologies. After this, the three kinds of 1D-NS are
   introduced. The main focus of the review is an in-depth analysis of the
   current achievements in the field and the major challenges that are to
   be overcome for the widespread use of such nanostructures in
   applications such as lab-on-a-chip devices and point-of-care
   diagnostics. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studied the efficiency of electrocoagulation/electroflotation
   in removing colour from synthetic and real textile wastewater by using
   aluminium and iron electrodes in an external-loop airlift reactor of 20
   L. The disperse dye is a mixture of Yellow terasil 4G. Red terasil 343
   150\% and Blue terasil 3R02, the reactive dye is a mixture of Red S3B
   195, Yellow SPD, Blue BRFS. For disperse dye, the removal efficiency was
   better using aluminium electrodes, whereas, the iron electrodes showed
   more efficiency for removing colour for reactive dye and mixed synthetic
   dye. Both for disperse, reactive and mixed dye. 40 mA cm(-2) and 20 min
   were respectively the optimal current density and electrolysis time. 7.5
   was an optimal initial pH for both reactive and mixed synthetic dye and
   6.2 was an optimal initial pH for disperse dye. The colour efficiency
   reached in general 90\%. The results showed also that Red and Blue
   disappeared quickly comparatively to the Yellow component both for
   reactive and disperse dyes. The real textile wastewater was then used.
   Three effluents were also used: disperse, reactive and the mixture. The
   colour efficiency is between 70 and 90\% and COD efficiency reached
   78\%. The specific electrical energy consumption per kg dye removed
   (E-dye) in optimal conditions for real effluent was calculated. 170
   kWh/kg(dye) was required for a reactive dye, 120 kWh/kg(dye) for
   disperse and 50 kWh/kg(dye) for the mixture. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background. There is a paucity of good studies evaluating the impact of
   calcineurin inhibitors on posttransplantation outcome in hepatitis C
   virus (HCV)-infected liver transplant (LT) recipients.
   Methods. We sought to determine whether there are differences on
   posttransplantation survival and histologic recurrence in HCV-LT
   recipients based on initial immunosuppression (IS) by conducting a
   prospective study comparing tacrolimus (Tac) versus cyclosporine-based
   IS in patients undergoing LT between 2001 and 2007. Protocol liver
   biopsies were performed.
   Results. Baseline characteristics (demographics, liver function at LT,
   genotype distribution, donor, surgery, and IS except for the type of
   calcineurin inhibitor) did not differ between groups. Severe disease
   (defined as bridging fibrosis, cirrhosis, cholestatic hepatitis, or
   allograft loss or death because of recurrent disease in the first year)
   was present in 67 of 253 (26.5\%) and was equally distributed in the CsA
   and Tac groups (27\% vs. 26\%; P=0.68). Two thirds of protocol biopsies
   performed at 1 year showed some fibrosis without differences between CsA
   and Tac groups (75\% vs. 70\%). Advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis and
   cirrhosis) was diagnosed in 30\% CsA and 24.5\% Tac patients (P=NS). No
   differences in survival at 1 and 7 years were observed (83\% and 67\%
   vs. 78\% and 64\%, respectively, P=0.4). In summary, in patients
   undergoing LT for HCV-related liver disease, posttransplantation outcome
   is not related to the calcineurin inhibitor used.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the sorption behavior of cesium was investigated
   in Ain Oussera soil around the Es-Salam reactor facility. This study was
   conducted using batch method under different physicochemical conditions
   including contact time, ionic strength, pH, solid/liquid ratio and
   temperature. The results showed that sorption followed
   pseudo-second-order kinetics with a good regression coefficients
   (R(2)=0.999). The activation energies were 11.26 and 15.21 kJ mol(-1)
   which correspond to ion-exchange-type sorption mechanism. The adsorption
   was favored at low temperature and it was exothermic (Delta H(0) <0,
   with average value of -1.97 kJ mol(-1)) and spontaneous (Delta G degrees
   < 0, with average value of -11.97 kJ mol(-1) at 23 degrees C and -13.2
   kJ mol(-1) at 60 degrees C). The presence of competing cations such as
   K(+) and Ca(2+) ions in groundwater can significantly reduce the Cs
   adsorption onto soil. Desorption reaction was also investigated using
   three reagents with different ionic strengths (deionized water,
   groundwater and 0.1 M KCl solution). The results showed that Cs ions
   were preferentially distributed onto high affinity sorption sites. (C)

Abstract = {{The mammalian circadian system is composed of multiple peripheral clocks
   that are synchronized by a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic
   nuclei of the hypothalamus. This system keeps track of the external
   world rhythms through entrainment by various time cues, such as the
   light-dark cycle and the feeding schedule. Alterations of photoperiod
   and meal time modulate the phase coupling between central and peripheral
   oscillators. In this study, we used real-time quantitative PCR to assess
   circadian clock gene expression in the liver and pituitary gland from
   mice raised under various photoperiods, or under a temporal restricted
   feeding protocol. Our results revealed unexpected differences between
   both organs. Whereas the liver oscillator always tracked meal time, the
   pituitary circadian clockwork showed an intermediate response, in
   between entrainment by the light regimen and the feeding-fasting rhythm.
   The same composite response was also observed in the pituitary gland
   from adrenalectomized mice under daytime restricted feeding, suggesting
   that circulating glucocorticoids do not inhibit full entrainment of the
   pituitary clockwork by meal time. Altogether our results reveal further
   aspects in the complexity of phase entrainment in the circadian system,
   and suggest that the pituitary may host oscillators able to integrate
   multiple time cues.}},

Abstract = {{Arboreal habitats pose unique challenges for locomotion as a result of
   their narrow cylindrical surfaces and discontinuities between branches.
   Decreased diameter of branches increases compliance, which can pose
   additional challenges, including effects on stability and energy
   damping. However, the combined effects of substrate diameter and
   compliance are poorly understood for any animal. We quantified
   performance, kinematics and substrate deformation while boa constrictors
   (Boa constrictor) climbed vertical ropes with three diameters (3, 6 and
   9 mm) and four tensions (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 body weights). Mean
   forward velocity decreased significantly with both decreased diameter
   and increased compliance. Both diameter and compliance had numerous
   effects on locomotor kinematics, but diameter had larger and more
   pervasive effects than compliance. Locomotion on the largest diameter
   had a larger forward excursion per cycle, and the locomotor mode and
   gripping strategy differed from that on the smaller diameters. On larger
   diameters, snakes primarily applied opposing forces at the same location
   on the rope to grip. By contrast, on smaller diameters forces were
   applied in opposite directions at different locations along the rope,
   resulting in increased rope deformation. Although energy is likely to be
   lost during deformation, snakes might use increased surface deformation
   as a strategy to enhance their ability to grip.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate whether a single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) +874T/A of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) correlates
   with response to immunosuppressive therapy. Amplification refractory
   mutation system-polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the
   polymorphic segments of the IFN-gamma +874T/A gene in the samples
   obtained from 54 patients with aplastic anemia and 51 healthy adults.
   Further, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to assay IFN-gamma
   levels in the blood plasma of 35 patients with severe aplastic anemia
   before immune suppression therapy and 20 healthy blood donors. The
   results showed that the frequency of IFN-gamma +874 TT genotype in
   patients with aplastic anemia was significantly higher than the
   corresponding frequency in the healthy adults (42.6\% vs. 17.6\%, chi(2)
   = 13.78, p = 0. 01). The response rate in severe aplastic anemia
   patients with increased IFN-gamma levels in the blood plasma was higher
   than that in severe aplastic anemia patients with decreased IFN-gamma
   levels in the blood plasma (73.7\% vs. 25.0\%, p<0.05). Of the 35
   patients with severe aplastic anemia, 15 showed the IFN-gamma +874 TT
   genotype, whereas response in 11 patients, the high response rate was
   significantly in the favor of the IFN-gamma +874 TT genotype (73.3\% vs.
   IFN-gamma + 874 non-TT 35\%, p<0.05). In conclusion, the IFN-gamma +874
   T/A gene polymorphism may be correlated with response to
   immunosuppressive therapy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. A cross-sectional study comparing normal subjects and
   patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with sciatica.
   Objective. To simultaneously measure the isokinetic muscle strength of
   the trunk, knees, and ankles in both groups.
   Summary of Background Data. Coordination between the trunk and lower
   extremity muscles is important for normal physical activity. Reduced
   trunk and knee muscle strength have been reported in patients with lower
   level LDH; however, ankle performance in these patients is still
   unknown.
   Methods. We recruited 43 normal subjects as controls and 33 patients
   with lower level LDH with sciatica. The isokinetic strength of the
   trunk, knees, and ankles was measured at 2 velocities in random order:
   60 degrees/s and 120 degrees/s, and 60 degrees/s and 180 degrees/s for
   trunk and ankle strength and for knee strength, respectively.
   Results. The isokinetic trunk strength was significantly lower in the
   LDH group irrespective of test modes or velocity. Despite unilateral
   sciatica or test modes and velocity, the unilateral knee strength was
   significantly lower in the LDH group than that in the control group.
   Knee extension torque was also found to be significantly lower in the
   limbs with sciatica than in those without sciatica at the testing
   velocity of 180 degrees/s (80.25 +/- 24.88 vs. 95.42 +/- 26.29 Nm, P <
   0.05). Irrespective of unilateral sciatica or test velocity, ankle
   plantar flexion torque revealed to be significantly lower in the LDH
   group than the control group; however, dorsiflexion torque was not
   different. Significant correlations were demonstrated among the total
   muscle strength of the trunk, knees, and ankles in both groups.
   Conclusion. Besides the lower trunk strength, concurrent lower
   unilateral knee and ankle plantar flexion but not dorsiflexion strength
   was demonstrated in the LDH subjects with unilateral sciatica,
   regardless of its location. As compared to the limbs without sciatica,
   an additional 14\% reduction of knee extension torque at 180 degrees/s
   was found in the limbs with sciatica in the LDH patients.}},

Title = {{VPAL: Video Packet Adaptation Layer for reliable video multicast over

Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a scheme, called Video Packet Adaptation Layer
   (VPAL), for reliable video multicast over the IEEE 802.11n WLAN. VPAL is
   composed of (1) Raptor coding for reliable video transmission, (2)
   header compression and (3) packet aggregation, both for efficient video
   transmission. Most of the VPAL functionalities reside above the emerging
   IEEE 802.11n Medium Access Control (MAC) layer while the packet
   aggregation requires some changes in the MAC functionalities. The
   reliability of the video multicast under a strict delay requirement, is
   provided by achieving the target error probability of video packets,
   which is done by controlling both the Raptor code rate and the physical
   (PHY) layer transmission rate. This strategy can provide a satisfactory
   quality of multicast video service irrespective of the channel condition
   with a minimum bandwidth use. New features of the 802.11n MAC are
   utilized for the channel status feedback from the users. Redundant
   header fields in the video packets are compressed, and then these
   packets are aggregated to further reduce the protocol overheads. We also
   consider a reduced version of VPAL which does not require any change in
   the MAC functionalities and simply works with the IEEE 802.11n MAC. The
   performance of the proposed systems is comparatively evaluated in terms
   of the perceived video quality, i.e., peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
   as well as the amount of required resources via both numerical analysis
   and simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   implementation and interpretation of this important legislation. A major
   goal of the Act is to improve access to affordable, quality health care.
   An important element in achieving this goal will be to learn from
   patients' experiences and build the foundation for evidence-based
   personalized medicine. This will require a partnership among
   researchers, clinicians, policy makers and regulators, and patients to
   design an integrated information network system that will be the basis
   for providing the right treatment for the right patient in the right
   place at the right time. In this review, we will discuss the salient
   points of the Act that specifically affect cancer research and care, as
   well as highlight opportunities for oncologists and researchers to play
   a primary role in developing a health care system that includes
   personalized medicine approaches that will in turn enhance the
   likelihood of achieving the goals and objectives of the health care
   reform act. Clin Cancer Res; 16(24); 5987-96. (C) 2010 AACR.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Active magnetic regenerator (AMR) refrigerators represent an alternative
   to vapor compression technology that relies on the magnetocaloric effect
   in a solid refrigerant. Magnetocaloric materials are in development and
   properties are reported regularly. Recently, there has been an emphasis
   on developing materials with a high entropy change with magnetization
   while placing lower emphasis on the adiabatic temperature change. This
   work uses model magnetocaloric materials and a numerical AMR model to
   predict how the temperature change and entropy change with magnetization
   interact and how they affect the performance of a practical system. The
   distribution of the magnetocaloric effect as a function of temperature
   was also studied. It was found that the adiabatic temperature change in
   a magnetocaloric material can be more important than the isothermal
   entropy change for certain conditions. A material that exhibits a sharp
   peak in isothermal entropy change was shown to produce a significantly
   lower cooling power than a material with a wide peak in a practical AMR
   system. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{This work elaborates upon two robust models of gradient elasticity and
   gradient plasticity, and one gradient model of heat transfer, as
   originally advocated by the second author in the 1980's. The objective
   is, after recalling the links between these models and existing
   generalized continuum theories as developed in the 1960's and
   subsequently, to apply the same methodology to the case of diffusion
   with a view to establishing generalized transport equations. Aifantis
   double diffusivity and conductivity theory that provides generalized
   mass or heat transfer equations is compared to micromorphic-type
   hyper-temperature and micro-entropy proposals. The double temperature
   and the micromorphic thermal models are shown to lead to equations more
   general that Cattaneo's. The sign of the coefficient of the second
   time-derivative of temperature is found to differ according to both
   approaches. The double temperature model contains a fourth space
   derivative term not present in the micromorphic models. Such generalized
   equations can be useful, for example, in the interpretation of recent
   femtosecond laser experiments on metals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In a previous study, we found that metaphase chromosomes are formed by
   thin plates, and here we have applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
   friction force measurements at the nanoscale (nanotribology) to analyze
   the properties of these planar structures in aqueous media at room
   temperature. Our results show that high concentrations of NaCl and EDTA
   and extensive digestion with protease and nuclease enzymes cause plate
   denaturation. Nanotribology studies show that native plates under
   structuring conditions (5 mM Mg2+) have a relatively high friction
   coefficient (mu approximate to 0.3), which is markedly reduced when high
   concentrations of NaCl or EDTA are added (mu approximate to 0.1). This
   lubricant effect can be interpreted considering the electrostatic
   repulsion between DNA phosphate groups and the AFM tip. Protease
   digestion increases the friction coefficient (mu approximate to 0.5),
   but the highest friction is observed when DNA is cleaved by micrococcal
   nuclease (mu approximate to 0.9), indicating that DNA is the main
   structural element of plates. Whereas nuclease-digested plates are
   irreversibly damaged after the friction measurement, native plates can
   absorb kinetic energy from the AFM tip without suffering any damage.
   These results suggest that plates are formed by a flexible and
   mechanically resistant two-dimensional network which allows the safe
   storage of DNA during mitosis.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports carbon nanotube (CNT)-based immunosensors for the
   detection of two types of microorganisms, bacteria and viruses. The
   pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the bacteriophage T7 were selected
   as model for bacteria and viruses, respectively, while E. coli K12 and
   the bacteriophage MS2 were used to assess the selectivity of the
   biosensor. The transduction element consisted of single-walled carbon
   nanotubes aligned in parallel bridging two gold electrodes to function
   as a chemiresistive biosensor. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
   were functionalized with specific antibodies (Ab) for the different
   microorganisms by covalent immobilization to the non-covalently bound
   1-pyrene butanoic acid succinimidyl ester. A significant increase in the
   resistance of the device was observed when the biosensor was exposed to
   E. coli O157:H7 whole cells or lysates with a limit of detection of
   10(5) and 10(3) CFU (colony forming units)/mL, corresponding to 10(3)
   and 10(1) CFU/chip, respectively, while no response was observed when
   the biosensor was exposed to the E. coli K12. In the case of virus
   detection, a significant resistance increase was detected due to
   interaction of the bacteriophages with the Abs, with a limit of
   detection of 10(3) PFU/mL corresponding to 10(1) PFU/chip and excellent
   selectivity against MS2 bacteriophage. The sensor exhibited a fast
   response time of similar to 5 min in the case of bacteriophage
   detection, while the response time for the detection of bacteria was 60

Abstract = {{Cadmium (Cd), a highly toxic environmental pollutant, induces hepatic
   disorders. The present study has been undertaken to investigate the
   protective role of the fruit extract of Terminalia arjuna (AE) against
   Cd-induced oxidative liver impairment using a murine model. Cadmium
   reduced hepatocytes viability, activated MAPKs, disturbed Bcl-2 family
   protein balance, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and
   induced apoptotic cell death by mitochondria dependent caspases-3
   activation. AE treatment, however, suppressed all the apoptotic actions
   of cadmium. Similarly, mice treated with cadmium altered a number
   biomarkers related to hepatic oxidative stress and other apoptotic
   indices. Oral administration of AE both pre and post prevented all the
   Cd-induced hepatic damages.
   Results suggest that Cd-induced hepatic dysfunction and apoptosis might
   be triggered by the ROS formation and mediated via the activation of
   MAPK family proteins. AE treatment however, reduced Cd-induced oxidative
   stress, attenuated the changes in MAPK families and
   mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic signaling pathways. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Benchmark stem densities for forests and woodlands in south-eastern
   Australia under conditions of relatively little modification by humans
   since European settlement}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{260}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Estimates of forest and woodland structure prior to major periods of
   modification (e.g. prior to European settlement) are routinely used to
   inform decisions relating to biodiversity conservation, silviculture and
   carbon sequestration potential in natural forests and woodlands. The
   techniques used to derive these estimates often demand that data be
   collected from specific geographic locations (e.g. locations for which
   historic survey records exist, where pollen accumulates, or where there
   is little modification by humans since European settlement) and
   therefore are often inherently biased. In this study we predicted
   numbers of trees by diameter class for several widespread forest and
   woodland types in south-eastern Australia under conditions of relatively
   little modification by humans since European settlement. To do this we
   fitted Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) separately to counts of stems
   in eight diameter classes from 495 plots using explanatory variables
   representing human modification, environmental variation and natural
   disturbances. We predicted stem densities under conditions of relatively
   little modification by humans since European settlement from these
   models by holding the significant explanatory variables representing
   modification by humans at minimum observed values. We compared these
   predictions with published estimates of pre-European stem densities and
   estimates that we derived for stands at theoretical equilibrium using
   the quotient of diminution (a). Our mean predictions were broadly
   comparable with estimates derived from both of these sources; however,
   we appeared to over-estimate numbers of stems in the smaller diameter
   classes for some vegetation alliances. A key outcome of this research
   and rarely reflected in other techniques used to predict pre-European
   forest structure - was the amount of variation in stem numbers even
   within a single diameter class and vegetation alliance. For example. in
   the white box vegetation alliance, flat parts of the landscape supported
   5 times the number of large trees (>80 cm DBH) found on upper slopes
   under conditions of relatively little modification by humans since
   European settlement. Our results therefore suggest that these forests
   and woodlands are more structurally heterogeneous than typically
   reflected in pre-European estimates and vegetation alliance should not
   be the unit for managing these stands. The methodology we present is
   applicable in many forests where the objective is to predict forest
   structure under conditions of relatively little modification by humans.

Abstract = {{Rainwater harvesting (RWH), the small-scale collection and storage of
   runoff to augment groundwater stores, has been seen as a solution to the
   deepening groundwater crisis in India. However, hydrological impacts of
   RWH in India are not well understood, particularly at the larger
   catchment-scale. A key element to grasping RWH impact involves
   understanding the generated recharge variability in time and space,
   which is the result of variability in rainfall-runoff and efficiency of
   RWH structures. Yet there are very few reported empirical studies of the
   impact of RWH. Catchment-scale impacts are best studied using a water
   balance model, which would require a basic level of field data and
   understanding of the variability. This study reports the results of a
   2-year field study in the 476 km(2) semi-arid Arvari River catchment,
   where over 366 RWH structures have been built since 1985. Difficulties
   associated with working in semiarid regions include data scarcity.
   Potential recharge estimates from seven RWH storages, across three
   different types and in six landscape positions, were calculated using
   the water balance method. These estimates were compared with recharge
   estimates from monitored water levels in 29 dug wells using the water
   table fluctuation method. The average daily potential recharge from RWH
   structures varied between 12 and 52 mm/day, while estimated actual
   recharge reaching the groundwater ranged from 3 to 7 mm/day. The large
   difference between recharge estimates could be explained through soil
   storage, local groundwater mounding beneath structures and a large
   lateral transmissivity in the aquifer. Overall, approximately 7\% of
   rainfall is recharged by RWH in the catchment, which was similar in the
   comparatively wet and dry years of the field analysis. There were key
   differences between RWH structures, due to engineering design and
   location. These results indicate that recharge from RWH affects the
   local groundwater table, but also has potential to move laterally and
   impact surrounding areas. However, the greatest weakness in such
   analysis is the lack of information available on aquifer
   characteristics, in addition to geology and soil type. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   Alan cared about helping his students and that his teaching was well
   integrated with his beliefs about how students learn physics and how
   teachers can best assist students. Learning about Alan's beliefs and
   motivations changed our thinking about what might constitute effective
   professional development for Alan and other TAs. We advocate a new

Abstract = {{Metal-graphene contact is a key interface in graphene-based device

   calculations to twelve metal-graphene interfaces and investigate the
   detailed interface atomic and electronic structures of physisorption and
   chemisorption interfaces. For physisorption interfaces (Ag, Al, Cu, Cd,

   energy-level shifts are shown to be two primary factors determining
   graphene's doping types and densities. For chemisorption interfaces (Ni,

   energy-level shifts and hybridized states' repulsive interactions lead
   to a band gap opening with metallic gap states. For practical

   modulate graphene's energy-levels and the corresponding control of

Abstract = {{Objective To assess sedative and cardiopulmonary effects of
   premedication with a medetomidine-buprenorphine or
   acepromazine-buprenorphine combination in dogs anesthetized with
   propofol and isoflurane.
   Design Randomized controlled clinical trial.
   Animals-90 dogs undergoing routine surgical and diagnostic procedures.
   Procedures Dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 premedication groups:
   group 1 (acepromazine, 0.03 mg/kg {[}0.014 mg/lb], IM; buprenorphine,
   0.02 mg/kg {[}0.009 mg/lb{[}, IM), 2 (medetomidine, 5 mu g/kg {[}2.3 mu
   g/lb], IM; buprenorphine, 0.02 mg/kg, IM), or 3 (medetomidine, 10 mu
   g/kg {[}4.5 mu g/lb], IM; buprenorphine, 0.02 mg/kg, IM). Anesthesia was
   induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Simple
   descriptive scores for sedation were assigned 15 minutes (groups 2 and
   31 and 30 minutes (group 1) after premedication administration. Basic
   cardiopulmonary data were recorded throughout the anesthetic period.
   Times to recovery from anesthesia were recorded.
   Results Sedation scores did not differ significantly among groups. Mean
   and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower and heart rate
   was significantly higher in group 1 than in the other groups. Mean
   end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 was significantly lower and
   respiratory rate was significantly higher in group 1 than in the other
   groups. There were no significant differences in anesthetic recovery
   times between groups.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Results suggested that either
   acepromazine or medetomidine could be used in combination with
   buprenorphine for premedication of dogs anesthetized with propofol and
   isoflurane for routine surgical and diagnostic procedures. Arterial
   blood pressure was better maintained with the medetomidine-buprenorphine
   combinations, but tissue perfusion was not investigated. (J Am Vet Med

Abstract = {{In the present study, we report the study by a combination of
   electrophoretically mediated microanalysis method with a partial
   technique for screening alpha-glucosidase inhibitors from 21 traditional
   Chinese drugs. In the setup, substrates and enzymes were introduced into
   the capillary as distinct plugs, the electrophoretic conditions for
   enzyme reaction and separation of substrates and products were different
   in the composition and pH of the background electrolyte, which make more
   enzyme reactions possible. Part of the capillary was filled with the
   optimal buffer for the enzyme reaction, whereas the rest was filled with
   the background electrolyte optimal for the separation of substrates and
   products. With the optimal condition, the Michaelis-Menten constant and
   the inhibitive mechanism of acarbose were studied, which were in the
   same range as previous literature data. Furthermore, the inhibitory
   ratios of enzymatic activity (IRE) of 21 traditional Chinese drugs were
   determined. The classical method has superiorities over traditional
   assay methods, which not only minimizes the false-positive results but
   also simplifies the experimental processes. It could be used for
   screening inhibitors in natural extract. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{165}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{819-826}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption of estrone was identified in microfiltration membrane filters
   with 0.1-0.45 mu m nominal pore sizes. This phenomenon is of concern as
   it may lead to distortion when such filters are used to process estrone
   solutions prior to chromatography analysis, such as in slurry-type
   photocataltytic degradation studies. The adsorption of estrone was
   comparatively assessed in a variety of membrane filters, and
   considerable adsorption was observed in nylon (NYL), polypropylene (PP),
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and cellulose acetate (CA) filters. While
   estrone adsorption gradually approached equilibrium in most filters, it
   maintained at near 100\% in NYL filters during most of the filtration
   process and remained substantial (42.2\%) when the filter capacity was
   reached. This rather unusual phenomenon was investigated, and ascribed
   to the hydrogen bonding between estrone and NYL membranes as
   demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Further studies
   showed that estrone adsorption in NYL membranes could be substantially
   reduced by increasing the pH to facilitate the deprotonation of estrone
   molecules. Similar improvements were obtained in PP and PTFE filters by
   pre-dosing estrone solutions with anhydrous ethanol (1:1, vol:vol). The
   only filter that showed consistently low estrone adsorption (<2.3\%) was
   the 0.45-mu m glass microfibre (GMF) filter.
   GMF and PTFE filters were further selected to process estrone solutions
   in a slurry-type photocatalytic degradation system using P25 (R) TiO2
   photocatalysts. Both types of filters showed satisfactory performance in
   terms of estrone solute recovery, as verified by samples simultaneously
   processed by high-speed centrifuging. It is suggested that caution
   should be taken when using MF membrane filters to process estrone
   aqueous solutions. Although GMF and PTFE filters (with solvent
   pre-dosing) may be appropriate to use, verifications on solute recovery
   are highly recommended. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional solutions of the electric current, magnetic field and
   magneto elastic stress are presented for a magnetic material of a thin
   infinite plate containing an elliptical hole with an edge crack under
   uniform electric current. Using a rational mapping function, the each
   solution is obtained as a closed form. The linear constitutive equation
   is used for the magnetic field and the stress analyses. According to the
   electro-magneto theory, only Maxwell stress is caused as a body force in
   a plate which raises a plane stress state for a thin plate and the
   deformation of the plate thickness. Therefore the magneto elastic stress
   is analyzed using Maxwell stress. No further assumption of the plane
   stress state that the plate is thin is made for the stress analysis,
   though Maxwell stress components are expressed by nonlinear terms. The
   rigorous boundary condition expressed by Maxwell stress components is
   completely satisfied without any linear assumptions on the boundary.
   First, electric current, magnetic field and stress analyses for soft
   ferromagnetic material are carried out and then those analyses for
   paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials are carried out. It is stated
   that the stress components are expressed by the same expressions for
   those materials and the difference is only the magnitude of the
   permeability, though the magnetic fields H-x, H-y are different each
   other in the plates. If the analysis of magnetic field of paramagnetic
   material is easier than that of soft ferromagnetic material, the stress
   analysis may be carried out using the magnetic field for paramagnetic
   material to analyze the stress field, and the results may be applied for
   a soft ferromagnetic material. It is stated that the stress state for
   the magnetic field H-x, H-y, is the same as the pure shear stress state.
   Solving the present magneto elastic stress problem, dislocation and
   rotation terms appear, which makes the present problem complicate.
   Solutions of the magneto elastic stress are nonlinear for the direction
   of electric current. Stresses in the direction of the plate thickness
   are caused and the solution is also obtained. Figures of the magnetic
   field and stress distribution are shown. Stress intensity factors are
   also derived and investigated for the crack length and the electric
   current direction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In an evaluation of a bacteriophage treatment for infection, ten dogs
   were included with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa otitis. Each received,
   directly into the auditory canal of one ear, a single dose of a topical
   preparation containing approximately 1 x 10(5) plaque forming units
   (PFU) of each of 6 bacteriophage strains, active against P. aeruginosa.
   At the time of bacteriophage administration and 48 h later each dog's
   core temperature was taken, its ear was assigned a clinical score
   (higher = worse condition) and aural swabs were taken for bacteriophage
   and P. aeruginosa counts. Forty eight hours after treatment the clinical
   score and P. aeruginosa count of all ears had fallen (mean score fall:
   30.1\%, range 7.7-56.3\%, p < 0.0001; mean count fall: 67\%, range
   29.4-96.8\%, p < 0.001). The bacteriophage counts had risen from the
   administered dose (mean rise: 99.1-fold, range 2.8-433.3-fold). No
   treatment related inflammation or other adverse events were detected
   during the trial period. This is the first report of a veterinary
   clinical trial of a bacteriophage treatment of infection. The results
   show that administration of this topical bacteriophage mixture leads to
   lysis of P. aeruginosa in the ear without apparent toxicity and that it
   has potential to be a convenient and effective treatment for P.
   aeruginosa otitis in dogs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in the gene encoding transforming growth factor-beta receptor
   type II (TGFBR2) have been described in patients with Loeys-Dietz
   syndrome (LDS), Marfan syndrome type 2 (MFS2) and familial thoracic
   aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD). Here, we present a
   comprehensive and quantitative analysis of TGFBR2 expression, turnover
   and TGF-beta-induced Smad and ERK signaling activity for nine mutations
   identified in patients with LDS, MFS2 and TAAD. The mutations had
   different effects on protein stability, internalization and signaling. A
   dominant-negative effect was demonstrated for mutations associated with
   LDS and MFS2. No mutation showed evidence of an immediate
   cell-autonomous paradoxical activation of TGF-beta signaling. There were
   no cell biological differences between mutations described in patients
   with LDS and MFS2. By contrast, R460C, which has been found in familial
   TAAD but not in MFS2 or LDS, showed a less-severe dominant-negative
   effect and retained residual Smad phosphorylation and transcriptional
   activity. TAAD is characterized primarily by thoracic aortic aneurysms
   or dissections. By contrast, MFS2 is characterized by numerous skeletal
   abnormalities, and patients with LDS additionally can display
   craniofacial and other abnormalities. Therefore, our findings suggest
   that the balance between defects in Smad and ERK signaling might be an
   important determinant of phenotypic severity in disorders related to
   mutations in TGFBR2.}},

   of the polymers were estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and
   bulk pyrolysis, which closely depend on molecular structures. Compared
   with that of their linear counterparts having comparable molecular
   weights, the ceramic yields of linear-cyclic PFSX and PFSZ were much
   higher. The pyrolysis process was investigated by lysis character is

   spectra, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectra (Py-GC-MS)
   analysis. The results indicated rather amount of ferrocene-based small
   molecules were formed during the pyrolysis of linear polymers in the
   range of 25-300 degrees C, whereas the existence of crosslinking or
   branched structure in the linear-cyclic polymers prohibited this
   transformation, and therefore, dramatically improved the ceramic yields.

Abstract = {{The NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is
   critical for caspase-1 activation and the proteolytic processing of
   pro-IL-1 beta. However, the mechanism that regulates NLRP3 inflammasome
   activation remains unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that
   tripartite-motif protein 30 (TRIM30) negatively regulates NLRP3
   inflammasome activation. After stimulation with ATP, an agonist of the
   NLRP3 inflammasome, knockdown of TRIM30 enhanced caspase-1 activation
   and increased production of IL-1 beta in both J774 cells and bone
   marrow-derived macrophages. Similarly with ATP, knockdown of TRIM30
   increased caspase-1 activation and IL-1 beta production triggered by
   other NLRP3 inflammasome agonists, including nigericin, monosodium
   urate, and silica. Production of reactive oxygen species was increased
   in TRIM30 knockdown cells, and its increase was required for enhanced
   NLRP3 inflammasome activation, because antioxidant treatment blocked
   excess IL-1 beta production. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM30
   attenuated reactive oxygen species production and NLRP3 inflammasome
   activation. Finally, in a crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent
   peritonitis model, monosodium urate-induced neutrophil flux and IL-1
   beta production was reduced significantly in TRIM30 transgenic mice as
   compared with that in their nontransgenic littermates. Taken together,
   our results indicate that TRIM30 is a negative regulator of NLRP3
   inflammasome activation and provide insights into the role of TRIM30 in
   maintaining inflammatory responses. The Journal of Immunology, 2010,

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND One-carbon metabolism plays a critical role in DNA
   methylation and DNA synthesis Variants of genes involved in one-carbon
   metabolism may result in aberrant methylation and/or DNA synthesis
   inhibition and ultimately modulate the initiation and progression of
   tumors In this study the authors hypothesized that polymorphisms in one
   carbon metabolism related genes may contribute to the prognosis of
   nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) METHODS The authors screened 57
   potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 11
   candidate genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and genotyped them in
   a cohort of 568 NSCLC patients by using illumina Golden Gate platform
   The Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test and Cox proportional hazards
   model were used for survival analyses RESULTS Variant alleles were
   significantly associated with favorable survivals of NSCLC for MTR
   rs3768160 A>G (allelic hazards ratio {[}HR] 0 78 95\% confidence
   interval {[}Cl] 0 62 0 98) MTRR rs2966952 G>A (allelic HR 084 95\% CI 0
   71-0 99) and DHFR rs1650697 G>A (allelic HR 083 95\% CI 0 70-0 99) and
   with unfavorable prognosis for MTHFD1 rs1950902 G>A with borderline
   significance (allelic HR 118 95\% Cl 0 99 140) In addition the combined
   genotypes of these four SNPs showed a locus-dosage effect on NSCLC
   survival (P-trend = 6 9 x 10(-5)) In the final multivariate Cox
   regression model combined genotypes based on 3 categories may be an
   independent prognostic factor for NSCLC with adjusted trend HR of 0 78
   (95\% Cl 0 66-0 92) CONCLUSION, Genetic variants in one-carbon
   metabolism pathway may be candidate biomarkers for NSCLC prognosis

Abstract = {{The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a basic
   helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim domain transcription factor, which is
   activated by various xenobiotic ligands. AHR is known to be abundant in
   liver tissue and to be associated with hepatic steatosis. However, it
   has not yet been elucidated how the activation of AHR promotes hepatic
   steatosis. The aim of this study is to clarify the role of AHR in
   hepatic steatosis. The intraperitoneal injection of 3-methylcholanthrene
   (3MC), a potent AHR ligand, into C57BL/6J mice significantly increased
   the levels of triglycerides and six long-chain monounsaturated fatty
   acids in the livers of mice, resulting in hepatic microvesicular
   steatosis. 3MC significantly enhanced the expression level of fatty acid
   translocase (FAT), a factor regulating the uptake of long-chain fatty
   acids into hepatocytes, in the liver. In an in vitro experiment using
   human hepatoma HepG2 cells, 3MC increased the expression level of FAT,
   and the downregulation of AHR by AHR siRNA led to the suppression of
   3MC-induced FAT expression. In addition, the mRNA level of peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, an upstream factor of FAT,
   was increased in the livers of 3MC-treated mice. Taking together, AHR
   activation induces hepatic microvesicular steatosis by increasing the
   expression level of FAT. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the long-term consequences of asphyxial cardiac arrest for
   hippocampal cell proliferation in rats to evaluate if the
   ischaemia-induced degenerated CA1 region may be repopulated by
   endogenous (stem) cells. Studies were performed in an asphyxial cardiac
   arrest model with 5 minutes of asphyxiation and three different survival
   times: 7, 21, and 90 clays. Sham-operated non-asphyxiated rats served as
   control. Cell proliferation was studied by labeling dividing cells with
   5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU). The neurodegenerative/regenerative
   pattern at single cell levels was monitored by immunohistochemistry.
   Alterations of gene expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative
   RT-PCR. Analysis of BrdU-incorporation demonstrated an increase at 7, 21
   as well as 90 days after global ischaemia in the hippocampal CA1
   pyramidal cell layer. Similar results were found in the dentate gyrus.
   Differentiation of BrdU-positive cells, investigated by cell
   phenotype-specific double fluorescent labeling, showed increased
   neurogenesis only in the dentate gyrus of animals surviving the cardiac
   arrest for 7 days. The majority of newcomers, especially in the damaged
   CA1 region, consisted of glial cells. Moreover, asphyxia seemed to be
   able to induce the migration of microglia and astroglia from adjacent
   areas into the damaged area and/or the activation of resident cells. In
   addition, we show microglia proliferation/activation even 90 days after
   cardiac arrest. This morphological finding was confirmed by PCR
   analysis. The results indicate that asphyxia triggers cell proliferation
   in general and gliogenesis in particular - a possible pro-reparative
   event. Furthermore, from the finding of microglia proliferation up to 90
   days after insult we conclude that delayed cell death processes take
   place which should be considered for further therapy strategies. (C)

Abstract = {{A 11-year survey on helminth intestinal infection of horses was done in
   seven provinces of southern Poland. 21,641 faecal samples were collected
   from horses of different age, sex, breed and management system
   originating from 84 farms. Age was the major factor influencing the
   cyathostome egg excretion, the maximum being observed in yearlings and
   second year horses. Parascaris was found mostly in foals and yearlings.
   The main factor for Anoplocephala was the access to pasture. The level
   of cyathostome egg shedding (EPG) could be related to sex (geldings had
   higher values of EPG), breed (Thoroughbred had higher EPG than other
   breeds), and type of farm (large farms had higher EPG than others). The
   change during the survey of anthelmintic treatment (from benzimidazole
   or pyrantel embonate to avermectins) was associated with lower
   cyathostome EPG, and this was probably due to partial resistance to
   benzimidazole. The seasonality of egg shedding (lowest from November to
   January included) was due to management (leaving the pasture to stable,
   anthelmintic treatment in October). The influence of climate on EPG was
   significant but small, annual rainfalls and average temperature being
   associated negatively and positively, respectively, with high
   cyathostome EPG. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A sea urchin-like carbon (UC) material with high surface area (416 m(2)
   g(-1)), adequate electrical conductivity (59.6 S cm(-1)) and good
   chemical stability was prepared by growing carbon nanotubes onto
   mesoporous carbon hollow spheres. A uniform dispersion of Pt
   nanoparticles was then anchored on the UC, where the Pt nanoparticles
   were prepared using benzylamine as the stabilizer. For this Pt loaded
   carbon, cyclic voltammogram measurements showed an exceptionally high
   electrochemically active surface area (EAS) (114.8 m(2) g(-1)) compared
   to the commonly used commercial E-TEK catalyst (65.2 m(2) g(-1)). The
   durability test demonstrates that the carbon used as a support exhibited
   minor loss in EAS of Pt. Compared to the E-TEK (20 wt\%) cathode
   catalyst, this Pt loaded UC catalyst has greatly enhanced catalytic
   activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction, less cathode flooding and
   considerably improved performance, resulting in an enhancement of ca.
   37\% in power density compared with that of E-TEK. Based on the results
   obtained, the UC is an excellent support for Pt nanoparticles used as
   cathode catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Purpose. The impact of lean methodology in i.v. medication processes in
   a children's hospital was studied.
   Methods. Medication orders at a children's hospital were analyzed for 30
   days to identify the specific times when most medications were changed
   or discontinued. Value-stream mapping was used to define the current
   state of preparation and identify non-value-added tasks in the i.v.
   medication preparation and dispensing processes. An optimization model
   was created using specific measurements to establish the optimal number
   of batches and batch preparation times of batches. Returned i.v.
   medications were collected for 7 days before and after implementation of
   the lean process to determine the impact of the lean process changes.
   Results. Patient-days increased from 1,836 during the first collection
   period to 2,017 during the second, and the total number of i.v. doses
   dispensed increased from 8,054 to 9,907. Wasted i.v. doses decreased
   from 1,339 (16.6\% of the total doses dispensed) to 853 (8.6\%). With
   the new process, Nationwide Children's Hospital was projected to realize
   a weekly savings of \$8,197 (\$426,244 annually), resulting in a 2.6\%
   reduction in annual drug expenditure. The annual savings is a
   conservative estimate, due to the 10\% increase in patient-days after
   the lean collection period compared with baseline. The differences in
   wasted doses and their costs were significant (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion. Implementing lean concepts in the i.v. medication
   preparation process had a positive effect on efficiency and drug cost.}},

Title = {{Paleoproterozoic lateritic paleosol-ultra-mature/mature
   quartzite-meta-arkose successions in southern Fennoscandiaintra-orogenic
   stage during the Svecofennian orogeny}},
Journal = {{PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{A Paleoproterozoic lateritic paleosol overlain by ultra-mature/mature
   quartzite is reported for the first time from three localities in the
   Svecofennian province in southern Finland. These are important
   indicators for warm paleoclimate and continental paleoenvironment.
   Ultra-mature quartzites above the lateritic paleosols are overlain by
   matrix-supported conglomerates followed by mature quartzites. These
   latter rocks are related to incipient rifting followed by main rift
   stage starting with increasingly more immature meta-arkose.
   We present a tectonic model in which exhumation, after 1.88-1.87 Ga
   contraction, unroofed plutonic rocks. Volcanism and exhumation-related
   erosion produced deposition of both volcanic and sedimentary material.
   Weathering of these rocks and deposition of ultra-mature/mature
   quartzites took place between 1.87 and 1.85/1.84 Ga followed by rifting
   at 1.84 Ga. Tectonic slicing during basin inversion thrust the prerift
   quartzites and rift-related volcanic and sedimentary rocks over older
   mid-crustal rocks and produced a low-angle stacking system.
   To accommodate voluminous magmatism at deeper crustal levels and
   widespread sedimentation at the surface, we propose that exhumation due
   to faulting followed by stabilization of the upper crust (0-15/20 km)
   occurred simultaneously as the detached hot middle and lower crust
   experienced vertical shortening via ductile flow and extrusion. The ca.
   1.85 Ga paleosol-quartzite successions in southern Fennoscandia have
   many similarities with the widespread ca. 1.7 Ga paleosol-quartzite
   successions in the United States. Both are intra-orogenic, formed on hot
   orogens and have simultaneous magmatism at deeper crustal levels and
   sedimentation at the surface.
   Accretion-type models presented for southern Fennoscandia at 1.87-1.80
   Ga are not compatible with the available data and either far-field
   setting during outboard subduction or a newly formed continental
   interior setting are proposed. Anyhow tectonic models proposed for
   southern Fennoscandia between 1.87 and 1.80 Ga should take into account
   the occurrence of lateritic paleosols and ultra-mature quartzites. (C)

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the primary environmental risk factor in
   the development of nonmelanoma skin cancer, and UVB in particular
   promotes tumor growth through various signaling pathways. Kaempferol, a
   flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, has been
   studied as a chemopreventive agent; however, little is known regarding
   its effects on UVB-induced photo-carcinogenesis. Here, we examined the
   effect of kaempferol on UVB-induced skin inflammation. We found that
   kaempferol suppressed UVB-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein
   expression in mouse skin epidermal JB6 P+ cells and attenuated the
   UVB-induced transcriptional activities of cox-2 and activator protein-1
   (AP-1). Kaempferol attenuated the UVB-induced phosphorylation of several
   mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including ERKs, p38, and
   JNKs, but had no effect on the phosphorylation of the upstream MAPK
   regulator Src. However, in vitro and ex vivo kinase assays demonstrated
   that kaempferol suppressed Src kinase activity. Furthermore, in vivo
   data from mouse skin support the idea that kaempferol suppresses
   UVB-induced COX-2 expression by blocking Src kinase activity. A
   pull-down assay revealed that kaempferol competes with ATP for direct
   binding to Src. Docking data suggest that kaempferol docks easily into
   the ATP-binding site of Src, which is located between the N and the C
   lobes of the kinase domain. Taken together, these results suggest that
   kaempferol is a potent chemopreventive agent against skin cancer through
   its inhibitory interaction with Src. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The study of the in-plane perturbation of a system of two coplanar
   slit-cracks carried out in Part I is specialized to the case where the
   distance between the inner crack fronts is small, or equivalently that
   between the outer fronts large. The limit process involved is complex
   because of appearance of a ``boundary layer{''} in the limiting case
   considered; this boundary layer occurs near the origin in the Fourier
   space used to determine the unknown components of the fundamental kernel
   looked for. A technique of matched asymptotic expansions is used to
   tackle this difficulty.
   The problem is thus reduced to determining two unknown functions only,
   which characterize the ``interactions{''} between the two inner fronts.

Abstract = {{A bismuth-film modified graphite nanofibers-Nafion glassy carbon
   electrode (BiF/GNFs-NA/GCE) was constructed for the simultaneous

   parameters such as deposition potential, deposition time, and bismuth
   ion concentration were optimized for the purpose of determination of
   trace metal ions in 0.10 M acetate buffer solution (pH 4.5). Under
   optimal conditions, based on three times the standard deviation of the
   baseline, the limits of detection were 0.09 mu g L-1 for Cd(II) and 0.02
   mu g L-1 for Pb(II) with a 10 min preconcentration. In addition, the
   BiF/GNFs-NA/GCE displayed good reproducibility and selectivity, making
   it suitable for the simultaneous determination of Cd(II) and Pb(II) in

   time are established. The conditional reliability function, the

   obtained by solving the backward Kolmogorov equation and generalized

   and boundary conditions. The results show that time delay in the

   Chinese yam particles were found by atomic force microscope and

   silver nanoparticles. The wavelength shifts are quantitatively predicted
   based on discrete dipole approximation of the LSPR effects, which are
   sensitive to the local dielectric constant changed by the Chinese yam

   of Pt functionalised MWNTs show that Pt nanoparticles of approximately
   4nm were deposited on the outer tube walls. SEM/EDX results confirm that
   the Pt nanoparticles were mono-sized and evenly distributed. Raman

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber microelectrodes and carbon fiber composite minielectrodes
   (CFM/CFCM) have been generally used for measurements of nitric oxide
   (NO) concentration in chemical and biological systems. The response time
   of a CFM/CFCM is usually from milliseconds to seconds depending on the
   electrode size, the thickness of coating layers on the electrode, and NO
   diffusion coefficients of the coating layers. As a result, the time
   course of recoded current changes (I-t curves) by the CFM/CFCM may be
   different from the actual time course of NO concentration changes (c-t
   curves) if the half-life of NO decay is close to or shorter than the
   response time of the electrode used. This adds complexity to the process
   for determining rate constants of NO decay kinetics from the recorded
   current curves (I-t curves). By computer simulations based on a
   mathematical model, an approximation method was developed for
   determining rate constants of NO decay from the recorded current curves.
   This method was first tested and valuated using a commercial CFCM in
   several simple reaction systems with known rate constants. The response
   time of the CFCM was measured as 4.7 +/- 0.7 s (n = 5). The determined
   rate constants of NO volatilization and NO autoxidation in our
   measurement system at 37 degrees C are (1.9 +/- 0.1) x 10(-3) s(-1) (n =
   4) and (2.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1) (n = 7), which are close to the
   reported rate constants. The method was then applied to determine the
   rate of NO decay in blood samples from control and smoking exposed mice.
   It was observed that the NO decay rate in the smoking group is >20\%
   higher than that in control group, and the increased NO decay rate in
   the smoking group was reversed by 10 mu M diphenyleneiodonium chloride
   (DPI), an inhibitor of flavin enzymes such as leukocyte NADPH oxidase.

Abstract = {{Hempseeds have not been utilised to any significant extent by the
   industrial food markets. A novel antioxidant peptide derived from
   hempseed by-product was investigated. Hempseed protein isolate was
   prepared by alkaline extraction and subsequent isoelectric
   precipitation. Its enzymatic hydrolysate, obtained by Alcalase (R)
   treatment, was subjected to DA201-C macroporous absorption resin, with
   simultaneous desalting and concentrating of hydrophobic fragments with
   improved free radical-scavenging activities. The active fraction was
   further separated by gel filtration and reversed-phase high performance
   liquid chromatography to obtain two purified peptides; the peptides were
   characterised as NHAV and HVRE-TALV, by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. The
   protective effects of the purified peptides on hydrogen peroxide-induced
   cell apoptosis were investigated in rat pheochromocytoma line PC12
   cells. The peptides, at a concentration of 10 mu g/ml, possessed
   protective effects (P < 0.05) against cell death and oxidative
   apoptosis. The findings are significant for the discovery and

Abstract = {{We tested hypotheses on the effect of growing space and biomechanics on
   tree growth, using data from two field experiments where Scots pine
   seedlings had been planted in a fixed but systematically irregular
   pattern. After 16 or 18 years, respectively, stem diameter was measured
   at 1.3 m (d(1.3)) and 0.3 m above ground (d(0.3)). Total tree height,
   length and diameter of the crown, and height to crown gravity point were
   also measured. Analyses were split in two parts: influence of growing
   space on tree and crown dimensions, and biomechanical influence of the
   crown on stem diameter. The results showed that crown size was closely
   related to tree height, and that there was a small but statistically
   significant effect of growing space on both crown size and shape. The
   biomechanical model explained about 85\% of the variation in stem
   diameter, but growing space had no influence on this relationship,
   indicating that the wind load absorbed by a given crown size was not
   affected by growing space. The results were discussed in relation to
   future growth modelling and new ways of estimating site productivity.

Abstract = {{Enhanced carbon monoxide (CO) in the upper troposphere (UT) is shown by
   nearly collocated Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Microwave
   Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements near and down-wind from the known
   wildfire region of SE Australia from December 12th-19th, 2006. Enhanced
   ultraviolet (UV) aerosol index (Al) derived from the Ozone Monitoring
   Instrument (ON) measurements correlates with these high CO
   concentrations. The Hybrid Single Particle Langrangian Integrated
   Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model back trajectories trace selected air parcels,
   where TES observes enhanced CO in the upper and lower troposphere, to
   the SE Australia fire region as their initial location. Simultaneously,
   they show a lack of vertical advection along their tracks. TES retrieved
   CO vertical profiles in the higher and lower southern latitudes are
   examined together with the averaging kernels and show that TES CO
   retrievals are most sensitive at approximately 300-400 hPa. The enhanced
   CO observed by TES in the upper (215 hPa) and lower (681 hPa)
   troposphere are, therefore, influenced by mid-tropospheric CO. CEOS-Chem
   model simulations with an 8-day emission inventory, as the wildfire
   source over Australia, are sampled to the TES/MLS observation times and
   locations. These simulations only show CO enhancements in the lower
   troposphere near and down-wind from the wildfire region of SE Australia
   with drastic underestimates of UT CO plumes. Although CloudSat
   along-track ice-water content curtains are examined to see whether
   possible vertical convection events can explain the high UT CO values,
   sparse observations of collocated Aura CO and CloudSat along-track
   ice-water content measurements for the single event precludes any
   conclusive correlation. Vertical convection that uplifts the
   fire-induced CO (i.e., most notably referred to as pyro-cumulonimbus
   (pyroCb)) may provide an explanation for the incongruence between these
   simulations and the TES/MLS observations of enhanced CO in the UT. (C)

Abstract = {{The self-assembly of diblock copolymers provides a convenient route to
   the formation of mechanically robust films with precise and tunable
   periodic arrangements of two physically demixed but chemically linked
   polymeric materials. Chemoselective transport membranes may be realized
   from such films by selective partitioning of an active species into one
   of the polymer domains. Here, lithium ions were selectively sequestered
   within the poly(ethylene oxide) block of a liquid crystalline diblock
   copolymer to form polymer electrolyte membranes. Optimization of the
   membrane conductivity mandates alignment of self-assembled structures
   such that conduction occurs via direct as opposed to tortuous transport
   between exterior surfaces. We show here that magnetic fields can be used
   in a very simple and scalable manner to produce highly aligned
   hexagonally packed cylindrical microdomains in such membranes over
   macroscopic areas. We systematically explore the dependence of the ionic
   conductivity of the membrane on both temperature and magnetic field
   strength. A surprising order of magnitude increase in conductivity
   relative to the nonaligned case is found in films aligned at the highest
   magnetic field strengths, 6 T. The conductivity of field aligned samples
   shows a nonmonotonic dependence on temperature, with a marked decrease
   on heating in the proximity of the order-disorder transition of the
   system before increasing again at elevated temperatures. The data
   suggest that domain-confined transport in hexagonally packed cylindrical
   systems differs markedly in anisotropy by comparison with lamellar
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Snakebite envenoming is a neglected public health challenge of
   compelling importance in many regions of the world, particularly
   sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and Papua-New Guinea. Addressing
   the problem of snakebite effectively demands an integrated multifocal
   approach, targeting complex problems and involving many participants. It
   must comprise:
   (a) Acquisition of reliable information on the incidence and mortality
   attributable to snakebite envenoming, and the number of people left with
   permanent sequelae.
   (b) Improvements in production of effective and safe antivenoms, through
   strategies aimed at strengthening the technological capacity of
   antivenom manufacturing laboratories.
   (c) Increasing the capacity of low-income countries to produce specific
   immunogens (snake venoms) locally, and to perform their own quality
   control of antivenoms.
   (d) Commitments from regional producers to manufacture antivenoms for
   countries where antivenom production is not currently feasible.
   (e) Implementation of financial initiatives guaranteeing the acquisition
   of adequate volumes of antivenom at affordable prices in low-income
   countries.
   (f) Performance of collaborative studies on the safety and effectiveness
   of antivenoms assessed preclinically and by properly designed clinical
   trials.
   (g) Development of antivenom distribution programmes tailored to the
   real needs and epidemiological situations of rural areas in each
   country.
   (h) Permanent training programmes for health staff, particularly in
   rural areas where snakebites are frequent.
   (i) Implementation of programmes to support those people whose
   snakebites resulted in chronic disabilities.
   (j) Preventive and educational programmes at the community level, with
   the active involvement of local organizations and employing modern
   methods of health promotion.
   Such an integrated approach, currently being fostered by the Global
   Snake Bite Initiative of the International Society on Toxinology and by
   the World Health Organization, will help to alleviate the enormous
   burden of human suffering inflicted by snakebite envenoming. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Background. Because of the shortage of organs for transplantation,
   procurement of kidneys from extended criteria donors is inevitable.
   Frequently, donors infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are used. To
   elucidate an initial compromise of molecular pathways in HCV graft, gene
   expression profiles were evaluated.
   Methods. Twenty-four donor allograft biopsies (n=12 HCV positive (+) and
   n=12 HCV negative (-)) were collected at preimplantation time and
   profiled using microarrays. Donors were age, race, gender, and cold and
   warm ischemia time matched between groups. Probe level data were read
   into the R programming environment using the affy Bioconductor package,
   and the robust multiarray average method was used to obtain probe set
   expression summaries. To identify probe sets exhibiting differential
   expression, a two sample t test was performed. Molecular and biologic
   functions were analyzed using Interaction Networks and Functional
   Analysis.
   Results. Fifty-eight probe sets were differentially expressed between
   HCV(+) versus HCV(-) donors (P<0.001). The molecular functions
   associated with the two top scored networks from the analysis of the
   differentially expressed genes were connective tissue development and
   function and tissue morphology (score 34), cell death, cell signaling,
   cellular assembly, and organization (score 32). Among the differentially
   affected top canonical pathways, we found the role of RIG1-like
   receptors in antiviral innate immunity (P<0.001), natural killer cell
   signaling (P=0.007), interleukin-8 signaling (P=0.048), interferon
   signaling (P=0.0 11; INFA21, INFGR1, and MED14), ILK signaling
   (P=0.001), and apoptosis signaling.
   Conclusions. A unique gene expression pattern was identified in HCV (+)
   kidney grafts. Innate immune system and inflammatory pathways were the
   most affected.}},

Abstract = {{Apoptosis of oligodendrocytes (ODCs), the myelin-producing glial cells
   in the CNS, plays a central role in demyelinating diseases such as
   multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),
   an animal model of multiple sclerosis. To investigate the mechanism
   behind ODC apoptosis in EAE, we made use of conditional knockout mice
   lacking the adaptor protein FADD specifically in ODCs (FADD(ODC-KO)).
   FADD mediates apoptosis by coupling death receptors with downstream
   caspase activation. In line with this, ODCs from FADD(ODC-KO) mice were
   completely resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis in vitro. In
   the EAE model, FADD(ODC-KO) mice followed an ameliorated clinical
   disease course in comparison with control littermates. Lymphocyte and
   macrophage infiltration into the spinal cord parenchyma was
   significantly reduced, as was the extent of demyelination and
   proinflammatory gene expression. Collectively, our data show that FADD
   is critical for ODC apoptosis and the development of autoimmune
   demyelinating disease. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185: 7646-7653.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate gender-specific short- and
   long-term mortalities after a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in
   patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). The study was based on
   505 men and 196 women with DM and 1,327 men and 415 women without DM
   consecutively hospitalized with a first-ever AMI from January 1998 to
   December 2003 recruited from a population-based MI registry. Patients
   were followed until December 31, 2005 (median follow-up time 4.3 years).
   In men and women, no significantly independent association between DM
   and short-term mortality was observed. After multivariable adjustment
   odds ratios (95\% confidence intervals {[}CIs]) for 28-day case fatality
   were 1.45 (95\% CI 0.90 to 2.34) in men with DM compared to men without
   DM and 1.44 (95\% CI 0.66 to 3.15) in women with DM compared to women
   without DM. Conversely, in 28-day AMT survivors DM was significantly
   associated with long-term mortality in age-adjusted analyses, in which
   men with DM had a hazard ratio (RR) of 1.57 (95\% CI 1.18 to 2.10) for
   all-cause mortality compared to non-DM men; the corresponding HR in
   women with DM was 2.91 (95\% CI 1.82 to 4.65). After multivariable
   adjustment the strong association in women with DM remained significant
   (HR 2.56, 95\% CI 1.53 to 4.27); however, in men with DM it became
   borderline significant (HR 1.36, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.85). In conclusion,
   short-term mortality was not significantly increased in men and women
   with DM after a first-ever AMI, although estimates were relatively high,
   indicating a possible relation. However, long-term mortality was higher
   in patients with AMI and DM, particularly in women. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{A comparison of imputation procedures and statistical tests for the
   analysis of two-dimensional electrophoresis data}},
Journal = {{PROTEOME SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Numerous gel-based softwares exist to detect protein changes
   potentially associated with disease. The data, however, are abundant
   with technical and structural complexities, making statistical analysis
   a difficult task. A particularly important topic is how the various
   softwares handle missing data. To date, no one has extensively studied
   the impact that interpolating missing data has on subsequent analysis of
   protein spots.
   Results: This work highlights the existing algorithms for handling
   missing data in two-dimensional gel analysis and performs a thorough
   comparison of the various algorithms and statistical tests on simulated
   and real datasets. For imputation methods, the best results in terms of
   root mean squared error are obtained using the least squares method of
   imputation along with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm
   approach to estimate missing values with an array covariance structure.
   The bootstrapped versions of the statistical tests offer the most
   liberal option for determining protein spot significance while the
   generalized family wise error rate (gFWER) should be considered for
   controlling the multiple testing error.
   Conclusions: In summary, we advocate for a three-step statistical
   analysis of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) data with a data
   imputation step, choice of statistical test, and lastly an error control
   method in light of multiple testing. When determining the choice of
   statistical test, it is worth considering whether the protein spots will
   be subjected to mass spectrometry. If this is the case a more liberal
   test such as the percentile-based bootstrap t can be employed. For error
   control in electrophoresis experiments, we advocate that gFWER be
   controlled for multiple testing rather than the false discovery rate.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we use transition network analysis for the first time to
   investigate ligand migration in truncated hemoglobin (trHbN) and obtain
   kinetic information about the docking-site dynamics in the protein. A
   comparison with explicit water molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns in
   total) shows that the rate constants derived from the network analysis
   are realistic. The transition network analysis provides 1) The
   time-resolved connectivity network in the protein; 2) The half-lives of
   the docking sites; 3) The transition timescales between two given
   docking sites; and 4) The extent of population transfer among different
   docking sites of the protein as a function of lag time. We investigate
   the role of the Tyr(33) and Gln(58) residues in ligand migration by
   studying ligand migration in four mutants of trHbN. The mutation study
   suggests that residues Tyr(33) and Gln(58) stabilize the NO ligand in
   the Xe2 docking site of trHbN, thus facilitating the efficiency of the
   NO detoxification reaction.}},

Abstract = {{The electrochemical reduction of CO2 was studied on a copper mesh
   electrode in aqueous solutions containing 3M solutions of KCl, KBr and
   KI as the electrolytes in a two and three phase configurations.
   Electrochemical experiments were carried out in a laboratory-made,
   divided H-type cell. The working electrode was a copper mesh, while the
   counter and reference electrodes were Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrode,
   respectively. Results of our work suggest a reaction mechanism for the
   electrochemical reduction of CO2 in the two phase configuration where
   the presence of Cu-X as the catalytic layer facilitates the electron
   transfer from the electrode to CO2. Electron-transfer to CO2 may occur
   via the X-ad(-)(Br-. Cl-, I-)-C bond, which is formed by the electron
   flow from the specifically adsorbed halide anion to the vacant orbital
   of CO2. The stronger the adsorption of the halide anion to the
   electrode, the more strongly CO2 is restrained, resulting in higher CO2
   reduction current. Furthermore, it is suggested that specifically
   adsorbed halide anions could suppress the adsorption of protons, leading
   to a higher hydrogen overvoltage. These effects may synergistically
   mitigate the overpotential necessary for CO2 reduction, and thus
   increase the rate of electrochemical CO2 reduction. Published by

Abstract = {{The Hippo pathway regulates the size of organs by controlling two
   opposing processes: proliferation and apoptosis. YAP2 (Yes
   kinase-associated protein 2), one of the three isoforms of YAP, is a WW
   domain-containing transcriptional co-activator that acts as the effector
   of the Hippo pathway in mammalian cells. In addition to WW domains, YAP2
   has a PDZ-binding motif at its C-terminus. We reported previously that
   this motif was necessary for YAP2 localization in the nucleus and for
   promoting cell detachment and apoptosis. In the present study, we show
   that the tight junction protein ZO (zonula occludens)-2 uses its first
   PDZ domain to form a complex with YAP2. The endogenous ZO-2 and YAP2
   proteins co-localize in the nucleus. We also found that ZO-2 facilitates
   the nuclear localization and pro-apoptotic function of YAP2, and that
   this activity of ZO-2 is PDZ-domain-dependent. The present paper is the
   first report on a PDZ-based nuclear translocation mechanism. Moreover,
   since the Hippo pathway acts as a tumour suppressor pathway, the
   YAP2-ZO-2 complex could represent a target for cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Polyunsaturated fatty acids are precursors of multiple pro-and
   anti-inflammatory molecules generated by enzymatic stereospecific and
   positionally specific insertion of oxygen, which is a prerequisite for
   recognition of these mediators by cellular receptors. However,
   nonenzymatically oxidized free and esterified polyunsaturated fatty
   acids also demonstrate activities relevant to inflammation. In
   particular, phospholipids containing oxidized fatty acid residues
   (oxidized phospholipids; OxPLs) were shown to induce proinflammatory
   changes in endothelial cells but paradoxically also to inhibit
   inflammation induced via TLR4. In this study, we show that half-maximal
   inhibition of LPS-induced elevation of E-selectin mRNA in endothelial
   cells developed at concentrations of oxidized
   1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OxPAPC) 10-fold
   lower than those required to induce proinflammatory response. Similar
   concentration difference was observed for other classes and molecular
   species of OxPLs. Upon injection into mice, OxPAPC did not elevate
   plasma levels of IL-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant but strongly
   inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of these inflammatory cytokines.
   Thus, both in vitro and in vivo, anti-LPS effects of OxPLs are observed
   at lower concentrations than those required for their proinflammatory
   action. Quantification of the most abundant oxidized
   phosphatidylcholines by HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry showed that
   circulating concentrations of total oxidized phosphatidylcholine species
   are close to the range where they demonstrate anti-LPS activity but
   significantly lower than that required for induction of inflammation. We
   hypothesize that low levels of OxPLs in circulation serve mostly
   anti-LPS function and protect from excessive systemic response to TLR4
   ligands, whereas proinflammatory effects of OxPLs are more likely to
   develop locally at sites of tissue deposition of OxPLs (e. g., in
   atherosclerotic vessels). The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185:
   7706-7712.}},

   (M1: (1)H(2)G(3)I(4)N(5)T(6)T(7)K(8)P(9)F(10)K(11)S(12)V) to a stack of
   mobile clay platelets and evaluate the morphological responses on a
   cubic lattice. A coarse-grained description is used to model both
   platelets and peptides capturing the specificity of each residue.
   Mobility profiles of residues and their proximity to platelets (i.e.,
   the local structural profile) suggest that the peptide binding is
   anchored by (7)Lys and (10)Lys. Correlation between the density profiles
   of platelets and peptides aided by the visual analysis shows that (i)
   the layered morphology is maintained due to peptide binding, (ii) the
   interstitial spacing between platelets, that is, the gallery width
   decreases on increasing the peptide concentration (consistent with
   recent experiments), (iii) relatively smaller amplitude of oscillations
   in peptide density profile around the inner clay galleries suggests that
   the peptides are more likely to bind at the layer boundaries and
   exterior surface of the platelets than intercalate. The radius of
   gyration (R-g) of the peptide shows nonmonotonic dependence on the
   peptide concentration (C-p). (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym

Abstract = {{A microplasma jet has been constructed for chemical vapour deposition on
   the inner surface of narrow long tubes and is tested on a quartz tube
   with the inner diameter of 6 mm and the outer diameter of 8 mm. A long
   plasma filament (> 100 mm) is generated inside the tube in argon with
   methane admixture. Depending on the quantity of admixture in argon, the
   negative as well as the positive corona discharges are ignited. Both
   modes of plasma are characterized using optical emission spectroscopy.
   For this purpose, nitrogen is admixed with argon and its emission is
   used for the determination of gas temperature, electron velocity
   distribution function and electron density at various places along the
   axis of the tube. The formation of active species, such as C, C(2) and
   CH during the dissociation of methane, is observed through their
   characteristic emission. The rate of methane dissociation is determined
   at various places along the axis of the tube during both modes of
   discharge. Since the chemical kinetics of the film growth process is
   different, different kinds of films are obtained during different modes
   of discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Rutile phase TiO2 thin films have been synthesized using chemical spray
   pyrolysis of titanyl acetylacetonate TiAcAc in ethanol at 500 degrees C.
   The first part of the paper focuses on the thermal decomposition
   behavior of the precursor by simultaneous thermogravimetry and
   differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) coupled with differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC). The second part of the paper focuses on the
   evolution of TiO2 thin films and their structural transformation with
   substrate temperature. XRD revealed amorphous TiO2 thin film at low
   substrate temperatures ( < 350 degrees C) and on high substrate
   temperatures anatase (3.84 g/cm(3)) or rutile (4.25 g/cm(3)) crystalline
   structure was obtained. The lattice constant, grain size, microstrain
   and the dislocation density of the film were obtained from the peak
   width. FTIR spectra of both anatase and rutile TiO2 revealed stretching
   vibration of the Ti-O bond for tetrahedral and octahedral surroundings
   of the titanium atom. Scanning electron micrograph showed the
   compactness of the rutile film. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The RON receptor tyrosine kinase regulates the balance between classical
   (M1) and alternative (M2) macrophage activation. In primary macrophages,
   the ligand for Ron, macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), inhibits the
   expression of inducible NO synthase, a marker of classically activated
   macrophages, whereas promoting the expression of arginase I, a marker of
   alternative activation. Ron(-/-) mice express increased levels of IL-12,
   a product of classically activated macrophages, after endotoxin
   administration, resulting in increased serum IFN-gamma levels and
   enhanced susceptibility to septic shock. In this study, we demonstrate
   that MSP inhibits LPS-induced IL-12p40 expression, and this inhibition
   is dependent on the docking site tyrosines in Ron. To further define
   this inhibition, we examined the effect of Ron on signaling pathways
   downstream of Ron. We found that MSP does not inhibit the
   MyD88-independent activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 and production
   of IFN-beta in response to LPS, nor does it inhibit MyD88-dependent
   TGF-beta-activated kinase phosphorylation or MAPK activation in primary
   macrophages. However, the induction of I kappa B kinase activity, I
   kappa B degradation, and DNA binding of NF-kappa B after LPS stimulation
   is delayed in the presence of MSP. In addition, Ron inhibits serine
   phosphorylation of p65 and NF-kappa B transcriptional activity induced
   by LPS stimulation of TLR4. Finally, MSP inhibits the NF-kappa
   B-dependent upregulation of the nuclear I kappa B family member, I kappa
   B zeta, a positive regulator of secondary response genes including
   IL-12p40. LPS also induces expression of Ron and an N-terminally
   truncated form of Ron, Sf-Ron, in primary macrophages, suggesting that
   the upregulation of Ron by LPS could provide classical feedback
   regulation of TLR signaling. The Journal of Immunology, 2010, 185:

Abstract = {{Sorting nexin 6 (SNX6), a predominantly cytoplasmic protein involved in
   intracellular trafficking of membrane receptors, was identified as a
   TGF-beta family interactor. However, apart from being a component of the
   Retromer, little is known about SNX6 cellular functions. Pim-1-dependent
   SNX6 nuclear translocation has been reported suggesting a putative
   nuclear role for SNX6. Here, we describe a previously non-reported
   association of SNX6 with breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1)
   protein detected by a yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction can be
   reconstituted in vitro and further FRET analysis confirmed the novel
   interaction. Additionally, we identified their coiled-coil domains as
   the minimal binding motives required for interaction. Since BRMS1 has
   been shown to repress transcription, we sought the ability of SNX6 to
   interfere with this nuclear activity. Using a standard gene reporter
   assay, we observed that SNX6 increases BRMS1-dependent transcriptional
   repression. Moreover, over-expression of SNX6 was capable of diminishing
   trans-activation in a dose-dependent manner. J. Cell. Biochem. 111:

Abstract = {{Scorpion venoms are complex mixtures of dozens or even hundreds of
   distinct proteins, many of which are inter-genome active elements. Fifty
   years after the first scorpion toxin sequences were determined,
   chromatography-assisted purification followed by automated protein
   sequencing or gene cloning, on a case-by-case basis, accumulated nearly
   250 amino acid sequences of scorpion venom components. A vast majority
   of the available sequences correspond to proteins adopting a common
   three-dimensional fold, whose ion channel modulating functions have been
   firmly established or could be confidently inferred. However, the actual
   molecular diversity contained in scorpion venoms -as revealed by
   bioassay-driven purification, some unexpected activities of
   ``canonical{''} neurotoxins and even serendipitous discoveries- is much
   larger than those ``canonical{''} toxin types. In the last few years
   mining into the molecular diversity contained in scorpion has been
   assisted by high-throughput Mass Spectrometry techniques and large-scale
   DNA sequencing, collectively accounting for the more than twofold
   increase in the number of known sequences of scorpion venom components
   (now reaching 500 unique sequences). This review, from a comparative
   perspective, deals with recent data obtained by proteomic and
   transcriptomic studies on scorpion venoms and venom glands. Altogether,
   these studies reveal a large contribution of non canonical venom
   components, which would account for more than half of the total protein
   diversity of any scorpion venom. On top of aiding at the better
   understanding of scorpion venom biology, whether in the context of venom
   function or within the venom gland itself, these ``novel{''} venom
   components certainly are an interesting source of bioactive proteins,
   whose characterization is worth pursuing. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Biomimetic materials for application in the field of tissue engineering
   are usually obtained through covalent bonding between the polymer
   backbone and the bioactive molecules. A totally new approach, proposed
   for the first time by our research group, for the creation of advanced
   synthetic support structures for cell adhesion and proliferation is
   represented by molecular imprinting (MI) technology. In this article, we
   describe the synthesis and characterization of molecularly imprinted
   polymers with recognition properties toward a fibronectin peptide
   sequence and their application as functionalization structures.
   Polymers, in the form of densely fused microgel particles, were obtained
   by precipitation polymerization. The imprinted particles showed good
   performance in terms of recognition capacity and quantitative rebinding;
   moreover, the epitope effect was observed, with the particles able to
   recognize and rebind not only the specific peptide sequence but also a
   larger fibronectin fragment. The cytotoxicity tests showed normal
   vitality in C2C12 myoblasts cultured in a medium that was put in contact
   with the imprinted particles. Therefore, imprinted particles were used
   to functionalize synthetic polymeric films by deposition on their
   surface. The deposition of the imprinted particles did not alter their
   specific recognition and rebinding behavior. The most remarkable result
   was obtained by the biological characterization: in fact, the
   functionalized materials appeared able to promote cell adhesion and
   proliferation. These results are very promising and suggest that MI can
   be used as an innovative functionalization technique to prepare
   bioactive scaffolds with an effective capacity for improving tissue
   regeneration. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 118:

Abstract = {{Layered Cu2S/CdS photovoltaic p-n junctions were fabricated via a simple
   and reproducible route. CdS inner layer was grown on ITO substrate using
   chemical bath deposition process for different times. The utilized bath
   consisted of cadmium sulfate and thiourea with concentrations of 0.05 M
   and 0.07 M, respectively. CdS layer grown for 600 min was uniform with a
   thickness of about 500 nm. Moreover, band gap energy of the CdS inner
   layers was measured as 2.40-2.44 eV depending on the thickness of the
   layer. Cu2S outer layer was formed over the CdS via ion exchange
   chemical route, in a bath consisting of copper chloride aqueous
   solution. EDS, XRD, and XPS were utilized to characterize the formation
   of cadmium sulfide, and copper sulfide phases during the fabrication
   steps of the p-n junctions. Nano-layered cell, each layer 200-250nm in
   thickness was fabricated with an apparent band gap of 2.22 eV. SEM
   imaging of both inner and the outer layers confirmed the uniformity and
   homogeneity of the CdS and the Cu2S layers. (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {{Tannin-based coagulant agent called Silvafloc was tested on surface
   river water clarification. This novel coagulant can be used in drinking
   water treatment, and consist of a chemically modified tannin extract
   from Schinopsis balansae, commonly known as Quebracho colorado. Low
   coagulant doses reached high turbidity removal percentage and
   operational conditions of neutral pH and room temperature allow up to
   90\% turbidity removal with 20 mg L-1 of coagulant. Rapid and slow
   mixing periods in Jar test as well as stirring intensity were evaluated
   and they were found to be less influent than coagulant dosage. Silvafloc
   drives to a significative disinfection (around 99.9\% for fecal
   streptococcus and fecal conforms and up to 70\% for total coliforms).
   Treated water also presented very low content in polyphenols (about 0.4
   mg L-1) and organic matter content was not increased, but removed about
   30\%. If compared with other natural or inorganic coagulants, Silvafloc
   is more efficient than aluminium sulphate, a classical metal salt for

Abstract = {{Background. We have developed a new portocaval (PC) shunt creation
   technique for use in small-for-size (SFS) graft liver transplantations.
   PC shunts are already used to avoid SFS graft syndrome in cases of
   adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), but the
   current method of creating these shunts is subject to two problems:
   reportal hypertension and liver dysfunction after premature ligation of
   the PC shunt; and graft atrophy and liver dysfunction because of the
   loss of portal venous flow late in the recovery period after LDLT.
   Methods. Our new technique avoids these two problems simultaneously by
   using the interposed obliterated ligamentum teres hepatis (LTH) to
   create the PC shunt, then obstructing the PC shunt after regeneration of
   the liver graft.
   Results. We have used this technique in four cases. In all cases, portal
   venous pressures after shunting were lower than those before shunting,
   and PC shunts with lower portal pressure were obstructed faster than
   that with higher portal pressure.
   Conclusion. Our results suggest that the LTH can function as a shape
   memory graft to reduce portal venous flow after regeneration of the
   graft liver. Using the LTH to create a PC shunt might help to prevent
   both SFS graft syndrome early in the recovery period after LDLT and loss
   of portal venous flow late in the recovery period.}},

Abstract = {{A method for simultaneous determination of nine ginsenosides including
   two pairs of isomers and F-group ginsenosides in functional foods by

   ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rf, Rb1, Rb3, Rg3, 20(S)-F1, 20(S)-F2, and
   20(S)-Rh2 in sample solution were separated by an ODS column with a
   programmed gradient elution with a mobile phase consisting of water and
   acetonitrile. Qualitative determination was based on the retention time
   and the characteristic absorption spectra of ginsenosides and standard
   curves were used for quantification. Recoveries were from 91.5\% to
   104.5\%. The limits of detection were from 7.0 ng to 16.5 ng. The
   relative standard deviations were <5\% (intra-day) and 1.77-7.04\%

Abstract = {{The fate of Cu, Zn and Cd after their entry into an unpolluted fresh
   water body was studied as a function of a condition of a natural

   primary and repeated contamination. Over 31 clays, the reproduction of
   new generation of a phytoplankton as renewable source of the suspended
   particles capable to metal biosorption was higher in a light mesocosm.
   As a result the residual concentration of metals in water decreased
   faster and their content in the settled deposits was higher in a light
   mesocosm, than in a dark mesocosm. Efficiency of planktonic channel in
   deducing of metals from water with settling deposits (in the order of Cu

Abstract = {{The assessment of sediment transfer processes is necessary to understand
   the hydro-geomorphological functioning of small alpine watersheds prone
   to channelised debris flows because their occurrence often depends on
   the amount of debris available in the gully systems. Therefore, sediment
   budgets should be studied through the identification of erosion,
   transport and deposition processes. Sediment transfer processes were
   investigated in a small catchment by field measurements and, more
   specifically, through the application of a process-based
   geomorphological mapping method. The proposed methodology is based on
   data directly derived from GIS analysis using high-resolution DEM, field
   measurements and aerial photograph interpretations. It has been
   conceived to estimate sediment transfer dynamics, taking into account
   the role of different sediment stores in the torrential system. The
   proposed geomorphological mapping methodology is quite innovative in
   comparison with most legend systems that are not adequate for mapping
   comprehensively active and complex geomorphological systems such as
   debris-flow catchments. Maps representing the various sediment storages
   and their relationships can be used for hydro-geomorphological hazard

Abstract = {{Timothy (Phleum pratense L) is the most important forage grass in
   Scandinavia and it is therefore highly interesting to study how it will
   perform in a changing climate. In order to model winter survival, the
   dynamics of hardening and dehardening must be simulated with
   satisfactory precision. We investigated an early timothy frost tolerance
   model (LT50 model), and an LT50 model for winter wheat. Based on the
   assumption that timothy has no vernalization requirement, unlike winter
   wheat, but does have the ability to adapt to cold temperatures in a
   process linked to stage of development, two alternative versions of the
   winter wheat model were also constructed. In total, these four candidate
   models were calibrated by a Bayesian approach for the timothy cultivar
   Engmo. The candidate models were validated using independent
   observations on LT50 in timothy at different locations reflecting
   differences in climate. A sensitivity analysis, using the Morris method,
   to identify important model parameters suggested that there is a
   connection between frost tolerance and stage of plant development, even
   if there is no vernalization requirement. The simplified winter wheat
   model was selected as the best candidate model for LT50 in timothy based
   on model selection criteria and its ability to capture the hardening and
   dehardening processes. The results from the Bayesian calibration suggest
   that there are no major regional differences in Norway calling for
   regional calibration. However, cultivar-specific calibration is probably
   required, since there are hardy and less hardy cultivars within the same
   species. A functional LT50 model would allow risk assessments to be made
   of future winter survival using specifically tailored and downscaled
   climate scenarios. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   refinement. In the CG Mg alloy, the activation of tension twinning also
   occurred in addition to basal slip, the work hardening rate was
   increased because of twin-induced additional hardening. Dynamic
   recrystallization (DRX) was observed in the CG alloy compressed to large

Abstract = {{Separation of two particles is characterized by a magnitude of the bond
   energy, which limits the accumulated energy of the particle interaction.
   In the case of a solid composed of many particles a magnitude of the
   average bond energy - the failure energy - exists, which limits the
   energy that can be accumulated in an infinitesimal material volume under
   strain. The energy limiter controls material softening, which indicates
   failure. Thus, by limiting the stored energy density it is possible to
   include a description of material failure in the constitutive model.
   When the failure energy, i.e. the energy limiter, is introduced in the
   constitutive model it can be calibrated in macroscopic experiments.
   Traditional elasticity models do not have energy limiters and they allow
   for the unlimited energy accumulation under the strain increase, which
   is physically meaningless because no material can sustain large enough
   strains without failure. We use elasticity with energy limiters for
   modeling dynamic failure propagation in brittle solids. Two models of
   isotropic Hookean solids with energy limiters are introduced and
   examined in simulations of the penetration of a projectile into a
   brittle plate in the present work. The first model uses the energy
   limiter with the overall energy term while the second model has separate
   energy limiters for the volumetric and deviatoric components. The
   results of the penetration simulation obtained by using both models are
   similar qualitatively. It is remarkable that the penetration depth is
   mesh-independent for fine meshes even without the special regularization
   procedures. This is the first work where the methods of elasticity with
   energy limiters are used in dynamic analysis of brittle failure. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: The Wnt (Wg/Wnt) signaling cascade plays an important role
   in tumorigenesis. Our previous report indicated that aberrant
   localization of beta-catenin proteins was a feature of pterygia.
   Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the association of beta-catenin
   protein and expression of a downstream gene, cyclin D1, in pterygial
   tissues.
   Methods: Using immunohistochemistry, beta-catenin and cyclin D1 protein
   expression was studied, in 150 pterygial specimens and 30 normal
   conjunctivas.
   Results: Seventy-three (48.7\%) and 60 (40.0\%) pterygial specimens
   tested positive for beta-catenin and cyclin D1 protein expression,
   respectively. Cyclin D1protein expression was significantly higher in
   beta-catenin-nuclear/cytoplasmic positive groups than in beta-catenin
   membrane positive and negative groups (p<0.0001). In addition, cyclin D1
   expression was significantly higher in the fleshy group than in the
   atrophic and intermediate groups (p=0.006).
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that beta-catenin expressed in
   nuclei/cytoplasm increases cyclinD1 protein expression, which invokes
   pterygial cell proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{A challenge in phenology studies is understanding what constitutes
   phenological change amidst background variation. The majority of
   phenological studies have focused on extracting critical points in the
   seasonal growth cycle, without exploiting the full temporal detail. The
   high degree of phenological variability between years demonstrates the
   necessity of distinguishing long-term phenological change from temporal
   variability. Here, we demonstrate the phenological change detection
   ability of a method for detecting change within time series. BFAST,
   Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend, integrates the decomposition of
   time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods
   for detecting change. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day NDVI time
   series with varying amounts of seasonal amplitude and noise, containing
   abrupt disturbances (e.g. fires) and long-term phenological changes.
   This revealed that the method is able to detect the timing of
   phenological changes within time series while accounting for abrupt
   disturbances and noise. Results showed that the phenological change
   detection is influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio of the time series.
   Between different land cover types the seasonal amplitude varies and
   determines the signal-to-noise ratio, and as such the capacity to
   differentiate phenological changes from noise. Application of the method
   on 16-day NDVI MODIS images from 2000 until 2009 for a forested study
   area in south eastern Australia confirmed these results. It was shown
   that a minimum seasonal amplitude of 0.1 NDVI is required to detect
   phenological change within cleaned MODIS NDVI time series using the
   quality flags. BFAST identifies phenological change independent of
   phenological metrics by exploiting the full time series. The method is
   globally applicable since it analyzes each pixel individually without
   the setting of thresholds to detect change within a time series.
   Longterm phenological changes can be detected within NDVI time series of
   a large range of land cover types (e.g. grassland, woodlands and
   deciduous forests) having a seasonal amplitude larger than the noise
   level. The method can be applied to any time series data and it is not
   necessarily limited to NDVI. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {{This study compares the ability of several poplar (Populus spp.) stand
   parameters to predict photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
   transmission through the overstorey canopy in a silvopastoral system. As
   an indirect measure of PAR transmission, diffuse non-intercepted
   radiation (DIFN) levels underneath fully foliated poplar stands were
   measured in two climatically contrasting regions of the North Island of
   New Zealand. The ability of several easily measured stand inventory
   parameters to predict understorey DIFN was then evaluated using
   regression analysis. Pasture net herbage accumulation (NHA) was also
   measured below the fully foliated trees and related to understorey DIFN.
   A directly inverse relationship between DIFN in the gap between tree
   crowns and stand canopy closure measured with a standard digital camera
   was found to be the simplest, most accurate and robust of the stand
   parameters examined. In comparison, there were site differences in the
   relationship for this understorey environment for all of the stand
   parameters based on individual tree metrics. Site differences in the
   relationship for DIFN directly underneath the tree-crowns were also
   apparent for both the stand parameters based on individual tree metrics
   and digital photographs. Inter-site variation in these relationships was
   attributed to unaccounted differences in stand leaf area. There was a
   strong straight-line relationship between DIFN and understorey pasture

Abstract = {{Concentrated muscadine pomace extract was chromatographically analyzed
   for its individual phenolic, flavonoid, and anthocyanidin compounds.
   This extract was also characterized regarding its total phenolic content
   (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidative activities in terms
   of scavenging DPPH free radicals, reducing ferric, and chelating Fe2+.
   The TPC of this product was 34.1 +/- 1.8 mg of gallic acid
   equivalents(GAE)/g of extract, and TFC was 3.0 +/- 0.3 mg of quercetin
   equivalents/g of extract. Some phenolic compounds including ellagic
   acid, gallic acid, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, catechin,
   myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were identified. Some
   anthocyanidins including delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and
   malvidin were also identified in the extract by using a combination of
   retention and spectral properties on a reverse-phase HPLC-PDA. In
   addition, 3,3',4,4'5,5'-hexahydroxystilbene-a resveratrol analogue
   present in the extract was identified for the first time by LC-MS. The
   results from this study demonstrate that the muscadine pomace extract is
   rich of natural antioxidants such as phenolics, flavonoids and
   anthocyanins, and possesses strong antioxidant properties. Besides, the
   developed methods can be used for routine quality control of the
   muscadine products for manufacturing efficiency and consistency.

   PBMC had higher viability than any 70/DI PBMC. The PBMC viability and
   recovery linearly decreased with the duration of storage at -70 degrees

Abstract = {{Adiponectin is an adipocyte-secreted protein involved in a variety of
   metabolic processes, including glucose regulation and fatty acid
   catabolism. We conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate
   the genetic loci associated with plasma adiponectin in 1776 unrelated
   Filipino women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey
   (CLHNS). Our strongest signal for adiponectin mapped to the gene CDH13
   (rs3865188, P < 7.2 x 10(-16)), which encodes a receptor for
   high-molecular-weight forms of adiponectin. Strong association was also
   detected near the ADIPOQ gene (rs864265, P = 3.8 x 10(-9)) and at a
   novel signal 100 kb upstream near KNG1 (rs11924390, P = 7.6 x 10(-7)).
   All three signals were also observed in 1774 young adult CLHNS offspring
   and in combined analysis including all 3550 mothers and offspring
   samples (all P < 1.6 x 10(-9)). An uncommon haplotype of rs11924390 and
   rs864265 (haplotype frequency = 0.050) was strongly associated with
   lower adiponectin compared with the most common C-G haplotype in both
   CLHNS mothers (P = 1.8 x 10(-25)) and offspring (P = 8.7 x 10(-32)).
   Comprehensive imputation of 2653 SNPs in a 2 Mb region using as
   reference combined CHB, JPT and CEU haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes
   Project revealed no variants that perfectly tagged this haplotype. Our
   findings provide the first genome-wide significant evidence of
   association with plasma adiponectin at the CDH13 locus and identify a
   novel uncommon KNG1-ADIPOQ haplotype strongly associated with
   adiponectin levels in Filipinos.}},

Abstract = {{A series of coumarin based TACE inhibitors were designed to bind in S1'
   pocket of TACE enzyme based on their docking study. Twelve analogues
   were synthesized and most of compounds were active in vitro TACE enzyme
   inhibition as well as cellular TNF-alpha inhibition. Among these, 15l
   effectively inhibited the production of serum TNF-alpha by oral
   administration at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Compound 15l also showed a good
   oral bioavailability at 42\% and effectively inhibited paw edema in rat
   carrageenan model. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)
   study using genetic function approximation technique (GFA) and docking
   study were performed to confirm the series of coumarin core TACE
   inhibitors. QSAR model have been evaluated internally and externally
   using test set prediction. Through docking study of each molecule, it is

Abstract = {{Here we examine the application of the COSMO-SAC model to phase
   equilibrium calculations of solutions containing ionic liquids (ILs) As
   there is uncertainty about the degree of ionization in these liquids, we
   consider three methods treating the IL as a neutral molecule, as a
   separated anion and cation, and essentially as an ion pair In the first
   case, the needed quantum mechanics calculation is done for the neutral
   molecule referred to as COSMO-SAC(molecule), and in the other two cases,
   the calculations are performed for the separated ions in which the IL is
   treated as two separate components, COSMO-SAC(ions) or COSMO-SAC(CA), in
   which the separate cosmo files are combined and the IL is treated as a
   single-component neutral ion pair There is generally good agreement
   between the predicted results and the experimental data using
   COSMO-SAC(CA) and COSMO-SAC(ions), while for COSMO-SAC(molecule) the
   results are less satisfactory and the calculations arc more difficult
   because of the problems with geometry optimization and the density
   functional calculations for the large Intact IL molecules The results
   show that the COSMO-SAC model can give reasonably good predictions for
   the vapor-liquid equilibria, liquid-liquid equilibria, and infinite
   dilution activity coefficients for solutions containing ionic liquids}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGES) which are known
   to adversely affect cartilage turnover and mechanical properties
   provides a molecular mechanism by which aging contributes to the
   development of osteoarthritis The objective of the present study was to
   investigate the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
   (PPAR-gamma) in AGEs-mediated chondrocytes damage In the cultured rabbit
   chondrocytes our results show that the PPAR-gamma agonist pioglitazone
   can concentration dependently inhibit the AGES-induced expression of
   TNF-alpha and MMP 13 Several studies have shown that activation of PPAR
   gamma may interfere with several signaling pathways regulating the
   proinflammatory genes in vivo and vitro experiments but little is known
   regarding their expression and regulation in cartilage Thus the effect
   of AGEs on PPAR-gamma expression was next examined Reverse transcription
   (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that AGEs treatment of chondrocytes
   downregulated PPAR-gamma expression in a time and
   concentration-dependent manner AGEs induced a significant downregulation
   in PPAR-gamma mRNA at 48 h and the maximum effect was found at 100 mu
   g/ml AGEs This effect was significantly depressed by the anti-RAGE
   antibody Specific inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinases
   (MAPK) p38 (SB203580) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SP600125) but not of
   extracellular signal regulated kinase (PD98059) prevented AGEs-induced
   downregulation of PPAR gamma expression In conclusion AGEs may be
   responsible for PPAR-gamma downregulation via a mechanism involving
   activation of the MAPK (p38 and JNK) and this downregulation might play
   a key role in AGEs-induced production of TNF-alpha and MMP-13 (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Open-celled titanium foams were fabricated by vacuum hot pressing of a
   blend of Ti and NaCl powders followed by NaCl removal in water.
   Densification kinetics of the Ti/NaCl blends are measured at 780 degrees
   C at various pressures (30-50 MPa), NaCl volume fractions (30-70\%) and
   NaCl powder sizes (50-500 mu m). As compared to pure Ti powders,
   densification kinetics of the blends is faster for relative densities
   below 92\% due to rapid deformation of the NaCl powders. After
   dissolution, the flattened shape of the NaCl powders is replicated in
   the pores, resulting in an anisotropic porous structure. The foams
   exhibit good compressive strengths (e.g., 102 MPa for 50\% porosity and
   28 MPa for 67\% porosity), low Young moduli (e.g., 29 GPa for 51\%
   porosity) and ductile behavior up to compressive strain >60\%. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Background: Clarifying the aetiology of dementia is of crucial
   importance in the management of patients as well as for research
   purposes but it is not always possible clinically. Therefore the
   identification of biological markers should complement clinical
   approaches. Telomere shortening is emerging as an important mechanism in
   vascular aging and the pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
   Thus, telomere length could be a potential candidate to accurately
   separate vascular from degenerative cognitive impairment.
   Objectives: To evaluate the usefulness of telomere length alone or
   combined with ApoE polymorphism in diagnosing mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI) and in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) from vascular
   (VaD) and mixed dementia (MD).
   Methods: Telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed
   by flow cytometry in 439 patients (mean age, 85.1 years): 204
   cognitively normal, 187 demented patients: 80 AD, 86 MD, and 21 with
   VaD; and 48 patients with MCI. Simple and multiple ordered logistic
   regressions were used to predict the risk of dementia from telomere
   length, ApoE polymorphism and age.
   Results: ApoE epsilon 4 was statistically associated with patients with
   dementia (p<0.001) compared to cognitively normal or MCI patients; but
   not with the aetiologies of dementia (AD, VaD and MD) (p = 0.385). No
   significant difference's in telomere length were found among patients
   with different aetiologies or severities of dementia. In the global
   model, the combination of telomere length and ApoE polymorphism did not
   confer a significantly higher dementia risk (OR = 0.95, 95\% CI =
   0.69-1.32; p = 0.784) than APOE epsilon 4 alone (OR=2.12, 95\%
   CI=1.15-3.9; p = 0.016).
   Conclusion: This longitudinal study in very old patients provided no
   evidence suggesting that telomere length alone could be used to
   distinguish between the different types of dementia or MCI, nor combined
   with the ApoE polymorphism. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An ionic liquid-based microwave-assisted extraction (ILMAE) method has
   been developed for the effective extraction of rutin from Chinese
   medicinal plants including Saururus chinensis (Lour.) Bail. (S.
   chinensis) and Flos Sophorae. A series of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   ionic liquids with different anions were investigated. The results
   indicated that the characteristics of anions have remarkable effects on
   the extraction efficiency of rutin and among the investigated ionic
   liquids, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ({[}bmim]Br) aqueous
   solution was the best In addition, the ILMAE procedures for the two
   kinds of medicinal herbs were also optimized by means of a series of
   single factor experiments and an L-9 (3(4)) orthogonal design. Compared
   with the optimal ionic liquid-based heating extraction (ILHE), marinated
   extraction (ILME), ultrasonic-assisted extraction (ILUAE), the optimized
   approach of ILMAE gained higher extraction efficiency which is 4.879
   mg/g in S. chinensis with RSD 1.33\% and 171.82 mg/g in Flos Sophorae
   with RSD 1.47\% within the shortest extraction time. Reversed phase high
   performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with ultraviolet detection
   was employed for the analysis of rutin in Chinese medicinal plants.
   Under the optimum conditions, the average recoveries of rutin from S.
   chinensis and Flos Sophorae were 101.23\% and 99.62\% with RSD lower
   than 3\%, respectively. The developed approach is linear at
   concentrations from 42 to 252 mg L-1 of rutin solution, with the
   regression coefficient (r) at 0.99917. Moreover, the extraction
   mechanism of ILMAE and the microstructures and chemical structures of
   the two researched samples before and after extraction were also
   investigated. With the help of LC-MS, it was future demonstrated that
   the two researched herbs do contain active ingredient of rutin and ionic
   liquids would not influence the structure of rutin. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mouse Ig kappa gene locus has three known transcriptional enhancers:
   an intronic enhancer (Ei), a 3' enhancer (E3'), and a further downstream
   enhancer (Ed). Previous studies on B lymphocytes derived from mutant
   embryonic stem cells have shown that deletion of either Ei or E3'
   significantly reduces Ig kappa gene rearrangement, whereas the combined
   deletion of both Ei and E3' eliminates such recombination. Furthermore,
   deletion of either E3' or Ed significantly reduces rearranged Ig kappa
   gene transcription. To determine whether the combined presence of both
   E3' and Ed are essential for Ig kappa gene expression, we generated
   homozygous double knockout (DKO) mice with targeted deletions in both
   elements. Significantly, homozygous DKO mice were unable to generate
   kappa(+) B cells both in bone marrow and the periphery and exhibited
   surface expression almost exclusively of Ig lambda-chains, despite the
   fact that they possessed potentially functional rearranged Ig kappa
   genes. Compared with their single-enhancer-deleted counterparts, Ig
   kappa loci in homozygous DKO mice exhibited dramatically reduced
   germline and rearranged gene transcription, lower levels of gene
   rearrangement and histone H3 acetylation, and markedly increased DNA
   methylation. This contributed to a partial developmental block at the
   pre-B cell stage of development. We conclude that the two downstream
   enhancers are essential in Ig kappa gene expression and that Ei in
   homozygous DKO mice is incapable of triggering Ig kappa gene
   transcription. Furthermore, these results reveal unexpected compensatory
   roles for Ed in E3' knockout mice in triggering germline transcription
   and V kappa gene rearrangements to both J kappa and RS elements. The

   pulse. Under certain conditions the presence of cracks can double the
   temperature rise over that of a smooth surface. Stress at the bottom of
   the cracks can be several times larger than that of the case when there

Abstract = {{Src homology 3 (SH3) domains are globular protein interaction modules
   that regulate cell behavior. The classic SH3 ligand-binding site
   accommodates a hydrophobic PxxP motif and a positively charged
   specificity-determining residue. We have determined the NMR structure of
   insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS) SH3 domain in complex
   with a repeat from Escherichia coli-secreted protein F-like protein
   encoded on prophage U (EspF(U)), a translocated effector of
   enterohemorrhagic E. coli that commandeers the mammalian actin assembly
   machinery. EspF(U)-IRTKS interaction is among the highest affinity
   natural SH3 ligands. Our complex structure reveals a unique type of SH3
   interaction based on recognition of tandem PxxP motifs in the ligand.
   Strikingly, the specificity pocket of IRTKS SH3 has evolved to
   accommodate a polyproline type II helical peptide analogously to docking
   of the canonical PxxP by the conserved IRTKS SH3 proline-binding
   pockets. This cooperative binding explains the high-affinity SH3
   interaction and is required for EspF(U)-IRTKS interaction in mammalian
   cells as well as the formation of localized actin ``pedestals{''}
   beneath bound bacteria. Importantly, tandem PxxP motifs are also found
   in mammalian ligands and have been shown to contribute to IRTKS SH3
   recognition similarly.}},

Title = {{Enumeration of Functional T-Cell Subsets by Fluorescence-Immunospot
   Defines Signatures of Pathogen Burden in Tuberculosis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: IFN-gamma and IL-2 cytokine-profiles define three functional
   T-cell subsets which may correlate with pathogen load in chronic
   intracellular infections. We therefore investigated the feasibility of
   the immunospot platform to rapidly enumerate T-cell subsets by
   single-cell IFN-gamma/IL-2 cytokine-profiling and establish whether
   immunospot-based T-cell signatures distinguish different clinical stages
   of human tuberculosis infection.
   Methods: We used fluorophore-labelled anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IL-2
   antibodies with digital overlay of spatially-mapped colour-filtered
   images to enumerate dual and single cytokine-secreting M. tuberculosis
   antigen-specific T-cells in tuberculosis patients and in latent
   tuberculosis infection (LTBI). We validated results against established
   measures of cytokine-secreting T-cells.
   Results: Fluorescence-immunospot correlated closely with single-cytokine
   enzyme-linked-immunospot for IFN-gamma-secreting T-cells and
   IL-2-secreting T-cells and flow-cytometry-based detection of dual
   IFN-gamma/IL-2-secreting T-cells. The untreated tuberculosis signature
   was dominated by IFN-gamma-only-secreting T-cells which shifted
   consistently in longitudinally-followed patients during treatment to a
   signature dominated by dual IFN-gamma/IL-2-secreting T-cells in treated
   patients. The LTBI signature differed from active tuberculosis, with
   higher proportions of IL-2-only and IFN-gamma/IL-2-secreting T-cells and
   lower proportions of IFN-gamma-only-secreting T-cells.
   Conclusions: Fluorescence-immunospot is a quantitative, accurate measure
   of functional T-cell subsets; identification of cytokine-signatures of
   pathogen burden, distinct clinical stages of M. tuberculosis infection
   and long-term immune containment suggests application for treatment
   monitoring and vaccine evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing number of emerging infectious disease events that have
   spread internationally, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
   and the 2009 pandemic A/H1N1, highlight the need for improvements in
   global outbreak surveillance. It is expected that the proliferation of
   Internet-based reports has resulted in greater communication and
   improved surveillance and reporting frameworks, especially with the
   revision of the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Health
   Regulations (IHR 2005), which went into force in 2007. However, there
   has been no global quantitative assessment of whether and how outbreak
   detection and communication processes have actually changed over time.
   In this study, we analyzed the entire WHO public record of Disease
   Outbreak News reports from 1996 to 2009 to characterize spatial-temporal
   trends in the timeliness of outbreak discovery and public communication
   about the outbreak relative to the estimated outbreak start date. Cox
   proportional hazards regression analyses show that overall, the
   timeliness of outbreak discovery improved by 7.3\% {[}hazard ratio (HR)
   = 1.073, 95\% CI (1.038; 1.110)] per year, and public communication
   improved by 6.2\% {[}HR = 1.062, 95\% CI (1.028; 1.096)] per year.
   However, the degree of improvement varied by geographic region; the only
   WHO region with statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) improvement in
   outbreak discovery was the Western Pacific region {[}HR = 1.102 per
   year, 95\% CI (1.008; 1.205)], whereas the Eastern Mediterranean {[}HR =
   1.201 per year, 95\% CI (1.066; 1.353)] and Western Pacific regions
   {[}HR = 1.119 per year, 95\% CI (1.025; 1.221)] showed improvement in
   public communication. These findings provide quantitative historical
   assessment of timeliness in infectious disease detection and public
   reporting of outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the spectral properties of a cholesteric
   film presenting a pitch profile with a Gaussian deformation. Using the
   Berreman 4 x 4 matrix formalism, we numerically obtain the transmission
   spectrum at normal and oblique light incidence as a function of width
   and the position of the deformation. Our results reveal that a pair of
   resonant modes emerges inside the main stop band of the transmission
   spectrum as the width of the deformation becomes comparable to the
   helical pitch length. The mechanism behind the emergence of the resonant
   modes is discussed. The case of a pitch profile with multiple Gaussian
   deformations is also analyzed. At this configuration, a crossover from
   single to multiple band-gap pattern can be observed in the transmission
   spectrum, depending on the deformation parameters.}},

Title = {{Human transcriptional interactome of chromatin contribute to gene
   co-expression}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Transcriptional interactome of chromatin is one of the
   important mechanisms in gene transcription regulation. By chromatin
   conformation capture and 3D FISH experiments, several chromatin
   interactions cases among sequence-distant genes or even inter-chromatin
   genes were reported. However, on genomics level, there is still little
   evidence to support these mechanisms. Recently based on Hi-C experiment,
   a genome-wide picture of chromatin interactions in human cells was
   presented. It provides a useful material for analysing whether the
   mechanism of transcriptional interactome is common.
   Results: The main work here is to demonstrate whether the effects of
   transcriptional interactome on gene co-expression exist on genomic
   level. While controlling the effects of transcription factors control
   similarities (TCS), we tested the correlation between Hi-C interaction
   and the mutual ranks of gene co-expression rates (provided by COXPRESdb)
   of intra-chromatin gene pairs. We used 6,084 genes with both TF
   annotation and co-expression information, and matched them into 273,458
   pairs with similar Hi-C interaction ranks in different cell types. The
   results illustrate that co-expression is strongly associated with
   chromatin interaction. Further analysis using GO annotation reveals
   potential correlation between gene function similarity, Hi-C interaction
   and their co-expression.
   Conclusions: According to the results in this research, the
   intra-chromatin interactome may have relation to gene function and
   associate with co-expression. This study provides evidence for
   illustrating the effect of transcriptional interactome on transcription
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of Ar(+) ion irradiation on the structure of pristine and
   fluorinated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was examined using
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman, and x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS). The TEM analysis revealed retention of tubular
   structures in both irradiated samples while Raman spectroscopy and XPS
   data indicated a partial destruction of nanotubes and formation of
   oxygen-containing groups on the nanotube surface. From similarity of
   electronic states of carbon in the irradiated pristine and fluorinated
   SWCNTs observed by XPS, it was suggested that defluorination of
   nanotubes proceeded with breaking of C-F bonds. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Acid-base transport in the renal collecting tubule is mediated by two
   canonical cell types: the beta-intercalated cell secretes HCO3 by an
   apical Cl:HCO3 named pendrin and a basolateral vacuolar (V)-ATPase. Acid
   secretion is mediated by the alpha-intercalated cell, which has an
   apical V-ATPase and a basolateral Cl:HCO3 exchanger (kAE1). We
   previously suggested that the beta-cell converts to the alpha-cell in
   response to acid feeding, a process that depended on the secretion and
   deposition of an extracellular matrix protein termed hensin (DMBT1).
   Here, we show that deletion of hensin from intercalated cells results in
   the absence of typical alpha-intercalated cells and the consequent
   development of complete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA).
   Essentially all of the intercalated cells in the cortex of the mutant
   mice are canonical beta-type cells, with apical pendrin and basolateral
   or diffuse/bipolar V-ATPase. In the medulla, however, a previously
   undescribed cell type has been uncovered, which resembles the cortical
   beta-intercalated cell in ultrastructure, but does not express pendrin.
   Polymerization and deposition of hensin (in response to acidosis)
   requires the activation of beta 1 integrin, and deletion of this gene
   from the intercalated cell caused a phenotype that was identical to the
   deletion of hensin itself, supporting its critical role in hensin
   function. Because previous studies suggested that the conversion of
   beta- to alpha-intercalated cells is a manifestation of terminal
   differentiation, the present results demonstrate that this
   differentiation proceeds from HCO3 secreting to acid secreting
   phenotypes, a process that requires deposition of hensin in the ECM.}},

Abstract = {{Gibberellins (GAs) modulate jasmonate (JA) signaling, which is essential
   for stress response and development in plants. However, the molecular
   details of such phytohormone interaction remain largely unknown. Here,
   we show that the JA ZIM-domain 1 (JAZ1) protein, a key repressor of JA
   signaling, interacts in vivo with DELLA proteins, repressors of the GA
   pathway. DELLAs prevent inhibitory JAZ1 interaction with a key
   transcriptional activator of JA responses, MYC2, and, thus, enhance the
   ability of MYC2 to regulate its target genes. Conversely, GA triggers
   degradation of DELLAs, which allows JAZ1 to bind MYC2 and suppress
   MYC2-dependent JA-signaling outputs. Therefore, our results reveal one
   means by which GAs suppress cellular competence to respond to JA.
   Because DELLAs serve as central regulators that mediate the crosstalk of
   various phytohormones, our model also suggests a candidate mechanism by
   which JA signaling may be fine-tuned by other signaling pathways through
   DELLAs.}},

Abstract = {{In the tunneling framework of Hawking radiation, the quantum tunneling

   of spacetime. The obtained results show that, the emission rate is
   related to changes of the black hole's quantum corrected entropies
   before and after the emission. This implies that, considering the
   quantum effect of spacetime, information conservation of black holes is
   probable. Meanwhile, the quantum corrected entropy of the modified lack
   hole is obtained and the leading correction behave as log-area type. And
   that, the emission spectrum with Planck scale correction is obtained and

Abstract = {{The origins of line broadening in the far-infrared spectrum of
   phosphorus donors in SiGe are investigated. Using a combination of
   Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and time-resolved
   pump-probe measurements, we show that the line shapes are dominated by
   inhomogenous broadening. Experimental FT-IR absorbance spectra measured
   in the temperature range 6-150 K are presented for three different Ge
   contents. Additional spectra of pure phosphorus doped silicon recorded
   under similar experimental conditions are presented and compared with
   the SiGe results. We propose a simple quantitative model to simulate the
   line broadening in our experimental spectra. Our model takes into
   account the compositional variations in the random SiGe binary alloy and
   its effect on the permittivity of the environment around each donor. We
   also show that the addition of small amounts Ge to Si single crystals
   has little detrimental effect on the lifetime of the excited infrared
   electronic energy levels, despite the observed line broadening.}},

Abstract = {{As recently reported, the Graftfast process is a grafting method that
   provides covalently grafted polymer films. It relies on the chemical
   reduction of diazonium salts by reducing agents in absence or presence
   of a vinylic monomer. Contrary to electroinduced methods delivering
   strongly grafted and stable polymer films such as cathodic
   electrografting (CE) of vinylic monomers (which requires drastic
   experimental conditions) or surface electroinitiated emulsion
   polymerization (SEEP), the Graftfast process provides strongly grafted
   polymer films on any type of materials (conductors, semiconductors, and
   insulators). Moreover, it is a fast one-step reaction occurring at
   atmospheric pressure, ambient air and room temperature in water, which
   makes it more suitable for applications than the slower ATRP-based
   methods. This article aims to complete the first paper on this process
   by giving preliminary answers to the question: How does the Graftfast
   process work? To achieve this mechanistic study, dual surface-solution
   analyses were performed. Both spontaneous and redox-induced grafting of
   polynitrophenylene-like (PNP) films and poly(hydroxyethyl) methacrylate
   (PHEMA) films were analyzed by infrared-attenuated total reflection
   (IR-ATR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) while the
   corresponding reactive solutions were studied by electronic paramagnetic
   resonance, EPR (spin-trapping method using 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane MNP
   as spin-trapping agent). The EPR spectra and hyperfine structure of MNP
   adducts provide evidence of aryl radicals production, growing polymer
   chains radicals formation, and the existence of critical concentration
   values, leading to favorable grafting kinetics.}},

Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Cell chemotaxis has been characterized as the formation of a front-back
   axis that is triggered by a gradient of chemoattractant; however,
   chemotaxis is accompanied by more complicated behaviors. These include
   migration in a straight line with a stable axis {[}the stable
   single-axis (SSA) pattern] and repeated splitting of the leading edge of
   the cell into two regions, followed by the ``choice{''} of one of these
   as the new leading edge {[}the split and choice (S\&C) pattern]. Indeed,
   transition between these two behaviors can be observed in individual
   cells. However, the conceptual framework of the network of signaling
   molecules that generates these patterns remains to be clarified. We
   confirmed theoretically that a system that has positive and negative
   feedback loops involving the reciprocal cycling between the membrane and
   the cytosol of molecules that promote membrane protrusion or retraction
   generates SSA and S\&C patterns of migratory behavior under similar
   conditions. We also predicted properties of the instabilities of such a
   system, which are essential for the generation of these behaviors, and
   we verified their existence in chemotaxing cells. Our research provides
   a simple model of network structure for chemotactic behaviors, including
   cell polarization.}},

Abstract = {{Malignant astrocytic brain tumors are among the most lethal cancers.
   Quiescent and therapy-resistant neural stem cell (NSC)-like cells in
   astrocytomas are likely to contribute to poor outcome. Malignant
   oligodendroglial brain tumors, in contrast, are therapy sensitive. Using
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and detailed developmental analyses, we
   demonstrated that murine oligodendroglioma cells show characteristics of
   oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and are therapy sensitive, and
   that OPC rather than NSC markers enriched for tumor formation. MRI of
   human oligodendroglioma also suggested a white matter (WM) origin, with
   markers for OPCs rather than NSCs similarly enriching for tumor
   formation. Our results suggest that oligodendroglioma cells show
   hallmarks of OPCs, and that a progenitor rather than a NSC origin
   underlies improved prognosis in patients with this tumor.}},

Abstract = {{The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase transports two Ca2+ per ATP
   hydrolyzed from the cytoplasm to the lumen against a large concentration
   gradient. During transport, the pump alters the affinity and
   accessibility for Ca2+ by rearrangements of transmembrane helices. In
   this study, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed for
   wild-type Ca2+-ATPase in the Ca2+-bound form and the Gln mutants of
   Glu771 and Glu908. Both of them contribute only one carboxyl oxygen to
   site I Ca2+, but only Glu771Gln completely looses the Ca2+-binding
   ability. The simulations show that: (i) For Glu771Gln, but not
   Glu908Gln, coordination of Ca2+ was critically disrupted. (ii)
   Coordination broke at site II first, although Glu771 and Glu908 only
   contribute to site I. (iii) A water molecule bound to site I Ca2+ and
   hydrogen bonded to Glu771 in wild-type, drastically changed the
   coordination of Ca2+ in the mutant. (iv) Water molecules flooded the
   binding sites from the lumenal side. (v) The side chain conformation of
   Ile775, located at the head of a hydrophobic cluster near the lumenal
   surface, appears critical for keeping out bulk water. Thus the
   simulations highlight the importance of the water molecule bound to site
   I Ca2+ and point to a strong relationship between Ca2+-coordination and
   shielding of bulk water, providing insights into the mechanism of gating
   of ion pathways in cation pumps.}},

Title = {{The role of humans in the diversification of a threatened island raptor}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anthropogenic habitat modifications have led to the
   extinction of many species and have favoured the expansion of others.
   Nonetheless, the possible role of humans as a diversifying force in
   vertebrate evolution has rarely been considered, especially for species
   with long generation times. We examine the influence that humans have
   had on the colonization and phenotypic and genetic differentiation of an
   insular population of a long-lived raptor species, the Egyptian vulture
   (Neophron percnopterus).
   Results: The morphological comparison between the Canarian Egyptian
   vultures and the main and closest population in Western Europe (Iberia)
   indicated that insular vultures are significantly heavier (16\%) and
   larger (about 3\%) than those from Iberia. Bayesian and standard genetic
   analyses also showed differentiation (F-ST = 0.11, p < 0.01). The
   inference of changes in the effective size of the Canarian deme, using
   two likelihood-based Bayesian approaches, suggested that the
   establishment of this insular population took place some 2500 years ago,
   matching the date of human colonization. This is consistent with the
   lack of earlier fossils.
   Conclusions: Archaeological remains show that first colonizers were
   Berber people from northern Africa who imported goats. This new and
   abundant food source could have allowed vultures to colonize, expand and
   adapt to the island environment. Our results suggest that anthropogenic
   environmental change can induce diversification and that this process
   may take place on an ecological time scale (less than 200 generations),
   even in the case of a long-lived species.}},

Title = {{The interaction of quasi-particles in graphene with chemical dopants}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{We review recent developments on the electronic properties of graphene
   under the influence of adsorbates. Potassium and hydrogen adsorbed on
   graphene induce very different effects on the graphene electron gas
   because of the different types-ionic versus covalent-of chemical bonds
   formed. Potassium readily donates electrons to graphene, and the
   resulting Fermi sea shows strong electron-plasmon scattering but weak
   defect scattering. In contrast, hydrogen adsorption saturates a carbon
   pi bond, leading to the removal of electrons from the graphene. Such
   hydrogen bonds act as a lattice defect, leading to a sharp reduction in
   conductivity and an insulating temperature dependence of the
   resistivity. The marked contrast in the behaviour of these adsorbates
   derives from the different symmetry classes of their defect geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Our aim here is to study the sugar reduction in musts to obtain wines
   with a slight alcohol reduction by nanofiltration. Specifically, sugar
   reduction is achieved by two successive nanofiltration steps. To test
   the method, we have worked with two types of musts: a white must from
   Verdejo grapes and a red one from Tinta de Toro grapes. The musts
   obtained from the nanofiltration treatment have been mixed with
   untreated must or with the retentate of the first nanofiltration stage
   in a proportion adequate to reduce the alcohol content of the resulting
   wines by 2 degrees.
   To verify the effectiveness of the process, each of these musts has been
   fermented along with an untreated control sample of the same must. The
   alcohol reduction in the wines has been satisfactory. However, a slight
   loss in the color and aroma of some compounds has been detected. (C)

Abstract = {{I investigate the role of two strike-slip faults in the tectonics of the
   western North America-Caribbean plate margin. The Ixcan fault, located
   in Guatemala north of the Polochic fault, is seismically active, with
   earthquakes of magnitude up to 5.7 reported recently. Fault-plane
   solutions along this curvilinear but generally E-W trending fault
   indicate left-lateral, strike-slip displacement. Several historic
   earthquakes appear to have taken place along the Ixcan fault since 1728,
   the largest one being the 1816 event (M=7.5). The NW-SE trending
   Concordia fault in southeastern Mexico appears to be the site of the
   great (M=7.6) earthquake of 1902. Isoseismals for this event suggest
   shallow, left-lateral strike-slip faulting.
   I propose a seismotectonic model in which both faults are part of the
   deformation associated to the North America-Caribbean plate boundary
   zone. Transpressive structures are found in the fault steps between
   strike-slip fault systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{1069-1077}},

Abstract = {{We identified the mitotic kinesin-like protein 2 (MKlp2), a kinesin
   required for chromosome passenger complex (CPC)-mediated cytokinesis, as
   a target of the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad2. MKlp2 possesses a
   consensus Mad2-binding motif required for Mad2 binding. Mad2 prevents
   MKlp2 from loading onto the mitotic spindle, a prerequisite step for its
   function as a mitotic kinesin. Furthermore, Mad2 inhibits the ability of
   MKlp2 to relocate the CPC from centromeres, an essential step to promote
   cytokinesis. An MKlp2 mutant that is refractory to Mad2-mediated
   inhibition prematurely translocates to the mitotic spindle and
   mislocalizes the CPC component Aurora B from the midbody of dividing
   cells. This correlates with an increased incidence of cytokinesis
   failure. Together, these findings reveal that MKlp2 is a novel mitotic
   target of Mad2 necessary for proper mitotic progression and cytokinesis.}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically investigate the intrinsic optical anisotropy or
   polarization induced by the microscopic interface asymmetry (MIA) in
   no-common-atom (NCA) InAs/GaSb superlattices (SLs) grown along the
   {[}001] direction. The eight-band K center dot P model is used to
   calculate the electronic band structures and incorporates the MIA
   effect. A Boltzmann equation approach is employed to calculate the
   optical properties. We found that in NCA InAs/GaSb SLs, the MIA effect
   causes a large in-plane optical anisotropy for linearly polarized light
   and the largest anisotropy occurs for light polarized along the {[}110]
   and {[}1 (1) over bar0] directions. The relative difference between the
   optical-absorption coefficient for {[}110]-polarized light and that for
   {[}1 (1) over bar0]-polarized light is found to be larger than 50\%. The
   dependence of the in-plane optical anisotropy on temperature,
   photoexcited carrier density, and layer width is examined in detail.
   This study is important for optical devices which require the
   polarization control and selectivity.}},

Title = {{Environmental and Lifestyle Factors Associated with Perceived Facial Age
   in Chinese Women}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Perceived facial age has been proposed as a biomarker of ageing with
   `looking young for one's age' linked to physical and cognitive
   functioning and to increased survival for Caucasians. We have
   investigated the environmental and lifestyle factors associated with
   perceived facial ageing in Chinese women. Facial photographs were
   collected from 250 Chinese women, aged 25-70 years in Shanghai, China.
   Perceived facial age was determined and related to chronological age for
   each participant. Lifestyle and health information was collected by
   questionnaire. Bivariate analyses (controlling for chronological age)
   identified and quantified lifestyle variables associated with perceived
   facial age. Independent predictors of perceived age were identified by
   multivariate modelling. Factors which significantly associated with
   looking younger for one's chronological age included greater years of
   education (p<0.001), fewer household members (p=0.027), menopausal
   status (p=0.020), frequency of visiting one's doctor (p=0.013), working
   indoors (p<0.001), spending less time in the sun (p=0.015), moderate
   levels of physical activity (p=0.004), higher frequency of teeth
   cleaning (p<0.001) and more frequent use of facial care products:
   cleanser (p<0.001); moisturiser (p=0.016) or night cream (p=0.016).
   Overall, 36.5\% of the variation in the difference between perceived and
   chronological age could be explained by a combination of chronological
   age and 6 independent lifestyle variables. We have thus identified and
   quantified a number of factors associated with younger appearance in
   Chinese women. Presentation of these factors in the context of facial
   appearance could provide significant motivation for the adoption of a
   range of healthy behaviours at the level of both individuals and
   populations.}},

Title = {{Finite entanglement entropy from the zero-point area of spacetime}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{The calculation of entanglement entropy S of quantum fields in
   spacetimes with horizon shows that, quite generically, S is (a)
   proportional to the area A of the horizon and (b) divergent. I argue
   that this divergence, which arises even in the case of Rindler horizon
   in flat spacetime, is yet another indication of a deep connection
   between horizon thermodynamics and gravitational dynamics. In an
   emergent perspective of gravity, which accommodates this connection, the
   fluctuations around the equipartition value in the area elements will
   lead to a minimal quantum of area O(1)L-P(2), which will act as a
   regulator for this divergence. In a particular prescription for
   incorporating the L-P(2) as zero-point-area of spacetime, this does
   happen and the divergence in entanglement entropy is regularized,
   leading to S proportional to A/L-P(2) in Einstein gravity. In more
   general models of gravity, the surface density of microscopic degrees of
   freedom is different which leads to a modified regularization procedure
   and the possibility that the entanglement entropy-when appropriately
   regularized-matches the Wald entropy.}},

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{We have dispersed graphene in water, stabilized by a range of 12 ionic
   and non-ionic surfactants. In all cases, the degree of exfoliation, as
   characterized by flake length and thickness, was similar. The dispersed
   flakes were typically 750 nm long and, on average, four layers thick.
   However, the dispersed concentration varied from solvent to solvent. For
   the ionic surfactants, the concentration scaled with the square of the
   zeta potential of the surfactant-coated flakes. This suggests that the
   concentration is proportional to the magnitude of the electrostatic
   potential barrier, which stabilizes surfactant-coated flakes against
   aggregation. For the non-ionic surfactants, the dispersed graphene
   concentration scaled linearly with the magnitude of the steric potential
   barrier stabilizing the flakes. However, the data suggested that other
   contributions are also important.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of a strong dynamics for Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking
   (EWSB), both vector and scalar degrees of freedom have been studied in
   the literature within an effective Lagrangian approach. Here we consider
   the case in which both a scalar, h, and a vector, V - respectively an
   iso-singlet and an iso-triplet under a custodial SU(2) - are relevant
   with a mass below the cut-off Lambda approximate to 4 pi v. We study the
   amplitudes for the processes W-L W-L -> W-L W-L, hh, V-L V-L, V(L)h.
   Requiring unitarity for the elastic channel W-L W-L -> W-L W-L we can
   reduce the parameter space to two free parameters for given masses of
   the heavy vector and the scalar. We study the numerical total cross
   sections for the associated productions pp -> Vhjj by Vector Boson
   Fusion (VBF) and pp -> Vh by Drell-Yan (DY) annihilation as functions of
   these free parameters. The expected rates of same-sign di-lepton and
   tri-lepton events from the decay of the V h final state are also given.

Abstract = {{The authors aimed to examine whether nonparticipation in a
   population-based health study was associated with poorer health status;
   to determine whether specific health problems were overrepresented among
   nonparticipants; and to explore potential consequences of participation
   bias on associations between exposures and outcomes. They used data from
   the Hordaland Health Study (HUSK), conducted in western Norway in
   1997-1999. Of 29,400 persons invited, 63.1\% participated in the study.
   Information from HUSK was linked with the Norwegian national registry of
   disability pensions (DPs), including information about DP diagnosis. The
   risk of DP receipt was almost twice as high among nonparticipants as
   participants (relative risk = 1.88, 95\% confidence interval: 1.81,
   1.95). The association was strongest for DPs received for mental
   disorders, with a 3-fold increased risk for nonparticipation. Substance
   abuse, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders were especially
   overrepresented among nonparticipants. The authors simulated the impact
   of nonparticipation on associations between exposures and outcomes by
   excluding HUSK participants with higher symptoms of common mental
   disorders (exposure) and examining the impact on DP (outcome). This
   selective exclusion modestly reduced associations between common mental
   disorders and DP. The authors conclude that nonparticipants have poorer
   health, but this is disorder-dependent. Participation bias is probably a
   greater threat to the validity of prevalence studies than to studies of
   associations between exposures and outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{New magnetotelluric and receiver transfer function studies provide
   insights from the upper to the lower crust of the eastern Betic
   Cordillera, which is deformed by large folds, normal faults, and a major
   transcurrent left-lateral fault, the Carboneras Fault Zone (CFZ).
   Receiver function analysis determines a NNW dipping Moho reaching 20
   degrees that increases in depth, from 20 km south of the CFZ up to 34 km
   in the Sierra de Los Filabres. In addition, seismic discontinuities
   determined in the upper crust are interpreted as major contacts between
   metamorphic complexes that are detached and folded. The MT inversion
   model reveals a conductive zone, also representing a crustal seismic
   discontinuity, associated with the Alpujarride/Nevado-Filabride contact
   and fitting the N vergent geometry of the Sierra Alhamilla antiform. A
   small flexure at Moho coincides with the CFZ, as revealed by the Bouguer
   anomaly trend, in agreement with the receiver function results.
   Moreover, the Bahr strike and tipper angle at the stations placed
   closest to the CFZ clearly reveal the continuity of the CFZ at least
   down to approximately 15 km in depth, crossing all the detected crustal
   discontinuities up to the Moho. The lack of a clear Moho offset
   associated with the Carboneras Fault supports the idea that some large
   strike-slip faults tend to accommodate the deformation by a broadening
   fault zone at lower crustal levels. Its nucleation could occur at the
   base of a thin crust, where melting processes critically reduced the
   lithospheric strength during the late Miocene, to then propagate upward,
   reaching the topographic surface. Northward, the lithosphere comprised
   moderately larger strength, and the crustal discontinuities favored the
   development of larger folds with kilometric amplitude instead of
   strike-slip faults since the late Miocene.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: The exact etiology of sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) is
   unclear, but it is interesting that several cardiovascular risk factors
   are associated with higher incidence of AD. The link between these risk
   factors and AD has yet to be identified; however, a common feature is
   endothelial dysfunction, specifically, decreased bioavailability of
   nitric oxide (NO).
   Objective: To determine the relationship between endothelial derived NO
   and the expression and processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP).
   Methods and Results: We used human brain microvascular endothelial cells
   to examine the role of NO in modulating APP expression and processing in
   vitro. Inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with the
   specific NOS inhibitor L-NAME (N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) led to
   increased APP and BACE1 (beth-site APP-cleaving enzyme1) protein levels,
   as well as increased secretion of the amyloidogenic peptide amyloid beth
   (A beth) (control 10.93 +/- 0.70 pg/mL; L-NAME 168.21 +/- 27.38 pg/mL;
   P<0.001). To examine the role of NO in modulation of APP expression and
   processing in vivo, we used brain and cerebral microvessels from
   eNOS-deficient (eNOS(-/-)) mice. Brain tissue from eNOS(-/-) mice had
   statistically higher APP and BACE1 protein levels, as well as increased
   BACE1 enzyme activity and A beth(A beta(1-42) wild-type control,
   0.737pg/mg; eNOS(-/-), 1.475 pg/mg; P<0.05), compared with wild-type
   controls (n=6 to 8 animals per background). Brain microvessels from
   eNOS(-/-) mice also showed statistically higher BACE1 protein levels as
   compared with wild-type control.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that endothelial NO plays an important
   role in modulating APP expression and processing within the brain and
   cerebrovasculature. The NO/cGMP pathway may be an important therapeutic
   target in preventing and treating mild cognitive impairment, as well as
   AD. (Circ Res. 2010;107:1498-1502.)}},

Abstract = {{Prompted by the Fermi-LAT discovery of a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar
   inside the CTA 1 supernova remnant, we obtained a 130 ks XMM-Newton
   observation to assess the timing behavior of this pulsar. Exploiting
   both the unprecedented photon harvest and the contemporary Fermi-LAT
   timing measurements, a 4.7 sigma single-peak pulsation is detected,
   making PSR J0007+7303 the second example, after Geminga, of a
   radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar also seen to pulsate in X-rays.
   Phase-resolved spectroscopy shows that the off-pulse portion of the
   light curve is dominated by a power-law, non-thermal spectrum, while the
   X-ray peak emission appears to be mainly of thermal origin, probably
   from a polar cap heated by magnetospheric return currents, pointing to a
   hot spot varying throughout the pulsar rotation.}},

Abstract = {{Cadmium sulfide (CAS) thin films have been deposited on glass/conducting
   glass substrates using low-cost chemical bath deposition method. The
   deposited films have been characterized using various techniques in
   order to optimize growth parameters. It has been confirmed by X-ray
   diffraction measurement that the deposited layers are mainly consisting
   of CdS phase. The PEC measurements indicate that the deposited CdS layer
   is n-type in electrical conduction, and optical absorbance measurements
   show that the band gap is 2.42 eV for as-deposited film and 2.27 eV upon
   heat treatment for one hour in air ambient. Both atomic force microscopy
   and scanning electron microscopy measurements indicate the formation of
   pinhole free and smooth surface of CdS films of nanosized grains. The
   electrical resistivity is also observed in the order of 104(4) Omega cm
   and decreases as temperature increases.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium manganese oxides were prepared by cathodic deposition from
   aqueous KMnO4 solution on an indium tin oxide slide. The products were
   characterized by XRD, XPS and SEM techniques. The as-prepared products
   were potassium manganese oxides with different manganese valence states.
   The component, morphology and size of the products could be controlled
   through adjusting the preparation parameters such as deposition
   potential, deposition time and acidity of the electrolyte. The results
   show that the deposition of potassium manganese oxide from aqueous KMnO4
   is a pH value dependent procedure. Due to the facilitating of
   intercalation and deintercalation of cations, the specific capacitance
   of the products deposited for 500 s is higher than that of 3 000 and 6
   000 s. At a scan rate of 2 mV . s(-1) in 0.2 mol . L-1 K2SO4 aqueous
   electrolyte, the specific capacitances of products are 119.4, 99.5 and
   109.0 F . g(-1) corresponding to the deposition time of 500, 3 000 and 6
   000 s, respectively. Electrochemical experiments indicate that the
   reversibility and performance of these potassium manganese oxides are
   also changed with the deposition time.}},

Abstract = {{Twin studies have shown that longevity in humans is moderately heritable
   with a genetic component of 25-32\% Experimental model organisms point
   to the existence of core survival and anti-ageing pathways that have
   been conserved throughout evolution It has been shown that mutations in
   single genes Involved in these pathways can either delay or accelerate
   the ageing process and that many of these genes and pathways are also
   present in humans Here we performed a targeted investigation of selected
   genes (i) involved in longevity pathways (insulin receptor/insulin-like
   growth factor-I signaling and energy metabolism intracellular signaling
   apoptosis and stress response) and (ii) in which mutations lead to
   genetic perturbations in animal models or human diseases Altogether we
   tested 500 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 343
   candidate genes for association with the longevity phenotype in a German
   sample comprising about 400 centenarians and an equal number of younger
   control subjects Thus this study presents one of the largest candidate
   studies in human genetic longevity research conducted to-date The three
   top-ranking markers which are located in the genes DUSP6 NALP1 and PERP
   revealed p-values <= 0 01 in the allelic case-control comparisons
   Although the association signals in Germans were not replicated in an
   Independent French sample the large number of analysis results is deemed
   a valuable reference point for further genetic studies (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Amitrole (3-amino-1 2 4-triazole) is a widely used herbicide Amitrole
   Induces thyroid and liver tumors in rodents However the mechanism of
   carcinogenesis by amitrole remains to be clarified To clarify the
   mechanism of carcinogenesis Induced by amitrole we investigated the
   formation of 8-oxo-7 8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) a
   characteristic of oxidatively generated DNA damage by an amitrole
   metabolite 3-amino-5-mercapto-1 2 4-triazole (AMT) in the presence of
   Cu(II) The amount of 8-oxodG was Increased by AMT in the presence of
   Cu(II) AMT-induced 8-oxodG formation was enhanced in deuterium oxide
   (D2O) which prolongs the half life of singlet oxygen (102) more than
   that in H2O Sodium azide and 1 4-diazabicyclo{[}2 2 2]-octane (DABCO)
   potent and relatively specific scavengers of 102 inhibited AMT-mediated
   8-oxodG formation Bathocuproine a Cu(I) chelator also inhibited the
   8-oxodG formation On the other hand typical OH scavengers did not
   inhibit the generation of 8-oxodG AMT plus Cu(II) also induced
   piperidine-labile DNA lesions frequently at every guanine residue These
   results suggest that 102 and Cu(I) play an important role in DNA damage
   induced by AMT It is concluded that oxidatively generated DNA damage
   induced by AMT via the generation of O-1(2) may contribute to

Abstract = {{A rapid on-line solid phase extraction ultra high performance liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the
   identification and quantitation of nine perfluorinated compounds in
   matrices of environmental, biological and food interest. Pre-treatment,
   solid phase extraction, chromatographic and mass detection conditions
   were optimised, in order to apply the whole methodology to the analysis
   of different matrices. Particular attention was devoted to the
   evaluation of matrix effect and the correlated phenomena of ion
   enhancement or suppression in mass spectrometry detection. LOD and LOQ
   range from 3 to 15 ng L(-1) and from 10 to 50 ng L(-1), respectively.
   Method detection limits (MDLs) were also calculated for each kind of
   matrix. The recovery, evaluated for each analyte, does not depend on
   analyte concentration in the explored concentration range: average (R)
   over bar\% values are always greater than 82.9\%. In the whole, the
   results obtained for samples of river waters, blood serum, blood plasma,
   and fish confirm the ubiquitous presence of perfluorinated compounds, as
   recently denounced by many sources. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   (sigma) = 26. These tools are used to begin the study of the target
   space-time dimension (D) over cap (j) (sigma) of cycle j in sector
   sigma, which is naturally defined as the number of zero modes (momenta)
   of each cycle. The general model-dependent formulae derived here will be

Abstract = {{The fusion peptide of influenza viral hemagglutinin plays a critical
   role in virus entry by facilitating membrane fusion between the virus
   and target cells. As the fusion peptide is the only universally
   conserved epitope in all influenza A and B viruses, it could be an
   attractive target for vaccine-induced immune responses. We previously
   reported that antibodies targeting the first 14 amino acids of the
   N-terminus of the fusion peptide could bind to virtually all influenza
   virus strains and quantify hemagglutinins in vaccines produced in
   embryonated eggs. Here we demonstrate that these universal antibodies
   bind to the viral hemagglutinins in native conformation presented in
   infected mammalian cell cultures and neutralize multiple subtypes of
   virus by inhibiting the pH-dependant fusion of viral and cellular
   membranes. These results suggest that this unique, highly-conserved
   linear sequence in viral hemagglutinin is exposed sufficiently to be
   attacked by the antibodies during the course of infection and merits
   further investigation because of potential importance in the protection
   against diverse strains of influenza viruses. Crown Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We report a novel method for fabricating silver nanoparticle assemblies
   with a featured gradient of spatial organizations. The unique step is to
   generate a gradient of deposit mass by dynamical deposition on a
   mask-covered substrate with a collimated cluster beam in oblique
   incidence. Then such gradient can be translated to the gradients of
   sizes or number densities of the nanoparticles separately, depending on
   the nature of the substrate surface. Multiscale gradients are
   implemented from mesoscopic to macroscopic. One-chip rapid detection of
   the optimal structure for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is
   achieved on the gradient assembly with particle number densities.}},

Abstract = {{An increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VIE) is observed in
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Only a limited
   number of studies described the effect of combined antiretroviral
   therapy (cART) on coagulation markers. In a prospective cohort study in
   cART-naive South African HIV-infected individuals the effect of
   initiating cART on markers of endothelial cell activation, coagulation
   and natural anticoagulation was studied. These markers were compared to
   the reference ranges for an HIV-uninfected control population recruited
   from hospital staff. A venous ultrasound of both legs was performed to
   detect asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT). A total number of 123
   HIV-infected participants were included. The patients were predominantly
   black and severely immuno-compromised. The CD4 cell count increased and
   the HIV viral load decreased significantly after the initiation of cART
   (p<0.001). The median follow-up period was 7.2 (+/- 1.6) months.
   Laboratory testing before and after initiation of cART was completed by
   86 patients. Before initiating CART significantly elevated von
   Willebrand factor and D-dimer levels, increased activated protein C
   sensitivity ratio (APCsr) and decreased total and free protein S and
   protein C levels were observed compared to HIV-negative controls. At
   follow-up all markers, except APCsr, improved towards the normal range
   for controls without showing complete normalisation. In a subgroup of 57
   patients no asymptomatic DVT was found. Compared to the controls,
   abnormal levels of coagulation markers were observed in HIV-infected
   individuals before and after the initiation of cART. Most markers
   improved after starting cART, but remained significantly different from
   the controls, indicating a persistent disturbed haemostatic balance.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{The charged fermion mass matrices are always invariant under U(1)(3)
   symmetry linked to the fermion number transformation. A class of
   two-Higgs-doublet models can be identified by requiring that the
   definition of this symmetry in an arbitrary weak basis be independent of
   Higgs parameters such as the ratio of the Higgs vacuum expectation
   values. The tree-level flavor changing neutral currents normally present
   in two-Higgs-doublet models are absent in this class of models, but
   unlike the type-I or type-II Higgs doublet models, the charged Higgs
   couplings in these models contain additional flavor-dependent
   CP-violating phases. These phases can account for the recent hints of
   the beyond-standard-model CP violation in the B-d and B-s mixing. In
   particular, there is a range of parameters in which new phases do not
   contribute to the Kmeson CP violation but give identical new physics
   contribution to the B-d and B-s meson mixing. Specific model
   realizations of the above scenario are briefly discussed.}},

   observable in the F-1-F-3 projection planes of the 3D-HN(C)N spectral
   variants. The F-2-F-3 projection planes of the spectra provide unique
   identification of the check points. The protocol has been demonstrated
   on two C-13/N-15-labelled proteins: ubiquitin and calbindin-D9k. In
   either case complete H-N and N-15 backbone assignments were obtained in
   less than a day each. The method would be valuable for NMR structural

Abstract = {{When it escapes early detection, malignant melanoma becomes a highly
   lethal and treatment-refractory cancer. Melastatin is greatly
   downregulated in metastatic melanomas and is widely believed to function
   as a melanoma tumor suppressor. Here we report that tumor suppressive
   activity is not mediated by melastatin but instead by a microRNA
   (miR-211) hosted within an intron of melastatin. Increasing expression
   of miR-211 but not melastatin reduced migration and invasion of
   malignant and highly invasive human melanomas characterized by low
   levels of melastatin and miR-211. An unbiased network analysis of
   melanoma-expressed genes filtered for their roles in metastasis
   identified three central node genes: IGF2R, TGFBR2, and NFAT5.
   Expression of these genes was reduced by miR-211, and knockdown of each
   gene phenocopied the effects of increased miR-211 on melanoma
   invasiveness. These data implicate miR-211 as a suppressor of melanoma
   invasion whose expression is silenced or selected against via
   suppression of the entire melastatin locus during human melanoma
   progression.}},

Abstract = {{The Au/Ru nanoparticle, in a molar ratio of 5:1 of Au to Ru, was
   modified by aptamer to prepare an aptamer AuRu nanoprobe(AptAuRu) for
   Pb2+, and the AptAuRu probe was stable in pH =7.0 Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4 buffer
   solution and in the presence of 85 mmol/L NaCl. Upon addition of Pb2+,
   the nanoprobe reacted with Pb2+ to form very stable G-quadruplex, and
   the released AuRu nanoparticles aggregated to big particles, which
   resulted in the resonance scattering(RS) peak at 592 nm increasing. The
   increased RS intensity was linear to the concentration of Pb2+ in the
   range of 1.2-240 pmol/L. After filtration, the unreacted AptAuRu
   nanoprobe in filtration solution exhibited strong catalytic effect on
   the slow particle reaction of NaClO3-NaI-TDMAC, and the association
   complex particle appeared a resonance scattering peak at 472 nm. When
   the concentration of Pb2+ increased, the amount of AptAuRu nanoprobe in
   filtration solution decreased, and the catalysis weak, that result to

Abstract = {{The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) exerts important
   functions in controlling glucose and energy homeostasis. Endogenous
   GLP-1 has a very short half-life due to DPP-IV-mediated degradation and
   renal clearance, which limits the therapeutic use of native GLP-1. We
   have shown previously that immunoglobulin fragment-fused GLP-1
   (GLP-1/Fc) is a structurally stable GLP-1 analog. Here, we report a
   non-viral GLP-1/Fc gene therapy strategy utilizing a REP78-in-trans and
   REB-in-cis element system to achieve a site-specific genomic
   integration. For this purpose, the GLP-1/Fc expression cassette, which
   is fused with the RBE element, was co-injected with the Rep78 plasmid
   into the muscles of transgenic mice carrying the AAVS1 locus of human
   chromosome 19. The Rep protein-mediated site-specific integration was
   demonstrated by nested PCR, dot-blot, and Southern blotting. We found
   that this approach reduced weight gain and improved lipid profiles in
   the AAVS1-mice on high-fat diet challenge. Our observations reveal a new
   GLP-1 therapeutic strategy with an apparent absence of side effects,
   which may find applications in diabetes treatment and obesity prevention

Abstract = {{Anxiety and/or fear can alter the nociceptive response in humans and
   animals. Slight stimulation of the dorsal periagueductal gray matter
   (DPAG) produced anxiety/fear-related behaviour and hyponociception in
   escapable, non-anxiogenic nociceptive models. Our aim was to investigate
   the role of the DPAG in models of persistent, anxiogenic nociception.
   GLY (1, 10, 20, and 80 nmol/0.3 mu l/60 s) was injected into the DPAG of
   rats, 5 min before formalin (2\%/50 mu l) injection either into the
   knee-joint or hind paw. In the knee-joint incapacitation test, GLY
   caused hypernociception at lower doses and hyponociception at higher
   doses. In the paw shacking test. GLY produced only hypernociception with
   the higher dose. Co-injecting GLY with 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-CLK) or
   (+/-)-3-amino-1-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone (HA-966) completely prevented the
   GLY effects in incapacitation and paw shacking tests, respectively. GLY
   injections outside the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) did not change
   the nociception. Behavioural analysis indicated that formalin paw
   injection produced higher stress signals than knee-joint injection, as
   diminished exploratory behaviour, and stereotypy. The results suggest
   that activation of the DPAG through the GLY(B)/NMDA receptor is able to
   produce either facilitation or inhibition of nociception depending on
   the nociceptive context. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical processes involving particle suspensions are still ill
   understood. Electro-flotation is process through which particles or ions
   can be selectively separated. Although the technique has been widely
   studied, not much is known about the effect of the chemistry of
   suspended particles on the process performance which constitutes the aim
   of the present research work.
   A column-type cell was designed to carry out electro-flotation
   experiments and standard air flotation experiments. Two minerals,
   Merensky reef and UG2, were tested.
   The classic air-flotation operation gave higher recoveries and grade of
   collected material compared to electro-flotation only when using
   Merensky reef ore. However, in the case of UG2 ore, the
   electro-flotation reached similar performance to that of the classic
   operation. It was found that the electrodes readily interact with the
   mineral pulp reducing the efficiency to generate bubbles. That
   efficiency depends significantly on the ore composition. Further
   electrochemical studies concerning how the voltage is used throughout
   the process was performed. The conductivity of the pulp formed using UG2
   ore increased around 5 times compared to that observed when using
   Merensky reef ore. Under identical experimental conditions, the froth
   formed with Merensky reef ore was shallow and precarious compared to the
   thick and stable froth formed in the case of UG2 ore. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Journal = {{CHEMBIOCHEM}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{2606-2612}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Several different cationic nonapeptides have been synthesized and
   investigated with respect to how they can influence the thermal melting
   of 2'-O-methylRNA/RNA and DNA/DNA duplexes. Each peptide has a
   C-terminal L-phenylalanine unit and is otherwise uniformly composed of a
   sequence of a specific basic D-amino acid that in most cases will be
   largely charged at neutral pH. These N-terminal octamer stretches are
   composed variously of the amino acids D-lysine, D-diaminobutyric acid
   (D-Dab), D-diaminopropionic acid (D-Dap), or D-histidine. None of the
   peptides substantially affected the thermal melting of DNA/DNA duplexes,
   which was in sharp contrast with their effects on 2'-O-methylRNA/RNA
   duplexes. In particular, the peptides based on diaminopropionic and
   diaminobutyric acid units had strong positive effects on the melting
   temperatures of the 2'-O-methylRNA duplexes (up to 16 degrees C higher
   with 1 equivalent of peptide) at pH 7, whereas at pH 6 the effect was
   even more drastic (Delta T-m up to + 25 degrees C). The shorter R groups
   of the Dap and Dab groups appear to have a better length than lysine for
   enhancement of the thermal melting of the 2'-O-methylRNA/RNA duplex, an
   effect that is more pronounced at lower pH but substantial even at pH 7,
   although the Dap derivative is not likely to be fully protonated. The
   dramatic difference between the influence, or lack thereof, on the
   2'-O-methylRNA/RNA and the DNA/DNA thermal meltings suggest that,
   although electrostatic interactions probably play a role, there is
   another major and structurally dependent component influencing the
   properties of the duplexes. This is also seen in the observation that
   the oligo-Dap and oligo-Dab peptides give greater melting point
   enhancements than both the lysine peptide (with a longer side chain) and
   a beta-linked Dap peptide with a shorter side chain and a longer
   backbone.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{We investigate four consecutive substorms using observations and global
   MHD simulation code GUMICS-4. The solar wind energy input is estimated
   by the epsilon parameter and evaluated from the simulation by direct
   integration of the energy transfer through the magnetopause. The
   ionospheric dissipation is estimated using the AE index and also
   evaluated by computing the Joule heating from both hemispheres in the
   simulation. Our results show that there is a clear and repeatable time
   delay between changes in the solar wind parameters and the energy input
   through the magnetopause. In the simulation, the Joule heating is quite
   directly driven by the energy input through the magnetopause, without
   any significant delays. The AE index shows two distinct responses: when
   the energy input through the magnetopause increases, the AE index
   responds with a delay; this can be interpreted as the growth phase. When
   the energy input decreases, the AE decreases simultaneously, without any
   significant delay. This indicates that after the onset, the energy input
   to the ionosphere is directly controlled by the energy input through the
   magnetopause. The results suggest that the recovery phase timing is
   determined by the solar wind parameters (with a delay associated with
   the magnetopause processes), while the onset timing is associated with
   internal magnetotail and/or magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes.}},

Title = {{Structure and expression of two nuclear receptor genes in marsupials:
   insights into the evolution of the antisense overlap between the
   alpha-thyroid hormone receptor and Rev-erb alpha}},
Journal = {{BMC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Alternative processing of alpha-thyroid hormone receptor (TR
   alpha, NR1A1) mRNAs gives rise to two functionally antagonistic nuclear
   receptors: TR alpha 1, the alpha-type receptor, and TR alpha 2, a
   non-hormone binding variant that is found only in mammals. TR alpha 2
   shares an unusual antisense coding overlap with mRNA for Rev-erb alpha
   (NR1D1), another nuclear receptor protein. In this study we examine the
   structure and expression of these genes in the gray short-tailed
   opossum, Monodelphis domestica, in comparison with that of eutherian
   mammals and three other marsupial species, Didelphis virginiana,
   Potorous tridactylus and Macropus eugenii, in order to understand the
   evolution and regulatory role of this antisense overlap.
   Results: The sequence, expression and genomic organization of mRNAs
   encoding TR alpha 1 and Rev-erb alpha are very similar in the opossum
   and eutherian mammals. However, the sequence corresponding to the TR
   alpha 2 coding region appears truncated by almost 100 amino acids. While
   expression of TR alpha 1 and Rev-erb alpha was readily detected in all
   tissues of M. domestica ages 0 days to 18 weeks, TR alpha 2 mRNA was not
   detected in any tissue or stage examined. These results contrast with
   the widespread and abundant expression of TR alpha 2 in rodents and
   other eutherian mammals. To examine requirements for alternative
   splicing of TR alpha mRNAs, a series of chimeric minigenes was
   constructed. Results show that the opossum TR alpha 2-specific 5' splice
   site sequence is fully competent for splicing but the sequence
   homologous to the TR alpha 2 3' splice site is not, even though the
   marsupial sequences are remarkably similar to core splice site elements
   in rat.
   Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that the variant nuclear
   receptor isoform, TR alpha 2, is not expressed in marsupials and that
   the antisense overlap between TR alpha and Rev-erb alpha thus is unique
   to eutherian mammals. Further investigation of the TR alpha and Rev-erb
   alpha genes in marsupial and eutherian species promises to yield
   additional insight into the physiological function of TR alpha 2 and the
   role of the associated antisense overlap with Rev-erb alpha in
   regulating expression of these genes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate numerically the micro and macro mechanical behaviour of
   non-cohesive granular materials, especially in the static limit. To
   achieve this goal we performed numerical simulations generating
   two-dimensional ``sand piles{''} from several thousands of convex
   polygonal particles with varying shapes, sizes and corner numbers, using
   a discrete element approach based on soft particles. We emphasize that
   the displacement (strain) fields inside sand piles have not been
   measured in experiments on sand piles. Averaging is made reproducible by
   introducing a representative volume element (RVE), the size of which we
   determine by careful measurements. Stress tensors are studied for both
   symmetric and asymmetric sand piles in two-dimensional systems, where
   the particles are dropped from a point source. Furthermore, we determine
   the fabric tensor inside the sand piles. A surprising finding is the
   behaviour of the contact density in this kind of heap, which increases
   where the pressure is at a minimum. The fabric is linearly proportional
   to the product of the volume fraction and the mean coordination number
   for a pile consisting of monodisperse mixture of particles. We observe
   that the macroscopic stress, strain and fabric tensors are not collinear
   in the sand piles. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics
   Observatory has state-of-the-art spatial resolution and shows the most
   detailed images of coronal loops ever observed. The series of coronal
   filters peak at different temperatures, which span the range of active
   regions. These features represent a significant improvement over earlier
   coronal imagers and make AIA ideal for multithermal analysis. Here, we
   targeted a 171 angstrom coronal loop in AR 11092 observed by AIA on 2010
   August 3. Isothermal analysis using the 171-to-193 ratio gave a
   temperature of log T approximate to 6.1, similar to the results of
   Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (EIT) and TRACE. Differential
   emission measure analysis, however, showed that the plasma was
   multithermal, not isothermal, with the bulk of the emission measure at
   log T > 6.1. The result from the isothermal analysis, which is the
   average of the true plasma distribution weighted by the instrument
   response functions, appears to be deceptively low. These results have
   potentially serious implications: EIT and TRACE results, which use the
   same isothermal method, show substantially smaller temperature gradients
   than predicted by standard models for loops in hydrodynamic equilibrium
   and have been used as strong evidence in support of footpoint heating
   models. These implications may have to be re-examined in the wake of new
   results from AIA.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{5132-5139}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This randomized study compared denosumab, a fully human monoclonal
   antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK)
   ligand, with zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing skeletal-related
   events (SREs) in patients with breast cancer with bone metastases.
   Patients and Methods
   Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous denosumab
   120 mg and intravenous placebo (n = 1,026) or intravenous zoledronic
   acid 4 mg adjusted for creatinine clearance and subcutaneous placebo (n
   = 1,020) every 4 weeks. All patients were strongly recommended to take
   daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. The primary end point was time
   to first on-study SRE (defined as pathologic fracture, radiation or
   surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression).
   Results
   Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying time to first
   on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; P = .01
   superiority) and time to first and subsequent (multiple) on-study SREs
   (rate ratio, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 0.89; P = .001). Reduction in bone
   turnover markers was greater with denosumab. Overall survival, disease
   progression, and rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were
   similar between groups. An excess of renal AEs and acute-phase reactions
   occurred with zoledronic acid; hypocalcemia occurred more frequently
   with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (2.0\%,
   denosumab; 1.4\%, zoledronic acid; P = .39).
   Conclusion
   Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing SREs
   in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone and was generally well
   tolerated. With the convenience of a subcutaneous injection and no
   requirement for renal monitoring, denosumab represents a potential
   treatment option for patients with bone metastases.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this work is to prepare and characterize the
   novel in situ forming implants, obtained through self-assembling of
   N-stearoyl-L-alanine methyl ester (SAM) in pharmaceutical oils, and to
   evaluate the biodegradability and biocompatibility of this organogel
   system. Methods: Minimum gelation concentration was used to measure the
   gelling ability of gelator SAM in different oils to select the optimal
   oil for further research. Phase transition temperatures of SAM/soybean
   oil organogels were determined by differential scanning calorimetry.
   Comparative studies on the in vitro degradation and in vivo degradation
   of SAM/soybean oil organogels in mice were investigated. Cytotoxicity
   tests and histological analysis of SAM/soybean oil organogels were
   studied by using mouse fibrosarcoma cells and mouse, respectively.
   Results: As an organogelator, SAM could gel a variety of oils at
   different minimum gelation concentration. Among them, it had the
   best-gelling ability in soybean oil, and the SAM/soybean oil organogel
   could be turned into gels abruptly at body temperature when the
   concentration of SAM was higher than 5\% (w/v) to be used as an
   injectable system. The in vitro degradation rate of organogel was
   inversely proportional to the organogelator concentration, whereas the
   degradation rate in vivo was much higher than in vitro, and gels were
   almost disappeared after 6 weeks. The selected formulation showed
   excellent biocompatibility as tested by in vitro cytotoxicity and in
   vivo histological evaluation. Conclusion: SAM/soybean oil organogel has
   excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility, which indicates that it
   has a great potential for safe in situ forming drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Vaccination plays a significant role in the control of bovine viral
   diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection and spread. Recent studies revealed that
   type 1b is the predominant BVDV type 1 subgenotype, representing more
   than 75\% of field isolates of BVDV-1. However, nearly all current,
   commercially available BVDV type 1 vaccines contain BVDV-1a strains.
   Previous studies have indicated that anti-BVDV sera, induced by BVDV-1a
   viruses, show less neutralization activity to BVDV-1b isolates than type
   1a. Therefore, it is critically important to evaluate BVDV-1a vaccines
   in their ability to prevent BVDV-1b infection in calves. In current
   studies, calves were vaccinated subcutaneously, intradermally or
   intranasally with a single dose of a multivalent, modified-live viral
   vaccine containing a BVDV-1a strain, and were challenged with differing
   BVDV-1b strains to determine the efficacy and duration of immunity of
   the vaccine against these heterologous virus strains. Vaccinated calves,
   in all administration routes, were protected from respiratory disease
   caused by the BVDV-1b viruses, as indicated by significantly fewer
   clinical signs, lower rectal temperatures, reduced viral shedding and
   greater white blood cell counts than non-vaccinated control animals. The

Abstract = {{We have reexamined the fluorescence polarization anisotropy of single
   polymer chains of the prototypical conjugated polymer
   poly{[}2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV)
   isolated in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix employing improved
   synthetic samples that contain a much smaller number of tetrahedral
   chemical defects per chain. The new measurements reveal a much larger
   fraction of highly anisotropic MEH-PPV chains, with >70\% of the chains
   exhibiting polarization anisotropy values falling in the range of
   0.6-0.9. High anisotropy is strong evidence for a rod-shaped
   conformation. A comparison of the experimental results with coarse
   grain, beads on a chain simulations reveals that simulations with the
   usual bead bead pairwise additive potentials cannot reproduce the
   observed large fraction of high polarization values. Apparently, this
   type of potential lacks some yet to be identified molecular feature that
   is necessary to accurately simulate the experimental results.}},

Title = {{Single-day dayside density enhancements over Europe: A survey of a
   half-century of ionosonde data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{With the National Geophysical Data Center's Space Physics Interactive
   Data Resource (SPIDR), we have collected ionosonde data from stations
   around the world from 1958 to 2006. The database consists of F-layer
   peak frequency values (f(o)F(2)) at hourly intervals (when data are
   available). We limit our study to midlatitude dayside density peak
   enhancements; we find that when such features appear, they are usually
   confined in longitude, being not wider than about 60-90 degrees, or 4-6
   hours of local time. In this paper, we look only at enhancements over
   Europe, as data coverage is superior there. We define a ``single-day
   enhancement{''} and search the European sector of the database for such
   occurrences, finding 890 events during the 49-year period. The frequency
   of occurrence of these events is seen to be anticorrelated with the
   solar activity cycle. There is also a seasonal distribution, with more
   events during the equinox months and the fewest during winter. We
   examine the geomagnetic activity levels on the days of the enhancements
   and find that a majority of the events are associated with small or
   moderate geomagnetic disturbances. Most of these disturbances are not
   large enough to be called ``storms{''}; in many cases, there is a D-st
   drop of just 20-40 units or a K-p increase to a level of 3 or 4. These
   disturbances are not intense enough to cause a storm negative phase, but
   in many cases they are sufficient to bring about a dayside ionospheric
   density enhancement of 50\% or more.}},

Title = {{Towards a Global Barcode Library for Lymantria (Lepidoptera:
   Lymantriinae) Tussock Moths of Biosecurity Concern}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Detecting and controlling the movements of invasive species,
   such as insect pests, relies upon rapid and accurate species
   identification in order to initiate containment procedures by the
   appropriate authorities. Many species in the tussock moth genus
   Lymantria are significant forestry pests, including the gypsy moth
   Lymantria dispar L., and consequently have been a focus for the
   development of molecular diagnostic tools to assist in identifying
   species and source populations. In this study we expand the taxonomic
   and geographic coverage of the DNA barcode reference library, and
   further test the utility of this diagnostic method, both for
   species/subspecies assignment and for determination of geographic
   provenance of populations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcodes were
   obtained from 518 individuals and 36 species of Lymantria, including
   sequences assembled and generated from previous studies, vouchered
   material in public collections, and intercepted specimens obtained from
   surveillance programs in Canada. A maximum likelihood tree was
   constructed, revealing high bootstrap support for 90\% of species
   clusters. Bayesian species assignment was also tested, and resulted in
   correct assignment to species and subspecies in all instances. The
   performance of barcoding was also compared against the commonly employed
   NB restriction digest system (also based on COI); while the latter is
   informative for discriminating gypsy moth subspecies, COI barcode
   sequences provide greater resolution and generality by encompassing a
   greater number of haplotypes across all Lymantria species, none shared
   between species.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates the efficacy of DNA
   barcodes for diagnosing species of Lymantria and reinforces the view
   that the approach is an under-utilized resource with substantial
   potential for biosecurity and surveillance. Biomonitoring agencies
   currently employing the NB restriction digest system would gather more
   information by transitioning to the use of DNA barcoding, a change which
   could be made relatively seamlessly as the same gene region underlies
   both protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Functional RNA molecules are conformationally dynamic and sample a
   multitude of dynamic modes over a wide range of frequencies Thus, a
   comprehensive description of RNA dynamics requires the inclusion of a

   description of local motions in RNA that occur in the nanosecond to
   microsecond window and are detected by solid-state NMR with nonrigid
   rotational motion of the HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR)
   RNA in solution as observed by solution NMR This theoretical model
   unifies the experimental results generated by solution and solid-state
   NMR and provides a comprehensive view of the dynamics of HIV-1 TAR RNA,
   a well-known paradigm of an RNA where function requires extensive
   conformational rearrangements This methodology provides a quantitative
   atomic level view of the amplitudes and rates of the local and

Title = {{Active tectonics of the east Alborz mountains, NE Iran: Rupture of the

   earthquake}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{The 856 A.D. Qumis earthquake (M7.9) is the most destructive earthquake
   to have occurred in Iran, killing more than 200,000 people and
   destroying the cities of Damghan and the old Parthian capital of Shahr-i
   Qumis (Hecatompylos). This study combines evidence of historical
   seismicity with observations of the geomorphology and paleoseismology to
   provide the first detailed description of active faulting in the Damghan
   region of the east Alborz mountains, Iran. Regional left-lateral shear
   is accommodated on the Astaneh, Damghan, and North Damghan faults.
   Quaternary alluvial fans have been displaced along the Astaneh fault,
   with 15-20 m stream offsets recording the cumulative displacement over
   the last two to five earthquakes. A paleoseismology study from a single
   trench along a 5-10 km segment of the Astaneh fault reveals a rupture
   prior to 1300 A.D. and significantly later than 600 B.C. Despite the
   limitations of a single trench in documenting the spatial and temporal
   evolution of the fault over the late Quaternary, we are nevertheless
   able to bracket the last event to a time period consistent with the 856
   A.D. earthquake. Two older earthquakes were also identified during the
   Holocene occurring between 600 B.C. and 4600 B.C. and between 4600 B.C.
   and 9600 B.C. The location of our trench within a bend on the Astaneh
   fault, which could act as a barrier to rupture propagation, means the
   three earthquakes recovered from our trench over the Holocene may
   represent a minimum. Further trenching will reveal how the Astaneh fault
   ruptures over repeated earthquakes and, consequently, the magnitude and
   extent of slip during the 856 A.D. earthquake.}},

   investigated using hypomorphic mutant mice for individual NRG1 splice
   variants.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To assess the behavioral impact of hyper
   NRG1 signaling, we generated and analyzed two independent mouse
   transgenic (Tg) lines carrying the transgene of green fluorescent
   protein (GFP)-tagged type-1 NRG1 cDNA. The promoter of elongation-factor
   1 alpha gene drove ubiquitous expression of GFP-tagged NRG1 in the whole
   brain. As compared to control littermates, both heterozygous NRG1-Tg
   lines showed increased locomotor activity, a nonsignificant trend toward
   decreasing prepulse inhibition, and decreased context-dependent fear
   learning but exhibited normal levels of tone-dependent learning. In
   addition, social interaction scores in both Tg lines were reduced in an
   isolation-induced resident-intruder test. There were also phenotypic
   increases in a GABAergic marker (parvalbumin) as well as in myelination
   markers (myelin basic protein and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide
   3'-phosphodiesterase) in their frontal cortex, indicating the
   authenticity of NRG1 hyper-signaling, although there were marked
   decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase levels and dopamine content in the
   hippocampus.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that aberrant hyper-signals of NRG1
   also disrupt various cognitive and behavioral processes. Thus,
   neuropathological implication of hyper NRG1 signaling in psychiatric
   diseases should be evaluated with further experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{The structures of monolayers on Si(100) made up of two acetyl-protected
   triol ligands, derived from 2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol, namely,
   R-C(CH2OAc)(3) with R = CH2=CH-(CH2)(9)-O-CH2- and R = CH2=CH-(CH2)(7)-,
   have been investigated. After deprotection, the two ligands are
   well-suited receptors for anchoring molecular functionalities, such as
   Fe-4 single molecule magnets, to the Si surface through OH groups.
   Monolayers were obtained by the hydrosilylation reactions between
   H-terminated Si(100) and the CH2=CH- end groups and were prepared in
   pure form or diluted with inert 1-alkenes to achieve an accurate control
   over the concentration and concerted orientation of the receptors on the
   surface. Subsequent anchoring of a Fe-4 cluster, especially designed for
   a vertical atom sequence, has been expedient to clarify the influence of
   ligand mole fraction on the ordering of molecular receptors. We have
   achieved insight into the related structures and morphologies by
   combining angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AR-XPS),
   FTIR-attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectroscopy, and atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), including force lithography experiments. There is
   evidence that steric hindrances of apical groups are crucial for surface
   concentrations and, in turn, for geometrical orientation of the
   tethering units. Aging effects on monolayer structures and possible
   recovery processes have also been evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Alarm management efforts have recently intensified, and many tools based
   on the guidelines in EEMUA 191 have been used to analyze alarm system
   performance at chemical sites. However, attempts to improve alarm

   analogues exhibits significantly improved NF-kappa B inhibition activity
   over the parent compound curcumin, at least in part by inhibiting I
   kappa B phosphorylation and degradation via IKK blockage; selected
   4-arylidene curcumin analogues also reduced the tumorigenic potential of

Abstract = {{In a pandemic setting, surveillance is essential to monitor the spread
   of the disease and assess its impact. Appropriate mitigation and
   healthcare preparedness strategies depend on fast and accurate epidemic
   surveillance data. During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, rapid
   improvements in influenza surveillance were made in Iceland. Here, we
   describe the improvements made in influenza surveillance during the
   pandemic, which could also be of great value in outbreaks caused by
   other pathogens. Following the raised level of pandemic influenza alert
   in April 2009, influenza surveillance was intensified. A comprehensive
   automatic surveillance system for influenza-like illness was developed,
   surveillance of influenza-related deaths was established and laboratory
   surveillance for influenza was strengthened. School absenteeism reports
   were also collected and compared with results from the automatic
   surveillance system. The first case of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
   was diagnosed in Iceland in May 2009, but sustained community
   transmission was not confirmed until mid-August. The pandemic virus
   circulated during the summer and early autumn before an abrupt increase
   in the number of cases was observed in October. There were large
   outbreaks in elementary schools for children aged 6-15 years throughout
   the country that peaked in late October. School absenteeism reports from
   all elementary schools in Iceland gave a similar epidemiological curve
   as that from data from the healthcare system. Estimates of the
   proportion of the population infected with the pandemic virus ranged
   from 10\% to 22\%. This study shows how the sudden need for improved
   surveillance in the pandemic led to rapid improvements in data
   collection in Iceland. This reporting system will be improved upon and
   expanded to include other notifiable diseases, to ensure accurate and
   timely collection of epidemiological data.}},

Title = {{Serum adiponectin is positively associated with lung function in young
   adults, independent of obesity: The CARDIA study}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: Adipose tissue produces adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory
   protein. Adiponectin deficiency in mice is associated with abnormal
   post-natal alveolar development.
   Objective: We hypothesized that lower serum adiponectin concentrations
   are associated with lower lung function in humans, independent of
   obesity. We explored mediation of this association by insulin resistance
   and systemic inflammation.
   Methods and Measurements: Spirometry testing was conducted at years 10
   and 20 follow-up evaluation visits in 2,056 eligible young adult
   participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
   (CARDIA) study. Body mass index, serum adiponectin, serum C-reactive
   protein (a marker of systemic inflammation), and insulin resistance were
   assessed at year 15.
   Main Results: After controlling for body mass index, years 10 and 20
   forced vital capacity (FVC) were 81 ml and 82 ml lower respectively (p =
   0.004 and 0.01 respectively) in the lowest vs. highest adiponectin
   quartiles. Similarly, years 10 and 20 forced expiratory volume in one
   second (FEV1) were 50 ml and 38 ml lower (p = 0.01 and 0.09,
   respectively) in the lowest vs. highest adiponectin quartiles. These
   associations were no longer significant after adjustment for insulin
   resistance and C-reactive protein. Serum adiponectin was not associated
   with FEV1/FVC or peak FEV1.
   Conclusions: Independent of obesity, lower serum adiponectin
   concentrations are associated with lower lung function. The attenuation
   of this association after adjustment for insulin resistance and systemic
   inflammation suggests that these covariates are on a causal pathway
   linking adiponectin and lung function.}},

Abstract = {{Two species superfluid Fermi gas is investigated on the BCS side up to
   the Feshbach resonance. Using the Greens's function technique gradient
   corrections are calculated to the generalized Thomas-Fermi theory

   measured by the small parameter (d/R-TF)(4), where d is the oscillator
   length of the trap potential and R-TF is the radial extension of the
   density n in the Thomas-Fermi approximation. In particular, at the
   Feshbach resonance the universal corrections to the local density
   approximation are calculated and a universal prefactor kappa(W) = 7/27
   is derived for the von Weizsacker-type correction
   kappa(W)(h(2)/2m)(del(2)n(1/2)/n(1/2)).}},

Title = {{Association of Serial Measures of Cardiac Troponin T Using a Sensitive
   Assay With Incident Heart Failure and Cardiovascular Mortality in Older
   Adults}},

Abstract = {{Context Older adults comprise the majority of new-onset heart failure
   (HF) diagnoses, but traditional risk-factor prediction models have
   limited accuracy in this population to identify those at highest risk
   for hospitalization or death.
   Objectives To determine if cardiac troponin T (cTnT) measured by a
   highly sensitive assay would be detectable in the majority of
   community-dwelling older adults, and if serial measures were associated
   with risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A longitudinal nationwide cohort study
   (Cardiovascular Health Study) of 4221 community-dwelling adults aged 65
   years or older without prior HF who had cTnT measured using a highly
   sensitive assay at baseline (1989-1990) and repeated after 2 to 3 years
   (n=2918).
   Main Outcome Measures New-onset HF and cardiovascular death were
   examined through June 2008 with respect to cTnT concentrations,
   accounting for clinical risk predictors.
   Results Cardiac troponin T was detectable (>= 3.00 pg/mL) in 2794
   participants (66.2\%). During a median follow-up of 11.8 years, 1279
   participants experienced new-onset HF and 1103 cardiovascular deaths
   occurred, with a greater risk of both end points associated with higher
   cTnT concentrations. Among those participants with the highest cTnT
   concentrations (>12.94 pg/mL), there was an incidence rate per 100
   person-years of 6.4 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 5.8-7.2; adjusted
   hazard ratio {[}aHR], 2.48; 95\% CI, 2.04-3.00) for HF and an incidence
   rate of 4.8 (95\% CI, 4.3-5.4; aHR, 2.91; 95\% CI, 2.37-3.58) for
   cardiovascular death compared with participants with undetectable cTnT
   levels (incidence rate, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.4-1.8 and 1.1; 95\% CI, 0.9-1.2
   for HF and cardiovascular death, respectively). Among individuals with
   initially detectable cTnT, a subsequent increase of more than 50\%
   (n=393, 22\%) was associated with a greater risk for HF (aHR, 1.61; 95\%
   CI, 1.32-1.97) and cardiovascular death (aHR, 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.35-2.03)
   and a decrease of more than 50\% (n=247, 14\%) was associated with a
   lower risk for HF (aHR, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.54-0.97) and cardiovascular
   death (aHR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.52-0.97) compared with participants with
   50\% or less change. Addition of baseline cTnT measurements to clinical
   risk factors was associated with only modest improvement in
   discrimination, with change in C statistic of 0.015 for HF and 0.013 for
   cardiovascular death.
   Conclusion In this cohort of older adults without known HF, baseline
   cTnT levels and changes in cTnT levels measured with a highly sensitive
   assay were significantly associated with incident HF and cardiovascular
   death. JAMA. 2010;304(22):2494-2502 www.jama.com}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Experiments designed to measure neutrino oscillations also provide major
   opportunities for discovering very weakly-coupled states. In order to
   produce neutrinos, experiments such as Liquid Scintillator Neutrino
   Detector collide thousands of Coulombs of protons into fixed targets,
   while MINOS and MiniBooNE also focus and then dump beams of muons. The
   neutrino detectors beyond these beam dumps are therefore an excellent
   arena in which to look for long-lived pseudoscalars or for vector bosons
   that kinetically mix with the photon. We show that these experiments
   have significant sensitivity beyond previous beam dumps and are able to
   partially close the gap between laboratory experiments and supernovae
   constraints on pseudoscalars. Future upgrades to the NuMI beamline and
   Project X will lead to even greater opportunities for discovery. We also
   discuss thin target experiments with muon beams, such as those available
   in COMPASS, and show that they constitute a powerful probe for
   leptophilic pseudo-Nambu-Goldstones.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which nanoscale-engineered systems cross intact human skin
   and can exert pharmacological effects in viable epidermis is
   controversial. This research seeks to develop a new lipid-based nanosome
   that enables the effective delivery of siRNA into human skin. The major
   finding is that an ultraflexible siRNA-containing nanosome-prepared
   using DOTAP, cholesterol, sodium cholate, and 30\% ethanol-penetrates
   into the epidermis of freshly excised intact human skin and is able to
   enter into the keratinocytes. The nanosomes, called
   surfactant-ethanol-cholesterol-osomes (SECosomes), show excellent size,
   surface charge, morphology, deformability, transfection efficiency,
   stability, and skin penetration capacity after complexation with siRNA.
   Importantly, these nanosomes have ideal characteristics for siRNA
   encapsulation, in that the siRNA is stable for at least 4 weeks, they
   enable highly efficient transfection of in vitro cultured cells, and are
   shown to transport siRNA delivery through intact human skin where
   changes in the keratinocyte cell state are demonstrated. It is concluded
   that increasing flexibility in nanosomes greatly enhances their ability
   to cross the intact human epidermal membrane and to unload their payload
   into targeted epidermal cells.}},

Abstract = {{A control framework was developed for real-time implementation of
   optimal control of emulsion polymerization with multiple monomers by
   integrating model-based algorithms with software engines. The developed
   system was applied for controlling conversion, particle size, molar
   mass, and polymer composition using model predictive control (MPC) based
   on mechanistic models for emulsion polymerization. The control
   formulation was extended to account for existing process constraints on
   the input, input moves, and solids content. On experimental testing, the
   developed control scheme was found to achieve the desired objectives
   without violating the process constraints and showed good robustness in
   rejecting disturbances. Improvements in the process operation and
   polymer property control were noted on implementing the developed
   multi-variable MPC for molar mass and product composition. The system
   facilitated efficient control of fundamental polymer attributes with
   semi-batch operation.}},

   Transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) has the potential
   to Improve these functions through a number of mechanisms which include
   facilitation of regeneration and neuroprotection For cardiovascular
   functions we have previously shown that OECs reduce the duration of
   autonomic dysreflexi i without evidence of regeneration To further
   understand the mechanisms underpinning this improvement we have studied
   changes in selected morphological features (cavitation non-cavity tissue
   loss morphology of sympathetic preganglionic neurons and primary
   afferent fibre density) in the T4-transected rat spinal cord over 9
   weeks both in control and OEC-transplanted animals 14 transection led to
   a number of structural changes gradual formation of cavities non-cavity
   tissue los a long term increase in soma size of sympathetic
   preganglionic neurons and a temporary Increase in I he extent of their
   dendritic bouts and an Increase in the density of primary afferent
   fibres caudal to the lesion OECs decreased the cavitation and normalised
   soma size of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons below the lesion
   while increasing the extent of dendritic arbours in the preganglionic
   neurons above the lesion Thus the OECs may contribute to the
   normalisation of the dysreflexic hypertension through tissue
   preservation and normalisation of the morphology of the preganglionic
   neurons caudal to the lesion while enhancing the input on the rostra!

Abstract = {{The high reset current I(R) in unipolar resistance switching is a major
   obstacle to practical applications in memory devices. In particular, the
   first I(R) value after the forming process is so high that the
   capacitors sometimes do not exhibit reliable unipolar resistance
   switching. We find that the compliance current I(comp) is a critical
   parameter for reducing I(R) values in polycrystalline Pt/NiO(w)/Pt,
   Pt/SrTiO(x) /Pt, Ti/SrTiO(x)/Pt, Pt/TiO(y)/Pt and Pt/FeO(z)/Pt
   capacitors, which show unipolar resistance switching. We therefore
   introduce an improved, simple and easy-to-use I(comp) limiter that
   stabilizes the forming process by drastically decreasing the current
   overflow so as to precisely control the I(comp) and subsequent I(R)

Abstract = {{(S)-styrene oxide, a useful chiral intermediate, has been synthesized
   using an electroenzymatic method with direct electrochemical FADH(2)
   regeneration. Low electroenzymatic efficiency arising from the fast
   FADH(2) reoxidation could be overcome by employing a zinc oxide/carbon
   black composite electrode. The attractive interaction between zinc oxide
   and styrene monooxygenase kept the local enzyme concentration high near
   the electrode surface, thereby increasing the accessibility of FADH2
   from the electrode surface to the enzyme. By adjusting the reaction
   conditions such as oxygen solubility, a high electroenzymatic efficiency
   of 65\% was obtained. As a result, the reaction rate was increased while
   the amount of the side-products from the cofactor reoxidation process
   was decreased. The metal oxide/carbon black composite electrode can be
   efficiently used for electroenzymatic syntheses using diffusible-flavin
   dependent monooxygenases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Neutral Atom Detector Unit (NUADU) aboard the TC-2 spacecraft
   recorded energetic neutral atom (ENA) image data for >3 h during part of
   the main and recovery phases of a major magnetic storm on 15 May 2005. A
   custom designed, constrained linear inversion method was applied to
   retrieve ring current ion distributions in the ENA records out to L =
   6.6. Comparisons were then made between the ion fluxes retrieved from
   these ENA data (energy ranges 50-81 keV and 81-158 keV) and
   complementary, contemporaneous particle fluxes measured in situ by
   Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer (SOPA) instruments aboard a series
   of geosynchronous satellites that were launched to encircle the
   equatorial plane at L similar to 6.6 by the Los Alamos National
   Laboratory (LANL). The ENA data revealed the development of two emission
   peaks during the main phase of the storm which corresponded to the
   arrival from the magnetotail of a pair of particle injections. These
   injections reached, in each case, maximum value before the corresponding
   AL index amplitude peak was attained. The main phase of the storm
   concluded (Dst approximate to -256 nT) in the aftermath of this event
   pair, and the ring current ion fluxes thereafter gradually decayed over
   several hours (the storm recovery phase). This is the first time that
   the linear inversion method developed for NUADU data has been globally
   validated using multipoint in situ measurements made at different
   magnetic local times. It was found that the higher the derived flux
   values were on the duskside/nightside, the closer they were to the in
   situ measurements. The retrieved fluxes obtained on the
   duskside/nightside tended, however, to be still somewhat underestimated
   since the ENA measurements concerned were made around the outer edge of
   the ring current at an altitude where the magnetic field in the inner
   magnetosphere deviates from that dipole configuration assumed in the
   inversion procedure to pertain there. The two methods utilized to study
   ions during a large magnetic storm are complementary in that the
   retrieved ion fluxes provide high time resolution information concerning
   the changing, large-scale structure of ring current events, whereas in
   situ flux sampling presents ``measurement truth{''} at particular
   locations within individual ring currents.}},

Abstract = {{Dopaminergic neurons develop at distinct anatomical sites to form some
   of the major neuromodulatory systems in the vertebrate brain. Despite
   their relevance in neurodegenerative diseases and the interests in
   reconstitutive therapies from stem cells, mechanisms of the neurogenic
   switch from precursor populations to dopaminergic neurons are not well
   understood. Here, we investigated neurogenesis of different dopaminergic
   and noradrenergic neuron populations in the zebrafish embryo.
   Birth-dating analysis by EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) incorporation
   revealed temporal dynamics of catecholaminergic neurogenesis. Analysis
   of Notch signaling mutants and stage-specific pharmacological inhibition
   of Notch processing revealed that dopaminergic neurons form by
   temporally distinct mechanisms: dopaminergic neurons of the posterior
   tuberculum derive directly from neural plate cells during primary
   neurogenesis, whereas other dopaminergic groups form in continuous or
   wavelike neurogenesis phases from proliferating precursor pools.
   Systematic analysis of Notch ligands revealed that the two zebrafish
   co-orthologs of mammalian Delta1, DeltaA and DeltaD, control the
   neurogenic switch of all early developing dopaminergic neurons in a
   partially redundant manner. DeltaA/D may also be involved in maintenance
   of dopaminergic precursor pools, as olig2 expression in ventral
   diencephalic dopaminergic precursors is affected in dla/dld mutants.
   DeltaA/D act upstream of sim1a and otpa during dopaminergic
   specification. However, despite the fact that both dopaminergic and
   corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons derive from sim1a- and
   otpa-expressing precursors, DeltaA/D does not act as a lineage switch
   between these two neuronal types. Rather, DeltaA/D limits the size of
   the sim1a- and otpa-expressing precursor pool from which dopaminergic
   neurons differentiate.}},

Abstract = {{The energetic properties of the divacancy defect in fcc nickel are
   studied by ab initio calculations based on density functional theory.
   The formation and binding enthalpies of the divacancy in the first
   (1nn), second (2nn) and third (3nn) nearest-neighbor configurations are
   presented. Results show that the 1nn divacancy configuration is the most
   stable with a formation enthalpy H-2v(f) of 2.71 eV and a small binding
   energy H-2v(b) of 0.03 eV. In the 2nn configuration, the
   monovacancy-monovacancy interaction is repulsive, and it vanishes in the
   3nn configuration. The migration process of the divacancy in its stable
   configuration is studied. We find that the divacancy migrates in the
   (111) plane by successive rotational steps of 60 degrees. The
   corresponding migration enthalpy H-2v(m) is predicted to be 0.59 eV,
   about half of that found for the monovacancy. For a better comparison of
   our results with high temperature experimental data, we have analyzed
   the effects of thermal expansion. Our results show that the inclusion of
   thermal expansion allows us to reproduce satisfactorily the experimental
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Carbohydrates are generally considered to be poorly immunogenic.
   Therefore, new approaches for enhancing their immunogenicity are
   important for the development of carbohydrates as vaccine components. We
   hypothesized that conjugation of an L-rhamnose (Rha) moiety to a
   carbohydrate antigen would enhance the antigenicity of the antigen in
   mice possessing anti-Rha antibodies via an antibody-dependent antigen
   uptake mechanism. To explore this hypothesis, we synthesized a
   single-molecule three-component vaccine containing the GalNAc-O-Thr (Tn)
   tumor-specific antigen, a 20 amino acid helper T-cell epitope (YAF)
   derived from an outer-membrane protein of Neisseria meningitides, and a
   Rha moiety. The vaccine was synthesized by automated Fmoc-based
   solid-phase peptide synthesis and deacetylated by brief treatment with
   NaOMe. Groups of female BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted with
   Rha-ovalbumin (Rha-OVA) formulated with either TiterMax Gold or Sigma
   Adjuvant System for a period of 35 days in order to determine optimal
   conditions for generating anti-Rha titers in mice. Anti-Rha antibody
   titers were > 100 fold higher in groups of mice immunized with Rha-OVA
   than in the control groups. Mice producing anti-Rha were challenged with
   Rha-YAF-Tn or YAF-Tn. Sera collected from the groups initially immunized
   with Rha-OVA and later challenged with Rha-YAF-Tn showed a 2-fold
   increase in anti-Tn titer at 1/100 serum dilution relative to mice not
   immunized with Rha-OVA. An in vitro T-cell proliferation study using
   cells primed with either Rha-YAF-Tn or YAF-Tn was done to examine
   possible differences in antigen uptake and presentation due to anti-Rha
   antibody and chemical modification. Proliferation of T cells was
   stimulated by a 10-fold lower antigen concentration in the presence of
   Rha antibodies. The results strongly suggest that T cells present in the
   spleen were presented with higher concentrations of Rha-YAF-Tn as a
   result of the presence of the anti-Rha antibodies.}},

   proceeds in a highly asynchronous, concerted reaction to yield the
   tricyclic, tertiary carbocation with a 5-membered C ring. The fourth

   of the C ring in concert with the formation of the 5-membered ring.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an efficient method for nonperturbative calculation of
   Green's function in a correlated electron system. The key idea of the
   method is to project out irrelevant operators having zero norm in the
   ground state, which we refer to as effective projection theory. We apply
   the method to a mesoscopic Anderson model and show that for a given
   wavefunction ansatz, equations of motion can be closed only by relevant
   operators, allowing easy calculation of the zero-temperature Green's
   function. It turns out that the resulting Green's functions reproduce
   exact limits of both weak and strong interactions. The accuracy is also
   verified for small systems by comparison with exact diagonalization
   results, revealing that effective projection theory captures the
   essential correlated features in the entire regime of interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(2,5-Bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl) thieno{[}3,2-b] thiophenes (pBTTTs)
   are a new class of solution-processable polymer semiconductors with high
   charge carrier mobilities that rival amorphous silicon. This exceptional
   performance is thought to originate in the microstructure of pBTTT
   films, which exhibit high crystallinity and a surface topography of wide
   terraces. However, the true lateral grain size has not been determined,
   despite the critical impact grain boundaries can have on the charge
   transport of polymer semiconductors. Here a strategy for determining the
   lateral grain structure of pBTTT using dark-field transmission electron
   microscopy (DF-TEM) and subsequent image analysis is presented. For the
   first time, it is revealed that the in-plain pBTTT crystal orientation
   varies smoothly across a length scale significantly less than one
   micrometer (e. g., with only small angles between adjacent diffracting
   regions). The pBTTT polymers thus exhibit an in-plane liquid crystalline
   texture. This microstructure is different from what has been reported
   for small molecule semiconductors or polymer semiconductors such as poly
   (3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT). Even though films processed differently
   exhibit different apparent domain sizes, they exhibit similar charge
   carrier hopping activation energies because they possess similar low
   densities of abrupt grain boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{We report the observation of a colossal, narrow resistance peak that
   arises in ultraclean (mobility similar to 3 x 10(7) cm(2)/Vs)
   GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells (QWs) under millimeter wave irradiation and a
   weak magnetic field. Such a spike is superposed on the 2nd harmonic
   microwave-induced resistance oscillations (MIRO) but having an amplitude
   >300\% of the MIRO, and a typical FWHM similar to 50 mK, comparable with
   the Landau level width. Systematic studies show a correlation between
   the spike and a pronounced negative magnetoresistance in these QWs,
   suggesting a mechanism based on the interplay of strong scatterers and
   smooth disorder. Alternatively, the spike may be interpreted as a
   manifestation of quantum interference between the quadrupole resonance
   and the higher-order cyclotron transition in well-separated Landau
   levels.}},

Title = {{What doctors think about the impact of managed care tools on quality of
   care, costs, autonomy, and relations with patients}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: How doctors perceive managed care tools and incentives is
   not well known. We assessed doctors' opinions about the expected impact
   of eight managed care tools on quality of care, control of health care
   costs, professional autonomy and relations with patients.
   Methods: Mail survey of doctors (N = 1546) in Geneva, Switzerland.
   Respondents were asked to rate the impact of 8 managed care tools on 4
   aspects of care on a 5-level scale (1 very negative, 2 rather negative,
   3 neutral, 4 rather positive, 5 very positive). For each tool, we
   obtained a mean score from the 4 separate impacts.
   Results: Doctors had predominantly negative opinions of the impact of
   managed care tools: use of guidelines (mean score 3.18), gate-keeping
   (2.76), managed care networks (2.77), second opinion requirement (2.65),
   pay for performance (1.90), pay by salary (2.24), selective contracting
   (1.56), and pre-approval of expensive treatments (1.77). Estimated
   impacts on cost control were positive or neutral for most tools, but
   impacts on professional autonomy were predominantly negative. Primary
   care doctors held more positive opinions than doctors in other
   specialties, and psychiatrists were in general the most critical. Older
   doctors had more negative opinions, as well as those in private
   practice.
   Conclusions: Doctors perceived most managed care tools to have a
   positive impact on the control of health care costs but a negative
   impact on medical practice. Tools that are controlled by the profession
   were better accepted than those that are imposed by payers.}},

Title = {{Blood product ratio in acute traumatic coagulopathy - effect on
   mortality in a Scandinavian level 1 trauma centre}},
Journal = {{SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION \& EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Trauma is the leading cause of loss of life expectancy
   worldwide. In the most seriously injured patients, coagulopathy is often
   present on admission. Therefore, transfusion strategies to increase the
   ratio of plasma (FFP) and platelets (PLT) to red blood cells (RBC),
   simulating whole blood, have been introduced. Several studies report
   that higher ratios improve survival in massively bleeding patients.
   Here, the aim was to investigate the potential effect of increased FFP
   and PLT to RBC on mortality in trauma patients.
   Methods: In a retrospective before and after study, all trauma patients
   primarily admitted to a level-one Trauma Centre, receiving blood
   transfusion, in 2001-3 (n = 97) and 2005-7 (n = 156), were included. In
   2001-3, FFP and PLT were administered in accordance with the American
   Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines whereas in 2005-7,
   Hemostatic Control Resuscitation (HCR) entailing pre-emptive use of FFP
   and PLT in transfusion packages during uncontrolled haemorrhage and
   thereafter guided by thrombelastograph (TEG) analysis was employed. The
   effect of transfusion therapy and coagulopathy on mortality was
   investigated.
   Results: Patients included in the early and late period had comparable
   demography, injury severity score (ISS), admission hematology and
   coagulopathy (27\% vs. 34\% had APTT above normal). There was a
   significant change in blood transfusion practice with shorter time
   interval from admission to first transfusion (median time 3 min vs. 28
   min in massive bleeders, p < 0.001), transfusion of higher ratios of
   FFP:RBC, PLT:RBC and PLT:FFP in the HCR group but 30-day mortality
   remained comparable in the two periods. In the 2005-7 period, higher
   age, ISS and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) above normal
   were independent predictors of mortality whereas no association was fund
   between blood product ratios and mortality.
   Conclusion: Aggressive administration of FFP and PLT did not influence
   mortality in the present trauma population.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical calculations have shown that proton therapy can reduce the
   incidence of radiation-induced secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN)
   compared with photon therapy for patients with prostate cancer. However,
   the uncertainties associated with calculations of SMN risk had not been
   assessed. The objective of this study was to quantify the uncertainties
   in projected risks of secondary cancer following contemporary proton and
   photon radiotherapies for prostate cancer. We performed a rigorous
   propagation of errors and several sensitivity tests to estimate the
   uncertainty in the ratio of relative risk (RRR) due to the largest
   contributors to the uncertainty: the radiation weighting factor for
   neutrons, the dose-response model for radiation carcinogenesis and
   interpatient variations in absorbed dose. The interval of values for the
   radiation weighting factor for neutrons and the dose-response model were
   derived from the literature, while interpatient variations in absorbed
   dose were taken from actual patient data. The influence of each
   parameter on a baseline RRR value was quantified. Our analysis revealed
   that the calculated RRR was insensitive to the largest contributors to
   the uncertainty. Uncertainties in the radiation weighting factor for
   neutrons, the shape of the dose-risk model and interpatient variations
   in therapeutic and stray doses introduced a total uncertainty of 33\% to
   the baseline RRR calculation.}},

Abstract = {{A three-stage support vector machine (SVM) was constructed to predict
   the state of cysteines by fusing sequence information, evolution
   information and annotation information of protein sequences. The first
   and second stages were for predicting whether the protein sequences
   contain disulfide bonds and whether all of the cysteines are involved in
   disulfide bonds. In the last stage, one SVM was constructed for
   predicting which cysteines are involved in disulfide bonds, among all
   these cysteines in proteins. The three SVMs give a good performance and
   the overall prediction accuracy are 90.05\%, 96.36\% and 80.00\%,
   respectively, which indicates that the features selected in this work
   are effective for predicting the state of cysteines. In addition,
   current methods only paid too much attention to the prediction
   performance and never showed us how much important the roles of these
   features played in the prediction. As a result a feature importance
   measurement designated as F-score function was used to evaluate these
   features. The result shows that among these protein descriptors;
   evolution information is the most important feature for representing the
   disulfide-containing proteins. The prediction software and data sets

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulation results predicting the state of dispersion
   (single, dimer, trimer, and so on) of coatedsuperparamagnetic iron oxide
   (Fe3O4) nanoparticles in an aqueous medium are compared with our
   experimental data for the same. Measured values of the volume percentage
   of particles in the dispersion, core particle diameter, coating-shell
   thickness, grafting density of the coating agent, saturation
   magnetization, and zeta potential for the citric acid-coated and
   poly(acrylic acid) {[}PAA]-coated particles have been used in our
   simulation. The simulation was performed by calculating the total
   interaction potential between two nanoparticles as a function of their
   interparticle distance and applying a criterion for the two particles to
   aggregate, with the criterion being that the minimum depth of the
   secondary minima in the total interaction potential must be at least
   equal to k(B)T. Simulation results successfully predicted both
   experimental trends(-)aggregates for citric acid-coated particles and an
   individual isolated state for PAA-coated particles. We have also
   investigated how this state changes for both kind of coating agents by
   varying the particle volume percentage from 0.01 to 25\%, the particle
   diameter from 2 to 19 nm, the shell thickness from 1 to 14 nm, and
   grafting density from 10(15) to 10(22) molecules/m(2). We find that the
   use of a lower shell thickness and a higher particle volume percentage
   leads to the formation of larger aggregates. The possible range of
   values of these four variables, which can be used experimentally to
   prepare a stable aqueous dispersion of isolated particles, is
   recommended on the basis of predictions from our simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Animals that deploy chemical defences against predators often signal
   their unprofitability using bright colouration. This pairing of toxicity
   and conspicuous patterning is known as aposematism.
   Explaining the evolution and spread of aposematic traits in previously
   cryptic species has been the focus of much empirical and theoretical
   work over the last two decades. Existing research concerning the initial
   evolution of aposematism does not however properly consider that many
   aposematic species (such as members of the hymenoptera, the lepidoptera,
   and amphibia) are highly mobile. We argue in this paper that the
   evolution of aposematic displays is therefore often best understood
   within a metapopulation framework; hence in this paper we present the
   first explicit metapopulation model of the evolution of aposematism. Our
   most general finding is that migration tends to reduce the probability
   that an aposematic prey can increase from rarity and spread across a
   large population. Hence, the best case scenarios for the spread of
   aposematism required fixation of the aposematic form in one or more
   isolated sub-habitats prior to some event which subsequently enabled
   migration. We observed that changes in frequency of new aposematic forms
   within source habitats are likely to be nonmonotonic. First, aposematic
   prey tend to decline in frequency as they migrate outwards from the
   source habitat to neighbouring sink habitats, but subsequently they
   increase in relative abundance in the source, as the descendents of
   earlier migrants migrate back from newly converted sub-populations. This
   pattern of initial loss and subsequent gain between new source and
   neighbouring sink habitats is then repeated as the aposematic form
   spreads via a moving cline. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantifying the interaction structure and the topological importance of
   species in food webs: A signed digraph approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},

Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Due to the structural complexity of nature, it is not always easy to
   identify topologically importance species in an ecosystem. In the past
   decade, several studies in ecology have developed methods for measuring
   species importance basing on direct and indirect inter-specific
   interactions. Here, by extending a previously developed methodology, we
   present an approach that can quantify the interaction structure of a
   food web and consequently the topological importance of species when the
   food web is viewed as a signed digraph. The basic principle behind our
   approach is to determine the sign and strength of direct and indirect
   interactions for all pathways up to a predefined number of steps. Our
   approach mainly differs from the previous methodology in that we are
   able to quantify the strength of inter-specific interaction as well as
   in what way species interact with each other, as it can explicitly
   quantify a wide range of ecological interactions such as cascading
   effect, indirect food supply effect, apparent and exploitive
   competitions in the same framework. This then allows us to quantify the
   topological importance of a species and examine whether it is a
   predominately positive or negative interactor in a food web.
   Furthermore, our analysis reveals that positive and negative effects
   from one species on others eventually cancel each other out for longer
   pathways resulting in stable interaction structure. Applications of our
   methodology include providing a more informative index for conservation
   biologists, and the potential use of interaction structure derived from
   our approach in food web robustness studies is also discussed. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We use genome-wide nucleosome maps to study sequence specificity of
   intrinsic histone-DNA interactions. In contrast with previous
   approaches, we employ an analogy between a classical one-dimensional
   fluid of finite-size particles in an arbitrary external potential and
   arrays of DNA-bound histone octamers. We derive an analytical solution
   to infer free energies of nucleosome formation directly from nucleosome
   occupancies measured in high-throughput experiments. The
   sequence-specific part of free energies is then captured by fitting them
   to a sum of energies assigned to individual nucleotide motifs. We have
   developed hierarchical models of increasing complexity and spatial
   resolution, establishing that nucleosome occupancies can be explained by
   systematic differences in mono-and dinucleotide content between
   nucleosomal and linker DNA sequences, with periodic dinucleotide
   distributions and longer sequence motifs playing a minor role.
   Furthermore, similar sequence signatures are exhibited by control
   experiments in which nucleosome-free genomic DNA is either sonicated or
   digested with micrococcal nuclease, making it possible that current
   predictions based on high-throughput nucleosome-positioning maps are
   biased by experimental artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We previously reported that allanxanthone C and
   macluraxanthone, two xanthones purified from Guttiferae trees, display
   in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in leukemic cells
   from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and leukemia B cell lines.
   Results: Here, we investigated the in vivo therapeutic effects of the
   two xanthones in a xenograft murine model of human CLL, developed by
   engrafting CD5-transfected chronic leukemia B cells into SCID mice.
   Treatment of the animals with five daily injections of either
   allanxanthone C or macluraxanthone resulted in a significant
   prolongation of their survival as compared to control animals injected
   with the solvent alone (p = 0.0006 and p = 0.0141, respectively). The
   same treatment of mice which were not xenografted induced no mortality.
   Conclusion: These data show for the first time the in vivo antileukemic
   activities of two plant-derived xanthones, and confirm their potential
   interest for CLL therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Background-A characteristic of both clinical and experimental atrial
   fibrillation (AF) is atrial electric remodeling associated with profound
   reduction of L-type Ca2+ current and shortening of the action potential
   duration. The possibility that microRNAs (miRNAs) may be involved in
   this process has not been tested. Accordingly, we assessed the potential
   role of miRNAs in regulating experimental AF.
   Methods and Results-The miRNA transcriptome was analyzed by microarray
   and verified by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain
   reaction with left atrial samples from dogs with AF established by right
   atrial tachypacing for 8 weeks and from human atrial samples from AF
   patients with rheumatic heart disease. miR-223, miR-328, and miR-664
   were found to be upregulated by >2 fold, whereas miR-101, miR-320, and
   miR-499 were downregulated by at least 50\%. In particular, miR-328
   level was elevated by 3.9-fold in AF dogs and 3.5-fold in AF patients
   relative to non-AF subjects. Computational prediction identified CACNA1C
   and CACNB1, which encode cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel alpha 1c- and beta
   1 subunits, respectively, as potential targets for miR-328. Forced
   expression of miR-328 through adenovirus infection in canine atrium and
   transgenic approach in mice recapitulated the phenotypes of AF,
   exemplified by enhanced AF vulnerability, diminished L-type Ca2+
   current, and shortened atrial action potential duration. Normalization
   of miR-328 level with antagomiR reversed the conditions, and genetic
   knockdown of endogenous miR-328 dampened AF vulnerability. CACNA1C and
   CACNB1 as the cognate target genes for miR-328 were confirmed by Western
   blot and luciferase activity assay showing the reciprocal relationship
   between the levels of miR-328 and L-type Ca2+ channel protein subunits.
   Conclusions-miR-328 contributes to the adverse atrial electric
   remodeling in AF through targeting L-type Ca2+ channel genes. The study
   therefore uncovered a novel molecular mechanism for AF and indicated
   miR-328 as a potential therapeutic target for AF. (Circulation.

Abstract = {{Background-Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) naturally progresses
   toward chronic AF at an estimated rate of 15\% to 30\% over a 1- to
   3-year period. Pulmonary vein (PV) isolation is increasingly performed
   for the treatment of drug-refractory paroxysmal AF. The long-term data
   on clinical outcome after circumferential PV isolation are limited.
   Methods and Results-From 2003 to late 2004, 161 patients (121 men; age,
   59.8 +/- 9.7 years) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF and normal left
   ventricular function underwent circumferential PV isolation guided by
   3-dimensional mapping and double Lasso technique. Right-sided and
   left-sided continuous circular lesions encircling the ipsilateral PVs
   were placed with irrigated radiofrequency energy. The procedure end
   point was the absence of all PV spikes for at least 30 minutes after PV
   isolation verified by 2 Lasso catheters placed within the ipsilateral
   PVs. Sinus rhythm was present in 75 patients (46.6\%) after the initial
   procedure during a median follow-up period of 4.8 years (0.33 to 5.5
   years). A second procedure was performed in 66 and a third procedure in
   12 patients. Recovered PV isolation conduction was observed in 62 of 66
   patients (94.0\%) during the second and in 8 of 12 patients (66.7\%)
   during the third procedure. After a median of 1 (1 to 3) procedure,
   stable sinus rhythm was achieved in 128 of 161 patients (79.5\%),
   whereas clinical improvement occurred in an additional 21 of 161
   patients (13.0\%) during a median follow-up of 4.6 years (0.33 to 5.5
   years). Four patients in stable sinus rhythm died during follow-up.
   Progression toward chronic AF was observed in 4 patients (2.4\%);
   however, only 2 patients reported symptoms.
   Conclusion-In patients with paroxysmal AF and normal left ventricular
   function, circumferential PV isolation results in stable sinus rhythm in
   the majority of patients, and low incidence of chronic AF was observed
   after ablation during up to 5 years of follow-up. (Circulation.

Title = {{Absence of cortical demyelination in neuromyelitis optica}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To asses the presence of cortical demyelination in brains of
   patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO). NMO is an autoimmune
   inflammatory demyelinating disease that specifically targets
   aquaporin-4-rich regions of the CNS. Since aquaporin-4 is highly
   expressed in normal cortex, we anticipated that cortical demyelination
   may occur in NMO.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional neuropathologic study performed on
   archival forebrain and cerebellar tissue sections from 19 autopsied
   patients with a clinically and/or pathologically confirmed NMO spectrum
   disorder.
   Results: Detailed immunohistochemical analyses of 19 archival NMO cases
   revealed preservation of aquaporin-4 in a normal distribution within
   cerebral and cerebellar cortices, and no evidence of cortical
   demyelination.
   Conclusions: This study provides a plausible explanation for the absence
   of a secondary progressive clinical course in NMO and shows that
   cognitive and cortical neuroimaging abnormalities previously reported in
   NMO cannot be attributed to cortical demyelination. Lack of cortical
   demyelination is another characteristic that further distinguishes NMO
   from MS. Neurology (R) 2010;75:2103-2109}},

Abstract = {{We prepared silica-dye-nanocrystal hybrid particles and studied the
   energy transfer from semiconductor nanocrystals (= donor) to organic dye

   nanocrystals were adsorbed onto monodisperse Stober silica particles
   with an outer silica shell of thickness 2-23 nm containing organic dye
   molecules (Texas Red). The thickness of this dye layer has a strong
   effect on the energy transfer efficiency, which is explained by the
   increase in the number of dye molecules homogeneously distributed within
   the silica shell, in combination with an enhanced surface adsorption of
   nanocrystals with increasing dye amount. Our conclusions were underlined
   by comparison of the experimental results with numerically calculated
   FRET efficiencies and by control experiments confirming attractive
   interaction between the nanocrystals and Texas Red freely dissolved in

Abstract = {{The mammalian X and Y chromosomes share little homology and are largely
   unsynapsed during normal meiosis. This asynapsis triggers inactivation
   of X- and Y-linked genes, or meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI)
   {[}1]. Whether MSCI is essential for male meiosis is unclear. Pachytene
   arrest and apoptosis is observed in mouse mutants in which MSCI fails,
   e.g., Brca1(-/-), H3afx(-/-), Sycp1(-/-), and Msh5(-/-) {[}2, 3].
   However, these also harbor defects in synapsis and/or recombination and
   as such may activate a putative pachytene checkpoint {[}4]. Here we
   present evidence that MSCI failure is sufficient to cause pachytene
   arrest. XYY males exhibit Y-Y synapsis and Y chromosomal escape from
   MSCI without accompanying synapsis/recombination defects {[}5]. We find
   that XYY males, like synapsis/recombination mutants, display pachytene
   arrest and that this can be circumvented by preventing Y-Y synapsis and
   associated Y gene expression. Pachytene expression of individual Y genes
   inserted as transgenes on autosomes shows that expression of the Zfy1/2
   paralogs in XY males is sufficient to phenocopy the pachytene arrest
   phenotype; insertion of Zfy1/2 on the X chromosome where they are
   subject to MSCI prevents this response. Our findings show that MSCI is
   essential for male meiosis and, as such, provide insight into the
   differential severity of meiotic mutations' effects on male and female
   meiosis.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation pressure affects the kinetics of a system exposed to radiation
   and it constitutes the basis of laser cooling. In this article, we study
   matter-wave pressure through examining the dynamics of a
   quantum-classical hybrid system. The quantum and classical subsystems
   are affected mutually via a changing boundary condition. Two systems,
   that is, an atom and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), are considered as
   the quantum subsystems, while an oscillating wall is taken as the
   classical subsystem. We show that the classical subsystem would
   experience a force proportional to Q(-3) from the quantum atom, where Q
   denotes the distance between the two walls, whereas it acquires an
   additional force proportional to Q(-2) from the BEC due to the atom-atom
   interaction in the BEC. These forces can be understood as the
   matter-wave pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The laminar flow regime prevailing in pressure-driven flow through a
   Y-shaped microfluidic channel was utilized to create a stable boundary
   between two aqueous liquids. Transverse transport of ions between these
   two liquids gave rise to a diffusion potential, which was monitored by
   measurement of the open circuit potential. In this report, the influence
   on the cross-channel potential distribution of protonation reactions
   occurring in the boundary zone between the two co-flowing liquids is
   presented. The proton source was present in one of the co-flowing
   streams, and an uncharged proton acceptor was present in the other
   aqueous stream. The time-dependent transport equation for diffusion and
   migration was augmented by chemical reaction terms and was solved for
   all species present in both streams as a theoretical basis for the
   analysis. Within this model, the system was assumed to be homogeneous
   along the channel height, and effects of nonuniform velocity profiles
   were neglected. A reduction in potential by several millivolts was
   predicted for a protonation reaction occurring close to the boundary
   between the two aqueous streams, provided that the mobility of the
   protonated species was lower than the mobility of the co-cation in the
   background electrolyte (alkali metal cation in this case). The magnitude
   of the decrease in the potential was greater for protonated molecules
   with lower mobility or if the mobility of he background electrolyte
   cation was increased. Experimental results are presented for imidazole
   and D-histidine as proton acceptors present in 10 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, or
   10 mM CsCl solution and co-flowing with a stream of 10 mM hydrochloric
   acid, which served as the proton source. Decreases in measured
   potential, in line with the predicted diminished potential, were
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Patterned polymeric coatings enriched with colloidal TiO2 nanorods and
   prepared by photopolymerization are found to exhibit a remarkable
   increase in their water wettability when irradiated with UV laser light.
   The effect can be completely reversed using successive storage in vacuum
   and dark ambient environment. By exploiting the enhancement of the
   nanocomposites hydrophilicity upon UV irradiation, we prepare
   wettability gradients along the surfaces by irradiating adjacent surface
   areas with increasing time. The gradients are carefully designed to
   achieve directional movement of water drops along them, taking into
   account the hysteresis effect that opposes the movement as well as the
   change in the shape of the drop during its motion. The accomplishment of
   surface paths for liquid flow, along which the hydrophilicity gradually
   increases, opens the way to a vast number of potential applications in
   microfluidics.}},

Abstract = {{We say that a matrix is simple if it is a (0, 1)-matrix with no repeated
   columns. Given m and a k x l(0, 1)-matrix F, we seek the bound forb(m,
   F) on the maximum number of columns that a simple m-rowed matrix A can
   have if the simple matrix A has the property that it has no k x l
   submatrix which is a row and column permutation of F. Let K(k) denote
   the k x 2(k) (0, 1)-matrix of all columns in k rows. Sauer, Perles and
   Shelah, and Vapnik and Chervonenkis established that forb(m, K(k)) is
   Theta(m(k-1)). (An alternative description for the absence of a
   configuration K(k) is to say that the matrix has no shattered k-set.) We
   identify an easy but exact condition on a k-rowed simple matrix F for
   which forb(m, F) is O(m(k-2)). A consequence is a classification of the
   asymptotics of forb(m, F) for simple four-rowed matrices F. In addition
   we identify an easy but exact description for all k-rowed non-simple
   matrices F which contain K(k) and for which forb(m, F) is still
   O(m(k-1)). The results are further evidence for the conjecture of Anstee
   and Sali on the asymptotics of forb(m, F) for fixed F. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Magnetic properties of a sigma-Fe16Cr14 alloy calculated with the
   charge-and spin-self-consistent Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) and
   combined with coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA) methods are
   reported. Nonmagnetic state as well as various magnetic orderings were
   considered, i.e., ferromagnetic (FM) and more complex antiparallel
   (called APM) arrangements for selected sublattices, as follows from the
   symmetry analysis. It has been shown that the Stoner criterion applied
   to nonmagnetic density of states at the Fermi energy, E-F is satisfied
   for Fe atoms situated on all five lattice sites, while it is not
   fulfilled for all Cr atoms. In FM and APM states, the values of magnetic
   moments on Fe atoms occupying various sites are dispersed between 0 and
   2.5 mu(B), and they are proportional to the number of Fe atoms in the
   nearest-neighbor shell. Magnetic moments of Cr atoms having much smaller
   values were found to be coupled antiparallel to those of Fe atoms. The
   average value of the magnetic moment per atom was found to be <mu >=0.55
   mu(B) that is by a factor of 4 larger than the experimental value found
   for a sigma-Fe0.538Cr0.462 sample. Conversely, admitting an antiparallel
   ordering (APM model) on atoms situated on C and D sites, according to
   the group theory and symmetry analysis results, yielded a substantial
   reduction of <mu > to 0.20 mu(B). Further diminution of <mu > to 0.15
   mu(B), which is very close to the experimental value of 0.14 mu(B), has
   been achieved with the KKR-CPA calculations by considering a chemical

Abstract = {{An extensive series of 3:1 site-differentiated cubane-type clusters
   {[}Fe4S4(PPr3i)(3)L] (L = Cl-, Br-, I-, RO-, RS-, RSe-) has been
   prepared in 40-80\% yield by two methods: ligand substitution of
   {[}Fe4S4(PPr3i)(4)](1+) in tetrahydrofuran (THF)/acetonitrile by
   reaction with monoanions, and reductive cleavage of ligand substrates
   (RSSR, RSeSeR, 12) by the all-ferrous clusters
   {[}Fe8S8(PPr3i)(6)]/{[}Fe16S16(PPR3i)(8)] in THF. These neutral clusters
   are stable and do not undergo ligand redistribution reactions involving
   charged species in benzene and THF solutions. X-ray structural studies
   confirm the cubane stereochemistry but with substantial and variable
   distortions of the {[}Fe4S4](1+) core from idealized cubic core
   geometry. Based on Fe-S bond lengths, seven clusters were found to have
   compressed tetragonal distortions (4 short and 8 long bonds), and the
   remaining seven display other types of distortions with different
   combinations of long, short, and intermediate bond lengths. These
   results further emphasize the facile deformabililty of this core
   oxidation state previously observed in {[}Fe4S4(SR)(4)](3-) clusters.
   The Fe2.25+ mean oxidation state was demonstrated from Fe-57 isomer
   shifts, and the appearance of two quadrupole doublets arises from the
   spin-coupled l9/2,4,1/2 > state. The S = 1/2 ground state was further
   supported by electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and magnetic
   susceptibility data.}},

   microparticles encapsulating ovalbumin (OVA) and CpG of 0.5-2.5 mu m in
   diameter with an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 63\% and 95\%
   respectively. In mice the microparticles generated high antigen-specific

   vivo imaging of mice subcutaneously injected with MPs showed several
   fold increase of OVA and CpG in draining inguinal lymph nodes compared

Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{A novel white-light-emitting phosphor Ca9Lu(PO4)7:Eu2+,Mn2+ has been
   prepared by solid-state reaction. The photoluminescence properties
   indicate that there is an efficient energy transfer from the Eu2+ to
   Mn2+ ions via a dipole-quadrupole reaction. The obtained phosphor
   exhibits a strong excitation band between 250 and 430 nm, matching well
   with the dominant emission band of a UV light-emitting-diode (LED) chip.
   Upon excitation of UV light, white light is realized by combining a
   broad blue-green emission band at 480 nm and a red emission band at 645
   nm attributed to the Eu2+ and Mn2+ ions. The energy-transfer efficiency
   and critical distance were also calculated. Furthermore, the phosphors
   can generate lights from blue-green through white and eventually to red
   by properly tuning the relative ratio of the Eu2+ to Mn2+ ions through
   the principle of energy transfer. Preliminary studies showed that the
   phosphor might be promising as a single-phased white-light-emitting
   phosphor for a UV white-light LED.}},

   prepared in crystalline form:
   {[}Cu-7(mu(3)-OH)(4)(mu-OCH2CF3)(2)(mu-L)(6)]{[}BF4](2) (2) and
   {[}Cu-7(mu(3)-OH)(4)(mu-OCH3)(2)-(mu-L)(6)]Cl-2 center dot xCH(2)Cl(2)

   {[}Cu-6(mu-OH)(4)(mu-OR)(2)(mu-L)(6)] ring is constructed of six
   square-pyramidal Cu ions, linked by 1,2-pyrazolido bridges from the L-
   ligands and by basal, apical-bridging hydroxy or alkoxy groups, while
   the central Cu ion is bound to the four metallamacrocyclic hydroxy
   donors in a near-regular square-planar geometry. The L- ligands project
   above and below the metal ion core, forming two bowl-shaped cavities
   that are fully (R = CH2CF3) or partially (R = CH3) occupied by the
   alkoxy R substituents. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility
   measurements on 2 demonstrated antiferromagnetic interactions between
   the Cu ions, yielding a spin-frustrated S=1/2 magnetic ground state that
   is fully populated below around 15 K. Electrospray ionization mass
   spectrometry, UV/vis/near-IR, and electron paramagnetic resonance
   measurements imply that the heptacopper(II) disk motif is robust in
   organic solvents.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether cilostazol,
   a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor and antiplatelet drug, would prevent
   tPA-associated hemorrhagic transformation. Mice subjected to 6-h middle
   cerebral artery occlusion were treated with delayed tPA alone at 6 h,
   with combined tPA plus cilostazol at 6 h, or with vehicle at 6 h. We
   used multiple imaging (electron microscopy, spectroscopy), histological
   and neurobehavioral measures to assess the effects of the treatment at
   18 h and 7 days after the reperfusion. To further investigate the
   mechanism of cilostazol to beneficial effect, we also performed an in
   vitro study with tPA and a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor in human
   brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes.
   Combination therapy with tPA plus cilostazol prevented development of
   hemorrhagic transformation, reduced brain edema, prevented endothelial
   injury via reduction MMP-9 activity, and prevented the blood-brain
   barrier opening by inhibiting decreased claudin-5 expression. These
   changes significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality at 18 h and 7
   days after the reperfusion. Also, the administration of both drugs
   prevented injury to brain human endothelial cells and human brain
   pericytes. The present study indicates that a phosphodiesterase-III
   inhibitor prevents the hemorrhagic transformation induced by focal
   cerebral ischemia in mice treated with tPA.}},

Title = {{Genomic Aberrations in Lung Adenocarcinoma in Never Smokers}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lung cancer in never smokers would rank as the seventh most
   common cause of cancer death worldwide.
   Methods and Findings: We performed high-resolution array comparative
   genomic hybridization analysis of lung adenocarcinoma in sixty never
   smokers and identified fourteen new minimal common regions (MCR) of gain
   or loss, of which five contained a single gene (MOCS2, NSUN3, KHDRBS2,
   SNTG1 and ST18). One larger MCR of gain contained NSD1. One focal
   amplification and nine gains contained FUS. NSD1 and FUS are oncogenes
   hitherto not known to be associated with lung cancer. FISH showed that
   the amplicon containing FUS was joined to the next telomeric amplicon at
   16p11.2. FUS was over-expressed in 10 tumors with gain of 16p11.2
   compared to 30 tumors without that gain. Other cancer genes present in
   aberrations included ARNT, BCL9, CDK4, CDKN2B, EGFR, ERBB2, MDM2, MDM4,
   MET, MYC and KRAS. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering with adjustment
   for false-discovery rate revealed clusters differing by the level and
   pattern of aberrations and displaying particular tumor characteristics.
   One cluster was strongly associated with gain of MYC. Another cluster
   was characterized by extensive losses containing tumor suppressor genes
   of which RB1 and WRN. Tumors in that cluster frequently harbored a
   central scar-like fibrosis. A third cluster was associated with gains on
   7p and 7q, containing ETV1 and BRAF, and displayed the highest rate of
   EGFR mutations. SNP array analysis validated copy-number aberrations and
   revealed that RB1 and WRN were altered by recurrent copy-neutral loss of
   heterozygosity.
   Conclusions: The present study has uncovered new aberrations containing
   cancer genes. The oncogene FUS is a candidate gene in the 16p region
   that is frequently gained in never smokers. Multiple genetic pathways
   defined by gains of MYC, deletions of RB1 and WRN or gains on 7p and 7q
   are involved in lung adenocarcinoma in never smokers.}},

Abstract = {{The new three-dimensional (3D) heterometallic Cu-II/Fe-II coordination
   polymers {[}Cu-6(H(2)tea)(6)Fe(CN)(6)](n)(NO3)(2n)center dot 6nH(2)O (1)
   and {[}Cu-6(Hmdea)(6)Fe(CN)(6)](n)(NO3)(2n)center dot 7nH(2)O (2) have
   been easily generated by aqueous-medium self-assembly reactions of
   copper(II) nitrate with triethanolamine or N-methyldiethanolamine
   (H(3)tea or H(2)mdea, respectively), in the presence of potassium
   ferricyanide and sodium hydroxide. They have been isolated as air-stable
   crystalline solids and fully characterized including by single-crystal
   X-ray diffraction analyses. The latter reveal the formation of 3D
   metal-organic frameworks that are constructed from the
   {[}Cu-2(mu-H(2)tea)(2)](2+) or {[}Cu-2(mu-Hmdea)(2)](2+) nodes and the
   octahedral {[}Fe(CN)(6)](4-) linkers, featuring regular (1) or distorted
   (2) octahedral net skeletons. Upon dehydration, both compounds show
   reversible escape and binding processes toward water or methanol
   molecules. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of 1 and 2 reveal strong
   antiferromagnetic {[}J = -199(1) cm(-1)] or strong ferromagnetic {[}J =
   +153(1) cm(-1)] couplings between the copper(II) ions through the
   mu-O-alkoxo atoms in 1 or 2, respectively. The differences in magnetic
   behavior are explained in terms of the dependence of the magnetic
   coupling constant on the Cu-O-Cu bridging angle. Compounds 1 and 2 also
   act as efficient catalyst precursors for the mild oxidation of
   cyclohexane by aqueous hydrogen peroxide to cyclohexanol and
   cyclohexanone (homogeneous catalytic system), leading to maximum total
   yields (based on cyclohexane) and turnover numbers (TONs) up to about
   22\% and 470, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous variations in weather and climate over widely separated
   regions are commonly known as ``hydroclimatic teleconnections{''}.
   Rainfall and runoff patterns, over continents, are found to be
   significantly teleconnected, with large-scale circulation patterns,
   through such hydroclimatic teleconnections. Though such teleconnections
   exist in nature, it is very difficult to model them, due to their
   inherent complexity.
   Statistical techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools gain
   popularity in modeling hydroclimatic teleconnection, based on their
   ability, in capturing the complicated relationship between the
   predictors (e.g. sea surface temperatures) and predictand (e.g.,
   rainfall). Genetic Programming is such an AI tool, which is capable of
   capturing nonlinear relationship, between predictor and predictand, due
   to its flexible functional structure. In the present study, gridded
   multi-site weekly rainfall is predicted from El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) indices, Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation
   (EQUINOO) indices, Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and lag rainfall at
   grid points, over the catchment, using Genetic Programming.
   The predicted rainfall is further used in a Genetic Programming model to
   predict streamflows. The model is applied for weekly forecasting of
   streamflow in Mahanadi River, India, and satisfactory performance is
   observed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   in Heart Tissue Specific Transgenic Mice}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{The lamin A/C (LMNA), nuclear intermediate filament proteins, is a basic
   component of the nuclear lamina. Mutations in LMNA are associated with a
   broad range of laminopathies, congenital diseases affecting tissue
   regeneration and homeostasis. Heart tissue specific transgenic mice of
   human LMNA E82K, a mutation causing dilated cardiomyopathy, were
   generated. Lmna(E82K) transgenic mouse lines exhibited thin-walled,
   dilated left and right ventricles, a progressive decrease of contractile
   function assessed by echocardiography. Abnormalities of the conduction
   system, myocytes disarray, collagen accumulation and increased levels of
   B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), procollagen type III alpha 1 (Col3
   alpha 1) and skeletal muscle actin alpha 1 (Act alpha 1) were detected
   in the hearts of Lmna(E82K) transgenic mice. The LMNA E82K mutation
   caused mislocation of LMNA in the nucleus and swollen mitochondria with
   loss of critae, together with the loss of nuclear envelope integrity.
   Most interestingly, we found that the level of apoptosis was 8.5-fold
   higher in the Lmna(E82K) transgenic mice than that of non-transgenic
   (NTG) mice. In the presence of the LMNA E82K, both of FAS and
   mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis were activated consistent with the
   increase of FAS expression, the release of cytochrome c from
   mitochondria to cytosol and activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3. Our
   results suggested that the apoptosis, at least for the LMNA E82K or the
   mutations in the rod region of Lamin A/C, might be an important
   mechanism causing continuous loss of myocytes and lead to myocardial
   dysfunction. It could be a potential therapeutic means to suppress
   and/or prevent inappropriate cardiac cell death in patients carrying
   LMNA mutation.}},

   Coumarin 153 (C-153) in SDS dispersed two different types of single

   solvation dynamics of C-153 in SWNTs is severely retarded compared to
   pure water and SDS micelle. Time resolved fluorescence anisotropy study
   suggests that C-153 molecules are located on the surface of SWNT, where
   the rotational motion of the probe is severely hindered compared to SDS
   micelle due to the restriction imposed by SWNT surface as well as
   surrounding SDS monomers or SDS half-cylindrical micelles adsorbed on

Abstract = {{A new generation of nanocarriers, logic-embedded vectors (LEVs), is
   endowed with the ability to localize components at multiple
   intracellular sites, thus creating an opportunity for synergistic
   control of redundant or dual-hit pathways. LEV encoding elements include
   size, shape, charge, and surface chemistry. In this study, LEVs consist
   of porous silicon nanocarriers, programmed for cellular uptake and
   trafficking along the endosomal pathway, and surface-tailored iron oxide
   nanoparticles, programmed for endosomal sorting and partitioning of
   particles into unique cellular locations. In the presence of persistent
   endosomal localization of silicon nanocarriers, amine-functionalized
   nanoparticles are sorted into multiple vesicular bodies that form novel
   membrane-bound compartments compatible with cellular secretion, while
   chitosan-coated nanoparticles escape from endosomes and enter the
   cytosol. Encapsulation within the porous silicon matrix protects these
   nanoparticle surface-tailored properties, and enhances endosomal escape
   of chitosan-coated nanoparticles. Thus, LEVs provide a mechanism for
   shielded transport of nanoparticles to the lesion, cellular manipulation
   at multiple levels, and a means for targeting both within and between
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{The heterocumulenes carbon dioxide (CO2), carbonyl sulfide (OCS), and
   carbon disulfide (CS2) were treated with
   bis(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-disila-1-azacyclopent-1-yl)tin
   \{{[}(CH2)Me2Si](2)N\}(2)Sn, an analogue of the well-studied
   bis{[}bis(trimethylsilyl)amido]tin species {[}(Me3Si)(2)N](2)Sn, to
   yield an unexpectedly diverse product slate. Reaction of
   \{{[}(CH2)Me2Si](2)N\}(2)Sn with CO2 resulted in the formation of
   2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-disila-1-oxacyclopentane, along with
   Sn-4(mu(4)-O)\{mu(2)-O2CN{[}SiMe2(CH2)(2)]\}4(mu(2)-N=C=O)(2) as the
   primary organometallic Sn-containing product. The reaction of
   \{{[}(CH2)Me2Si](2)N\}(2)Sn with CS2 led to formal reduction of CS2 to
   {[}CS2](2-), yielding
   {[}\{{[}(CH2)Me2Si](2)N\}(2)Sn](2)CS2\{{[}(CH2)Me2Si](2)N\}(2)Sn, in
   which the {[}CS2](2-) is coordinated through C and S to two tin centers.
   The product
   {[}\{{[}(CH2)Me2Si](2)N\}(2)Sn](2)CS2\{{[}(CH2)Me2Si](2)N\}(2)Sn also
   contains a novel 4-membered Sn-Sn-C-S ring, and exhibits a further
   bonding interaction through sulfur to a third Sn atom. Reaction of DOS
   with \{{[}(CH2)Me2Si](2)N\}(2)Sn resulted in an insoluble polymeric
   material. In a comparison reaction, {[}(Me3Si)(2)N](2)Sn was treated
   with OCS to yield Sn-4(mu(4)-O)(mu(2)-OSiMe3)(5)(eta(1)-N=C=S). A
   combination of NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single
   crystal X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the products of each
   reaction. The oxygen atoms in the final products come from the facile
   cleavage of either CO2 or OCS, depending on the reacting carbon
   dichalogenide.}},

Title = {{Maneb and paraquat-induced modulation of toxicant responsive genes in

Abstract = {{Experimental studies have shown that toxicant responsive genes,
   cytochrome P4505 (CYPs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play a
   critical role in pesticide-induced toxicity. CYPs play pro-oxidant role
   and GSTs offer protection in maneb (MB) and paraquat (PQ)-induced brain
   and lung toxicities. The present study aimed to investigate the effect
   of repeated exposures of MB and/or PQ on lipid peroxidation
   (LPO),glutathione content (GSH) and toxicant responsive genes, i.e.,
   CYP1A1, 1A2, 2E1, GSTA4-4, GSTA1-1 and GSTA3-3 in the liver and to
   correlate the same with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). A
   significant augmentation in LPO and reduction in GSH content was
   observed in a time of exposure dependent manner in the liver and PMNs of
   MB and/or PQ treated animals. The expression and catalytic activity of
   CYP2E1 and GSTA4-4 were significantly increased following MB and/or PQ
   exposure both in the liver and PMNs. Although the expression of GSTA3-3
   was increased, the expression of GSTA1-1 was unaltered after MB and/or
   PQ treatment in both the liver and PMNs. MB augmented the expression and
   catalytic activity of CYP1A1 in the liver, however, CYP1A2 was
   unaffected. PQ on the other hand, significantly increased hepatic CYP1A2
   expression and catalytic activity. MB and/or PQ did not produce any
   significant changes in CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in PMNs. The results of the
   study thus demonstrate that MB and PQ differentially regulate hepatic
   CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 while LPO, GSH, CYP2E1, GSTA4-4 and GSTA3-3 are
   modulated in the similar fashions both in the liver and PMNs. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Cell membranes have been proposed to serve as promoters for calcium
   oxalate monohydrate (COM) kidney stone formation. However, direct
   evidence to demonstrate the modulatory effects of renal tubular cell
   membranes on COM crystals does not currently exist. We thus examined the
   effects of intact MDCK cells and their fragmented membranes on COM
   crystal growth, aggregation and transformation. COM crystals were
   generated in the absence (control) or presence of intact MOCK cells or
   their membrane fragments. Intact MOCK cells and their membrane fragments
   significantly inhibited COM crystal growth (22.6\% and 25.2\% decreases
   in size, respectively) and significantly reduced COM total crystal mass
   (23.1\% and 25.6\% decreases, respectively). In contrast, both of them
   markedly promoted crystal aggregation (1.9-fold and 3.2-fold increases,
   respectively). Moreover, both intact cells and membrane fragments could
   transform COM to calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) crystals. Finally, COM
   crystal growth inhibitory activities of both membrane forms were
   successfully confirmed by a spectrophotometric oxalate-depletion assay.
   Our data provide the first direct evidence to demonstrate the dual
   modulatory effects of MDCK membranes on COM crystals. Although growth of
   individual COM crystals was inhibited, their aggregation was promoted.
   These findings provide additional insights into the mechanisms of COM
   kidney stone formation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Methanol oxidation reaction probes the chemical nature of the active
   sites (formaldehyde forms on surface redox sites and dimethylether, on
   acidic ones) and has been used to characterize the active sites present
   on the surface of Mo-V-Nb-O catalysts which has been correlated with the
   activity for propane oxidation to acrylic acid. The effect of
   calcination atmosphere and the role of tellurium addition have been
   discussed as a function of the total coverage. The structure of Mo-V-O
   mixed phases strongly depends on these parameters, as determined by XRD,
   XPS and Raman spectroscopy. Such structures determine the catalytic
   behavior of catalysts during both propane and methanol oxidation. At low
   and medium coverages, the presence of oxidized dispersed surface
   vanadium structures (VOx) determines the catalytic behavior; such phases
   are active for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde. At high coverages,
   the formation of Al-Mo-O and Mo-V-O crystalline aggregates decreases the
   number of redox sites, whereas the presence of reduced species in
   rutile-like and/or MoO2 increases the redox activity for inert-calcined
   samples. For samples with high coverage, tellurium addition decreases
   the activity during methanol oxidation. This is due to a decrease in the
   population of surface VOx species. The interaction of tellurium with
   molybdenum and vanadium sites results in mixed phases with intermediate
   oxidation state that exhibit higher yields to acrylic acid. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Combustion and smoke emission properties of PVC compounds, modified with
   copper (II), molybdenum, and zinc oxides, were studied using cone
   calorimeter, limiting oxygen index (LOT) and thermogravimetry coupled
   with mass spectrometry (TG/MS). Results showed that the metal oxides
   have a very significant effect on the combustion and smoke suppression
   properties of the PVC compounds. The results also confirmed the
   anticipation mechanisms of the dehydrochlorination reactions, reductive
   coupling, and elimination of benzene resulting from the presence of
   copper (II), molybdenum, and zinc, indicated by the increasing content
   of postcombustion char residue and the significant reduction in benzene
   production, indicated by the MS measurements performed. The results also
   provide indications that the combination of the copper (II) and
   molybdenum oxides is the one with the best balance of combustion
   properties, as it reduced the heat released and promoted the suppression
   of smoke more efficiently. The formulations containing ZnO, because of
   their strong Lewis acid character, indicated a less pronounced reduction
   of smoke released during the combustion process, when compared with

   loads and the selected inflation pressures were compared, to identify
   the wheel with the lowest motion resistance. On all the test surfaces,
   the 660 mm diameter recorded the lowest motion resistance measured with
   an average of 16 out of the 36 total number of test outcomes. The 660 mm
   diameter wheel, if used, has the potential to increase the pull (draft)
   and can be used in the development of simple, easy to maintain and
   low-cost agricultural machines with narrow wheels; as traction member
   for the low-income farmers and the rural dwellers to boost their
   agricultural productivity.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the degree of modification of selected
   properties of soils in a semi-arid environment as a result of sludge
   application, in an endeavour to understand variations in percentage
   improvement with sludge application rate (SAR). Sludge was applied to a
   calcic luvisol (luvisol 1), a ferric luvisol (luvisol 2) an arenosol,
   and a vertisol at different rates and after three months, each
   soil-sludge mixture tested. Spinach (Spinacea oleracea) was then planted
   to test sludge effects on spinach yield. Addition of sludge reduced the
   pH of luvisol 1, luvisol 2, arenosol and vertisol by an average of 0.8,
   1.1, 0.4 and 1.0 pH units, respectively. Mean concentrations of
   phosphorus, total kjeldahl nitrogen, and plant available nitrogen were
   highest in luvisol 1 (91.1 mg/kg), vertisol (2.3\%), and vertisol (718.3
   mg/kg) respectively. Concentrations of all plant nutrients increased
   with SAR in all soils. Percentage increase however varied, being highest
   in the luvisols at lower SAR, and shifting to the arenosol as SAR
   increased. Highest spinach yield was obtained from luvisol 2 with mean
   values of 49.2 gm, 19.7 gm and 179.7 cm(2) for fresh biomass, dry
   biomass and leaf area of spinach respectively. Spinach grown on the
   sludge-amended vertisol had the highest correlation coefficients between
   leaf area (LA) and SAR (0.92), fresh biomass (FBM) and SAR (0.90) and
   dry biomass (DBM) and SAR (0.95). Possible causes of the observed
   differences in sludge effects on the different soil properties are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic renormalization-group (RG) methods were originally used by
   Forster, Nelson, and Stephen (FNS) to study the large-scale behavior of
   randomly stirred incompressible fluids governed by the Navier-Stokes
   equations. Similar calculations using a variety of methods have been
   performed but have led to a discrepancy in results. In this paper, we
   carefully reexamine in d dimensions the approaches used to calculate the
   renormalized viscosity increment and, by including an additional
   constraint which is neglected in many procedures, conclude that the
   original result of FNS is correct. By explicitly using step functions to
   control the domain of integration, we calculate a nonzero correction
   caused by boundary terms which cannot be ignored. We then go on to
   analyze how the noise renormalization, which is absent in many
   approaches, contributes an O(k(2)) correction to the force
   autocorrelation and show conditions for this to be taken as a
   renormalization of the noise coefficient. Following this, we discuss the
   applicability of this RG procedure to the calculation of the inertial
   range properties of fluid turbulence.}},

   Vitro Suppression Assay}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: In type 1 diabetes (T1D), a prototypic autoimmune disease,
   effector T cells destroy beta cells. Normally, CD4(+)CD25(+high), or
   natural regulatory T cells (Tregs), counter this assault. In
   autoimmunity, the failure to suppress CD4(+)CD25(low) T cells is
   important for disease development. However, both Treg dysfunction and
   hyperactive responder T-cell proliferation contribute to disease.
   Methods/Principal Findings: We investigated human CD4(+)CD25(low) T
   cells and compared them to CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells in otherwise equivalent
   in vitro proliferative conditions. We then asked whether these
   differences in suppression are exacerbated in T1D. In both single and
   co-culture with Tregs, the CD4(+)CD25(low) T cells divided more rapidly
   than CD4(+)CD25 T cells, which manifests as increased
   proliferation/reduced suppression. Time-course experiments showed that
   this difference could be explained by higher IL-2 production from
   CD4+CD25(low) compared to CD4+CD25- T cells. There was also a
   significant increase in CD4+CD25(low) T-cell proliferation compared to
   CD4+CD25- T cells during suppression assays from RO T1D and at-risk
   subjects (n = 28, p = 0.015 and p = 0.024 respectively).
   Conclusions/Significance: The in vitro dual suppression assays proposed
   here could highlight the impaired sensitivity of certain responder T
   cells to the suppressive effect of Tregs in human autoimmune diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Neuronal cell loss underlies the pathological decline in cognition and
   memory associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Recently, targeting the
   endocannabinoid system in AD has emerged as a promising new approach to
   treatment. Studies have identified neuroprotective roles for
   endocannabinoids against key pathological events in the AD brain,
   including cell death by apoptosis. Elucidation of the apoptotic pathway
   evoked by beta-amyloid (A beta) is thus important for the development of
   therapeutic strategies that can thwart A beta toxicity and preserve cell
   viability. We have previously reported that lysosomal membrane
   permeabilization plays a distinct role in the apoptotic pathway
   initiated by A beta. In the present study, we provide evidence that the
   endocannabinoid system can stabilize lysosomes against A beta-induced
   permeabilization and in turn sustain cell survival. We report that
   endocannabinoids stabilize lysosomes by preventing the A beta-induced
   up-regulation of the tumor suppressor protein, p53, and its interaction
   with the lysosomal membrane. We also provide evidence that intracellular
   cannabinoid type 1 receptors play a role in stabilizing lysosomes
   against A beta toxicity and thus highlight the functionality of these
   receptors. Given the deleterious effect of lysosomal membrane
   permeabilization on cell viability, stabilization of lysosomes with
   endocannabinoids may represent a novel mechanism by which these lipid
   modulators confer neuroprotection.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, stalagmites have become important archives for
   paleoclimate. Several studies applying carbon and oxygen isotopes of
   stalagmites show a simultaneous increase of delta C-13 and delta O-18
   along individual growth layers, which is interpreted as being indicative
   of isotope fractionation under disequilibrium conditions. In order to
   obtain robust paleoclimatic information from calcite precipitated under
   these non-equilibrium conditions it is important to improve the
   quantitative understanding of the corresponding isotope fractionation
   processes. Here we present laboratory experiments simulating calcite
   precipitation under cave-analogue conditions. The major focus was the
   investigation of the temporal evolution of the delta C-13 and delta O-18
   values of the precipitated calcite for varying temperature, drip
   interval and initial SICaCo3.
   All experiments show an isotopic enrichment of both delta C-13 and delta
   O-18 with increasing distance from the point of drip water impinge.
   Longer drip intervals and higher temperatures result in a larger
   enrichment. In addition, the slope between delta O-18 and delta C-13 is
   lower for higher temperatures indicating faster oxygen isotope exchange
   between the water reservoir and the bicarbonate in the solution.
   In case of delta C-13, the fractionation factor between the precipitated
   calcite and the bicarbonate in the solution. (13)alpha(CaCo3)-HCO3-,
   shows a larger increase with higher temperatures in comparison to
   previous studies. This possibly indicates an increasing contribution of
   disequilibrium isotope fractionation processes for increasing
   temperatures, which are not accounted for by the equilibrium isotope
   fractionation factors. Furthermore, a quantitative determination of the
   calcite precipitation time, T-p, and the oxygen isotope exchange time
   between the bicarbonate and the water, T-b, yields faster reaction rates
   in comparison to previously published time constants, particularly at
   higher temperature (23 degrees C). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Dilatant strengthening as a mechanism for slow slip events}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{The mechanics of slow slip events (SSE) in subduction zones remain
   unresolved. We suggest that SSE nucleate in areas of unstable friction
   under drained conditions, but as slip accelerates dilatancy reduces pore
   pressure p quenching instability. Competition between dilatant
   strengthening and thermal pressurization may control whether slip is
   slow or fast. We model SSE with 2-D elasticity, rate-state friction, and
   a dilatancy law where porosity phi evolves toward steady state phi(ss)
   over distance d(c) and phi(ss) = phi(0) + epsilon ln(v/v(0)); v is slip
   speed. We consider two diffusion models. Membrane diffusion (MD) is
   approximated by -(p -p(infinity))/t(f) where p and p(infinity) are shear
   zone and remote pore pressure and t(f) is a characteristic diffusion
   time. Homogeneous diffusion (HD) accurately models fault-normal flow
   with diffusivity c(hyd). For MD, linearized analysis defines a boundary
   epsilon = 1 - a/b between slow and fast slip, where epsilon =
   f(0)epsilon/beta b(sigma - p(infinity)), f(0), a, and b are friction
   parameters and beta is compressibility. When epsilon < 1 - a/b slip
   accelerates to instability for sufficiently large faults, whereas for
   epsilon > 1 -a/b slip speeds remain quasi-static. For HD, E-p equivalent
   to epsilon h/(beta(sigma - p(infinity))root v(infinity) / c(hyd)d(c))
   defines dilatancy efficiency, where h is shear zone thickness and
   v(infinity) is plate velocity. SSE are favored by large epsilon h and
   low effective stress. The ratio E-p to thermal pressurization efficiency
   scales with 1/(sigma - p infinity), so high p(infinity) favors SSE,
   consistent with seismic observations. For E-p similar to 10(-3)
   transient slip rates, repeat times, average slip, and stress drops are
   comparable to field observations. Model updip propagation speeds are
   comparable to those observed along-strike. Many simulations exhibit slow
   phases driven by steady downdip slip and faster phases that relax the
   accumulated stress. Model SSE accommodate only a fraction of plate
   motion; the remaining deficit must be accommodated during coseismic or
   postseismic slip.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal, transmissible,
   neurodegenerative disease of cattle. To date, the disease process is
   still poorly understood. In this study, brain tissue samples from
   animals naturally infected with BSE were analysed to identify
   differentially regulated genes using Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome
   Arrays. A total of 230 genes were shown to be differentially regulated
   and many of these genes encode proteins involved in immune response,
   apoptosis, cell adhesion, stress response and transcription. Seventeen
   genes are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and 10 of these
   17 genes are involved in stress related responses including ER
   chaperones, Grp94 and Grp170. Western blotting analysis showed that
   another ER chaperone, Grp78, was up-regulated in BSE. Up-regulation of
   these three chaperones strongly suggests the presence of ER stress and
   the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in BSE. The
   occurrence of ER stress was also supported by changes in gene expression
   for cytosolic proteins, such as the chaperone pair of Hsp70 and DnaJ.
   Many genes associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the
   autophagy-lysosome system were differentially regulated, indicating that
   both pathways might be activated in response to ER stress. A model is
   presented to explain the mechanisms of prion neurotoxicity using these
   ER stress related responses. Clustering analysis showed that the
   differently regulated genes found from the naturally infected BSE cases
   could be used to predict the infectious status of the samples
   experimentally infected with BSE from the previous study and vice versa.
   Proof-of-principle gene expression biomarkers were found to represent
   BSE using 10 genes with 94\% sensitivity and 87\% specificity.}},

   the two carbon-carbon double bonds present in the compounds were carried
   out to further explore the structure-activity relationships of these new

   decreases antiviral activity, whereas either cyclopropanation or

Title = {{TLR4 Inhibits Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) STAT3 Activation and Thereby
   Exerts Deleterious Effects on MSC-Mediated Cardioprotection}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) improve
   myocardial recovery after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. These
   effects are mediated in part by the paracrine secretion of angiogenic
   and tissue growth-promoting factors. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is
   expressed by MSC and induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation in
   neuronal progenitors as well as many other cell types. It is unknown
   whether knock-out (KO) of TLR4 will change the paracrine properties of
   MSC and in turn improve MSC-associated myocardial protection.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: This study explored the effect of MSC
   TLR4 on the secretion of angiogenic factors and chemokines in vitro by
   using ELISA and cytokine array assays and investigated the role of TLR4
   on MSC-mediated myocardial recovery after I/R injury in an isolated rat
   heart model. We observed that MSC isolated from TLR4 KO mice exhibited a
   greater degree of cardioprotection in a rat model of myocardial I/R
   injury. This enhanced protection was associated with increased
   angiogenic factor production, proliferation and differentiation.
   TLR4-dificiency was also associated with decreased phosphorylation of
   PI-3K and AKT, but increased activation of STAT3. siRNA targeting of
   STAT3 resulted in attenuation of the enhanced cardioprotection of
   TLR4-deficient MSC.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study indicates that TLR4 exerts
   deleterious effects on MSC-derived cardioprotection following I/R by a
   STAT3 inhibitory mechanism.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the geotectonic evolution of the southeastern Tibetan
   plateau requires knowledge about the structure of the lithosphere. Using
   data from 77 broadband stations in SW China, we invert Rayleigh wave
   phase velocity dispersion curves from ambient noise interferometry (T =
   10-40 s) and teleseismic surface waves (T = 20-150 s) for 3-D
   heterogeneity and azimuthal anisotropy in the lithosphere to similar to
   150 km depth. Our surface wave array tomography reveals (1) deep crustal
   zones of anomalously low shear wave speed and (2) substantial variations
   with depth of the pattern of azimuthal anisotropy. Upper crustal
   azimuthal anisotropy reveals a curvilinear pattern around the eastern
   Himalayan syntaxis, with fast directions generally parallel to the main
   strike slip faults. The mantle pattern of azimuthal anisotropy is
   different from that in the crust and varies from north to south. The
   tomographically inferred 3-D variation in azimuthal anisotropy helps
   constrain the source region of shear wave splitting. South of similar to
   26 degrees N (off the high plateau) most of the observed splitting can
   be accounted for by upper mantle anisotropy, but for stations on the
   plateau proper (with thick crust) crustal anisotropy cannot be ignored.
   On long wavelengths, the pattern of azimuthal anisotropy in the crust
   differs from that in the mantle. This is easiest explained if
   deformation varies with depth. The deep crustal zones of low shear wave
   speed (and, presumably, mechanical strength) may represent loci of
   ductile deformation. But their lateral variation suggests that in SE
   Tibet (localized) crustal channel flow and motion along the major strike
   slip faults are both important.}},

   The surface tension measurements revealed that the ionic liquid {[}C-12

   Triton X-100 are very different while the concentration of added
   {[}C(12)mim]{[}BE4] is below and upon its CMC. The H-1 NMR data
   demonstrated that there are hydrogen-bond interactions between the
   imidazolium cation of {[}C(12)mim]{[}BF4] and the hydrophilic PEO groups
   of Triton X-100 and hydrophobic interactions between the dodecyl chain
   of the imidazolium cation and the hydrophobic chain with phenyl of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},

Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{This study introduces a flexible multiple nested modeling framework
   developed from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for
   boundary layer cloud research. It features a nested large-eddy
   simulation in a hindcasting mode that allows a direct comparison between
   simulations and observations. Using this approach, we simulated two
   stratocumulus cases observed at the southern Great Plains observing
   site. The simulation-observation comparisons demonstrate that the
   multiple nested WRF well reproduces the cloud properties and vertical
   velocity fields detected by cloud radar and other remote sensing
   instruments. The simulations show that (1) the cloud fields can be
   strongly modulated by mesoscale organizations; (2) the vertical velocity
   variance and skewness in the boundary layer have well-defined diurnal
   variations and are strongly dependent on external forcings, but the
   in-cloud turbulent statistics appears to be more controlled by the
   internal turbulent processes; (3) the organized structures of
   stratocumulus are only slightly skewed, which is consistent with the
   cloud radar observations that the updraft fraction is close to 50\%; and
   (4) the vertical distribution of cloud water and the associated
   high-order moments of continental stratocumulus can be substantially
   different from its marine counterpart due to different ambient
   thermodynamic structures. This study suggests that the multiple-scale
   WRF modeling system provides a great numerical framework that can be
   used to address various issues regarding the parameterization of
   boundary layer clouds.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Appropriate regulation of respective gene expressions is a
   bottleneck for the realization of artificial biological systems inside
   living cells. The modification of several promoter sequences is required
   to achieve appropriate regulation of the systems. However, a
   time-consuming process is required for the insertion of an operator, a
   binding site of a protein for gene expression, to the gene regulatory
   region of a plasmid. Thus, a standardized method for integrating
   operator sequences to the regulatory region of a plasmid is required.
   Results: We developed a standardized method for integrating operator
   sequences to the regulatory region of a plasmid and constructed a
   synthetic promoter that functions as a genetic AND gate. By
   standardizing the regulatory region of a plasmid and the operator parts,
   we established a platform for modular assembly of the operator parts.
   Moreover, by assembling two different operator parts on the regulatory
   region, we constructed a regulatory device with an AND gate function.
   Conclusions: We implemented a new standard to assemble operator parts
   for construction of functional genetic logic gates. The logic gates at
   the molecular scale have important implications for reprogramming
   cellular behavior.}},

Title = {{Photodepletion differentially affects CD4(+) Tregs versus CD4(+)
   effector T cells from patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease}},
Journal = {{BLOOD}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{23}},

Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Even the most potent immunosuppressive drugs often fail to control
   graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the most frequent and deleterious
   posttransplantation complication. We previously reported that
   photodepletion using dibromorhodamine (TH9402) eliminates T cells from
   healthy donors activated against major histocompatibility
   complex-incompatible cells and spares resting T cells. In the present
   study, we identified photodepletion conditions selectively eradicating
   endogenous proliferating T cells from chronic GVHD patients, with the
   concomittant sparing and expansion of CD4(+) CD25(+) forkhead box
   protein 3-positive T cells. The regulatory T-cell (Treg) nature and
   function of these photodepletion-resistant cells was demonstrated in
   coculture and depletion/repletion experiments. The mechanism by which
   Tregs escape photodepletion involves active P-glycoprotein-mediated drug
   efflux. This Treg-inhibitory activity is attributable to interleukin-10
   secretion, requires cell-cell contact, and implies binding with
   cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Preventing CTLA-4 ligation
   abrogated the in vitro generation of Tregs, thus identifying
   CTLA-4-mediated cell-cell contact as a crucial priming event for Treg
   function. Moreover, the frequency of circulating Tregs increased in
   chronic GVHD patients treated with TH9402 photodepleted cells. In
   conclusion, these results identify a novel approach to both preserve and
   expand Tregs while selectively eliminating CD4(+) effector T cells. They
   also uncover effector pathways that could be used advantageously for the
   treatment of patients with refractory GVHD. (Blood.

Abstract = {{In a recent phase 3 trial, bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide
   followed by maintenance treatment with bortezomib-thalidomide
   demonstrated superior efficacy compared with
   bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone. To decrease neurologic toxicities, the
   protocol was amended and patients in both arms received once-weekly
   instead of the initial twice-weekly bortezomib infusions: 372 patients
   received once-weekly and 139 twice-weekly bortezomib. In this posthoc
   analysis we assessed the impact of the schedule change on clinical
   outcomes and safety. Long-term outcomes appeared similar: 3-year
   progression-free survival rate was 50\% in the once-weekly and 47\% in
   the twice-weekly group (P > .999), and 3-year overall survival rate was
   88\% and 89\%, respectively (P = .54). The complete response rate was
   30\% in the once-weekly and 35\% in the twice-weekly group (P = .27).
   Nonhematologic grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 35\% of
   once-weekly patients and 51\% of twice-weekly patients (P = .003). The
   incidence of grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy was 8\% in the once-weekly
   and 28\% in the twice-weekly group (P < .001); 5\% of patients in the
   once-weekly and 15\% in the twice-weekly group discontinued therapy
   because of peripheral neuropathy (P < .001). This improvement in safety
   did not appear to affect efficacy. This study is registered at

   on the surface of vertically aligned gold nanorod arrays exhibit a
   variation in enhancement factor (EF) as a function of excitation

   properties of the surface. The key to understanding this lack of
   correlation and to obtaining agreement between experimental and
   calculated EF spectra lies with consideration of randomly distributed,
   sub-10 nm gaps between nanorods forming the substrate. Intense fields in
   these enhancement ``hot spots{''} make a dominant contribution to the
   Raman scattering and have a very different spectral profile to that of
   the elastic optical response. Detailed modeling of the electric field
   enhancement at both excitation and scattering wavelengths was used to
   quantitatively predict both the spectral profile and the magnitude of
   the observed EF.}},

Abstract = {{Instrumental seismicity of the greater Rome area is analyzed using the
   most recent seismological database. The aim of this study is to identify
   potential seismogenic structures responsible for the moderate seismicity
   that characterizes this sector, where no surface faulting is expected on
   the basis of the absence of strong local earthquakes, as evidenced by
   the 2000-year-long historical record. Nevertheless, in light of the
   great value and the high vulnerability of the architectural and
   monumental patrimony of Rome, even the occurrence of moderate events
   imposes a careful assessment of the hazard, linked to the presence of
   active faults that are undetectable by means of classic geological field
   investigation. Seismic data here analyzed belong to the period 1997-2008
   and show local magnitude (M-L) ranging from 1.5 to 4.7. To better
   constrain the hypocentral depths, we computed the V-p/V-s ratio using a
   modified Wadati method and the minimum 1-D velocity model that
   approximates the seismic structure of the study area. Moreover, we
   applied a double-difference hypocentral determination technique to
   improve earthquake locations. Most of the located seismicity appears to
   be concentrated within seven main clusters. Spatial distribution of the
   seismicity allowed us to identify several seismogenic structures,
   corresponding to previously undetected or only supposed active faults.
   The stress tensor obtained by inverting the focal mechanisms computed in
   this study is in agreement with the NE-SW extensional tectonic stress
   active in the inner chain of the Apennines, although there is evidence
   of some local stress field heterogeneities.}},

Title = {{Reverse mode Na+/Ca2+ exchange mediated by STIM1 contributes to Ca2+
   influx in airway smooth muscle following agonist stimulation}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Agonist stimulation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) results in
   IP3 mediated Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum followed by
   the activation of store operated and receptor operated non-selective
   cation channels. Activation of these non-selective channels also results
   in a Na+ influx. This localised increase in Na+ levels can potentially
   switch the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger into reverse mode and so result in a
   further influx of Ca2+. The aim of this study was to characterise the
   expression and physiological function of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in
   cultured human bronchial smooth muscle cells and determine its
   contribution to agonist induced Ca2+ influx into these cells.
   Methods: The expression profile of NCX (which encodes the Na+/Ca2+
   exchanger) homologues in cultured human bronchial smooth muscle cells
   was determined by reverse transcriptase PCR. The functional activity of
   reverse mode NCX was investigated using a combination of whole cell
   patch clamp, intracellular Ca2+ measurements and porcine airway
   contractile analyses. KB-R7943 (an antagonist for reverse mode NCX) and
   target specific siRNA were utilised as tools to inhibit NCX function.
   Results: NCX1 protein was detected in cultured human bronchial smooth
   muscle cells (HBSMC) cells and NCX1.3 was the only mRNA transcript
   variant detected. A combination of intracellular Na+ loading and
   addition of extracellular Ca2(+) induced an outwardly rectifying current
   which was augmented following stimulation with histamine. This outwardly
   rectifying current was inhibited by 10 mu M KB-R7943 (an antagonist of
   reverse mode NCX1) and was reduced in cells incubated with siRNA against
   NCX1. Interestingly, this outwardly rectifying current was also
   inhibited following knockdown of STIM1, suggesting for the first time a
   link between store operated cation entry and NCX1 activation. In
   addition, 10 mu M KB-R7943 inhibited agonist induced changes in
   cytosolic Ca2+ and induced relaxation of porcine peripheral airways.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these data demonstrate a potentially
   important role for NCX1 in control of Ca2+ homeostasis and link store
   depletion via STIM1 directly with NCX activation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the structure and molecular processes at the
   electrode/membrane interfaces constitutes an important topic in PEFC as
   well as in electrochemistry. In this work, the Pt(111)/Nafion model
   interface in HClO4 acid solutions is studied by IRRAS and cyclic
   voltammetry. It was found that the presence of an electric field mainly
   promotes deprotonation of sulfonic groups and structuring of water
   inside the membrane (polar molecules); especially near the electrode
   surface, with a sudden change of system optical properties at the
   Pt(111)/membrane interface at 0.9 V, possibly due to clustering within
   the polymer. Furthermore, the performance of the Pt(111)/Nafion in a
   typical electrochemical reaction as CO oxidation has been also analyzed.
   It is shown that there are notable differences between the
   characteristics of CO adsorption and oxidation at Pt(111) with and
   without polymer electrolyte membrane, like a continual wavenumber
   increase with the potential for the on-top CO band, even during CO
   oxidation, which proceeds at higher potentials at the electrode covered
   by the polymer. The spectroscopic features suggest enhanced proton
   mobility inside the membrane concomitantly with the deprotonation of
   sulfonic groups near the electrode surface and with higher potentials,
   possibly due to oriented morphologies inside the membrane induced by
   high fields.}},

Abstract = {{There is convincing evidence showing that the probability distributions
   of stock returns in mature markets exhibit power-law tails and both the
   positive and negative tails conform to the inverse cubic law. It
   supports the possibility that the tail exponents are universal at least
   for mature markets in the sense that they do not depend on stock market,
   industry sector, and market capitalization. We investigate the
   distributions of intraday returns at different time scales (Delta t = 1,
   5, 15, and 30 min) of all the A-share stocks traded in the Chinese stock
   market, which is the largest emerging market in the world. We find that
   the returns can be well fitted by the q-Gaussian distribution and the
   tails have power-law relaxations with the exponents increasing with
   Delta t and being well outside the Levy stable regime for individual
   stocks. We provide statistically significant evidence showing that, at
   small time scales Delta t<15 min, the exponents logarithmically decrease
   with the turnover rate and increase with the market capitalization. When
   Delta t>15 min, no conclusive evidence is found for a possible
   dependence of the tail exponent on the turnover rate or the market
   capitalization. Our findings indicate that the intraday return
   distributions at small time scales are not universal in emerging stock
   markets but might be universal at large time scales.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about metabolic regulation in stem cells and how this
   modulates tissue regeneration or tumour suppression. We studied the Lkb1
   tumour suppressor and its substrate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
   kinases that coordinate metabolism with cell growth. Deletion of the
   Lkb1 (also called Stk11) gene in mice caused increased haematopoietic
   stem cell (HSC) division, rapid HSC depletion and pancytopenia. HSCs
   depended more acutely on Lkb1 for cell-cycle regulation and survival
   than many other haematopoietic cells. HSC depletion did not depend on
   mTOR activation or oxidative stress. Lkb1-deficient HSCs, but not
   myeloid progenitors, had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and
   ATP levels. HSCs deficient for two catalytic alpha-subunits of AMPK
   (AMPK-deficient HSCs) showed similar changes in mitochondrial function
   but remained able to reconstitute irradiated mice. Lkb1-deficient HSCs,
   but not AMPK-deficient HSCs, exhibited defects in centrosomes and
   mitotic spindles in culture, and became aneuploid. Lkb1 is therefore
   required for HSC maintenance through AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent
   mechanisms, revealing differences in metabolic and cell-cycle regulation
   between HSCs and some other haematopoietic progenitors.}},

Title = {{Development of crystallographic preferred orientation and microstructure
   during plastic deformation of natural coarse-grained quartz veins}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The microstructure and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of
   quartz were quantified in 17 samples of natural monomineralic tabular
   veins. The veins opened and were deformed, up to shear strain gamma >
   15, in a small temperature window (about 25 degrees C) above 500 degrees
   C, as established by Ti-in-quartz thermometry. The veins filled a set of
   fractures within the Adamello tonalite (southern Alps, Italy) and
   localized homogeneous simple shear during postmagmatic cooling. The
   local (square millimeter scale) and bulk (square centimeter) CPO were
   investigated by computer-integrated polarization microscopy (CIP) and
   X-ray texture goniometry. Weakly deformed veins (WDV: gamma < 1) consist
   of millimeter- to centimeter-sized crystals with a strong CPO showing a
   c-axis girdle slightly inclined, mostly with the shear sense, to the
   foliation (XY) plane and a strong maximum close to the lineation (X).
   Moderately deformed veins (MDV: 2 < gamma < 3) consist of elongated
   nonrecrystallized ribbon grains and most have a CPO showing a strong Y
   maximum of c axes some with weak extension into a YZ girdle. Strongly
   deformed veins (SDV: gamma = 4 to 15) are pervasively to completely
   recrystallized to fine (34-40 mm grain size) aggregates with a strong
   CPO similar to that of MDV. The slip systems during plastic deformation
   were dominantly prism < a > with subordinate rhomb and basal < a > slip.
   Recrystallization occurred rather abruptly for 3 < gamma < 4. In
   contrast to dislocation creep experiments in quartz (and other
   minerals), a steady-state recrystallized fabric is achieved at early
   stages of deformation (gamma approximate to 4) as there is no evidence,
   with increasing strain, of strengthening of the CPO, of rotation of the
   fabric skeleton, or of change in grain size. WDV represent weakly
   deformed relicts of veins with an initial CPO believed to have developed
   during crystal growth but unsuitably oriented for prism < a > slip
   during subsequent shear. MDV and SDV appear to derive from veins
   different from WDV, where the vein crystals grew with orientation
   favorable for prism < a > slip. The relationship between the initial
   growth CPO and the kinematic framework suggests that veins opened at a
   temperature close to that at which there is a switch between the
   activity of prism < c > and prism < a > slip, with the temperature of
   growth causing growth of crystals well oriented for slip. The initial
   CPO of veins, from which quartz mylonites are commonly derived, plays a
   critical role in the fabric evolution. The strong growth-and
   strain-induced CPOs of these sheared veins inhibited significant
   reworking during lower temperature stages of pluton cooling when basal <
   a > slip would have been dominant.}},

Title = {{Targeting the oncogenic protein beta-catenin to enhance chemotherapy
   outcome against solid human cancers}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR CANCER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Beta-catenin is a multifunctional oncogenic protein that
   contributes fundamentally to cell development and biology. Elevation in
   expression and activity of beta-catenin has been implicated in many
   cancers and associated with poor prognosis. Beta-catenin is degraded in
   the cytoplasm by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta) through
   phosphorylation. Cell growth and proliferation is associated with
   beta-catenin translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.
   This laboratory was the first to demonstrate that selenium-containing
   compounds can enhance the efficacy and cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs
   in several preclinical xenograft models. These data provided the basis
   to identify mechanism of selenium action focusing on beta-catenin as a
   target. This study was designed to: (1) determine whether
   pharmacological doses of methylseleninic acid (MSeA) have inhibitory
   effects on the level and the oncogenic activity of beta-catenin, (2)
   investigate the kinetics and the mechanism of beta-catenin inhibition,
   and (3) confirm that inhibition of beta-catenin would lead to enhanced
   cytotoxicity of standard chemotherapeutic drugs.
   Results: In six human cancer cell lines, the inhibition of total and
   nuclear expression of beta-catenin by MSeA was dose and time dependent.
   The involvement of GSK-3 beta in the degradation of beta-catenin was
   cell type dependent (GSK-3 beta-dependent in HT-29, whereas GSK-3
   beta-independent in HCT-8). However, the pronounced inhibition of
   beta-catenin by MSeA was independent of various drug treatments and was
   not reversed after combination therapy. Knockout of beta-catenin by
   ShRNA and its inhibition by MSeA yielded similar enhancement of
   cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs. Collectively, the generated data
   demonstrate that b-catenin is a target of MSeA and its inhibition
   resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that beta-catenin, a molecule
   associated with drug resistance, is a target of selenium and its
   inhibition is associated with increased multiple drugs cytotoxicity in
   various human cancers. Further, degradation of beta-catenin by GSK-3
   beta is not a general mechanism but is cell type dependent.}},

Title = {{Disentangling uncertainties in distributed hydrological modeling using
   multiplicative error models and sequential data assimilation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The quantification of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling is a difficult
   task, as it arises from a combination of physical measurement errors,
   errors due to different temporal or spatial scales, and errors in the
   mathematical description of hydrologic processes. This paper presents an
   approach to infer during a calibration process the statistical
   properties of the principal error sources, namely, parameter,
   precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and structural model
   uncertainty, by means of sequential data assimilation (SDA). We perform
   SDA using a particle filter that combines stochastic universal
   resampling and kernel smoothing with local shrinkage to improve its
   performance in comparison to traditional filters. Precipitation,
   potential evapotranspiration, and structural model uncertainty are
   incorporated into the calibration process using multiplicative error
   models. The particle filter is applied to a large-scale distributed
   model of the Rhine River to demonstrate its usefulness when
   characterizing error sources. Diagnostic checks and a synthetic case
   study show that the posterior distributions can be considered as
   reliable. The posterior multiplier distributions are used to identify
   whether a systematic bias exists and to illustrate that uncertainty from
   those sources can be reduced significantly in comparison to the prior
   assumptions adopted. Evaluating the predictive uncertainty shows that
   the overall error in hydrologic models is sufficiently characterized by
   the different error sources used here. Results indicate, however, that
   the assumptions taken in the output error model and the simplifications
   of the multiplicative models do not always hold in practice. Therefore,
   more sophisticated error models and a better quantification of the
   discharge measurement error are required to further improve
   characterization of error sources.}},

Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{693-698}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Objective Population studies have consistently found that shorter sleep
   durations are associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease
   particularly among women Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived
   anti-inflammatory hormone that is related to cardiovascular disease risk
   We hypothesized that sleep restriction would reduce adiponectin levels
   in healthy young adults
   Methods 74 healthy adults (57\% men 63\% African American mean age 299
   years) completed 2 nights of baseline sleep at 10 h time in bed (TIB)
   per night followed by 5 nights of sleep restricted to 4 h TIB per night.
   An additional 8 participants were randomized to a control group that
   received 10 h TIB per night throughout the study Plasma adiponectin
   levels were measured following the second night of baseline sleep and
   the fifth night of sleep restriction or control sleep
   Results Sleep restriction resulted in a decrease in plasma adiponectin
   levels among Caucasian women (Z =-2 19 p = 0 028) but an increase among
   African American women (Z = 2 73 p = 0 006) No significant effects of
   sleep restriction on adiponectin levels were found among men A 2 x 2
   between-group analysis of covariance on adiponectin change scores
   controlling for BMI confirmed significant interactions between sleep
   restriction and race/ethnicity {[}F(1 66) = 13 73 p<0 001] as well as
   among sleep restriction race/ethnicity and sex {[}F(1 66) = 4 27 p = 0

   Conclusions Inflammatory responses to sleep loss appear to be moderated
   by sex and race/ethnicity observed decreases in adiponectin following
   sleep restriction may be one avenue by which reduced sleep duration

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate time trends in socioeconomic inequalities in
   cause specific neonatal mortality in order to assess changing patterns
   in mortality due to different causes, particularly prematurity, and
   identify key areas of focus for future intervention strategies.
   Design Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting England.
   Participants All neonatal deaths in singleton infants born between 1
   January 1997 and 31 December 2007.
   Main outcome measure Cause specific neonatal mortality per 10 000 births
   by deprivation tenth (deprivation measured with UK index of multiple
   deprivation 2004 at super output area level).
   Results 18 524 neonatal deaths occurred in singleton infants born in the
   11 year study period. Neonatal mortality fell between 1997-9 and 2006-7
   (from 31.4 to 25.1 per 10 000 live births). The relative deprivation gap
   (ratio of mortality in the most deprived tenth compared with the least
   deprived tenth) increased from 2.08 in 1997-9 to 2.68 in 2003-5, before
   a fall to 2.35 in 2006-7. The most common causes of death were
   immaturity and congenital anomalies. Mortality due to immaturity before
   24 weeks' gestation did not decrease over time and showed the widest
   relative deprivation gap (2.98 in 1997-9; 4.14 in 2003-5; 3.16 in
   2006-7). Mortality rates for all other causes fell over time. For
   congenital anomalies, immaturity, and accidents and other specific
   causes, the relative deprivation gap widened between 1997-9 and 2003-5,
   before a slight fall in 2006-7. For intrapartum events and sudden infant
   deaths (only 13.5\% of deaths) the relative deprivation gap narrowed
   slightly.
   Conclusions Almost 80\% of the relative deprivation gap in all cause
   mortality was explained by premature birth and congenital anomalies. To
   reduce socioeconomic inequalities in mortality, a change in focus is
   needed to concentrate on these two influential causes of death.
   Understanding the link between deprivation and preterm birth should be a
   major research priority to identify interventions to reduce preterm
   birth.}},

Abstract = {{We study the finite-temperature transition to the m=1/2 magnetization
   plateau in a model of interacting S=1/2 spins with longer-range
   interactions and strong exchange anisotropy on the geometrically
   frustrated Shastry-Sutherland lattice. This model was shown to capture
   the qualitative features of the field-induced magnetization plateaus in
   the rare-earth tetraboride, TmB4. Our results show that the transition
   to the plateau state occurs via two successive transitions with the
   two-dimensional Ising universality class, when the quantum exchange
   interactions are finite, whereas a single phase transition takes place
   in the purely Ising limit. To better understand these behaviors, we
   perform Monte Carlo simulations of the classical generalized four-state
   chiral clock model and compare the phase diagrams of the two models.
   Finally, we estimate a parameter set that can explain the magnetization
   curves observed in TmB4. The magnetic properties and critical behavior
   of the finite-temperature transition to the m=1/2 plateau state are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Hard x-ray diffraction microscopy enables us to observe thick objects at
   high spatial resolution. The resolution of this method is limited, in
   principle, by only the x-ray wavelength and the largest scattering angle
   recorded. As the resolution approaches the wavelength, the thickness
   effect of objects plays a significant role in x-ray diffraction
   microscopy. In this paper, we report high-resolution hard x-ray
   diffraction microscopy for thick objects. We used highly focused
   coherent x rays with a wavelength of similar to 0.1 nm as an incident
   beam and measured the diffraction patterns of a similar to 150-nm-thick
   silver nanocube at the scattering angle of similar to 3 degrees. We
   observed a characteristic contrast of the coherent diffraction pattern
   due to only the thickness effect and collected the diffraction patterns
   at nine incident angles so as to obtain information on a cross section
   of Fourier space. We reconstructed a pure projection image by the
   iterative phasing method from the patched diffraction pattern. The edge
   resolution of the reconstructed image was similar to 2 nm, which was the
   highest resolution so far achieved by x-ray microscopy. The present
   study provides us with a method for quantitatively observing thick
   samples at high resolution by hard x-ray diffraction microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{First-principles electronic structure calculations of styrene lines on
   H-covered Si(100) show that phenyl ring orientations at chain ends are
   fluxional, favoring structures with the terminal ring arranged
   perpendicular to the molecular line. Simulated scanning tunneling
   microscopy images show that the tunneling current depends strongly on
   the phenyl ring orientation, because it controls the coupling between
   the charged dangling bond and the styrene pi system. The
   perpendicular-ring orientation shows higher conductivity than when all
   rings are parallel, increasing the apparent height of the molecule at
   the end of the row. This is consistent with experimental observations,
   suggesting that STM images provide evidence for the perpendicular-ring
   structure. Experiments have also shown that on highly n-doped surfaces,
   where the dangling bond is negatively charged, an electrostatic field
   modulates the conductivity of the styrene molecules as a function of
   distance from the dangling bond. This effect is also reproduced in the
   simulated images. This ``slope effect{''} can be quantitatively modeled
   by a simple surface screening model, which provides some new insight
   into the structure of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon-coated SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple one-pot
   hydrothermal treatment. During the hydrothermal process, SnO2 was formed
   by the hydrolysis of fin(l) dichloride dihydrate (SnCl2 center dot
   2H(2)O) in alkali solution, while sucrose was used as the carbon source
   to form the coated polysaccharide shell on the SnO2 nanoparticles. In
   the obtained carbon-coated SnO2 nanoparticles, SnO2 nanocrystals with a
   diameter of 4 nm were observed to be homogeneously dispersed in the
   particles. After calcination, the product exhibited improved lithium
   storage properties, as compared to pure SnO2 nanoparticles. The
   carbon-coated SnO2 nanoparticles exhibit 430 mAh g(-1) reversible
   capacities after 100 cycles and an average capacity fading of 0.2\% per
   cycle after the 20th cycle. The good electrochemical performances of the
   carbon-coated SnO2 nanoparticles indicate that the obtained carbon shell
   can effectively increase the stability of the active materials and
   improve the cycling performance of oxide-based anode materials for
   lithium-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider has collected several
   hundred million cosmic ray events during 2008 and 2009. These data were
   used to commission the Muon Spectrometer and to study the performance of
   the trigger and tracking chambers, their alignment, the detector control
   system, the data acquisition and the analysis programs. We present the
   performance in the relevant parameters that determine the quality of the
   muon measurement. We discuss the single element efficiency, resolution
   and noise rates, the calibration method of the detector response and of
   the alignment system, the track reconstruction efficiency and the
   momentum measurement. The results show that the detector is close to the
   design performance and that the Muon Spectrometer is ready to detect
   muons produced in high energy proton-proton collisions.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunity egalitarians support rich-to-poor redistribution whenever
   this allows for the compensation of income disparities due to
   non-responsible choices (circumstances). In this paper we focus on the
   measurement of opportunity inequality within Roemer's (Philos Public Aff
   22:146-166, 1993) pragmatic theory where a disjoint and exhaustive
   partition rule is assumed such that individuals within the same
   population can be grouped depending on the sole circumstances. Given
   entropy-based, deprivation-based and welfaristic inequality
   decomposition procedures, we show that the between-group Gini component
   from Dagum's decomposition is the only well known between-group
   inequality index satisfying the Pigou-Dalton principle of transfer as
   reformulated for opportunity egalitarianism.}},

Abstract = {{RAPD markers were used to investigate population genetic parameters of
   an endangered partridge, Alectoris chukar, in four areas of Iran, as a
   part of a genetic conservation program. The aim of this study was to
   analyze the genetic similarity among these populations. Blood samples
   from 75 birds were used for DNA extraction and RAPD-PCR analysis of 67
   loci, with 28 polymorphic bands (41.79\%). The populations of
   Kalat-e-Nader and Mashhad were found to be closely related, as were the
   Torbat-e-Jaam and the Quchan populations. Mean heterozygosity for all
   populations was 0.4405 +/- A 0.0755. The results indicate that chukar
   partridge genetic diversity in Khorasan-e-Razavi province is sufficient
   and the amount of gene flow among populations is acceptable.}},

Title = {{Effect of bleaching versus repolishing on colour and surface topography
   of stained resin composite}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN DENTAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{390-398}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ozonated
   gel, carbamide peroxide bleaching agent and polishing paste on the
   colour and surface topography of stained resin composite.
   Methods: Ninety disc-shaped resin composite specimens were used in this
   study. They were randomly divided into three groups of 30 specimens each
   according to the immersion solutions used, i.e., tea, cola or artificial
   saliva. Each group was further subdivided into three equal subgroups (n
   = 10) according to the type of whitening treatment applied; 30\%
   carbamide peroxide, ozonated KY gel or polishing paste. Colour and
   surface roughness was measured at baseline, after immersion, also
   following whitening procedures by using a stereomicroscope. The results
   were recorded, tabulated and statistically analysed.
   Results: The colour values of artificial saliva displayed the highest
   statistically significant mean colour difference compared to cola and
   tea. However, there was no statistically significant difference in
   surface roughness. Also, a superior whitening effect was demonstrated
   with ozonated gel. Ozonated gel showed statistically significant lowest
   roughness compared to both carbamide peroxide and polishing paste.
   Conclusions: Immersion solutions have a positive influence on the colour
   of resin composite. Also, ozonated gel is an efficient bleaching agent
   with the least adverse effect on surface roughness.}},

Abstract = {{P>This paper investigates the transmission of monetary policy to the
   real economy after the adoption of bank reforms in emerging market
   economies (EMEs). The Egyptian case is empirically studied to test the
   efficacy of the banking sector as a transmission agent subsequent to the
   banking reforms that extended from 1991 to 2009. The structural vector
   autoregressive methodology is employed to investigate the impact of the
   interest rate and foreign exchange rate channels on output and
   inflation. The results of the study reveal several interactions among
   the two types of channels. Second, interest rate intervention proves to
   have substantial effects on output, but less on inflation. Third,
   exchange rate intervention has some effects on inflation, but less on
   output. Thus, both transmission channels have showed superior
   effectiveness after the banking reform. This indicates that the Central
   Bank of Egypt should not continue to depend on the interest rate channel
   alone, but has to additionally utilize the exchange rate channel in
   order to successfully achieve inflation targeting that has been its
   prime goal since 2003 and even more after the global food crisis of
   2007/8. This ruling could prove functional when conducting monetary
   policy in EMEs of similar circumstances to Egypt.}},

Title = {{The MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit: Design, training, and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{79}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Medical records must often be stripped of patient identifiers,
   or de-identified, before being shared. De-identification by humans is
   time-consuming, and existing software is limited in its generality. The
   open source MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit (MIST) provides an
   environment to support rapid tailoring of automated de-identification to
   different document types, using automatically learned classifiers to
   de-identify and protect sensitive information.
   Methods: MIST was evaluated with four classes of patient records from
   the Vanderbilt University Medical Center: discharge summaries,
   laboratory reports, letters, and order summaries. We trained and tested
   MIST on each class of record separately, as well as on pooled sets of
   records. We measured precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy at the
   word level for the detection of patient identifiers as designated by the
   HIPAA Safe Harbor Rule.
   Results: MIST was applied to medical records that differed in the
   amounts and types of protected health information (PHI): lab reports
   contained only two types of PHI (dates, names) compared to discharge
   summaries, which were much richer. Performance of the de-identification
   tool depended on record class; F-measure results were 0.996 for order
   summaries, 0.996 for discharge summaries, 0.943 for letters and 0.934
   for laboratory reports. Experiments suggest the tool requires several
   hundred training exemplars to reach an F-measure of at least 0.9.
   Conclusions: The MIST toolkit makes possible the rapid tailoring of
   automated de-identification to particular document types and supports
   the transition of the de-identification software to medical end users,
   avoiding the need for developers to have access to original medical
   records. We are making the MIST toolkit available under an open source
   license to encourage its application to diverse data sets at multiple
   institutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents a general technique for the synthesis of
   parallel-connected two-port networks. This is based on the even-and
   odd-mode admittances of a standard Chebyshev network. The expressions
   for the even/odd-mode admittance are used to synthesize the low-pass
   network into branches of sub-networks connected in parallel between the
   source and the load. These together will have the same characteristics
   as a ladder network. It is also shown how a filter of a particular order
   will have the same parallel branch topology regardless of how many
   transmission zeros are used in the filter's transfer function. This
   design technique can be beneficial for various implementation techniques
   such as multilayer substrate and dual-mode resonators. Examples of
   fourth-and sixth-order degree networks with various numbers of

Abstract = {{A growing body of literature addresses the linkages between religion and
   mental health. While the preponderance of the empirical evidence points
   to positive effects that religious variables have on mental health, less
   is known about the specific mechanisms that may explain this recurrent

   state of Texas, a social capital perspective is applied and ordered
   logistic regression techniques used to determine the impact of
   religion/religiosity variables on mental health. Specifically, the study
   contrasts individualistic and collectivist forms of religious expression
   and argues that it is the nature of the religious phenomenon under
   consideration and not religiosity per se which has the most direct
   impact on mental health. Findings suggest that collectivist religious
   practices like church attendance and participation in church related
   activities are linked to positive mental health outcomes. Conversely,
   individualistic practices, as measured by consumption of religious
   media, prayer, and reading of scripture, seem to be associated with
   lower measures of overall mental health. Implications for the religious

Abstract = {{We have surgically treated 771 patients for thoracic and
   thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms since 1983. Our primary effort has
   been to develop experimentally validated strategies to reduce
   paraplegia, renal failure, and mortality in these high-risk patients.
   This approach has led to a spinal cord protection protocol that has
   reduced paraplegia risk by 80\% (observed/expected ratio 0.19) with the
   use of cerebral spinal fluid drainage, moderate hypothermia (31 degrees
   C-33 degrees C), endorphin receptor antagonist (naloxone), and
   thiopental burst suppression while optimizing mean arterial pressure
   (>90 mm Hg) and cardiac index. The elective mortality rate is 2.80\%
   (17\% for acute patients), and with rapid renal cooling for renal
   protection, only 0.88\% required permanent dialysis. These results were
   achieved without the use of assisted circulation. We have reattached
   intercostal arteries since 2005 using preoperative magnetic resonance
   angiographic localization, but it remains unclear whether intercostal
   reimplantation reduces paraplegia risk, as we had initially proposed. We
   strongly believe that a consistent anesthetic and postoperative care
   protocol uniformly built and applied around these principles greatly
   enhances our surgical outcomes. We also show that improved outcomes with
   assisted circulation and hypothermic arrest in treatment of
   thoracoabdominal aortic disease follow similar principles of spinal cord
   and end-organ protection. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2010; 140:S136-41)}},

   subdistribution of corank one in the largest distribution in the

   that a one-parameter deformation of a special multi-flag on a compact

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1078-1083}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Slags from the production of high-alloyed steel contain both chemically
   bound chromium (mainly as Cr(2)O(3)) in the mineral fraction and
   elemental chromium in the metallic remainders. Thermochemical post
   treatment of the slag in an electric arc furnace under reducing
   conditions enables the nearly complete recovery of the total amount of
   chromium in form of a metallic alloy. The best results were achieved by
   resistance melting (submerged electrodes) with addition of a reducing
   agent into the melt. The efficiencies of the reducing agents carbon,
   aluminium, silicon (as ferrosilicon) and silicon carbide were
   investigated and compared. As aluminium is the strongest reducing agent,
   it is less selective and reduces much more SiO(2) than Cr(2)O(3). While
   SiC shows only low reactivity because of its high thermal resistance,
   carbon and silicon had the highest reducing potentials: More than 97\%
   of the chemically bound chromium can be recovered by application of
   these reducing agents. Due to the high temperature required for the
   reduction of the chromium compounds, the reduction of SiO(2) as an
   undesired side reaction cannot be avoided. However, compared with
   mechanical procedures that are limited to the recovery of the metallic
   remainders, the total chromium recovery can be significantly increased
   by the described reductive melting procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The roads of incoming information to the US higher education system
   about the Bologna Process are varied and numerous. They include not only
   the on-line and traditional trade press, but also conferences of
   national organisations. Whether anyone remembers much of that
   information, on the other hand, is an open question, as a limited survey
   undertaken by the author reveals. The mainstream media are not
   interested in Bologna, governance authorities are exclusively focused on
   internal issues, and the US research literature on Bologna, while
   growing, is still minimal. However, some of the research was picked up
   by the Lumina Foundation for Education, which sponsored the first US
   experiment with Bologna-related reforms through a Tuning project
   involving three state systems and six disciplines; and a second round of
   this venture should begin soon. Out of this effort came Lumina's
   sponsorship of the first rounds of discussions concerning the potential
   for a national degree qualifications framework. This evolution indicates
   another mode of communication in the US system: a combination of
   personal relations and private foundations with a bold enough agenda to
   elevate and move both Bologna knowledge and practice to the centre of US
   consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is one of the major dermatologic
   conditions for which phototherapy continues to be a successful and
   valuable treatment modality. The beneficial role of ultraviolet (UV)
   light on CTCL is suggested by the observation that lesions generally
   occur on non-sun-exposed areas. Currently, a number of light sources are
   available, namely broadband UVB, psoralen and UVA (PUVA), narrowband
   UVB, and long-wave UV (UVA1) and selection of the specific modality is
   generally based on the stage of the disease. The efficacy of narrowband
   UVB is limited to the patch stage, while PUVA is used for stage IB and
   IIA where widespread patches or plaques take place. Case reports or
   small series show the efficacy of UVA1 in the treatment of early-stage
   CTCL. Long term remission with vairous phototherapy modalities has been
   reported in CTCL while relapses are also common. The present review will
   focus on the efficacy of the different phototherapeutic modalities in
   the treatment of CTCL.}},

Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Transthyretin is a serum and cerebrospinal fluid protein synthesized
   early in development by the liver, choroid plexus and several other
   tissues. It is a carrier protein for the antioxidant vitamins, retinol,
   and thyroid hormones. Transthyretin helps internalize thyroxine and
   retinol-binding protein into cells by binding to megalin, which is a
   multi-ligand receptor expressed on the luminal surface of various
   epithelia. We investigated the expression of transthyretin and its
   receptor megalin in the human skin; however, their expression pattern in
   the hair follicle is still to be elucidated. This study addresses this
   issue and tests the hypothesis that ``the expression of transthyretin
   and megalin undergoes hair follicle cycle-dependent changes.{''} A total
   of 50 normal human scalp skin biopsies were examined (healthy females,
   53-62 years) using immunofluorescence staining methods and real-time
   PCR. In each case, 50 hair follicles were analyzed (35, 10, and 5
   follicles in anagen, catagen, and telogen, respectively). Transthyretin
   and megalin were prominently expressed in the human scalp skin and hair
   follicles, on both gene and protein levels. The concentrations of
   transthyretin and megalin were 0.12 and 0.03 Ul/ml, respectively, as
   indicated by PCR. The expression showed hair follicle cycle-associated
   changes i.e., strong expression during early and mature anagen, very
   weak expression during catagen and moderate expression during telogen.
   The expression values of these proteins in the anagen were statistically
   significantly higher than those of either catagen or telogen hair
   follicles (P a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001). This study
   provides the first morphologic indication that transthyretin and megalin
   are variably expressed in the human scalp skin and hair follicles. It
   also reports variations in the expression of these proteins during hair
   follicle cycling. The clinical ramifications of these findings are open
   for further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Development of advanced ceramics such as silicon carbide has gained
   significant importance because of their desirable properties. However,
   their engineering applications are still limited owing to the
   limitations in developing damage-free and economical machining
   techniques. It is often desired to increase the machining rate to
   improve productivity while maintaining the desired surface integrity.
   The success of this approach, however, requires a fundamental
   understanding of the material removal and damage formation mechanism in
   grinding. In this paper, high removal rate grinding of silicon carbide
   was investigated with respect to material removal and basic grinding
   parameters using a diamond grinding wheel. The results showed that the
   material removal was primarily due to the microfracture and grain
   dislodgement under the grinding conditioned selected. For grain
   dislodgement removal mode, the relationship for the removal rate in
   scratching based on a simple fracture mechanics analysis has been
   established. This research provides valuable insights into the surface
   and subsurface integrity and material removal mechanism during high
   removal rate grinding of silicon carbide. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

   treatments on biomechanical variables were assessed using repeated
   measures analysis of variance and least square means (P <.05).
   Results
   The ventral slot procedure increased range of motion at the treated VMU.
   Plate fixation decreased range of motion, increased stiffness, and
   decreased energy at the treated VMU. No changes were observed at
   adjacent VMUs. None of the screws penetrated the vertebral canal. Mean
   (+/- SD) yield bending moment of plate stabilized, slotted spines was
   15.6 +/- 4.6 N m.
   Conclusion
   LCP fixation with monocortical screws stabilized the canine cervical
   spine.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: We describe the newly generated DAK-PAX5 monoclonal
   antibody raised against a fixation-resistant epitope of the human
   PAX5/BSAP molecule.
   Materials and Methods: Following Western-blot, absorption, and
   chess-board titration tests, and optimization of antigen-retrieval and
   detection methods, DAK-Pax5 was used in parallel with a reference
   antibody (clone 24) on tissue microarrays (TMAs) constructed from normal
   human and animal tissues and from hematologic and nonhematologic human
   malignancies. Such TMAs were also tested with an anti-PAX2 antibody.
   Results: DAK-Pax5 reacted with normal human and animal B-cells and with
   460/473 B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (BNHLs). All
   plasmacytomas/plasmablastic tumors (n = 13) and T/NK-cell neoplasms (n =
   264) turned out consistently negative as did acute myelogenous
   leukaemias (n = 19) except 2 carrying t(8;21). Positivity was found in
   6/6 and 155/169 lymphocyte predominant and classical HLs, respectively,
   although the staining intensity varied through cases. Among 521
   nonhematologic malignancies, DAK-Pax5 reacted with 22/399 carcinomas
   (4/11 neuroendocrine, 2/4 Merkel-cell, 4/21 prostatic, 1/11 urothelial,
   1/26 renal, 2/12 cervical squamous-cell, 3/13 ovarian, and 5/75
   colonic). When compared with clone 24, DAK-Pax5 produced a stronger
   positivity in most if not all B-NHLs and HLs. No cross-reactivity with
   the anti-PAX2 antibody was recorded.
   Discussion: DAK-Pax5 represents a new reliable tool for diagnostics and
   research.}},

Abstract = {{While both 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) are
   neuroprotective in several experimental paradigms, P4 also counteracts
   E2 neuroprotective effects. We recently reported that a 4-h treatment of
   cultured hippocampal slices with P4 following a prolonged (20 h)
   treatment with E2 eliminated estrogenic neuroprotection against NMDA
   toxicity and induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
   expression. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the same
   treatment on levels of estrogen receptors, ER alpha and ER beta, and
   BDNF using a similar paradigm. E2 treatment resulted in elevated ER beta
   mRNA and protein levels, did not modify ER alpha mRNA, but increased ER
   alpha protein levels, and increased BDNF mRNA levels. P4 reversed
   E2-elicited increases in ER beta mRNA and protein levels, in ER alpha
   protein levels, and in BDNF mRNA levels. Experiments with an ER
   beta-specific antagonist, PHTPP, and specific agonists of ER alpha and
   ER beta, propylpyrazoletriol and diarylpropionitrile, respectively,
   indicated that E2-mediated neuroprotection against NMDA toxicity was, at
   least in part, mediated via ER beta receptor. In support of this
   conclusion, E2 did not protect against NMDA toxicity in cultured
   hippocampal slices from ER beta-/- mice. Thus, E2-mediated
   neuroprotection against NMDA toxicity may be because of estrogenic
   induction of BDNF via its ER beta receptor, and P4-mediated inhibition
   of E2 neuroprotective effects treatment to P4-induced down-regulation of
   ER beta and BDNF.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of 56 Pinus species in Mexico was modelled with MAXENT.
   The pine species were classified as threatened according to IUCN
   criteria. Our aim was to ascertain whether or not threatened pine
   species were adequately represented in protected areas. Almost 70\% of
   the species had less than 10\% of their modelled distribution area
   protected. None of the pine species reached their representation
   targets. Threatened pine species were less widely distributed, occurred
   at lower maximum elevations, and were less well represented in protected
   areas than other pine species. The results suggest that the present
   system of protected areas in Mexico fails to protect pine species
   adequately. Conservation targets should be especially directed to
   species with narrow distributions which occur at low altitudes, such as

Abstract = {{Field populations of adult whiteflies, Bemisia tabaci, from Pakistan
   were monitored from 1992 to 2007 for their susceptibility to seven
   organophosphate and three carbamate insecticides using a leaf-dip
   method. Malathion, quinalphos and chlorpyrifos generally exhibited no or
   a very low level of resistance in B. tabaci over a 16-year monitoring
   period. Resistance to profenofos, triazophos, parathion-methyl and
   ethion was usually low to high up to 1995, and then it dropped to very
   low levels during 1996-2004. Resistance levels again picked up from low
   to moderate levels for triazophos during 2005-2007, for parathion-methyl
   during 2003-2007, and for ethion in 2006. Among carbamates, thiodicarb
   resistance was high during 1994-1996, which dropped to moderate levels
   in 1997 and 1998 and to very low levels during 1999-2001, but again
   increased from low to high levels during 2002-2007. Methomyl resistance
   was moderate in 1994 and 1995, which dropped to very low levels during
   1996-2002, and then increased to low levels during 2003-2007.
   Butocarboxim resistance remained very low during 1994-2003 and then
   increased from low to high levels during 2004-2007. The insecticides
   exhibiting no, very low or low resistance, and no cross-resistance among

Abstract = {{Preparation of spatial data for Geographic Information System (GIS)
   simultaneously during feature digitizing process from photogrammetric
   models reduces data editing phases after feature digitizing process.
   Therefore, the problems, caused by separating spatial data production
   process from preparation of this data, are overcome as far as possible.
   To achieve this purpose, specialty and expertise required for spatial
   data structuring and preparation for GIS, should be available in an
   interface system which establishes a direct connection between
   photogrammetric and GIS systems. In this case, when a user digitizes a
   feature from a photogrammetric model, decision making process about the
   method of editing, structuring, layering, and storing of the feature in
   GIS database, can be carried out by such an interface system. Thus,
   according to the capabilities of expert systems for modeling the
   knowledge and deduction methods of experts, generating an expert
   interface system between photogrammetric and GIS systems, offers a
   suitable solution for this integration. In this paper, the capabilities
   of expert systems for intelligent spatial data structuring and
   preparation simultaneously during feature digitizing process from
   photogrammetric models, have been investigated. Also, design,
   implementation and test of an expert interface system for integration of
   photogrammetric and GIS systems in order to take advantages of
   capabilities of both systems simultaneously as one integrated system,
   has been described. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, a combined heat and power plant for cogeneration
   purposes that produces 50 MW of electricity and 33.3 kg/s of saturated
   steam at 13 bar is optimized using genetic algorithm. The design
   parameters of the plant considered are compressor pressure ratio
   (r(AC)), compressor isentropic efficiency (eta(comp)), gas turbine
   isentropic efficiency (eta(GT)), combustion chamber inlet temperature
   (T-3), and turbine inlet temperature (TIT). In addition, to optimally
   find the optimum design parameters, an exergoeconomic approach is
   employed. A new objective function, representing total cost rate of the
   system product including cost rate of each equipment (sum of the
   operating cost, related to the fuel consumption) and cost rate of
   environmental impact (NOx and CO) is considered. Finally, the optimal
   values of decision variables are obtained by minimizing the objective
   function using evolutionary genetic algorithm. Moreover, the influence
   of changes in the demanded power on various design parameters are
   parametrically studied for 50, 60, 70 MW of net power output. The
   results show that for a specific unit cost of fuel, the values of design
   parameters increase, as the required, with net power output increases.
   Also, the variations of the optimal decision variables versus unit cost
   of fuel reveal that by increasing the fuel cost, the pressure ratio,
   r(AC), compressor isentropic efficiency, eta(AC), turbine isentropic
   efficiency, eta(GT). and turbine inlet temperature (TIT) increase. (C)

   combination between an ant colony algorithm, a heuristic algorithm and a
   local search procedure is proposed and presented. The hybrid approach is
   to use artificial ants to construct solutions by applying a stochastic
   greedy rule based on the Gupta's heuristic and pheromone trails. A local
   search is then performed to improve the performance quality of
   constructed solutions. Once all ants have terminated their generations,
   the pheromone trails are modified according to a global updating rule.
   The proposed algorithm is applied to benchmark problems taken from the
   literature and compared with other metaheuristics. Computational
   experiments are given to demonstrate the superiority of the algorithm in
   the quality of solution and CPU time.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine the pattern of skeletal dysplasias in Qatar
   population and to assess the accuracy of prenatal diagnosis and
   prognosis.
   Methods. This was a retrospective descriptive study of 30 women with
   high risk for skeletal dysplasias. The recruited women were submitted to
   clinical assessment, ultrasound scanning using 2-dimensional,
   3-dimensional/4-dimensional and colour Doppler technique with possible
   molecular diagnosis. The findings were compared with the postnatal or
   postmortem assessments. Final diagnosis was based on clinical
   examination, skeletal survey, autopsy and molecular testing as deemed
   necessary.
   Results. Thirty cases of skeletal dysplasia were antenatally diagnosed
   over 4-year period with family history in few cases. Among many entities
   thanatophoric dysplasia showed largest prevalence {[}7(23\%)]. Prenatal
   diagnosis was accurate in 76\% of foetuses while the first indicator of
   abnormality was a suspected anomaly found during routine ultrasound
   assessment in most cases {[}17(56\%)]. Prediction of lethality based on
   ultrasound findings was 100\% accurate.
   Conclusions. This study confirmed the possibility of good prenatal
   diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias present among Qatar population.
   Diagnosis based on ultrasound assessment will improve by adding
   molecular techniques with positive impact on prenatal care.}},

Abstract = {{Emissions of carbon oxides, particularly carbon dioxide, from fossil
   fuels have an enormous environmental and economical impact on coal
   (under atmospheric storage) utilization as a fuel for utility plants.
   Therefore, a deeper understanding of the processes controlling their
   formation is crucial. This work investigates the effect of coal rank on
   the carbon oxides emissions. It offers a new perspective on the subject
   as it encompasses three classes of coals (bituminous, sub-bituminous,
   and lignite) and can shed light on the specific coal parameters that
   effect the formation of carbon oxides at low temperatures. It is
   suggested that the main product carbon dioxide is not only a direct
   product of the consumed oxygen but that its formation is also dependent
   on the pre-existing O content in the coal macromolecule. The effect of
   coal rank on the formation of carbon oxides during low temperatures at
   the coals surface is discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) has been suggested as an indirect
   tool for selecting plants having higher water use efficiency (WUE) and
   yield potential. Enhancing WUE is an important breeding objective as
   water scarcity is increasing with every passing day. This study was
   undertaken to assess the genotypic variation and relationship between
   leaf, straw, grain Delta, grain yield and WUE in eight aromatic rice
   cultivars grown in lysimeters under three water regimes, in absence of
   drainage and runoff. Highly significant positive correlations were found
   between above-ground biomass and WUEB, and grain yield and WUEG, due to
   the low variation in water consumed by different cultivars. Leaf, straw
   and grain Delta showed a consistent variation across treatments and
   cultivars. Under water stress conditions, both leaf and straw Delta.
   were positively correlated to grain yield and WUEG. In all the water
   treatments, WUEG was positively correlated to harvest index and
   negatively to plant height. All the mutants from Basmati 385 had
   significantly higher Delta. values as compared to the mutants from
   Basmati 370. It was concluded that the new cultivar, Basmati 385,
   represents a better genetic source for Delta improvement than the old
   cultivar, Basmati 370.}},

Abstract = {{An extension of the study of two particle correlations used at RHIC to
   LHC energies (Pb + Pb at root S-NN = 5.5 TeV) is presented. The method
   is based on the two-dimensional Fourier Transform used to calculate the
   angular autocorrelation function in space. It does not require the
   identification of a leading particle and is, hence, optimized to the

Abstract = {{Advancing research on service quality requires clarifying the
   theoretical conceptualizations and validating an integrated service
   quality model. The purpose of this study is to facilitate and elucidate
   practical issues and decisions related to the development of a
   hierarchical service quality model in mobile health (mHealth) services
   research. Conceptually, it extends theory by reframing service quality
   as a reflective, hierarchical construct and modeling its impact on
   satisfaction, intention to continue using and quality of life.
   Empirically, it confirms that PLS path modeling can be used to estimate
   the parameters of a higher order construct and its association with
   subsequent consequential latent variables in a nomological network. The
   findings of the study show that service quality is the third-order,
   reflective construct model with strong positive effects on satisfaction,
   continuance intentions and quality of life in the context of mHealth
   services. Finally, the study discusses the implications of hierarchical
   service quality modeling in electronic markets and highlights future

Abstract = {{The photodegradation of thin films of poly(para-tert-butylstyrene) with
   265 nm radiation in the presence of oxygen, and as a function of
   irradiation time, has been studied using fluorescence, Fourier
   transform-infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.
   The influence of phthalate and terephthalate plasticizers on
   photo-oxidative degradation was also investigated. Blending with
   phthalate plasticizers was found to cause a higher efficiency of
   degradation than that obtained for doping with terephthalate
   plasticizers. The intensity of absorption was also found to increase
   with time of irradiation and in the intensity of a new absorption band
   at longer wavelength, thus indicating a possibility of photodegradation
   of polymer films. The analysis of the Fourier transform-infrared spectra
   of the irradiated and non-irradiated samples showed an increase in the
   intensities of the carbonyl and hydroxyl regions of the Fourier
   transform-infrared spectra providing evidence for the photodegradation
   as well as the photo-oxidation of polymeric chains. The increase in the
   analyzed ranges is attributed to the formation of alcohols, aliphatic
   ketones and to the increase in the number of polyene structures that
   resulted from hydrogen abstraction during photodegradation reactions.}},

   fluctuation in the concentration of osteocalcin during the 24 h period
   with minimum and maximum levels at 13:00 (01:00 pm) and 18:00 (06:00
   pm), respectively. Slight fluctuation was observed in the concentration
   of BAP with minimum and maximum levels at 01:00 am and 12:00 pm,

Abstract = {{A low dose proniosomal gel containing celecoxib was developed for the
   treatment of osteoarthritis. All the prepared formulations were
   subjected to physicochemical evaluations and anti-inflammatory studies.
   The entrapment was > 90\%. The vesicle shape was determined with the
   help of transmission electron microscopy. The vesicle size,
   size-distribution, and polydispersity studies were performed using
   photon correlation spectroscopy. Anti-inflammatory studies were
   performed using the rat hind-paw oedema induced by carrageenan (1\%
   w/v). The selected proniosomal gel (N1LE3) produced 100\% inhibition of
   paw oedema in rats up to 8 h after carrageenan injection. It produced
   95\% and 92\% inhibition after 12 h and 24 h, respectively. These
   results indicate that proniosomes are a promising carrier for the
   transdermal delivery of celecoxib. Thus celecoxib can be formulated into
   a low dose proniosomal gel that can save the recipient from the adverse
   effects of large doses.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, chemotherapy has been introduced in protocols
   for patients with intracranial germinoma with the objective of reducing
   the volume and the dose of irradiation without compromising survival
   rates. The aim of this work is to critically analyze the pattern of
   relapse in a cohort of patients with nonmetastatic germinoma
   prospectively treated with chemotherapy followed by focal field
   radiation. Data of all germinoma patients registered in the French
   protocol for intracranial germ cell tumors between 1990 and 1999 were
   reviewed. The pattern of relapse, management, and outcome were analyzed
   in 10 of 60 patients who developed a recurrence after initial treatment.
   In 9 patients, the site of recurrence was local or loco-regional,
   notably in the periventricular area for 8. One patient only had isolated
   distant leptomeningeal relapse. The review of the sites of relapse
   suggests that most recurrences could have been avoided with a larger
   ventricular field of radiation. Treatment at first relapse included
   chemotherapy (10 patients), high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell
   transplant (8 patients), and/or radiation therapy (4 patients). Five
   patients experienced a second relapse. At a median follow-up of 72
   months since the first relapse, 8 patients are alive in second or third
   remission. This review identified an excess of periventricular relapses
   when the focal field of radiation is used in the combined management of
   germinoma. These relapses are predominantly marginal or outside
   radiation fields. Ventricular field radiation appears a logical
   alternative to decrease the incidence of such relapses. Future trials
   should aim at better identifying patients who may benefit from local and
   ventricular radiation, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{There is now a growing need to identify various kinds of activities that
   occur in videos. In this paper, we first present a logical language
   called Probabilistic Activity Description Language (PADL) in which users
   can specify activities of interest. We then develop a probabilistic
   framework which assigns to any subvideo of a given video sequence a
   probability that the subvideo contains the given activity, and we
   finally develop two fast algorithms to detect activities within this
   framework. OffPad finds all minimal segments of a video that contain a
   given activity with a probability exceeding a given threshold. In
   contrast, the OnPad algorithm examines a video during playout (rather
   than afterwards as OffPad does) and computes the probability that a
   given activity is occurring (even if the activity is only partially
   complete). Our prototype Probabilistic Activity Detection System (PADS)
   implements the framework and the two algorithms, building on top of
   existing image processing algorithms. We have conducted detailed
   experiments and compared our approach to four different approaches
   presented in the literature. We show that-for complex activity
   definitions-our approach outperforms all the other approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Background The present study was designed to compare the efficacy,
   tolerability and safety of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl when combined
   with propofol during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in children.
   Methods Fifty children aged 3-8 years, the American Society of
   Anesthesiologists status I and II, scheduled for elective extracorporeal
   shock wave lithotripsy were randomly allocated to receive a loading dose
   0.7 mu gkg(-1) over 10 min followed by maintenance infusion 0.3 mu
   gkg(-1)h(-1) of either dexmedetomidine in propofol/dexmedetomidine group
   or fentanyl in propofol/fentanyl group (n=25 each). The target drug
   infusion rates were adjusted to keep the haemodynamics within +/- 20\%
   from the baseline values. All patients received propofol infusion to
   maintain bispectral index values (40-60) throughout the procedure.
   Induction and maintenance doses of propofol were recorded. Total doses
   of both studied drugs were calculated. Perioperative haemodynamics,
   incidence of intraprocedural and postprocedural complications and time
   to first analgesic requirement were recorded.
   Results The propofol requirement was significantly lower in the
   propofol/dexmedetomidine group than that in propofol/fentanyl group
   during induction and maintenance of anaesthesia (P<0.0001). Total doses
   of fentanyl and dexmedetomidine were 0.961 (0.1) mu gkg(-1) and 0.925
   (0.07) mu gkg(-1), respectively. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate
   were significantly decreased compared to the baseline throughout the
   procedure in both groups and increased significantly relative to both
   baseline and the other group at 30 min in the propofol/fentanyl group
   and 60 min in the propofol/dexmedetomidine group in the recovery area
   (P<0.05). In propofol/dexmedetomidine group, the incidence of
   intraprocedural hypoventilation was significantly lower (P=0.016) and
   time to first analgesic requirement was significantly longer (P<0.0001)
   than that in propofol/fentanyl group.
   Conclusion Both propofol/fentanyl and propofol/dexmedetomidine
   combinations at mentioned dose regimen were effective and well tolerated
   for children undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. However,
   propofol/dexmedetomidine combination was accompanied with less propofol
   consumption, prolonged analgesia and lower incidence of intraprocedural
   and postprocedural complications. Eur J Anaesthesiol 2010;27:1058-1064}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a Cognitive Radio Based Medium Access Control (CR-MAC)
   protocol for Wireless Sensor Body Area Networks (WSBAN) that utilizes
   cognitive radio transmission is proposed. In this proposal, the sensor
   nodes are classified into nodes of life-critical health information and
   nodes of non-critical health information. The CR-MAC protocol
   prioritizes the critical packets access to the transmission medium by
   transmitting them with higher power while transmitting lower priority
   packets using lower transmission power. At the receiver, a higher
   priority packet experiences collision only when there are more than one
   critical packet transmission at the same transmission slot while non
   critical packets experience collision when there are more than one
   transmission at the same transmission slot. This protocol is evaluated
   analytically and through simulation. The obtained results demonstrate a
   differentiated service system which prioritizes critical traffic access
   to the transmission medium and increases the critical traffic
   throughput. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Radiative transfer effects in primordial hydrogen recombination}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},

Abstract = {{The calculation of a highly accurate cosmological recombination history
   has been the object of particular attention recently, as it constitutes
   the major theoretical uncertainty when predicting the angular power
   spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. Lyman transitions,
   in particular the Lyman-alpha line, have long been recognized as one of
   the bottlenecks of recombination, due to their very low escape
   probabilities. The Sobolev approximation does not describe radiative
   transfer in the vicinity of Lyman lines to a sufficient degree of
   accuracy, and several corrections have already been computed in other
   works. In this paper, we compute the impact of some radiative transfer
   effects that were previously ignored, or for which previous treatments
   were incomplete. First, the effect of Thomson scattering in the vicinity
   of the Lyman-alpha line is evaluated, using a full redistribution kernel
   incorporated into a radiative transfer code. The effect of feedback of
   distortions generated by the optically thick deuterium Lyman-alpha line
   blueward of the hydrogen line is investigated with an analytic
   approximation. It is shown that both effects are negligible during
   cosmological hydrogen recombination. Second, the importance of
   high-lying, nonoverlapping Lyman transitions is assessed. It is shown
   that escape from lines above Ly gamma and frequency diffusion in Ly beta
   and higher lines can be neglected without loss of accuracy. Third, a
   formalism generalizing the Sobolev approximation is developed to account
   for the overlap of the high-lying Lyman lines, which is shown to lead to
   negligible changes to the recombination history. Finally, the
   possibility of a cosmological hydrogen recombination maser is
   investigated. It is shown that there is no such maser in the purely
   radiative treatment presented here.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Prolonged air leak is still one of the most frequent
   complications after pulmonary resections, particularly upper lobectomy.
   This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of pleural tenting in
   decreasing air leak after upper lobectomy. Methods: This was a
   prospective randomised study of 48 patients who had upper lobectomy.
   They were divided into two groups: the first group included 23 patients
   in whom the pleural tent was done, and the other group included 25
   patients in whom no tenting was performed. These two groups were
   compared regarding the preoperative, operative and postoperative
   characteristics. Results: The incidence of air leak was significantly
   lower in the tent group at postoperative day 3 and thereafter. The
   intensity of air leak at postoperative day 2 was significantly lower in
   the tent group (p = 0.028), and the duration of air leak was
   significantly shorter in the tent group (2.96 +/- 1.43 days vs 4.68 +/-
   2.95 days, p = 0.015). The total amount of pleural drainage was
   significantly larger in the tent group (1278 +/- 407 ml vs 1054 +/- 266
   ml, p = 0.027). The chest tube duration and the total hospital stay
   showed no significant difference between both groups. The incidence of
   development of postoperative apical dead space was lower in the tent
   group but it did not reach a significant level. The incidence of
   prolonged air leak was significantly lower in the tent group and
   regression analysis for its risk factors showed that pleural tenting was
   significantly associated with decreasing the incidence of prolonged air
   leak while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was
   significantly associated with increasing it. Conclusion: Pleural tenting
   is a simple, short, safe and effective procedure for decreasing air leak
   following upper lobectomy and may be used especially in those patients,
   who have increased risk of prolonged air leak. (C) 2010 European

Abstract = {{Background: The present study examines frequency of DSM-IV symptom and
   diagnostic criteria for separation anxiety disorder (SAD) by informant,
   age, and sex.
   Methods: Children aged 4-15 years with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of SAD
   (N=106) were assessed using structured diagnostic interviews
   (Kinder-DIPS; DSM-IV-TR Version). Frequency of DSM-IV symptom and
   diagnostic criteria were examined as a function of informant and child
   characteristics, along with impairment and distress ratings.
   Results: The most frequently reported symptoms were separation-related
   distress, avoidance of being alone/without an adult and sleeping away
   from caregivers or from home, with nightmares the least frequently
   endorsed criterion. Child report did not yield any significant sex or
   age differences. However, parent report revealed greater reluctance or
   avoidance of school attendance for girls than boys, and for younger
   children (<8 years). Parent report indicated greater symptom-related
   impairment than child report, and the number of symptoms was correlated
   with impairment based on parent report, and with distress based on child
   report.
   Conclusions: The primary indicators of SAD appear to be separation
   distress, avoidance of being alone, and sleeping away from caregivers.
   Findings suggest that parents may be best placed to determine
   impairment, while children may be the most accurate reporters of more
   covert internal distress. Implications for clinicians are that reports
   from multiple informants should be used to gain the most comprehensive
   information about childhood SAD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aging is characterized by decline in metabolic function and insulin
   resistance, and both seem to be in the basis of neurodegenerative
   diseases and cognitive dysfunction. Estrogens prevent age-related
   changes, and phytoestrogens influence learning and memory. Our
   hypothesis was that estradiol and genistein, using rapid-action
   mechanisms, are able to modify insulin sensitivity, process of learning,
   and spatial memory. Young and aged ovariectomized rats received acute
   treatment with estradiol or genistein. Aged animals were more
   insulin-resistant than young. In each age, estradiol and
   genistein-treated animals were less insulin-resistant than the others,
   except in the case of young animals treated with high doses of
   genistein. In aged rats, no differences between groups were found in
   spatial memory test, showing a poor performance in the water maze task.
   However, young females treated with estradiol or high doses of genistein
   performed well in spatial memory task like the control group. Only rats
   treated with high doses of genistein showed an optimal spatial memory
   similar to the control group. Conversely, acute treatment with high
   doses of phytoestrogens improved spatial memory consolidation only in
   young rats, supporting the critical period hypothesis for the beneficial
   effects of estrogens on memory. Therefore, genistein treatment seems to
   be suitable treatment in aged rats in order to prevent insulin
   resistance but not memory decline associated with aging. Acute genistein
   treatment is not effective to restore insulin resistance associated to
   the early loss of ovarian function, although it can be useful to improve
   memory deficits in this condition.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the nature of jurors' knowledge about factors influencing
   eyewitness memory is critical for judges' decisions to admit expert
   testimony. Past empirical research has primarily assessed such knowledge
   using responses to survey questions. Yet, research from a variety of
   fields suggests that expressed beliefs may over- or under-estimate the
   ability of respondents to act appropriately when faced with a situation
   where such knowledge is relevant. Participants in this study evaluated
   the accuracy of eyewitnesses depicted in brief trial transcripts and
   answered survey questions to assess their beliefs regarding the same
   eyewitness memory issues. Results revealed that participants'
   performance on the transcripts did not correlate with their survey
   responses for most issues. Our findings highlight some potential
   strengths and weaknesses of survey measures of knowledge about
   eyewitness memory, and suggest the need for more diverse research
   investigating people's understanding and use of such knowledge.

Abstract = {{Located in the north-western extreme of the Iberian northern plateau
   with the Portugal border on the west, Zamora province is one of the
   current divisions of the autonomous region of Castile-Leon (Spain).
   According to natural boundaries and historical records, the province of
   Zamora can be subdivided into six different regions: Aliste, Benavente,
   Bajo Duero, Campos-Pan, Sanabria and Sayago. The geography of the area
   is configured by two major rivers: the Duero that crosses the province
   in a west-east direction and its affluent the Esla that crosses the
   province in a northwest-southeast course. In this work, we analyze both
   surnames of 166,349 individuals from Zamora province. The main goal of
   this study is to explore the differential weight of historical,
   demographic, geographic and sociocultural factors in shaping the
   bio-demographic and genetic structure of this specific population. The
   highest value of total consanguinity based on random isonymy is observed
   in Sanabria, which also has the lowest values of heteronymy and the
   highest intra-population a priori kinship. By contrast, Sayago exhibits
   the highest value of heteronymy and the lowest intra-population a priori
   kinship. The consanguinity values observed in Zamora are, in part,
   related to the population structure. Notwithstanding, the values of
   non-random consanguinity observed in some municipalities could be
   associated with particular mating behaviors that favor isonymic
   marriages. Finally, the results of analyses indicate that the levels of
   micro-differentiation in the province cannot be considered high;
   however, some degree of substructure could be deduced. It appears that
   the current population structure of Zamora has been determined not only
   by settlement history, geographic distance and geographic boundaries,
   but also, by land system distribution and population size.}},

   (TVD) Runge-Kutta schemes in order to improve their accuracy without
   doubling their computational cost as classical high-order (more than
   three) TVD schemes. The obtained schemes preserve the total variation
   bounded (TVB) property. Since the extrapolation is performed with
   schemes that are really TVD, a stable behavior is expected. Using also
   TVB schemes in space, some numerical experiments showing good
   performances of the proposed schemes are presented. Up to our knowledge,
   it is the first time that extrapolation procedures are used in this way.

Abstract = {{The performance of a digital mammography system (Siemens Mammomat
   Novation) using different target/filter combinations and tube voltage
   has been assessed. The objective of this study is to optimize beam
   quality selection based on contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and mean
   glandular dose (MGD). Three composition of breast were studied with
   composition of glandular/adipose of 30/70, 50/50, and 70/30. CNR was
   measured using 2, 4 and 6 cm-thick simulated breast phantoms with an
   aluminium sheet of 0.1 mm thickness placed on top of the phantom. Three
   target/filter combinations, namely molybdenum/molybdenum (Mo/Mo),
   molybdenum/rhodium (Mo/Rh) and tungsten/rhodium (W/Rh) with various tube
   voltage and mAs were tested. MGD was measured for each exposure. For
   50/50 breast composition, Mo/Rh combination with tube voltage 26 kVp is
   optimal for 2 cm-thick breast. W/Rh combination with tube voltage 27 and
   28 kVp are optimal for 4 and 6 cm-thick breast, respectively. For both
   30/70 and 70/30 breast composition, W/Rh combination is optimal with
   tube voltage 25, 26 and 27 kVp, respectively. From our study it was
   shown that there are potential of dose reduction up to 11\% for a set
   CNR of 3.0 by using beam quality other than that are determined by AEC
   selection. Under the constraint of lowest MGD, for a particular breast
   composition, calcification detection is optimized by using a softer
   X-ray beam for thin breast and harder X-ray beam for thick breast. These
   experimental results also indicate that for breast with high
   fibroglandular tissues (70/30), the use of higher beam quality does not
   always increase calcification detection due to additional structured
   noise caused by the fibroglandular tissues itself.}},

Abstract = {{Increased dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) enhances the mobilization of
   metals and nutrients in soil solutions. Our objective was to investigate
   the mobilization of Al, Ca, Fe, and P in forest soils due to fluctuating
   DIC concentrations. Intact soil cores were taken from the O and B
   horizons at the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM) to conduct soil
   column transport experiments. Solutions with DIC concentrations (similar
   to 20-600 ppm) were introduced into the columns. DIC was reversibly
   sorbed and its migration was retarded by a factor of 1.2 to 2.1 compared
   to the conservative sodium bromide tracer, corresponding to a log K-D =
   -0.82 to -0.07. Elevated DIC significantly enhanced the mobilization of
   all Al, Fe, Ca, and P. Particulate (> 0.4 mu m) Al and Fe were mobilized
   during chemical and flow transitions, such as increasing DIC and
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and resumption of flow after draining
   the columns. Calcium and P were primarily in dissolved forms. Mechanisms
   such as ion exchange (Al, Fe, Ca), ligand- and proton-promoted
   dissolution (Al and Fe), and ligand exchange (P) were the likely
   chemical mechanisms for the mobilization of these species. One column
   was packed with dried and sieved B-horizon soil. The effluent from this
   column had DOC, Al, and Fe concentrations considerably higher than those
   in the intact columns, suggesting that these species were mobilized from
   soil's microporous structure that was otherwise not exposed to the
   advective flow. Calcium and P concentrations, however, were similar to
   those in the intact columns, suggesting that these elements were less
   occluded in soil particles.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The purpose of this study was to investigate to what extent patients
   using prescription antiobesity drugs (orlistat, sibutramine and
   rimonabant) used cardiovascular and antidiabetic drugs. An additional
   aim was to investigate whether such co-medication differed according to
   gender, age and amount of antiobesity drugs used. Method Data were
   retrieved from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). All patients
   who had an antiobesity drug (ATC code A08A) dispensed from a Norwegian
   pharmacy between January 2004 and December 2007 were included in the
   study. Results During the 4-year study period 83,717 patients had
   antiobesity drugs dispensed. One in three patients using antiobesity
   drugs had at least on one occasion used a cardiovascular and/or an
   antidiabetic drug concomitantly. A significantly higher percentage of
   men used antihypertensives (40.4 vs. 27.2\%, P < 0.0005), lipid
   modifying agents (24.4 vs. 11.9\%, P < 0.0005) and drugs used in
   diabetes (12.7 vs. 6.4\%, P < 0.0005) concomitantly with antiobesity
   drugs when compared to women. The percentage of patients who had
   concomitant drug use increased markedly with age. One in four patients
   had antiobesity drugs dispensed only once during the period 2004-2007.
   Conclusion Use of cardiovascular and antidiabetic drugs among patients
   using antiobesity drugs was extensive, especially among men and elderly
   patients. Overall, there was a high degree of polypharmacy among users
   of antiobesity drugs. Also, many patients dispensed antiobesity drugs in
   amounts that indicated use less than the recommended daily dose, and
   many dispensed antiobesity drugs only once. When prescribing antiobesity
   drugs to patients the potential benefits of antiobesity drugs should be
   considered in relation to the patients other chronic diseases and to the
   total complexity of the patients drug regimen.}},

Abstract = {{In order to screen microsatellites for conservation genetics studies of
   the species, a total of 23 microsatellite loci from Korean goral
   (Naemorhedus caudatus), including 15 previously developed loci and 8 new
   loci in this study, were tested. Eleven microsatellites were screened
   and subjected to cross-species amplification using a test panel of four
   Caprinae species, Japanese serows (Capricornis crispus), Chinese gorals
   (Naemorhedus goral), Northern chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and domestic
   goats (Capra hircus). In addition, all eleven microsatellites (SY3A,
   SY12A, SY12B, SY48, SY58, SY71, SY76, SY84, SY84B, SY112, and SY129)
   satisfied the criteria to be a core set of microsatellites. This core
   set of microsatellites and cross-species amplification of Korean goral
   microsatellites were found to be helpful for high-resolution studies for
   conservation and management of Korean goral and other endangered

Title = {{A Soluble Guanylate Cyclase-Dependent Mechanism Is Involved in the
   Regulation of Net Hepatic Glucose Uptake by Nitric Oxide in Vivo}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE We previously showed that elevating hepatic nitric oxide (NO)
   levels reduced net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU) in the presence of
   portal glucose delivery, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia. The aim of
   the present study was to determine the role of a downstream signal,
   soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), in the regulation of NHGU by NO.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Studies were performed on 42-h-fasted
   conscious dogs fitted with vascular catheters. At 0 min, somatostatin
   was given peripherally along with 4x basal insulin and basal glucagon
   intraportally. Glucose was delivered at a variable rate via a leg vein
   to double the blood glucose level and hepatic glucose load throughout
   the study. From 90 to 270 min, an intraportal infusion of the sGC
   inhibitor 1H-{[}1,2,4] oxadiazolo{[}4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) was
   given in -sGC (n = 10) and -sGC/+NO (n = 6), whereas saline was given in
   saline infusion (SAL) (n = 10). The -sGC/+NO group also received
   intraportal SIN-1 (NO donor) to elevate hepatic NO from 180 to 270 min.
   RESULTS In the presence of 4x basal insulin, basal glucagon, and
   hyperglycemia (2x basal), inhibition of sGC in the liver enhanced NHGU
   (mg/kg/min; 210-270 min) by similar to 55\% (2.9 +/- 0.2 in SAL vs. 4.6
   +/- 0.5 in -sGC). Further elevating hepatic NO failed to reduce NHGU
   (4.5 +/- 0.7 in -sGC/+NO). Net hepatic carbon retention (i.e., glycogen
   synthesis; mg glucose equivalents/kg/min) increased to 3.8 +/- 0.2 in
   -sGC and 3.8 +/- 0.4 in -sGC/+NO vs. 2.4 +/- 0.2 in SAL (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS NO regulates liver glucose uptake through a sGC-dependent
   pathway. The latter could be a target for pharmacologic intervention to
   increase meal-associated hepatic glucose uptake in individuals with type
   2 diabetes. Diabetes 59:2999-3007, 2010}},

Abstract = {{The selection of appropriate type of contract for a highway maintenance
   project can be influenced by project attributes such as the expected
   cost and duration. However, the expected project cost and planned
   duration depend on other project attributes and also depend on each
   other. These simultaneous relationships complicate the identification of
   the appropriate contract for a highway maintenance project. While
   previous research has provided insight into the factors that affect
   project cost and duration, the validity of the findings may have been
   stymied by a lack of explicit consideration of the simultaneous
   relationships between project duration and cost. In this paper, we
   develop a framework based on a three-stage least-squares model to
   identify the most appropriate type of contract given the project's
   attributes while explicitly accounting for the simultaneity between
   project cost and duration. The framework can also be used to estimate
   the expected contract duration and cost on the basis of the project
   type, constituent work activities, physical size (length) of the
   project, and contract type. The results suggest that the choice of the
   appropriate contract type for a highway maintenance project is
   influenced by characteristics such as the number of constituent
   maintenance activities in the contract, the expected or specified
   contract characteristics (contract duration, cost, and length), and the
   type of highway asset in question.}},

Abstract = {{Tissues from two juvenile brown bears (Ursus arctos), suspected to have
   died from yew (Taxus baccata) toxicosis, were chemically examined using
   thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography.
   Extraction and analysis were conducted on heart and liver tissue samples
   as well as stomach content from the two bears and also on fresh material
   from an authenticated yew tree which was used as a standard for
   comparison. The taxine complex comprised of taxine B, 1-deoxytaxine B,
   isotaxine B, 2-acetyltaxin B, 1-deoxyisotaxine B, 2-acetylisotaxine B,
   and cinnamates were detected in all extracted samples. taxine B and its
   isomer isotaxine B are the main toxic constituents in yew. The heart,
   the target organ of taxine B, is arrested when reaching the lethal
   tissue concentration of taxine complex. In the present cases, the
   concentration in the hearts was found to be 37 and 17 mu g taxine
   complex per gram tissue, respectively. As no further absorption into the
   heart occurs following cardiac arrest, the concentration determined is
   the actual lethal tissue concentration. Yew ingestion was confirmed by
   microscopic examination of stomach contents of both bears.
   Histopathological findings of contraction band necrosis in heart
   specimens were also consistent with yew intoxication.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have investigated the impacts of river impoundments on

   dragonflies' habitat structures, especially in relation to shoreline
   vegetation. This study investigated the effects of the impoundment of
   the Guadiana River and its tributaries on dragonflies four years after
   the construction of a reservoir. A total of 17 dragonfly species (11
   Zygoptera and ten Anisoptera), representing six families, were recorded
   in 21 sites in the years 1999 and 2003. Aeshna mixta, Coenagrion
   caerulescens, Coenagrion scitulum, Sympetrum foscolombei, Sympetrum
   meridionale and Sympetrum striolatum were sampled just before the
   impoundment took place, and Anax parthenope, Onychogomphus forcipatus.
   Orthetrum coerulescens, Trithemis. annulata, Platycnemis acutipennis and
   Platycnemis latipes were recorded only after the construction of the
   reservoir. We concluded that the construction of the Alqueva Reservoir
   four years earlier did not change the dragonfly species richness,
   possibly because of species overlap, but that the species composition
   was modified. Changes in marginal vegetation may have been important to
   new species compositions.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis The safety of metformin in heart failure has been
   questioned because of a perceived risk of life-threatening lactic
   acidosis, though recent studies have not supported this concern. We
   investigated the risk of all-cause mortality associated with individual
   glucose-lowering treatment regimens used in current clinical practice in
   Denmark.
   Methods All patients aged >= 30 years hospitalised for the first time
   for heart failure in 1997-2006 were identified and followed until the
   end of 2006. Patients who received treatment with metformin, a
   sulfonylurea and/or insulin were included and assigned to mono-, bi- or
   triple therapy groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression
   models were used to assess the risk of all-cause mortality.
   Results A total of 10,920 patients were included. The median
   observational time was 844 days (interquartile range 365-1,395 days). In
   total, 6,187 (57\%) patients died. With sulfonylurea monotherapy used as
   the reference, adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality associated
   with the different treatment groups were as follows: metformin 0.85
   (95\% CI 0.75-0.98, p=0.02), metformin+sulfonylurea 0.89 (95\% CI
   0.82-0.96, p=0.003), metformin+insulin 0.96 (95\% CI 0.82-1.13, p=0.6),
   metformin+insulin+sulfonylurea 0.94 (95\% CI 0.77-1.15, p=0.5),
   sulfonylurea+insulin 0.97 (95\% CI 0.86-1.08, p=0.5) and insulin 1.14
   (95\% CI 1.06-1.20, p=0.0001).
   Conclusions/interpretation Treatment with metformin is associated with a
   low risk of mortality in diabetic patients with heart failure compared
   with treatment with a sulfonylurea or insulin.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied electron-induced interaction of molecular chlorine with
   Si(100) surface under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Without electron
   beam irradiation, chlorine was found to be adsorbed both dissociatively
   (first step) and molecularly (second step) at 100 K. Illumination of
   molecular chlorine-covered surface at 100K with electron beam (1-3 keV)
   led to the formation of silicon tetrachloride on the Si(100) surface. We
   established that the surface reaction, that is responsible for the
   SiCl(4) formation, is initiated by Cl(2) dissociation and appearance of
   the active chlorine radicals. Importance of the such effect is also
   discussed in a view of their possible applications for selective etching
   of semiconductor surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Questions about migration have cropped up in discussions on development
   in recent years. Although research has shown that remittances from
   migrants and migrants' transnationalism are often considered synonymous
   with development, the findings are not always so optimistic: some
   sceptics present migration as an impediment to economic growth. From an
   actor-oriented perspective, the relation between migration and
   development is shown to be neither positive nor negative but, instead,
   ambivalent. The strong migration from the town of Bor a in northern
   Romania has had a noticeable impact on the local population. The effects
   on the town's development are assessed by placing these economic changes
   in the complicated context of the social changes wrought by migration.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, time-resolved IR stimulated luminescence (TR-IRSL) curves
   from feldspar have mainly been measured over a few hundred mu s with the
   purpose of estimating the lifetimes of the components. In this study, we
   present the decay form of time-resolved IRSL and IR stimulated
   phosphorescence (IRSP) from orthoclase feldspar covering over 8 orders
   of magnitude (50 ns to similar to 7 s). A detailed characterisation of
   the slowly decaying signals (ms to s time scales) from feldspar is
   undertaken to obtain further insight into the role of re-trapping in
   both the IR stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and the relatively more
   stable post-IR IRSL signals. The decay form of the different signals
   examined here shows a weak dependence on preheat temperature and a
   strong dependence on stimulation temperature. Interestingly. the IRSP
   curves show a conspicuous kink of which the position is linearly
   dependent on the on-time duration.
   The data on thermal dependence of these signals might suggest that the
   decay behaviour of the time-resolved IRSL and phosphorescence signals
   mainly reflect the occupancy of electrons in the band tail states with a
   significant contribution from the shallow traps. This interpretation is
   supported by thermoluminescence (TL) curves showing the photo-transfer
   effect during short IR and post-IR IR stimulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Waste or resource? Classifying and scoring dredged material management
   strategies in terms of the waste hierarchy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1657-1668}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A well-designed approach for the selection of dredged material (DM)
   management option decisions identifies the trade-offs among various
   risks, costs, and benefits of multiple management alternatives. Whatever
   tools are applied to make and communicate decisions, it is critical that
   decision criteria and the parameters or indicators that are used to
   score or rank them are relevant, clear, and exhaustive, but not
   redundant. Alongside the more ``traditional{''} ones, new criteria are
   emerging which consider statutory drivers, multi-scale assessments,
   sustainability and ecosystem issues. Increasingly, policies demand more
   sustainable sediment management (including a prioritization of
   beneficial re-use), waste minimization, and a consideration of the waste
   hierarchy. A consideration of such factors requires that DM management
   approaches are classified in terms of the waste hierarchy and that these
   classifications are used to develop transparent and meaningful
   indicators, criteria, and scoring methods that can be used to inform
   decisions.
   Waste hierarchy classifications and definitions (pollution prevention,
   processing, re-use, recycling, and disposal), are discussed and a
   framework for DM management option and technology classification is
   proposed. Methodologies are presented by which complete management
   scenarios, with multiple phases or components, can be ranked and scored
   based upon the fates of all project fractions in terms of the waste
   hierarchy.
   A hypothetical case study is presented in which 15 DM management
   scenarios are evaluated using two scoring systems. These had different
   strengths and weaknesses, but both allowed for consistent and
   transparent comparisons of complex DM management scenarios in terms of
   the waste hierarchy that could be used for project comparison and
   communication.
   The goal of any indicator or score designed to represent a decision
   criterion is to provide a relative measure to allow decision makers and
   stakeholders to balance potentially competing decision drivers for
   potentially vastly different management scenarios in a level, consistent
   and transparent manner. As the waste hierarchy is likely to become
   increasingly important as a regulatory driver, and as a factor that can
   be used to address sustainability, it is important to be clear about the
   assumptions and definitions that are being used to make these concepts
   relevant to DM and other aspects of sediment management; this paper
   provides a framework for discussion.}},

Abstract = {{Aims:
   The positive influence of two selected extremely halophilic archaea
   strains in the production of salted anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus,
   L., 1758) was highlighted.
   Methods and Results:
   Anchovies produced with salt artificially contaminated with halophiles
   exhibited lower loads of staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and lactic
   acid bacteria, and a reduced content of histamine as well as an improved
   organoleptic acceptance.
   Conclusions:
   The findings of this survey are expected to enhance the safety of salted
   anchovies, with regard to the histamine formation during ripening, and
   to improve the sensory attributes of this product.
   Significance and Impact of the Study:
   This study represents the first report on the positive influence of
   halophilic archaea in traditional salted anchovies production, thus
   suggesting new perspectives about a conscious employment of properly
   selected haloarchaea strains in this traditional manufacture.}},

   range, the particle sizes decrease with increasing Ni content and a bulk
   solid solution limit was determined at similar to 1 mol\%. Ni surface
   enrichment is present at concentrations higher than the solution limit.
   Only above 10 mol\% Ni. the formation of a second NiO-related phase has
   been determined. Magnetization measurements suggest the occurrence of
   ferromagnetism for samples in the solid solution regime (below similar
   to 1 mol\%). This ferromagnetism is associated with the exchange
   interaction between electron spins trapped on oxygen vacancies, and is
   enhanced as the amount of Ni2+ substituting at Sn4+ sites increases.
   Above the solid solution limit, ferromagnetism is destroyed by the Ni
   surface enrichment and the system behaves as a paramagnet. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The extreme genetic diversity of the HIV-1 remains as a daunting
   challenge for the development of an effective AIDS vaccine. One strategy
   for creating a single vaccine that protects against the HIV-1 expanding
   population is to reconstruct centralized immunogenic sequences that
   minimize the genetic distance to circulating strains that the vaccine is
   targeting. Such centralized genes can be estimated with inferred
   consensus, ancestral and center-of-tree sequences. Although the
   increased breadth of antibody and T-cell responses induced by the
   centralized vaccines to date are encouraging, they are modest and may
   only be partly effective in combating HIV-1. One of the reasons of this
   limited success might be that several features of HIV-1 molecular
   evolution have not been yet taken into account in the design of these
   centralized vaccines, the most important likely being its high
   recombination rate and complex nucleotide substitution process. Here we
   describe evolutionary methodologies for the inference of centralized
   HIV-1 genes, with particular focus on the sources of error introduced by
   recombination and the model of evolution, in order to foster the
   development of more effective immunogens before synthesis and assessment
   in the lab, and final testing in AIDS vaccine trials.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We have determined the currently allowed regions of the parameter spaces
   of two representative models of diffuse neutrino flux from active
   galactic nuclei (AGN): one by Koers \& Tinyakov (KT) and another by
   Becker \& Biermann (BB). Our observable has been the number of upgoing
   muon-neutrinos expected in the 86-string IceCube detector, after 5 years
   of exposure, in the range 10(5) <= E-nu/GeV <= 10(8). We have used the
   latest estimated discovery potential of the IceCube-86 array at the 5
   sigma level to determine the lower boundary of the regions, while for
   the upper boundary we have used either the AMANDA upper bound on the
   neutrino flux or the more recent preliminary upper bound given by the
   half-completed IceCube-40 array (IC40). We have varied the spectral
   index of the proposed power-law fluxes, a, and two parameters of the BB
   model: the ratio between the boost factors of neutrinos and cosmic rays,
   Gamma(nu)/Gamma(CR), and the maximum redshift of the sources that
   contribute to the cosmic-ray flux, z(CR)(max). For the KT model, we have
   considered two scenarios: one in which the number density of AGN does
   not evolve with redshift and another in which it evolves strongly,
   following the star formation rate. Using the IC40 upper bound, we have
   found that the models are visible in IceCube-86 only inside very thin
   strips of parameter space and that both of them are discarded at the
   preferred value of alpha = 2.7 obtained from fits to cosmic-ray data.
   Lower values of a, notably the values 2.0 and 2.3 proposed in the
   literature, fare better. In addition, we have analysed the capacity of
   IceCube-86 to discriminate between the models within the small regions
   of parameter space where both of them give testable predictions. Within
   these regions, discrimination at the 5 sigma level or more is
   guaranteed.}},

Abstract = {{Today, trenchless technologies such as horizontal directional drilling
   (HDD) have increased significantly as an alternative installation method
   in the municipal sector. Installation of potable water, force mains,
   reclaimed water, and gravity sewer pipelines employing directional
   drilling have increased as demand for installations in difficult areas
   including under rivers or major highways and highly urbanized and
   congested utility corridors has increased. The nature of the HDD process
   necessitates the use of continuously joined pipe products capable of
   being pulled in, as opposed to being pushed, or ``jacked{''} in as with
   segmental installations. Fusible polyvinylchloride pipe (FPVCP) inane
   such material for installation of water and wastewater, pressure and
   non-pressure infrastructure using HDD. This paper describes a model for
   predicting pull loads during HDD installations using FPVCP. Pull load
   data was captured using an in-line measuring device attached between the
   backreamer of the drill string and the product pipe to gauge exact
   loading transferred to the pipe. Detailed results from four field
   projects demonstrate excellent correlation between predicted and field

Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Decompressive hemicraniectomy reduces
   morbidity and mortality in patients with large hemispheric stroke.
   However, its role in patients that underwent failed endovascular
   reperfusion remains unknown.
   Methods: Patients with acute stroke secondary to internal carotid artery
   occlusion who underwent endovascular multimodal reperfusion therapy were
   evaluated. Patients with failed revascularization who were referred for
   decompressive hemicraniectomy were compared with patients with failed
   reperfusion who did not undergo decompressive hemicraniectomy.
   Functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Score (mRS) and
   neurological disability with the NIH Stroke Scale Score (NIHSS) at 90
   days from stroke onset.
   Results: Six decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated patients were
   included (four females, mean age: 36.7 years, mean NIHSS: 24.5). None of
   the decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated patients died compared to six
   of seven patients with failed multi-modal reperfusion therapy that did
   not undergo decompressive hemicraniectomy. All decompressive
   hemicraniectomy-treated patients were discharged to a rehabilitation
   facility whereas the only surviving non-decompressive
   hemicraniectomy-treated patient was discharged to a nursing facility.
   Five of the six decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated (84\%) and none of
   the non-decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated patients had an mRS <= 3
   at 90 days post-stroke.
   Discussion: Decompressive hemicraniectomy can significantly improve
   functional outcome in patients with large carotid artery strokes that
   failed to recanalize following multi-modal reperfusion therapy. These
   results imply that decompressive hemicraniectomy should be planned in
   patients who undergo multi-modal reperfusion therapy for large carotid
   artery stroke.}},

Abstract = {{A lot of research effort has been put into wireless sensor networks
   (WSNs) and several methods have been proposed to minimize the energy
   consumption and maximize the network's lifetime. However, little work
   has been carried out regarding WSNs deployed for emergency situations.
   We argue that such WSNs should function under a flexible channel
   allocation scheme when needed and be able to operate and adapt in
   dynamic, ever-changing environments coexisting with other interfering
   networks (IEEE 802.11b/g, 802.15.4, 802.15.1). In this paper, a simple
   and efficient method for the detection of a single operational frequency
   channel that guarantees satisfactory communication among all network
   nodes is proposed. Experimental measurements carried out in a real
   environment reveal the coexistence problem among networks in close
   proximity that operate in the same frequency band and prove the validity
   and efficiency of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Contents
   The inbred SLA miniature pig is a unique animal model developed for
   organ transplantation studies and pre-clinical experimental purposes.
   Reported oestrous synchronization and superovulation treatments were
   examined in two SLA haplotypes (AA and DD) to allow collection of
   embryos for both practical embryo transfer and experimental technologies
   from a closed breeding colony. Pre-puberal miniature pigs were poor
   responders to oestrous synchronization treatments, while post-puberal
   sows were equivalent to commercial sows. Following superovulation, the
   ovulation number (corpora .hemorrhagica) was higher (p < 0.05) in the
   cycling sows when compared with non-cycling sows. Ovulations were
   equivalent to commercial pre-puberal gilts and non-cycling sows (p >
   0.05). No difference in ovulation number between haplotypes was
   observed, which differs from the previous report (DD > AA). Collection
   of zygotes for pronuclear injection was the highest in the non-cycling
   post-puberal miniature pig group (p < 0.05), although significantly
   lower when compared with the commercial pig treatment groups (p < 0.05).
   The incidence of cystic endometrial hyperplasia in our colony was
   equivalent to rates observed in commercial pigs. Pronuclear
   visualization following centrifugation was the highest in the
   non-cycling miniature sow group and approximates to about 25\% of
   ovulations and about half the rate observed in the commercial pigs
   (50\%). Miniature pig embryos transferred between SLA haplotypes and
   transfer of DD embryos to commercial pigs resulted in live births at a
   higher efficiency than previously reported. This study demonstrates the
   feasibility of undertaking assisted reproductive technologies in a
   closed breeding colony of inbred SLA miniature pigs without compromise
   to the breeding programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, recently found to be functionally
   abnormal in various types of human disease, is negatively regulated by
   the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway As Akt is constitutively activated in a
   subset of breast cancer, we hypothesized that glycogen synthase kinase 3
   beta is inappropriately inactivated in these cases In this study, we
   aimed to assess (1) the overall frequency of glycogen synthase kinase 3
   beta inactivation in breast cancer, (2) whether there is an association
   between Akt activation and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inactivation,
   and (3) whether there is a correlation between glycogen synthase kinase
   3 beta inactivation and various pathologic and clinical parameters The
   phosphorylated form of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (pGSK-3 beta) and
   Akt (pAkt) were used as surrogate markers for glycogen synthase kinase 3
   beta inactivation and Akt activation, respectively Immunohistochemistry
   applied to paraffin-embedded tissues was used to assess 72 consecutive
   invasive mammary carcinomas, of which 50 were estrogen receptor-positive
   Overall, pGSK-3 beta and pAkt were positive in 34 (47 2\%) and 35 (48
   6\%) cases, respectively These 2 markers were significantly correlated
   with each other in the overall group and in the estrogen receptor
   positive subgroup (P = 01 and 003, Spearman, respectively) Importantly,
   pGSK-3 beta, but not pAkt, significantly correlated a worse clinical
   outcome in this cohort (P = 004, log rank) In summary, evidence of
   glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inactivation was found in approximately
   half of the invasive mammary carcinomas Our data suggest that this
   abnormality is likely attributed to Akt activation and that glycogen
   synthase kinase 3 beta inactivation confers a worse clinical outcome (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives:
   To measure the prevalence of dental erosion in permanent teeth in
   Iceland as part of the National Oral Health Survey.
   Methods:
   A representative, nationwide sample of 2251 Icelandic children, 20\% of
   those aged 6, 12 and 15 year, was examined. Dental erosion was recorded
   for all erupted permanent teeth and graded using the modified scale of
   Lussi.
   Results:
   Erosion was not seen in the permanent teeth of six-year-olds, but was
   present in 15.7\% of 12-year-olds, more frequently in boys than girls
   (19.9\% boys, 11.0\% girls; P < 0.001). Among 15-year-olds, dental
   erosion was seen among 30.7\% of subjects (38.3\% boys, 22.7\% girls; P
   < 0.001). Severity of erosion was mostly scored as grade I, with only
   5.5\% of 15-year-olds scored as grade II, mostly on tooth 46 (4.3\%) and
   36 (4.2\%). For 12-year-olds, 0.9\% had erosion scores of grade II
   mostly on tooth 46 (0.8\%) and 36 (0.7\%). No subjects had erosion of
   grade III. The most common clinical manifestation of erosion was the
   appearance of cup-like lesions on the cusps of lower first molars.
   Conclusions:
   Dental erosion was frequently present by the age of 12; the prevalence
   doubled by age 15 and was seen almost twice as often among boys than
   girls. Teeth most frequently showing signs of erosion were the lower
   first molars. The rapidly growing prevalence of erosion demonstrated by
   this nationwide survey emphasizes the need for further research into the
   aetiology of erosion and possible methods of preventing and treating
   this emerging dental problem.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Comorbid and anatomic characteristics that portend higher
   procedural risk are well defined for carotid endarterectomy but less so
   for carotid artery stenting.
   Methods and Results-We pooled carotid stent data from 4 Cordis-sponsored
   trials (n=2104) with similar patient cohorts and end point determination
   to identify predictors of neurological death or stroke within 30 days of
   the procedure. Median age was 74 years (24\% >80 years), 36\% were
   women, and 24.2\% were symptomatic in the previous 6 months. There were
   88 (4.2\%) neurological deaths or strokes at 30 days. Among symptomatic
   patients, the risk of adverse neurological outcome declined with
   increasing time between the incident neurological event and carotid
   stent procedure. In a logistic regression model that included
   preprocedural and procedural variables, significant multivariable
   predictors of 30-day neurological death or stroke were older age
   (continuous), black race, angiographically visible thrombus in
   symptomatic patients, procedural use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
   inhibitors, procedural transient ischemic attack, final residual
   stenosis >30\%, and periprocedural use of protamine or vasopressors.
   Conclusions-In this pooled analysis, a number of preprocedural and
   procedural factors predicted higher risk of stroke and neurological
   death within 30 days of a carotid stent procedure. Identification of
   such predictors may help to guide patient selection and further refine
   procedural technique. (Circ Cardiovasc Interv. 2010;3:577-584.)}},

Abstract = {{Methanol is included among the most hazardous air pollutants, and an
   effort of vapors biofiltration by using microbial consortiums has been
   reported. The aim of this work was to couple the methanol vapors
   biodegradation with the production of recombinant endochitinase (ech42)
   from Trichoderma atroviride in Pichia pastoris transformed with the
   pPIC-ech42 plasmid. After carrying out batch experiments at 0.5\% (w/v)
   of methanol concentration, the recombinant P. pastoris Mut(+) strain was
   selected because it showed methanol biodegradation rates similar to
   those of wild type GS115 strain (39 g/m(3) h), but 15\% higher than the
   transformed Mut(S) strain. In addition, the recombinant Ech42 protein
   production was higher in Mut(+) than Mut(S). After various methanol
   vapor concentrations were evaluated, the maximum recombinant protein
   recovery was 317 mg/l and the volumetric methanol consumption rate was
   88.7 g/m(3) h at 0.5\% (w/v) of methanol concentration. This research
   underlines the promising application of linking methanol vapors
   biodegradation with the production of recombinant protein with high

   Material and Methods: Treatment with amphotericin B (1mg/kg/day
   intraperitoneally), fluconazole (100 mg/kg/day ip), terbinafine (100
   mg/kg/day by oral gavage) and combinations of terbinafine with
   amphotericin B and terbinafine with fluconazole at the same doses began
   24 h after infection and continued for 10 days, and kidney cultures were
   performed.
   Results: No significant improvement in survival was not found between
   the control and the terbinafine group (p>0.05). With the addition of
   amphotericin B to terbinafine, significant improvement in survival was
   found compared with the survival of untreated controls (p<0.0001). When
   compared with the control group, the kidney culture results of the
   amphotericin B group were superior to those with two-fold reduction in
   CFU counts (p<0.05), but the difference between the terbinafine group
   and the control group was not significant (p>0.05). Terbinafine with
   amphotericin B and terbinafine with fluconazole combinations, when
   compared by fungal density reduction with amphotericin B, were less
   effective and the difference was significant (p<0.0001).
   Conclusion: Terbinafine had no effect on controlling systemic

Title = {{Second-year medical students' motivational beliefs, emotions, and
   achievement}},

Abstract = {{Context
   A challenge for medical educators is to better understand the personal
   factors that lead to individual success in medical school and beyond.
   Recently, educational researchers in fields outside medicine have
   acknowledged the importance of motivation and emotion in students'
   learning and performance. These affective factors have received less
   emphasis in the medical education literature.
   Objectives
   This longitudinal study examined the relations between medical students'
   motivational beliefs (task value and self-efficacy), achievement
   emotions (enjoyment, anxiety and boredom) and academic achievement.
   Methods
   Second-year medical students (n = 136) completed motivational beliefs
   and achievement emotions surveys following their first and second
   trimesters, respectively. Academic achievement was operationalised as
   students' average course examination grades and national board shelf
   examination scores.
   Results
   The results largely confirmed the hypothesised relations between
   beliefs, emotions and achievement. Structural equation modelling
   revealed that task value beliefs were positively associated with
   course-related enjoyment (standardised regression coefficient {[}beta] =
   0.59) and were negatively related to boredom (beta = - 0.25), whereas
   self-efficacy beliefs were negatively associated with course-related
   anxiety only (beta = - 0.47). Furthermore, student enjoyment was
   positively associated with national board shelf examination score (beta
   = 0.31), whereas anxiety and boredom were both negatively related to
   course examination grade (beta = - 0.36 and - 0.27, respectively). The
   overall structural model accounted for considerable variance in each of
   the achievement outcomes: R2 = 0.20 and 0.14 for the course examination
   grade and national board shelf examination score, respectively.
   Conclusions
   This study suggests that medical students' motivational beliefs and
   achievement emotions are important contributors to their academic
   achievement. These results have implications for medical educators
   striving to understand the personal factors that influence learning and
   performance in medical training.}},

Abstract = {{The group of severe cutaneous drug reactions with systemic symptoms
   includes several syndromes: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson
   syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and drug reaction

   several days to six weeks after introducing the incriminating drug. The
   skin and internal organs (liver, kidneys, lungs, etc.) are usually
   involved. A great possibility of lethal outcome is a critical
   characteristic of these syndromes. A patient with pyelonephritis
   diagnosed during emergency room workup is described. Ciprofloxacin was
   prescribed and the patient was discharged. After ten days, the patient
   came back with worsening condition, general inflammatory response, skin
   changes, liver and kidney damage, and eosinophilia. DRESS syndrome was
   diagnosed based on clinical and other findings. The diagnosis and
   treatment of severe drug reactions with cutaneous and systemic symptoms

Abstract = {{In this research an atomic force microscopy (AFM) study on
   self-assembled In0.5Ga0.5As/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) was performed.
   Surface morphology of self-assembled In0.5Ga0.5As QDs changes with

   and decreased the dots density. In addiditon, self-assembled
   In0.5Ga0.5As QDs was grown on In0.1Ga0.9As underlying layer with
   different after-growth AsH3 flow time during cooling-down. The
   underlying layer caused lattice strain relaxation in the QDs on the
   surface. Increasing the period of AsH3 flow during cooling-down reduced
   the diameter of the dots and increased the density. The migration of
   groups III species in the growth of In0.5Ga0.5As/GaAs system was
   influenced by AsH3 flow during cooling-down period. This was due to the
   increase in surface population of active arsenic species. Underlying
   layer and the period of AsH3 flow during cooling-down are the two key
   factors in the fabrication of small and dense In0.5Ga0.5As QDs.}},

Abstract = {{Auger electron spectroscopy was used to study electron stimulated
   adsorption from residual ultra-high vacuum medium on the atomically pure
   surface of indium. In the absence of irradiation of the surface of
   indium by a beam of electrons, adsorption processes were much weaker or
   almost absent. Electron stimulation considerably increased the rate of
   adsorption. Irradiation by electrons caused the dissociation of the
   adsorbate; as a result, a layer of carbon formed on the surface of
   indium. The conclusion is drawn that, in modeling electron stimulated
   adsorption, not only electronic excitation and/or dissociation of
   molecules in the gas phase, but also the excitation of surface particles
   or adsorbent defects should be taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate
   to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is needed for the action of
   folate-dependent enzymes and is thus essential for DNA synthesis and
   methylation. The importance of this reaction is demonstrated by the
   effectiveness of antifolate medications used to treat cancer by
   inhibiting DHFR, thereby depleting THF and slowing DNA synthesis and
   cell proliferation. Due to the pivotal role that DHFR plays in folate
   metabolism and cancer treatment, changes in the level of DHFR expression
   can affect susceptibility to a variety of diseases dependent on folate
   status such as spina bifida and cancer. Likewise, variability in DHFR
   expression can affect sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs such as the
   folate antagonist methotrexate. Alterations in DHFR expression can be
   due to polymorphisms in the DHFR gene. Several variations have recently
   been described in DHFR, including promoter polymorphisms, the 19-bp
   deletion allele and variations in 3'UTR. These polymorphisms seem to be
   functional, affecting mRNA levels through various interesting
   mechanisms, including regulation through RNA interference. Several
   groups have assessed the association of these polymorphisms with folate
   levels, risk of cancer and spina bifida as well as the outcome of
   diseases treated with MTX. The latter may lead to different treatment
   schedules, improving treatment efficacy and/or allowing for a reduction
   in drug side effects. This review will summarize present knowledge
   regarding the predictive potential of DHFR polymorphisms in disease and
   treatment.}},

   (PVA), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and their blends. Miscibility and
   morphology of both polymers in the nanofiber blends were studied by
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), revealing that PVA and PHB were
   miscible with good compatibility. DSC also revealed suppression of
   crystallinity of PHB in the blend nanofibers with increasing proportion
   of PVA. The hydrolytic degradation of PHB was accelerated with
   increasing PVA fraction. Cell culture experiments with a human
   keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and dermal fibroblast on the electrospun
   PHB and PVA/PHB blend nanofibers showed maximum adhesion and
   proliferation on pure PHB. However, the addition of 5 wt \% PVA to PHB
   inhibited growth of HaCaT cells but not of fibroblasts. On the contrary,
   adhesion and proliferation of HaCaT cells were promoted on PVA/PHB
   (50/50) fibers, which inhibited growth of fibroblasts.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To assess the role of biochemical bone markers in classification of
   children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), their possible association
   with vertebral compression fractures in milder forms of OI and their
   role in monitoring of intravenous pamidronate (APD) treatment.
   Methods: Serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone ALP isoforms (in a
   subgroup), osteocalcin, type I procollagen carboxy-terminal propeptide,
   carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and urine
   deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were measured in a cross-sectional study of 130
   untreated individuals, 0.25-20.9 years (median 6.7), with OI types I,
   III and IV. Of those, sixty-nine were also assessed longitudinally
   during monthly APD treatment. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by
   dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
   Results: Significant differences in bone markers, however not sufficient
   for individual clinical use, were found in the larger untreated group
   but not between subgroups with or without vertebral compressions. All
   bone markers decreased during treatment for 1.0-12.5 years, but with
   different relative amounts. Changes were not correlated to the
   improvement in BMD, mobility or pain.
   Conclusion: Bone markers are, despite significant differences, not
   useful for the classification of OI type in the individual child and are
   not associated with vertebral compressions. Serum ALP and urinary DPD
   are sensitive in monitoring bisphosphonate treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In wound healing transforming growth factor 131 (TGF beta 1), utilizing
   the Smad signaling pathway, advances connective tissue deposition, the
   transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and wound contraction.
   The compound SB-505124 disrupts the Smad signaling pathway by blocking
   activin receptor-like kinase phosphorylation of select Smad signaling
   proteins. Four full thickness excisional square 2 x 2 cm wounds were
   made on the rat dorsum. On day 2, the pair of wounds on the left
   received 1 mu M SB-505124 in gel, and the pair on the right, controls,
   received gel alone. Wounds were covered with nonocclusive dressings and
   treated redressed daily for 4 days. No differences in day 14 wound sizes
   between treatment groups were found. H\&E stained sections revealed
   increased cell density in SB-505124 treated wounds. Polarized light
   microscopy showed collagen fiber bundles birefringence intensity and
   organization were equivalent between treatment groups. Myofibroblast
   populations, identified by a-smooth muscle actin staining, were the norm
   in controls but absent in SB-505124 treated wounds, which was confirmed
   by Western blot analysis. Blocking the Smad signaling pathway diminished
   connective tissue deposition and generated a deficiency in myofibroblast
   numbers, but wound contraction was unimpaired. The absence of
   myofibroblasts may be related to the blocking of the Smad signaling
   pathway or it may be related to the generation of less tension in
   treated wounds, related to reduce deposited connective tissue. These
   findings support the notion that wound contraction does not require the
   generation of myofibroblast contractile forces, but rather the
   organization of newly deposited collagen fiber bundles by forces related
   to fibroblast locomotion. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   explains how people value health insurance and how changes in its costs
   affect coverage. The tax compliance literature indicates that the

Abstract = {{Collaborative social interaction when using Web 2.0 in terms of

   circumstances made the case study method appropriate: the impossibility
   to control student activities, and the study of contemporary and ongoing

   reflections concerning their own and others' thoughts and emotions, b)
   supports individual students and integrates them into a work group, and
   c) develops students' identification and awareness in relation to self,

Abstract = {{Objectives To determine the types of, and the populations targeted by
   interventions implemented to increase breast cancer screening rates in
   counties with large African American populations across different US
   regions.
   Methods A brief questionnaire was administered by e-mail to county
   representatives from 33 states from October 2008 through March 2009.
   Responses were obtained from 33\% of 203 targeted counties.
   Results Most counties (>80\%) reported interventions for African
   American women and for women with low income. Women were exposed to
   different kinds of interventions depending on where they lived. Most
   counties in the Northeast (93\%), Southwest (82\%), and Midwest (100\%)
   implemented interventions that provided free or low cost mammograms.
   Counties in the Southeast (83\%) were more likely to report education
   interventions. Counties from the Southwest reported using a variety of
   interventions to encourage breast cancer screening.
   Conclusion In this selected group of counties, different types of
   interventions were used to increase breast cancer screening in minority
   and disadvantaged women. Interventions implemented were similar to those
   shown in the literature to be effective in increasing screening rates in
   specific populations. Future research should examine the use of
   screening interventions in a larger sample of US counties.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce an estimation error analysis for
   quadratically nonlinear system identification in the short-time Fourier
   transform (STFT) domain. The identification scheme consists of a
   parallel connection of a linear component, represented by crossband
   filters between subbands, and a quadratic component, which is modeled by
   multiplicative cross-terms. We mainly concentrate on two types of
   undermodeling errors. The first is caused by employing a purely linear
   model in the estimation process (i.e., nonlinear undermodeling), and the
   second is a consequence of restricting the number of estimated crossband
   filters in the linear component. We derive analytical relations between
   the noise level, nonlinearity strength, and the obtainable mean-square
   error (mse) in subbands. We show that for low signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) conditions, a lower mse is achieved by allowing for nonlinear
   undermodeling and utilizing a purely linear model. However, as the SNR
   increases, the performance can be generally improved by incorporating a
   nonlinear component into the model. We further show that as the SNR
   increases, a larger number of crossband filters should be estimated to
   attain a lower mse, whether a linear or nonlinear model is employed.
   Experimental results support the theoretical derivations.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its abundance in Latin America, and its remarkable ability to
   use tools, there are only a few myological studies on the capuchin
   monkey, Cebus libidinosus. In the present study, we dissected the
   forearm extensor muscles of six adult males and two adult females of
   this species. We describe these muscles and compare them with those of
   other primates dissected by us and by other authors. The forearm
   extensor muscles of Cebus monkeys are, in general, more similar to those
   of other platyrrhines than to distantly related taxa that use tools,
   such as chimpanzees and modern humans, with three main exceptions:
   contrary to most other platyrrhines, (1) in Cebus, chimpanzees and
   modern humans the extensor pollicis longus usually inserts onto Digit I,
   and not onto Digits I and II; (2) in Cebus the abductor pollicis longus
   has two separate tendons, as is the case in chimpanzees, and in modern
   humans (where one of these tendons is associated with a distinct belly,
   forming the muscle extensor pollicis brevis); (3) in Cebus, and in
   modern humans and chimpanzees, the extensor pollicis longus is not
   deeply blended with the extensor indicis. Therefore, the Cebus monkeys
   provide an illustrative example of how phylogenetic constrains and
   ecological adaptations have been combined to develop a specific
   myological configuration that, associated with their sophisticated
   neurological organization, allow them to easily navigate in their
   arboreal habitats and, at the same time, to finely manipulate objects in
   order to search for food and to prepare this food for ingestion. Anat

Abstract = {{Since the Supreme Court's widely criticized decision in DeShaney v.
   Winnebago County Department of Social Services, the principle that the
   Constitution affords no relief for a social worker's failure to prevent
   harm to a child has been described as a ``staple of our constitutional
   law.{''} Whatever might be said about this principle on its own terms,
   it produces very troubling incentives for social workers, who may still
   face constitutional tort liability when they act affirmatively to
   intervene in troubled families-the unjustified removal of a child from
   her parents' custody, after all, is the sort of infringement proscribed
   by our Constitution's charter of negative liberties. This Article is the
   first to argue that this imbalance should be taken into account in
   determining the level of immunity to which social workers ought to be
   entitled when their conduct is challenged in federal court. In a world
   where social workers cannot be held liable in federal court for leaving
   an endangered child in the care of her parents, it is unacceptable to
   allow social workers to face liability for wrongfully removing a child
   from a dangerous home. In this Article, I offer a reluctant defense of
   absolute immunity for social workers initiating child dependency
   proceedings, arguing that such immunity can correct a perilous
   imbalance.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between vacuolar pH in Anthurium andraeanum (Hurt.) and
   spathe color, cultivar, developmental stage, spathe location, spathe
   surface differences, and time after harvest was investigated with the
   overall long-term objective of developing a methodology for engineering
   blue-colored spathes. Chromospectral analysis of the pigmentation was
   also studied. Six experiments were conducted involving 23 cultivars of
   anthurium with each experiment arranged in a randomized complete block
   design with five replications. Spathe color was associated with vacuolar
   pH with the whites and greens having the highest pH (average 5.65)
   followed by corals (5.38), pinks (5.20), reds (5.10), and oranges (4.5).
   In general, there was correspondence between the lightness of the
   pigmentation (L{*}) and the pH values with the lighter colors having
   higher pH values. There were, however, significant differences among
   cultivars within the color groups. Whereas spathe pH decreased with
   aging, there was no difference in the spectral data, suggesting that
   factors other than anthocyanin content may be contributing to the pH
   difference. There were no differences in pH between locations sampled on
   the spathe nor between the spathe surfaces provided there were no
   differences in color intensity (L{*}). The pH increased with vase life
   in two of three cultivars tested with pH values showing an association
   with increases in a{*} and b{*} (chromospectral data) reflecting a
   bluing effect. The importance of the results to engineering blue-colored
   spathes in anthurium is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) offer unique properties such as the highest
   current density, ballistic transport, ultra-high thermal conductivity,
   and extremely high mechanical strength. Because of these remarkable
   properties, they have been expected for use as wiring materials and as
   alternate channel materials for extending complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) performance in future very large scale
   integration (VLSI) technologies. In this paper, we report the present
   status of CNT growth technologies and the applications for via
   interconnects (vertical wiring) and field-effect transistors (FETs). We
   fabricated CNT via and evaluated its robustness over a high-density
   current. In our technology, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were
   successfully grown at temperatures as low as 365 degrees C using Co
   catalyst nanoparticles, which were formed and deposited by a
   custom-designed particle generation and deposition system. The density
   of MWNTs grown at 450 degrees C reaches more than 1 x 10(12) /cm(2).
   MWNTs were grown in via holes with a diameter as small as 40 nm. The
   resistance of CNT vias with a diameter of 160 nm was found to be of the
   same order as that of tungsten plugs. The CNT via was able to sustain a
   current density as high as 5.0 x 10(6) A/cm(2) at 105 degrees C for 100
   h without any deterioration in its properties. We propose a Si-process
   compatible technique to control carrier polarity of CNFETs by utilizing
   fixed charges introduced by the gate oxide. High-performance p-and
   n-type CNFETs and CMOS inverters with stability in air have been
   realized.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the results from laboratory investigations of the
   adhesion of polysiloxane topcoats. Low adhesion together with internal
   stress and lack of paint film flexibility and strength are expected to
   be the main reasons for the cracking and flaking of protective coatings.
   Internal stresses and mechanical properties were discussed in two
   previous papers. Topcoat flaking would occur if in-plane tensile
   stresses exceed the shear mode adhesive strength of the topcoat. Today's
   qualification test regime only covers tensile mode adhesion under dry
   conditions. Any reduction in adhesion from moisture is not covered.
   Therefore, dry and wet adhesion has been measured in a new test setup,
   allowing load to be applied in both tensile mode and shear mode. Two
   commercially available polysiloxane topcoats have been tested, both as a
   single coat and as part of a two-coat system. The laboratory tests have
   shown that the internal stresses reported in the earlier paper could not
   cause flaking of any of the tested products. Shear load mode adhesion
   was found to be insignificantly different from the tensile load mode
   adhesion. Water immersion reduced the adhesive strength in some tests,
   but not to the extent where this would indicate vulnerability to topcoat
   flaking.}},

Abstract = {{Anorectal melanomas represent a group of mucosal melanomas with unknown
   etiology and poor prognosis. The lesions can be misdiagnosed as
   hemorrhoids during clinical examination. We reviewed the morphological
   and clinical features of 14 anorectal melanomas, and discuss the
   treatment modalities of this entity. Fourteen patients who were
   diagnosed with anorectal malignant melanoma between 1997 and 2004 were
   evaluated with regard to age, sex, size, morphology, lymph node or
   distant metastasis, treatment modality and survival. Eight patients were
   female and six were male, and their mean age was 58 years. The size of
   melanoma ranged from 3 cm to 8 cm. Pathological evaluation revealed
   epithelioid and spindle cell type tumor in seven and two patients,
   respectively, whereas, in the remaining seven patients, the tumor was
   composed of both types. Pigmentation was apparent in all tumors. There
   was lymph node metastasis in 11 patients and distant metastasis in all
   patients. Eleven patients underwent abdominoperineal resection and three
   were treated by local excision. Mean survival was 8.7 months. Prognosis
   of anorectal melanoma remains poor. Awareness of the diverse
   clinicopathological features of these lesions, both on the part of the
   clinicians and pathologists, is crucial for their early detection and
   proper treatment.}},

Title = {{A prospective study into the aetiology of lymphocytic duodenosis}},

Abstract = {{P>Background
   Lymphocytic duodenosis is defined by normal villous architecture and
   intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) > 25 per 100 enterocytes. Such
   patients should not be diagnosed with coeliac disease, solely by
   histology, as previous retrospective studies have suggested other
   associations with lymphocytic duodenosis.
   Aim
   To study prospectively the aetiology of lymphocytic duodenosis.
   Methods
   One hundred patients with lymphocytic duodenosis were investigated
   rigorously for coeliac disease and other known associations for
   lymphocytic duodenosis by initial investigations of coeliac serology,
   and exclusion of infection. Of 34 with no explanation for lymphocytic
   duodenosis, 29 underwent repeat duodenal biopsies following a gluten
   challenge.
   Results
   Coeliac disease was present in 16\% of patients with lymphocytic
   duodenosis. In the absence of a positive coeliac diagnosis, lymphocytic
   duodenosis was most commonly associated with drugs (21\%), infection
   (19\%), immune dysregulation (4\%), inflammatory bowel disease (2\%),
   microscopic colitis (2\%), sarcoidosis (1\%) and IgA deficiency (1\%).
   Of 34 with no known associations, 18 had symptoms of irritable bowel
   syndrome (IBS), and in 29 patients investigated with repeat duodenal
   biopsies, the IEL count returned to normal in 22.
   Conclusions
   In 66\% of cases of lymphocytic duodenosis, a known association can be
   found by further investigations; importantly, 16\% will have coeliac
   disease. In those with no apparent cause, there may be an association
   with IBS and the IEL count becomes normal on repeat biopsy in 76\%.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate nitrification rates in
   algal-bacterial biofilms of waste stabilization ponds (WSP) under
   different conditions of light, oxygen and pH. Biofilms were grown on
   wooden plates of 6.0 cm by 8.0cm by 0.4 cm in a PVC tray continuously
   fed with synthetic wastewater with initial NH4-N and Chemical Oxygen
   Demand (COD) concentrations of 40 mg l(-1) and 100 mg l(-1),
   respectively, under light intensity of 85-95 mu E m(-2) s(-1). Batch
   activity tests were carried out by exposure of the plates to light
   conditions as above (to simulate day time), dim light of 1.8-2.2 mu E
   m(-2) s(-1) (to simulate reduced light as in deeper locations in WSP)
   and dark conditions (to simulate night time). Dissolved oxygen (DO)
   concentration and pH were controlled. At some experiments, both
   parameters were kept constant, and at others they were left to vary as
   in WSP. Results show biofilm nitrification rates of 945-1817 mg-N m(-2)
   d(-1) and 1124-1615 mg-N m(-2) d(-1) for light and dark experiments.
   When the minimum DO was 4.1 mg l(-1), the biofilm nitrification rates
   under light and dark conditions did not differ significantly at 95\%
   confidence. When the minimum DO in the dim light experiment was 3.2 mg
   l(-1), the nitrification rates under light and dim light conditions were
   945 mg-N m(-2) d(-1) and 563 mg-N m(-2) d(-1) and these significantly
   differed. Further decrease of DO to 1.1 mg l(-1) under dark conditions
   resulted in more decrease of the nitrification rates to 156 mg-N m(-2)
   d(-1). It therefore seems that under these experimental conditions,
   biofilm nitrification rates are significantly reduced at a certain point
   when bulk water DO is between 3.2 mg l(-1) and 4.1 mg l(-1). As long as
   bulk water DO under dark is high, light is not important in influencing
   the process of nitrification. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{NTPDase (EC 3.6.1.5) occurs in lymphocytes and plays an important role
   in immune function, in that hydrolyzes extracellular nucleoside tri-
   and/or diphosphates to form AMP. Pythium insidiosum causes the disease
   pythiosis, a pyogranulomatous disease of horses, dogs, cattle, cats and
   humans. Most antifungal drugs are ineffective against this pathogen, and
   immunotherapy, a treatment approach that relies on the injection of P.
   insidiosum antigen, has been successfully used in humans and horses to
   manage this disease. In this study, we investigated NTPDase activity in
   lymphocytes from rabbits inoculated with zoospores of P. insidiosum.
   After immunotherapy, we investigated the relationship between enzymatic
   activity and the pattern of the immune response. One milliliter of
   zoospores was inoculated subcutaneously into the coastal region of each
   rabbit. An average of 17,500 viable mobile zoospores/mL of induction
   medium was administered. Inoculated rabbits were checked weekly, and the
   subcutaneous nodular area (cm(2)) was measured 28 days after
   inoculation. Rabbits that developed lesions received four doses of
   immunotherapy at intervals of 14 days. Blood samples were collected by
   heart puncture twice a month for the determination of NTPDase activity.
   The results demonstrated that NTPDase activity in lymphocytes was
   increased in relation to ATP hydrolysis (by about 100\%) in pythiosis
   and returned to normal values after immunotherapy. The data
   demonstrating NTPDase activity before and after immunotherapy reinforce
   the previously elaborated hypothesis that the change from a Th2 to a Th1
   immune response is responsible for the curative properties of
   immunotherapy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a new accurate and efficient technique for the
   analysis of H-plane single or multiple rods in rectangular waveguides.
   The new method is based on a mode matching procedure that matches open
   space and guided modes along a circular boundary that encloses the rods.
   Since the EM fields around the obstacles are expanded using open space
   cylindrical modes, a full analytical (and highly efficient) solution can
   be obtained for dielectric or metallic circular posts. However, this
   technique can also cope with any arbitrary geometry of the H plane
   obstacles. In such a case, a numerical method should be used to
   characterize geometries other than circular in terms of cylindrical
   modes, and therefore the efficiency would be reduced.
   The method has been successfully applied to the analysis and design of
   several H plane filters with different topologies involving single
   centered and off-centered posts, as well as double post geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the neuropsychological factors that contribute to
   individual differences in the asymmetric orientation along the mental
   number line. The present study documents healthy subjects' preference
   for small numbers over large numbers in a random number generation task.
   This preference, referred to as ``small-number bias{''} (SNB), varied
   with prefrontal functional lateralization: it was larger in participants
   with over-proportionately better performance in design fluency compared
   to letter fluency than in participants with over-proportionately better
   performance in letter fluency when compared to design fluency.
   Asymmetries in learning and memory tasks (verbal vs. non-verbal) were
   not related to direction or size of the SNB. We conclude that
   hemispheric asymmetries of specifically prefrontal executive functions
   are predictive of an individual's lateral orientation bias along the
   mental number line. Therefore, the focus on parietal contributions to
   spatial-numerical associations may not be justified. Random number
   generation may be a helpful method to further explore these associations
   uncontaminated by the asymmetric involvement of response effectors. (C)

Abstract = {{This study aimed at identifying clinical factors for predicting
   hematologic toxicity after radioimmunotherapy with Y-90-ibritumomab
   tiuxetan or I-131-tositumomab in clinical practice. Methods: Hematologic
   data were available from 14 non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with
   Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan and 18 who received I-131-tositumomab. The
   percentage baseline at nadir and 4 wk post nadir and the time to nadir
   were selected as the toxicity indicators for both platelets and
   neutrophils. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to
   identify significant predictors (P < 0.05) of each indicator. Results:
   For both platelets and neutrophils, pooled and separate analyses of
   Y-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan and I-131-tositumomab data yielded the time
   elapsed since the last chemotherapy as the only significant predictor of
   the percentage baseline at nadir. The extent of bone marrow involvement
   was not a significant factor in this study, possibly because of the
   short time elapsed since the last chemotherapy of the 7 patients with
   bone marrow involvement. Because both treatments were designed to
   deliver a comparable bone marrow dose, this factor also was not
   significant. None of the 14 factors considered was predictive of the
   time to nadir. The R-2 value for the model predicting percentage
   baseline at nadir was 0.60 for platelets and 0.40 for neutrophils. This
   model predicted the platelet and neutrophil toxicity grade to within +/-
   1 for 28 and 30 of the 32 patients, respectively. For the 7 patients
   predicted with grade I thrombocytopenia, 6 of whom had actual grade
   I-II, dosing might be increased to improve treatment efficacy.
   Conclusion: The elapsed time since the last chemotherapy can be used to
   predict hematologic toxicity and customize the current dosing method in
   radioimmunotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: The aim of this study was to search for Bacillus thuringiensis
   (Bt) harbouring cry1A gene which could effectively control cotton pest,
   American bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.
   Methods and Results: cry gene profiling of 50 Bt isolates showed the
   presence of cry1, cry2, cry3, cry4, cry7, cry8 and cry9 genes. None of
   the isolates harboured cry1 gene alone. It was always found in
   combination with cry3. There was no isolate positive for cry10 gene.
   Considering isolates with single cry genes, the frequency of cry4 was
   predominant (22\%) followed cry2 (6\%), cry3 (4\%) and cry8 (2\%).
   Isolates having two cry genes in combination had 14\% incidence for cry2
   + cry4, 12\% for cry3 + cry4 and 10\% for cry1 + cry3. The most dominant
   three gene linkage was cry1 + cry3 + cry4. Further profiling of cry1
   gene showed that cry1K gene was abundantly present in all combinations
   such as cry1A, cry1D, cry1F and cry1I. However, cry1C existed
   independent of other subtypes. Finally, the Bt isolates with cry1A were
   analyzed for 16S rRNA gene, which showed two distinct groups of isolates
   on the basis of sequence homology. Bioassays of spore-crystal mixtures
   of SBS-Bt4, 8, 17, 21 and 26 harbouring cry1 against neonate larvae of
   H. armigera showed LC50 1288, 1202, 467.7, 524.8 and 108.5 mu g ml(-1).
   The SBS-Bt26 showed fourfold higher toxicity than the cry 1Ac harbouring
   positive control, HD-73.
   Conclusions: None of the isolates harboured single cry 1 gene. They were
   always in combination of two or three genes. A Bt isolate (Bt26) had
   fourfold higher toxicity against H. armigera larvae compared with the
   positive control HD 73 and hence can be commercially exploited to
   control insect pest.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The inter relationship between the
   cry genes content and the toxicity may allow better understanding of Bt
   ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Primary vasculitis is the result of idiopathic inflammation m blood
   vessel walls T cells are believed to play a critical role but the nature
   of the pathological T cell response remains obscure In this study we
   provide evidence that CD4(+) T lymphocytes activated in the presence of
   syngeneic vascular smooth muscle cells were sufficient to induce
   vasculitic lesions after adoptive transfer to recipient mice
   Additionally the disease is triggered m the absence of antibodies in
   experiments in which both the donors of stimulated lymphocytes and the
   transfer recipients were mice that were deficient in B cells Tracking
   and proliferation of the transferred cells and their cytokine profiles
   were assessed by fluo rescence tagging and flow cytometry Proliferating
   CD4+ T cells were evident 3 days after transfer corresponding to the
   occurrence of vasculitic le slops in mouse lungs The transferred T
   lymphocytes exhibited Th1 and Th17 cytokine profiles and minimal Th2
   However, 1 week after vasculitis in duction effector functions could be
   successfully recalled in Th1 cells but not in Th17 cells Additionally in
   the absence of constitutive interferon gamma expression T cells
   sensitized by vascular smooth muscle cells failed to induce vasculitis
   In conclusion our results show that Th1 cells play a key role in
   eliciting vasculitis m this murine model and that induction of the

Abstract = {{In Drosophila, the checkpoint protein-2 kinase (DmChk2) and its
   downstream effector protein, Dmp53, are required for DNA damage-mediated
   cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis. In this study we focus on
   understanding the function of these two apoptosis inducing factors
   during ovarian development. We found that expression of Dmp53, but not
   DmChk2, led to loss of ovarian stem cells. We demonstrate that
   expression of DmChk2, but not Dmp53, induced mid-oogenesis cell death.
   DmChk2 induced cell death was not suppressed by Dmp53 mutant, revealing
   for the first time that in Drosophila, over-expression of DmChk2 can
   induce cell death which is independent of Dmp53. We found that
   over-expression of caspase inhibitors such as DIAP1, p35 and p49 did not
   suppress DmChk2- and Dmp53-induced cell death. Thus, our study reveals
   stage-specific effects of Dmp53 and DmChk2 in oogenesis. Moreover, our
   results demonstrate that although DmChk2 and Dmp53 affect different
   stages of ovarian development, loss of ovarian stem cells by p53
   expression and mid-oogenesis cell death induced by DmChk2 do not require
   caspase activity.}},

   In this article, we report that SCR from Schistosoma-infected mouse
   showed a significant decrease in its V (max) and K (m) compared to
   control using both cytochrome c and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as
   substrates. Furthermore, the kinetic studies of the purified SCR in the
   absence and presence of the schistosomicidal drugs praziquantel and
   Commiphora extract reveal that both drugs have an inhibitory action on
   the enzyme from the control and Schistosoma-infected mice and
   praziquantel changes the type of inhibition of SCR towards cytochrome c
   from mixed type in control to a competitive one in the case of the
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{Samples with nominal compositions MoSnxSr2YCu2O8-delta (0 <= x <= 0.075)

   MoSr2YCu2O8-delta. The upper critical fields of the samples were
   determined using magnetization, susceptibility and resistivity
   measurements. It was established that the Sn-doping weakly affects the
   first and the intragrain second critical field of Mo-1212 but enhances
   the extrapolated to T = 0 (i.e. the intergrain) upper critical field.
   The observed phenomena were discussed on the basis of the
   Josephson-junction-arrays model. A phenomenological expression

Abstract = {{P>The objective of this work was to estimate covariance functions using
   random regression models on B-splines functions of animal age, for
   weights from birth to adult age in Canchim cattle. Data comprised 49 011
   records on 2435 females. The model of analysis included fixed effects of
   contemporary groups, age of dam as quadratic covariable and the
   population mean trend taken into account by a cubic regression on
   orthogonal polynomials of animal age. Residual variances were modelled
   through a step function with four classes. The direct and maternal
   additive genetic effects, and animal and maternal permanent
   environmental effects were included as random effects in the model. A
   total of seventeen analyses, considering linear, quadratic and cubic
   B-splines functions and up to seven knots, were carried out. B-spline
   functions of the same order were considered for all random effects.
   Random regression models on B-splines functions were compared to a
   random regression model on Legendre polynomials and with a multitrait
   model. Results from different models of analyses were compared using the
   REML form of the Akaike Information criterion and Schwarz' Bayesian
   Information criterion. In addition, the variance components and genetic
   parameters estimated for each random regression model were also used as
   criteria to choose the most adequate model to describe the covariance
   structure of the data. A model fitting quadratic B-splines, with four
   knots or three segments for direct additive genetic effect and animal
   permanent environmental effect and two knots for maternal additive
   genetic effect and maternal permanent environmental effect, was the most
   adequate to describe the covariance structure of the data. Random
   regression models using B-spline functions as base functions fitted the
   data better than Legendre polynomials, especially at mature ages, but
   higher number of parameters need to be estimated with B-splines
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{Most biological rates and times decrease systematically with increasing
   organism body size. We use an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model
   of West Nile Virus in birds to show that pathogen replication rates
   decline with host body size, but natural immune system (NIS) response
   rates do not change systematically with body size. The scale-invariant
   detection and response of the NIS is surprising since the NIS has to
   search for small quantities of pathogens through larger physical spaces
   in larger organisms, and also respond by producing larger absolute
   quantities of antibody in larger organisms. We hypothesize that the NIS
   has evolved an architecture to efficiently neutralize pathogens. We
   investigate three different hypothesized NIS architectures using an
   Agent Based Model (ABM). We find that a sub-modular NIS architecture, in
   which lymph node number and size both increase sublinearly with body
   size, efficiently balances the tradeoff between local pathogen detection
   and global response. This leads to nearly scale-invariant detection and
   response consistent with experimental data. Similar to the NIS, physical
   space and resources are also important constraints on distributed
   systems, for example low-powered robots connected by short-range
   wireless communication. We show that the sub-modular design principles
   of the NIS can be applied to problems such as distributed robot control
   to efficiently balance the tradeoff between local search for a solution
   and global response or proliferation of the solution. We demonstrate
   that the lymphatic network of the NIS efficiently balances local and
   global communication, and we suggest a new approach for Artificial
   Immune Systems (AIS) that uses a sub-modular architecture to facilitate
   distributed search.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The determination of the stoichiometry of complex formation and the
   mechanism of fluorescence quenching of tehnisartan (TMST) with Y(III)
   and Nd(III) was carried out in great detail by a fluorometric method.
   The quenching was interpreted in terms of chelation-enhanced quenching.
   The experimental results showed that both Y(III) and Nd(III) quench the
   intrinsic fluorescence of TMST without inducing any conformational
   change in it. The quenching of fluorescence was found to be static and
   due to the formation of a nonfluorescent complex in the ground state.
   Linear Stern - Volmer plots were obtained for both complexes. The pH of
   the solution was found to have a profound effect on quenching, and
   effective quenching was obtained at pH 7. The stoichiometry of metal -
   TMST complexes was found to be 1:2 through the Benesi-Hildebrand method.
   The quenching constant K-sv and association constant were determined
   together with their thermodynamic parameters at (25, 35, and 45) degrees
   C. The negative Delta G values indicate that the complexation process is
   spontaneous. A decrease in log K with an increase in temperature and the
   negative values of Delta H for the complexation show that all the

   life impedes the process of knowledge transmission across time. We
   derive a simple and intuitive form of the dependence of aggregate
   knowledge transfer on adult mortality and incorporate it into a model of
   endogenous growth. We then quantitatively examine the relevance of the
   proposed link in application to the long-run growth experience of
   England. Our calibration exercise suggests that the reduction in adult
   mortality, by improving knowledge transmission across time and
   encouraging more innovation, was a quantitatively important force behind
   the takeoff in output per capita.}},

Title = {{Ureteroileal Anastomosis With Intraluminal Visualization: Technique and

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES Although the ileal conduit is the most well-established
   urinary diversion, the optimal technique for ureteroileal anastomosis
   remains controversial. Here, we present a technique for anastomosis of
   the ureters from within the lumen of the ileal conduit, under direct
   visualization. We examine the rate of ureteral stricture using this
   method, and review the literature regarding ureteroenteric anastomotic
   complications with various techniques.
   METHODS An intraluminal technique for ureteroenteric anastomsosis was
   performed by opening the conduit on the antimesenteric border to allow
   direct visualization of the ureteroileal anastomosis. Using our
   prospectively collected database, we investigated the prevalence of
   anastomotic stricture in patients undergoing urinary diversion using
   this method for anastomosis.
   RESULTS One-hundred eighteen patients underwent ileal conduit diversion
   with ureteroileal anastomoses performed as described. Median
   postoperative follow-up was 15 months. Ureteral strictures were
   identified in 5/118 patients (4.2\%). Of the patients with strictures,
   one was successfully treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation, three
   were managed with chronic ureteral stents, and one was managed with a
   chronic percutaneous nephrostomy. Review of the recent literature
   reveals stricture rates up to 10\% with current techniques.
   CONCLUSIONS We conclude from these results that during ileal conduit
   creation, intraluminal anastomosis of the ureters to the ileal segment
   under direct vision represents a viable alternative to other techniques,
   with complication rates that compare favorably with other reported
   series. UROLOGY 76: 1496-1500, 2010. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that the source of current and erosion plasma in a
   unipolar arc is explosive electron emission, which occurs as ejection of
   individual portions of electrons named ectons. This phenomenon is
   responsible for the numerous microcraters left by unipolar arcs on metal
   surfaces. An arc of this type is self-sustained due to the interaction
   of the erosion plasma with the electrode surface. The duration of an arc
   is determined by the conditions of its initiation: the higher the arc
   current, and hence, the number of cells in the spot formed on arc
   initiation, the longer the arc operation.}},

Abstract = {{Non-blazar active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been recently established
   as a class of gamma-ray sources. M87, a nearby representative of this
   class, shows fast TeV variability on timescales of a few days. We
   suggest a scenario of flare gamma-ray emission in non-blazar AGNs based
   on a red giant (RG) interacting with the jet at the base. We solve the
   hydrodynamical equations that describe the evolution of the envelope of
   an RG blown by the impact of the jet. If the RG is at least slightly
   tidally disrupted by the supermassive black hole, enough stellar
   material will be blown by the jet, expanding quickly until a significant
   part of the jet is shocked. This process can render suitable conditions
   for energy dissipation and proton acceleration, which could explain the
   detected day-scale TeV flares from M87 via proton-proton collisions.
   Since the radiation produced would be unbeamed, such an event should be
   mostly detected from non-blazar AGNs. They may be frequent phenomena,
   detectable in the GeV-TeV range even up to distances of similar to 1 Gpc
   for the most powerful jets. The counterparts at lower energies are
   expected to be not too bright. M87, and nearby non-blazar AGNs in
   general, can be fast variable sources of gamma-rays through RG/jet
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Information on host plant preference of agriculturally important insect
   pests, such as Lygus hesperus (Knight), can be helpful in predicting its
   occurrence and future movement among crop and non-crop host plants. A
   field study was conducted during 2005 and 2006 to evaluate the host
   preference of Lygus to cotton and four other host plants in the Texas
   High Plains, including alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), wild sunflower
   (Helianthus annuus L.), Russian thistle (Salsola iberica L.) and pigweed
   (Amaranthus palmeri L.). Sampling for both nymphs and adults during 2005
   (July to November) and 2006 (June to November) showed that alfalfa and
   Russian thistle were the two most preferred hosts out of the five hosts
   evaluated. Abundance of nymphs (numbers per 50 sweeps per host plant)
   during the sampling period also indicated the superior reproductive
   suitability of alfalfa and Russian thistle. Cotton appeared to be the
   least attractive host plant for Lygus when Russian thistle and alfalfa
   were available in the host mosaic. Seasonal abundance of Lygus was found
   to be lower during 2006 compared to 2005, which may be explained by the
   difference in rainfall patterns during these two years. In terms of
   species dominance, L. hesperus was the most dominant species in the
   sampled population followed by an inconsiderable fraction of L. elisus
   and L. lineolaris.}},

Abstract = {{Both the sperm and oocyte are terminally differentiated cells, but
   within a very short post-fertilization period, their genomes are
   converted into a totipotent zygote The process of this transformation
   has been studied in a number of mammals as well as in the pig, for which
   very inconsistent results have been published To clarify these
   inconsistencies, we have used the interspecies intracytoplasmic sperm
   injection technique for embryo production and subsequent paternal genome
   remodeling evaluation First, we injected boar sperm heads into ovulated
   and in vitro matured mouse oocytes The boar spermatozoa consistently
   decondense in ovulated oocytes and form fully developed pronuclei with
   demethylated DNA (5-methylcytosine, 5-MeC) Additional labeling against
   other histone modifications (H3/K9 dimethylation, H3/K4 trimethylation)
   and HP1 (Heterochromatin Protein 1) revealed similarity to those changes
   that are typical for natural mouse zygotes On the other hand, no
   decondensation and formation of male pronuclei were observed, in spite
   of obvious oocyte activation, m in vitro matured oocytes For this
   reason, we have evaluated the reprogramming parameters of in vitro
   matured mouse oocytes in more detail In mouse zygotes (intraspecific),
   both pronuclei were consistently formed, but no sperm head chromatin
   demethylation was detected after 5-MeC labeling Our observations suggest
   that porcine sperm heads are capable of undergoing active demethylation
   in in moo matured mouse oocytes On the other hand, in vitro matured
   oocytes possess much lower sperm remodeling capabilities}},

Abstract = {{Processes occurring in freshwater, estuarine, and marine habitats
   strongly influence the growth, survival and reproductive success of
   salmonids. Nonetheless, implementing an ecosystem model explicitly
   linking these important habitats has been hindered by the inability to
   track the source identity of individuals where they co-occur. Here we
   explore the development and integration of natural markers-molecular and
   isotopic to characterize the natal sources of Chinook salmon
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Mid and Upper Columbia River
   summer/fall-run (UCR Su/F) population. Microsatellite DNA markers
   identified the majority of juveniles collected in rivers and hatcheries
   in the Mid and Upper Columbia River watershed to the Summer/Fall-run
   population in this watershed with 90\% posterior probabilities of group
   membership. Strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86) measured in the natal
   rearing portion of the otolith showed significant geographic variation
   among natal rivers and hatcheries. Natal sites exhibited a wide dynamic
   range in Sr-87/Sr-86 source signatures (0.7043-0.7142), such that on
   average 61\% of individuals were correctly classified to the location
   from which they were collected. We found that multilocus genotypes and
   otolith Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios collected on the same individuals were
   complementary markers when applied in a hierarchy. Microsatellites
   successfully assigned individuals to the broader UCR Su/F genetic group
   and Sr-87/Sr-86 provided finer-scale geographic assignments to five
   natal river and hatchery groups nested within the UCR Su/F population.
   The temporal stability of both genetic and Sr-87/Sr-86 markers, together
   with the coast-wide microsatellite baseline currently being used for
   mixed-stock fisheries management supports the further development and
   integration of Sr-87/Sr-86 markers to potentially achieve finer levels
   of stock resolution. Stock identification at the scales of individual
   rivers and hatcheries would help elucidate the abundance, distribution,
   and the relative contributions of natal sources important for the
   recovery and spatial management of Chinook salmon.}},

Journal = {{RESPIRATORY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The causation of asthma is poorly understood. Risk factors
   for atopic and non-atopic asthma may be different. This study aimed to
   analyze the associations between markers of poverty, dirt and infections
   and wheezing in atopic and non-atopic children.
   Methods: 1445 children were recruited from a population-based cohort in
   Salvador, Brazil. Wheezing was assessed using the ISAAC questionnaire
   and atopy defined as allergen-specific IgE >= 0.70 kU/L. Relevant social
   factors, environmental exposures and serological markers for childhood
   infections were investigated as risk factors using multivariate
   multinomial logistic regression.
   Results: Common risk factors for wheezing in atopic and non-atopic
   children, respectively, were parental asthma and respiratory infection
   in early childhood. No other factor was associated with wheezing in
   atopic children. Factors associated with wheezing in non-atopics were
   low maternal educational level (OR 1.49, 95\% CI 0.98-2.38), low
   frequency of room cleaning (OR 2.49, 95\% CI 1.27-4.90), presence of
   rodents in the house (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.06-2.09), and day care
   attendance (OR 1.52, 95\% CI 1.01-2.29).
   Conclusions: Non-atopic wheezing was associated with risk factors
   indicative of poverty, dirt and infections. Further research is required
   to more precisely define the mediating exposures and the mechanisms by
   which they may cause non-atopic wheeze.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has reported an association between narcissism in youth
   and a variety of externalizing behavior problems. The extent to which
   narcissism, conceptualized in two ways (i.e., as part of psychopathy; as
   a constellation of maladaptive and adaptive features), was related to
   internalizing problems in adolescents was examined in this study.
   Participants were 534 at-risk adolescents ages 16-19, attending a
   military-style residential program. Psychopathy-linked narcissism was
   positively associated with self-reported internalizing problems:
   however, narcissism assessed from the Narcissistic Personality Inventory
   for Children (NPIC: Barry, Frick, \& Killian, 2003) was negatively
   associated with such symptoms. Perceptions of peer relationships
   appeared to play a role in this latter association. The implications for
   the understanding of youth narcissism are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective The goal of this paper is to discuss cancer-related fatigue
   (CRF) and address issues related to the investigation into potential
   biological and genetic causal mechanisms. The objectives are to: (1)
   describe CRF as a component of quality of life (QOL); (2) address
   measurement issues that have slowed progress toward an understanding of
   mechanisms underlying this symptom; (3) review biological pathways and
   genetic approaches that have promise for the exploration of causal
   mechanisms of CRF; and (4) offer directions for future research.
   Methods Review, synthesis, and interpretation of the literature.
   Results Until recently, CRF and QOL have been understood primarily as
   subjective patient-reported experiences. With increased understanding of
   human genetics, theories and research are being expanded to incorporate
   biological and genetic understandings of these subjective experiences.
   Proposed biological and genetic mechanisms of CRF that have been
   examined include cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   (HPA) axis dysfunction, five hydroxy tryptophan (5-HT) neurotransmitter
   dysregulation, circadian rhythm disruption, alterations in adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) and muscle metabolism, and vagal afferent activation.
   Approaches to the study of genetic mechanisms have also been addressed
   including candidate genes, genome-wide scanning, and gene expression.
   Based on the review and synthesis of the literature, directions for
   future research are proposed.
   Conclusions Understanding the biological and genetic basis of CRF has
   the potential to contribute to a more complete understanding of the
   genetic determinants of QOL.}},

Abstract = {{The approach to the surgical treatment of lateral oral cavity and
   oro-pharyngeal cancer has undergone many changes over the years, passing
   from a demolitive approach involving segmental resectioning of the
   mandible to a conservative approach with temporary mandibulotomy. The
   complications resulting from these two different approaches invited
   further review of the various indications related to them. The present
   report considers, through a retrospective analysis, whether the
   sub-mandibular approach, which envisages the use of the harmonic
   instrument, is an oncologically correct alternative and whether it
   actually reduces the number of early and late complications. From 2003
   to 2009, 259 patients underwent surgery for lateral oral cavity and
   oro-pharyngeal cancer. A sub-mandibular approach was used in 163
   patients, and a conservative trans-mandibular approach in 12. The
   results showed that the number of late complications and T recurrences
   was significantly lower in those patients in whom the sub-mandibular
   approach was carried out. There was no difference in the microscopic
   examination of the resection margins. The use of the harmonic instrument
   made it possible to perform ``en bloc{''} (T+N) operations working in
   narrow spaces with less intra-operative bleeding, which contributed to
   adequate oncological radicality.}},

Abstract = {{Obturator anterior hip dislocation is very rare. Poor results are
   described in patients with additional large transchondral fractures and
   treatment of these injuries remains challenging. Appropriate treatment
   recommendations are missing in the literature. This case report
   introduces surgical hip dislocation for osteochondral autograft
   transplantation with graft harvest from the nonweightbearing area of the
   head-neck junction as a salvage procedure in a large femoral head
   defect. We report the treatment and outcome of a 48-year-old man who
   sustained an anterior dislocation of the left hip after a motorcycle
   accident. After initial closed reduction in the emergency room, imaging
   analysis revealed a large osteochondral defect of the femoral head
   within the weightbearing area (10 x 20 mm, depth: 5 mm). The hip was
   exposed with a surgical hip dislocation using a trochanteric osteotomy.
   An osteochondral autograft was harvested from a nonweightbearing area of
   the femoral head and transferred into the defect. The patient was
   prospectively examined clinically and radiologically. Two years
   postoperatively, the patient was free of pain and complaints. The
   function of the injured hip was comparable to that of the contralateral,
   healthy hip and showed satisfying radiologic results. Surgical hip
   dislocation with a trochanteric flip osteotomy is a simple, one-step
   technique that allows full inspection of the hip to treat osteochondral
   femoral defects by osteochondral transplantation. The presented
   technique, used as a salvage procedure in a large femoral head defect,
   yielded good clinical and satisfying radiologic outcomes at the midterm.}},

Abstract = {{In August 2009 a combined epidemiological and ecological pilot study was
   conducted to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in the form
   of exposures to toxic metals experienced by mine workers and Indigenous
   Mam Mayan near the Marlin Mine in Guatemala In the human study there
   were no differences in blood and urine metals when comparing five mine
   workers with eighteen non-mine workers and there were no discernible
   relationships between metal exposures and self-reported health measures
   in any study group On the other hand individuals residing closest to the
   mine had significantly higher levels of certain metals (urinary mercury
   copper arsenic and zinc) when compared to those living further away The
   levels of blood aluminum manganese and cobalt were elevated in
   comparison to established normal ranges in many individuals however
   there was no apparent relationship to proximity to the mine or
   occupation and thus are of unclear significance In the ecological study
   several metals (aluminum manganese and cobalt) were found significantly
   elevated in the river water and sediment sites directly below the mine
   when compared to sites elsewhere When the human and ecological results
   are combined they suggest that exposures to certain metals may be
   elevated in sites near the mine but it is not clear if the current
   magnitude of these elevations poses a significant threat to health The
   authors conclude that more robust studies are needed while parallel
   efforts to minimize the ecological and human impacts of mining proceed
   This is critical particularly as the impact of the exposures found could
   be greatly magnified by expected increases in mining activity over time

Abstract = {{We explore how radiative cooling, supernova feedback, cosmic rays, and a
   new model of the energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
   affect the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) power spectra. To
   do this, we use a suite of hydrodynamical TreePM-SPH simulations of the
   cosmic web in large periodic boxes and tailored higher resolution
   simulations of individual galaxy clusters. Our AGN feedback simulations
   match the recent universal pressure profile and cluster mass scaling
   relations of the REXCESS X-ray cluster sample better than previous
   analytical or numerical approaches. For multipoles l less than or
   similar to 2000, our power spectra with and without enhanced feedback
   are similar, suggesting that theoretical uncertainties over that range
   are relatively small, although current analytic and semi-analytic
   approaches overestimate this SZ power. We find the power at high
   2000-10,000 multipoles in which the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)
   and South Pole Telescope (SPT) probe is sensitive to the feedback
   prescription, and hence can constrain the theory of intracluster gas, in
   particular for the highly uncertain redshifts > 0.8. The apparent
   tension between sigma(8) from primary cosmic microwave background power
   and from analytic SZ spectra inferred using ACT and SPT data is lessened
   with our AGN feedback spectra.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses using the spatial frequency of species occurrences, as obtained
   by faunal atlases, allows us to obtain information on assembly rules of
   local bird assemblages. Here, diversity/dominance diagrams have been
   used to relate the structural differences in two phenology-based
   assemblages (i.e. sedentary species and long distance migrants) obtained
   by an occurrence data set throughout a local breeding bird atlas in an
   Apennine nature reserve of Central Italy. Among the 58 breeding bird
   species sampled, 28 \% were long distance migrants. On the average, long
   distance migrants were spatially rarer when compared to sedentary
   species. In diversity/dominance diagrams, sedentary species show a trend
   similar to that obtained by the entire community (broken-stick pattern),
   while long distance migrants have a curve with slope tending to fit
   geometrically. Geometric species models show steep plots and are typical
   of assemblages with high relative dominance, low evenness and few
   species (in our case, the long distance migrants). Moving from geometric
   series towards a broken-stick model, the assemblages tend to be even
   more species rich (in our case, the sedentary species). In a Palearctic
   bird community, long distance migrants are generally rarer in abundance
   and spatial distribution when compared to sedentary species. A different
   phenology may imply differences in species evolution, history and
   ecology with consequences for abundance, distribution and rarity
   patterns. In our study area, patterns of spatial occurrences evidenced
   by diversity/dominance curves may be due to the influence of long-term
   history, short-term competition and local disturbances that
   differentiated the two phenologic sub-assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the effect of social capital access on entrepreneurship.
   Social capital helps entrepreneurs to overcome resource constraints.
   This is especially important in small communities where we often see a
   lack of market-oriented institutions such as venture capital firms.
   Entrepreneurs gain access to social capital via club memberships.
   Combining differences in the number of individual club memberships with
   differences in the importance of social capital across communities, we
   identify a causal small community mark-up effect of individual club
   memberships on entrepreneurship. Assuming that unobserved heterogeneity
   that might influence both the individual's selection into clubs and the
   occupational choice to be an entrepreneur is independent of community
   size, we find that the effect of club membership on the propensity to be
   an entrepreneur is 2.6 percentage points larger in small communities
   than in large communities. Robustness tests support the validity of our
   identifying assumption and results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   (the steward), a doctor, a chaplain, and a large support staff. There
   were rivalries between the middle class administrators of institution
   especially during the reign of Thomas Melville (1867-84). Because over
   twenty percent of the retired seamen were former ship captains, in
   addition to numerous officers such as first mates, there were intense
   power dynamics between Melville (a former clipper ship captain) and the
   retired seamen (inmates). The design of the buildings and grounds, the

Abstract = {{We pose the following question: If a physical experiment were to be
   completely controlled by an algorithm, what effect would the algorithm
   have on the physical measurements made possible by the experiment?
   In a programme to study the nature of computation possible by physical
   systems, and by algorithms coupled with physical systems, we have begun
   to analyse:
   (i) the algorithmic nature of experimental procedures; and
   (ii) the idea of using a physical experiment as an oracle to Turing
   Machines.
   To answer the question, we will extend our theory of experimental
   oracles so that we can use Turing machines to model the experimental
   procedures that govern the conduct of physical experiments. First, we
   specify an experiment that measures mass via collisions in Newtonian
   dynamics and examine its properties in preparation for its use as an
   oracle. We begin the classification of the computational power of
   polynomial time Turing machines with this experimental oracle using
   non-uniform complexity classes. Second, we show that modelling an
   experimenter and experimental procedure algorithmically imposes a limit
   on what can be measured using equipment. Indeed, the theorems suggest a
   new form of uncertainty principle for our knowledge of physical
   quantities measured in simple physical experiments. We argue that the
   results established here are representative of a huge class of
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The complete nucleotide sequence of Great Island virus (GIV) genome was
   determined, along with genome segments (Seg) 1, 2 and 6 of Kemerovo
   (KEMV), Lipovnik (LIPV) and Tribec (TRBV) viruses All four viruses,
   together with Broadhaven virus, are currently classified within the
   species Great Island virus and have been isolated from ticks, birds or
   humans Sequence comparisons showed that Seg-4 of GIV encoded the
   outer-capsid protein responsible for cell attachment, although it was
   approximately half the length of its counterpart in the Culicoides or
   mosquito-transmitted orbiviruses A second overlapping ORF (in the +2
   reading frame) was identified in Seg-9 of GIV, encoding a putative
   dsRNA-binding protein Phylogenetic analyses of the RNA-dependent RNA
   polymerase (Pal) and 12 protein amino acid sequences indicated that the
   tick-borne orbiviruses represent an ancestral group from which the
   mosquito-borne orbiviruses have evolved This mirrors the evolutionary
   relationships between the arthropod vectors of these viruses, supporting
   a co-speciation hypothesis for these arboviruses and their
   arthropod-vectors Phylogenetic analyses of the 12 proteins of KEMV,
   LIPV, TRBV and GIV (showing 82\% amino acid identity) correlated with
   the early classification of Great Island viruses as two distinct
   serocomplexes (Great Island and Kemerovo serocomplexes) Amino acid
   identity levels in the VP1(Pol) and T2 proteins between the two
   serocomplexes were 73 and 82\%, respectively, whilst those between
   previously characterized Orbivirus species are 53-73\% and 26-83\%,
   respectively These data suggest that despite limited genome segment
   reassortment between these two groups, their current classification
   within the same Orbivirus species could be re-evaluated}},

   The empirical analysis based on firm-level data from the Microdatabase

Title = {{Usefulness and limitations of computational models in aortic disease
   risk stratification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In risk stratification of aortic diseases such as aneurysm
   and aortic dissection, diameter is one parameter whose influence on the
   average aortic wall stress is directly described by the Laplace law.
   More advanced mechanical models can be used and may yield additional
   information, such as transmural stress distributions. The question then
   arises of how refined models need to be to provide clinicians with
   practical help.
   Methods: Two sets of finite element models were used. The relative roles
   of diameter, material stiffness, longitudinal stretch, blood pressure,
   wall thickness, and vessel curvature were explored using simplified
   aortic models for comparison with the Laplace law. The influences of the
   material properties nonlinearity and residual stress on the transmural
   stress distribution were investigated using an advanced aortic model
   including recent experimental findings in older humans.
   Results: The Laplace law was confirmed as one effective, basic tool to
   assess the average wall stress in the aortic wall, both in the
   circumferential and longitudinal directions. However, the simplified
   models were sufficient to show that, as already reported in the
   literature, longitudinal stretch and vessel curvature have potentially
   equally strong or even stronger contributions to wall stress than the
   parameters included in the Laplace law. When the advanced model was
   used, and residual stress induced by large opening angles such as found
   in older subjects was introduced, the transmural stress gradient was
   found inverted compared with expectations, with the largest stresses now
   toward the adventitia. The results suggested that the intima may be
   increasingly shielded from higher stresses as one gets older, which
   might be protective against the initiation of dissection tears in the
   thoracic aorta.
   Conclusion: Biomechanical analysis of the aorta may be refined by using
   increasingly detailed computational models. Simplified models can
   readily improve on the Laplace law in the assessment of aortic wall
   stress, and as such, may already contribute to better risk
   stratification of aortic disease. Advanced models may also enhance our
   understanding of the mechanistic aspects in the pathogenesis of aortic
   disease. However, their applicability in a patient-specific context may
   be limited by the large number of input data they require, some of which
   might stay out of the clinicians' reach. (J Vase Surg 2010;52:1572-9.)}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental issue for the restoration of bone defects according to a
   tissue engineering approach is the development of highly porous
   bioactive scaffolds. The polymer burning out method is widely employed
   to fabricate bioceramic scaffolds because of its versatility, simplicity
   and low cost. However, the resulting scaffolds may suffer low porosity
   and non-interconnected pores. In the present contribution a new
   fabrication method is presented. Thanks to a recently developed
   potassium-based bioactive glass, which has the peculiarity to be
   sintered at a relatively low temperature (i.e. similar to 750 degrees
   C), it was possible to use sodium chloride particles as pore generating
   agents, which helped to maintain the shape of the struts during the
   entire sintering process. The salt particles can be easily removed by
   immersing the scaffold in water, giving place to a structure that
   combines high porosity (in the 70-80 vol.\% range) with interconnected
   pores and an appreciable mechanical behaviour (Young's modulus in the
   3.4-3.7 MPa range according to compression tests). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {{Coronary reperfusion of acute coronary syndromes with ST segment
   elevation requires medical treatment involving potential thrombolysis as
   well as very potent anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications. In such
   a therapeutic setting, the risk of bleeding complications may be high
   and should be taken into account accordingly. An accurate definition of
   these bleeding complications is crucial in order to compare all
   currently available treatments and strategies appropriately. The
   heterogeneous definitions often published in the literature make any
   valid interpretations of the results very difficult. These bleeding
   complications, which affect negatively the outcome of patients
   undergoing treatment should be adequately anticipated in our treatment
   strategies. An exhaustive knowledge of the bleeding risk factors is
   necessary in order to adjust the treatment modalities. The occurrence of
   bleeding may be related to the vascular approach used for cardiac
   catheterization. In this respect, the superiority of the radial approach
   has been widely demonstrated. In addition, certain instances of bleeding
   are not related to the vascular approach, such as digestive and
   neurological bleeding which can have very severe consequences.
   Consequently, it is necessary to adapt treatments with heterogeneous
   potential for bleeding to individual bleeding risk factors, which may be
   quantified by scores measuring the bleeding risk. Finally, treatment
   combinations must often be carefully tailored to the characteristics of
   each individual patient. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced age is associated with decrements in episodic memory which are
   more pronounced in memory for associations than for individual items The
   associative deficit hypothesis (ADH) states that age differences in
   recognition memory reflect difficulty in binding components of a memory
   episode and retrieving bound units To date ADH has received support only
   in studies of extreme age groups and the Influence of sex education and
   health on age related associative deficit is unknown We address those
   issues using a verbal paired associate yes no recognition paradigm on a
   lifespan sample of 278 healthy well educated adults In accord with the
   ADH greater age was associated with lower hit and greater false alarm
   rates and more liberal response bias on associative recognition tests
   Women outperformed men on recognition of items and associations but
   among normotensive participants women outperformed men only on memory
   for associations and not on item recognition Thus although supporting
   ADH in a large lifespan sample of healthy adults the findings indicate
   that the effect may be partially driven by an age related increase in
   liberal bias in recognition of associations Sex differences and health
   factors may modify the associative deficit regardless of age}},

   could not be explained by the pharmacokinetic theory available at that
   time. For example rats receiving phenobarbital as an enzyme inducing
   agent exhibited increased elimination of phenylbutazone in vitro in
   liver microsomes and in vivo in whole animals compared to that observed
   in non-induced animals. However, for desipramine, although phenobarbital
   increased elimination in microsomes, no change in plasma disappearance
   was noted in vivo for this drug between rats induced with phenobarbital
   and control rats. Similar in vitro-in vivo discordancies were seen with
   changes in protein binding. The introduction of clearance concepts in
   the early 1970s by Professor Rowland and others provided the scientific
   rationale for these apparently contradictory findings and the
   recognition that clearance, not half-life, was the measure of the body's
   ability to eliminate drugs and most importantly that changes in
   pathology and physiology could be correlated with measures of clearance.
   Up to that time half-life was well recognized in terms of basic chemical
   principles as an appropriate measure of the rate of elimination and
   reflective of changes in the rate of elimination. The difference between
   chemistry and pharmacokinetics, however, is that in chemistry the volume
   in which the reaction occurs does not change. In contrast, in
   pharmacokinetics, disease states and differences in physiology can
   change the space available in which the drug may distribute in the body.
   Thus, it was necessary to develop a pharmacokinetic measure of volume
   that was independent of elimination, i.e., V(ss). Now, the relationship
   between V(ss) and clearance led to a unique measure of time of drug in
   the body, the mean residence time. Although this parameter is calculated
   in all PK programs, very few pharmaceutical scientists know how it can
   be useful. Very recently, we have shown that the concepts of
   accumulation, prediction of which is the clinically relevant use for
   half-life and mean residence time, are flawed and that the appropriate
   time dependent parameter to predict accumulation has not been previously
   correctly identified. Finally, when clearance concepts were developed
   our understanding of the importance of drug transporters was
   nonexistent. A critical, and generally unrecognized assumption (which is
   only explicitly stated in Professor Rowland's seminal 1973 paper), in
   the development of the theory of clearance is that the unbound drug
   concentration in the organ of elimination is in a constant equilibrium
   with the unbound drug concentration in the systemic circulation, where
   drug concentration measurements are made. Transporter drug-drug and
   disease interactions may, in fact, change this equilibrium and
   potentially what we consider as intrinsic clearance, may not be
   independent of an eliminating organ volume parameter, contrary to what
   we have been teaching for the past 37 years.}},

Abstract = {{There is unequivocal evidence of increased air temperatures in Spain as
   a result of climate change Using organic matter, nitrate and soluble
   reactive phosphorus concentrations, we reconstructed changes in water
   quality in 15 montane, pristine streams between 1973 and 2005 in Spain
   We also measured how loading rates of these variables change as a
   function of shifting temperatures Almost half of tested variables were
   related with hypothesized trends of climatic change for air temperature
   Concerning extreme events, the hypothesis of climatic change matched in
   33\% of all relationships, which mostly occurred in Northern Spain
   Regional gradients of population change and soil degradation, however,
   did not explain the geographical distribution of climatic change effects
   The main reason that effects on water quality are not ubiquitous and
   that constraining factors are hardly detected may be that long-term
   signals are the outcome of several interacting processes These are still
   poorly known and may act at different spatial and temporal scales Hence,
   a case-by-case approach might prove more fruitful than a regional one
   when studying water quality responses to climatic change Consideration
   of the balance between extreme and normal events (storm- vs baseflow),
   catchment effects (land use and its effects on evapotranspiration and
   runoff) and in-stream processes (outgassing, mineralization, burial)
   could help increase our understanding of the responses of water quality
   to climatic change}},

Abstract = {{The commercial potential of olive oils from three autochthonous olive
   varieties Bodocal, Racimilla and Negral from Aragon (Spain) has been
   examined. Physicochemical characteristics, sensory analysis, nutritional
   composition, color and pigments were considered. The three varieties are
   generally used for producing table olives or olive oil in coupages but
   not for the production of monovarietal virgin olive oil. The values of
   the physicochemical and sensory analysis for the three olive oils
   corresponded to extra virgin category, however important differences
   among the three oils were observed in relation to pigment content, color
   measurements and fatty acid and phenol and tocopherol composition.
   Several characteristics such as oil yield, fatty acid and phenol and
   tocopherol content and sensory profiles suggested that some of these
   oils are of a promising composition. The olive yield of the Bodocal
   variety was the lowest (17\%) and its corresponding oil had the smallest
   oleic acid (69\%), phenols (272 mg gallic acid/kg) and tocopherol (96
   mg/kg) contents and not equilibrated sensory parameters. The main
   characteristics of the Racimilla variety were a very high oil yield
   (28\%) with very high contents in oleic acid (79 \%) and phenols (831 mg
   gallic acid/kg). The oil of the Negral variety had very equilibrated
   sensory properties and its oleic acid content (76\%) was similar to that
   of Racimilla. Its phenol content (456 mg gallic acid/kg) was between
   that of the other two varieties and its tocopherol content (190 mg/kg)
   was the highest. Therefore, the two last varieties could be of great
   interest for producing monovarietal olive oils.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of low- and high-temperature dry heat, and hot water
   treatments, for disinfesting cottonseed of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
   vasinfectum was investigated. Naturally infected seeds from Louisiana
   were air-heated at 30, 35, and 40 degrees C for up to 24 weeks. Seed
   harvested from bolls inoculated with race 4 of E oxysporum f. sp.
   vasinfectum were incubated in dry heat at 60, 70, and 80 degrees C for 2
   to 14 days, or were immersed in 90 degrees C water from 45 s to 3 min.
   The effects on seed germination and vigor of hot water treatment and a
   subset of the high-temperature dry heat treatments were also examined in
   seeds of a Pima (Gossypium barbadense) and an Upland (G. hirsutum)
   cultivar. Low- or high-temperature dry heat did not eliminate Fusarium
   spp. from the seed, although seed infection declined more rapidly with
   higher incubation temperatures. High-temperature dry heat treatments
   effective in eliminating fusaria also significantly reduced seed vigor
   in both the Pima and Upland cultivars. Seed from all times of immersion
   in hot water were less frequently infected with Fusarium spp. than
   nontreated seed. Incidence of seed infection did not differ
   significantly among immersion times ranging from 75 s to 3 min.
   Immersion in 90 degrees C water did not reduce germination or vigor at
   exposure times <= 120 s and <= 150 s for seeds of Pima and Upland
   cotton, respectively. Results from the hot water treatments suggest that
   thermotherapy may be optimized to provide a tactic to prevent the spread
   of virulent F oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum genotypes into uninfested
   areas through infected seed.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric transformers (PTs) are used as step-up voltage elements in

   point shields are difficult to employ to prevent flashover. This paper
   presents an investigation of piezoelectric flashover prevention by thin
   film encapsulation. Dielectric material was deposited on the PT both
   over the entire device and at specific regions of interest. The
   dielectric was deposited by evaporation to eliminate gaps at the triple
   point. The flashover strength is evaluated depending on the dielectric
   type, thickness, and length. The mechanical loss incurred by the

Abstract = {{Social resource sharing systems are central elements of the Web 2.0 and
   use the same kind of lightweight knowledge representation, called
   folksonomy. Their large user communities and ever-growing networks of
   user-generated content have made them an attractive object of
   investigation for researchers from different disciplines like Social
   Network Analysis, Data Mining, Information Retrieval or Knowledge
   Discovery. In this paper, we summarize and extend our work on different
   aspects of this branch of Web 2.0 research, demonstrated and evaluated
   within our own social bookmark and publication sharing system BibSonomy,
   which is currently among the three most popular systems of its kind. We
   structure this presentation along the different interaction phases of a
   user with our system, coupling the relevant research questions of each
   phase with the corresponding implementation issues. This approach
   reveals in a systematic fashion important aspects and results of the
   broad bandwidth of folksonomy research like capturing of emergent
   semantics, spam detection, ranking algorithms, analogies to search
   engine log data, personalized tag recommendations and information
   extraction techniques. We conclude that when integrating a real-life
   application like BibSonomy into research, certain constraints have to be
   considered; but in general, the tight interplay between our scientific
   work and the running system has made BibSonomy a valuable platform for
   demonstrating and evaluating Web 2.0 research.}},

Journal = {{CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Researchers have identified many factors that are associated with
   worrying, ranging from a verbal/left hemisphere bias to intolerance of
   uncertainty. This paper describes an initiation-termination (IT)
   two-phase model of worrying that attempts to comprehensively put
   together the many different pieces of the puzzle. The first phase of the
   model concerns the development of perceptions of threat, which initiates
   the process of worrying. The strength of a perceived threat is
   influenced by the perceived probability and cost of an undesirable
   future outcome, along with danger/risk salience. The second phase
   concerns acceptance of the prospect of an uncertain future threat, which
   terminates the process of worrying. Factors that play roles in this
   second phase include beliefs about the value of worrying, the desire for
   certainty, a perseverative-iterative style, and a sense of closure
   regarding one's role in trying to prevent or plan for the threat. The
   factors that play roles in these two phases are discussed, as are the
   implications of the model for conceptualizing, treating and conducting
   research on worrying. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tripolar and other electrode configurations that use simultaneous
   stimulation inside the cochlea have been tested to reduce channel
   interactions compared to the monopolar stimulation conventionally used
   in cochlear implant systems. However, these ``focused{''} configurations
   require increased current levels to achieve sufficient loudness. In this
   study, we investigate whether highly accurate recordings of the
   intracochlear electrical field set up by monopolar and tripolar
   configurations correlate to their effect on loudness. We related the
   intra-scalar potential distribution to behavioral loudness, by
   introducing a free parameter (alpha) which parameterizes the degree to
   which the potential field peak set up inside the scala tympani is still
   present at the location of the targeted neural tissue. Loudness
   balancing was performed on four levels between behavioral threshold and
   the most comfortable loudness level in a group of 10 experienced
   Advanced Bionics cochlear implant users. The effect of the amount of
   focusing on loudness was well explained by alpha per subject location
   along the basilar membrane. We found that alpha was unaffected by
   presentation level. Moreover, the ratios between the monopolar and
   tripolar currents, balanced for equal loudness, were approximately the
   same for all presentation levels. This suggests a linear loudness growth
   with increasing current level and that the equal peak hypothesis may
   predict the loudness of threshold as well as at supra-threshold levels.
   These results suggest that advanced electrical field imaging,
   complemented with limited psychophysical testing, more specifically at
   only one presentation level, enables estimation of the loudness growth
   of complex electrode configurations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Recommendations from the EGAPP Working Group: Genomic profiling to
   assess cardiovascular risk to improve cardiovascular health}},
Journal = {{GENETICS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{839-843}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Summary of Recommendations: The Evaluation of Genomic Applications
   in Practice and Prevention Working Group (EWG) found insufficient
   evidence to recommend testing for the 9p21 genetic variant or 57 other
   variants in 28 genes (listed in Table 1) to assess risk for
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population, specifically
   heart disease and stroke. The EWG found that the magnitude of net health
   benefit from use of any of these tests alone or in combination is
   negligible. The EWG discourages clinical use unless further evidence
   supports improved clinical outcomes. Based on the available evidence,
   the overall certainty of net health benefit is deemed ``Low.{''}
   Rationale: It has been suggested that an improvement in CVD risk
   classification (adjusting intermediate risk of CVD into high-or low-risk
   categories) might lead to management changes (e. g., earlier initiation
   or higher rates of medical interventions, or targeted recommendations
   for behavioral change) that improve CVD outcomes. In the absence of
   direct evidence to support this possibility, this review sought indirect
   evidence aimed at documenting the extent to which genomic profiling
   alters CVD risk estimation, alone and in combination with traditional
   risk factors, and the extent to which risk reclassification improves
   health outcomes. Analytic validity: Assay-related evidence on available
   genomic profiling tests was deemed inadequate. However, based on
   existing technologies that have been or may be used and on data from two
   of the companies performing such testing, the analytic sensitivity and
   specificity of tests for individual gene variants might be at least
   satisfactory. Clinical validity: Twenty-nine gene candidates were
   evaluated, with 58 different gene variant/disease associations. Evidence
   on clinical validity was rated inadequate for 34 of these associations
   (59\%) and adequate for 23 (40\%). Inadequate grades were based on
   limited evidence, poor replication, existence of possible biases, or
   combinations of these factors. For heart disease (25 combined
   associations) and stroke (13 combined associations), profiling provided
   areas under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 66\% and
   57\%, respectively. Only the association of 9p21 variants with heart
   disease had convincing evidence of a per-allele odds ratio of between
   1.2 and 1.3; this was the highest effect size for any variant/disease
   combination with at least adequate evidence. Although the 9p21
   association seems to be independent of traditional risk factors, there
   is adequate evidence that the improvement in risk prediction is, at
   best, small. Clinical utility: Clinical utility was not formally
   evaluated in any of the studies reported to date, including for 9p21. As
   a result, no evidence was available on the balance of benefits and
   harms. Also, there was no direct evidence available to assess the health
   benefits and harms of adding these markers to traditional risk factors
   (e. g., Framingham Risk Score). However, the estimated additional
   benefit from adding genomic markers to traditional risk factors was
   found to be negligible. Contextual Issues: Prevention of CVD is a public
   health priority. Improvements in outcomes associated with genomic
   profiling could have important impacts. Traditional risk factors such as
   those used in the Framingham Risk Scores have an advantage in clinical
   screening and risk assessment strategies because they measure the actual
   targets for therapy (e. g., lipid levels and blood pressure).
   To add value, genomic testing should lead to better outcomes than those
   achievable by assesment and treatment of traditional risk factors alone.
   Some issues important for clinical utility remain unknown, such as the
   biological mechanism underlying the most convincing marker's (9p21)
   association with CVD; the level of risk that changes intervention;
   whether long-term disease outcomes will improve; how individuals
   ordering direct to consumer tests will understand/ respond to test
   results and interact with the health care system; and whether direct to
   consumer testing will motivate behavior change or amplify potential
   harms. Genet Med 2010:12(12):839-843.}},

Abstract = {{Hereditary deficiency of the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) causes a
   chronic lung disease in humans that is characterized by excessive
   mobilization of neutrophils into the lung. However, the reason for the
   increased neutrophil burden has not been fully elucidated. In this study
   we have demonstrated using human neutrophils that serum AAT coordinates
   both CXCR1- and soluble immune complex (sIC) receptor-mediated
   chemotaxis by divergent pathways. We demonstrated that glycosylated AAT
   can bind to IL-8 (a ligand for CXCR1) and that AAT-IL-8 complex
   formation prevented IL-8 interaction with CXCR1. Second, AAT modulated
   neutrophil chemotaxis in response to sIC by controlling membrane
   expression of the glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored (GPI-anchored) Fc
   receptor Fc gamma RIIIb. This process was mediated through inhibition of
   ADAM-17 enzymatic activity. Neutrophils isolated from clinically stable
   AAT-deficient patients were characterized by low membrane expression of
   Fc gamma RIIIb and increased chemotaxis in response to IL-8 and sIC.
   Treatment of AAT deficient individuals with AAT augmentation therapy
   resulted in increased AAT binding to IL-8, increased AAT binding to the
   neutrophil membrane, decreased Fc gamma RIIIb release from the
   neutrophil membrane, and normalization of chemotaxis. These results
   provide new insight into the mechanism underlying the effect of AAT
   augmentation therapy in the pulmonary disease associated with AAT
   deficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we relate the coupling of Markov chains, at the basis of
   perfect sampling methods, with damage spreading, which captures the
   chaotic nature of stochastic dynamics. For two-dimensional spin glasses
   and hard spheres we point out that the obstacle to the application of
   perfect-sampling schemes is posed by damage spreading rather than by the
   survey problem of the entire configuration space. We find dynamical
   damage-spreading transitions deeply inside the paramagnetic and liquid
   phases, and we show that the critical values of the transition
   temperatures and densities depend on the coupling scheme. We discuss our
   findings in the light of a classic proof that for arbitrary Monte Carlo

Abstract = {{The UK government has agreed to a 26\% reduction in greenhouse gas
   emissions by 2020 and an 80\% reduction by 2050, against a 1990
   baseline. Britain's approximately 26 million existing homes account for
   27\% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions. Given the low-build rate for
   new homes, today's homes will comprise at least 80\% of the 2050 housing
   stock. Therefore, it is essential that significant improvements are
   realised to existing homes if the UK is to meet its sustainability
   objectives. This paper develops a building rating system designed to
   assess the sustainability merits of existing home retrofits and to
   indicate the success of a range of retrofit measures. With the
   methodology applied to six case studies, performance of the retrofit
   measures adopted and their prioritisation are discussed, together with
   the effectiveness of a retrofit building rating system. The creation and
   adoption of a purpose-designed building rating system, such as the one
   described and demonstrated here, with escalating mandatory performance
   levels in energy and water efficiency, would help to drive improvement
   in existing homes. Such an approach would be used to rate existing
   homes, galvanise stakeholders around a common framework and provide
   long-term visibility to the marketplace. It must be integrated with
   existing building regulations, planning mechanisms, incentive
   programmes, and assessment requirements such as energy performance
   certificates. Encouraging action now will not only result in quality
   improvements to the existing housing stock and a reduced ecological
   footprint but will also build resilience in energy and water systems and
   facilitate adaptation to future climate change.}},

   otoliths found no significant difference in PLDs or otolith growth rates
   between self-recruiting and immigrant larvae. We also quantified otolith
   Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios during the larval phase using laser ablation
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Again, we found no
   significant differences in larval profiles of either element between
   self-recruits and immigrants. Our results highlight the need for caution
   when interpreting otolith dispersal histories based on natural
   geochemical tags in the absence of water chemistry data or known-origin
   larvae with which to test the discriminatory ability of natural tags.}},

Title = {{Serum visfatin as a non-traditional biomarker of endothelial dysfunction
   in chronic kidney disease: An Egyptian study}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{530-535}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is closely linked to
   cardiovascular disease and outcome in patients with chronic kidney
   disease (CKD). Visfatin is an adipocytokine that recently generated much
   interest; however, its role in CKD remains to be clarified. This study
   aimed to assess visfatin in correlation with markers of ED and
   inflammation in Egyptian patients with CKD.
   Methods: The study included 40 non-diabetic, clinically stable CKD
   patients and 20 healthy volunteers. Serum levels of visfatin, markers of
   ED (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell
   adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)) and markers of inflammation (interleukin-6
   (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP)) were measured. Endothelial
   function was evaluated using brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation
   (FMD).
   Results: Serum visfatin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CRP, and IL-6 levels were
   significantly elevated and FMD\% was decreased in CKD patients as
   compared to controls. Visfatin correlated positively with ICAM-1,
   VCAM-1, CRP, and IL-6 and negatively with FMD\% in CKD patients. In a
   multiple regression model, visfatin was strongly and independently
   associated with FMD (Beta=-0.02, P<0.001) in CKD patients.
   Conclusions: Serum visfatin is strongly associated with endothelial
   adhesion molecules and FMD\%, suggesting that visfatin is an important
   promising biomarker for prediction of ED and future cardiovascular risk
   in CKD patients. Moreover, the relationship between visfatin and IL-6
   indicates that circulating visfatin may reflect the sub-clinical
   inflammatory status. Thus, visfatin might be involved in the complex
   interactions between ED, inflammation, and atherosclerosis and their
   major clinical consequences; however, further prospective studies are
   required to prove this hypothesis. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {{Fluoride is an important anion present in various environmental,

   can enter the human body by means of polluted air, water and the food
   chain. Determination of fluoride in 86 food samples was performed by
   using an ion-selective electrode, as this method is simple, rapid and
   reliable. Fluoride concentrations were determined in the most-consumed
   fruit juices, soft drinks and milk samples among the population of
   Kuwait. A total of 15 soft drink samples available in the Kuwaiti
   markets were analyzed. The fluoride contents ranged from 0.05 -
   0.15mg/L, with an average of 0.06 mg/L. From the producer KDD, 16 fruit
   juice samples were selected from the markets and analyzed for fluoride
   content. The fluoride level ranged from 0.05 - 0.20 mg/L, within an
   average of 0.08 mg/L. The 32 other main brands of fruit juices available
   in the supermarkets were analyzed for fluoride content and found to be

Journal = {{ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Scaling bulk CMOS SRAM technology for on-chip caches beyond the 22nm
   node is questionable, on account of high leakage power consumption,
   performance degradation, and instability due to process variations.
   Recently, two-three transistor one gated-diode (2T/3T1D) DRAMs were
   proposed as alternatives to address the SRAM variability problem, with
   an emphasis on high-activity embedded cache applications. They are
   highly competitive to SRAM in terms of performance, while having a
   smaller power and area footprint at lower technology nodes. The current
   evolutionary trend in transistor structures is moving toward an era of
   multigate devices, which makes it necessary to identify design issues
   and advantages of gated-diode DRAMs implemented in a multigate
   technology.
   In this work, we address gated-diode DRAM design in FinFET technology
   using mixed-mode 2D-device simulations. We revisit the model of internal
   voltage gain in bulk gated diodes and extend it to provide quantitative
   insight into designing Fin gated diodes, that is, gated diodes in FinFET
   technology. To this effect, we propose FinFET variants of the bulk
   gated-diode configuration and identify parameters that are critical to
   enhancing the retention time and read current in 2T/3T1D FinFET DRAMs.
   Additionally, we show the superiority of 2T1D FinFET DRAM over 6T FinFET
   SRAM having pass-gate feedback (6T PGFB) and 2T1D bulk DRAM under the
   effect of physical parameter process variations using a quasi-Monte
   Carlo method implemented in FinE, an environment we have developed for
   double-gate circuit design that integrates Sentaurus TCAD from Synopsys
   with the Spice3-UFDG double-gate compact model from University of
   Florida, under a single framework. Finally, we present a new tunable
   threshold gated diode FinFET amplifier which uses an n-type gated diode
   for voltage-boosting, along with a p-type gated diode for
   zero-suppression.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the dormancy dynamic of
   `Niagara Branca' grape and `Bruno' kiwi tree buds in a region of low
   chilling. The experiments were carried out in 2007 and 2008 through the
   cutting of branches every two weeks in orchards in Pinhais-PR. In the
   last date, an additional group of stems was collected and maintained in
   a refrigerator at a temperature of 4 to 7 degrees C by 1440 hours. The
   evaluation of dormancy was observed by the biological test of single
   node cuttings into a growth room with temperature of 25 degrees C and
   photoperiod of 16 hours. The chilling hours (CH) and chilling units (CU)
   were estimated from the region. The two species were analyzed
   individually. The entirely randomized experimental design was used with
   12 treatments in 2007 and 11 treatments in 2008, both with four
   replications and ten cutting per plot. The bud endodormancy of `Bruno'
   kiwi installed from April and reached higher intensity in the end of May
   to the second half of June. The end of endodormancy can naturally occur
   by the end of August, but with variations among years. The bud
   endodormancy of grapevine `Niagara Branca' installed in April and
   remains strong until May. The end of natural endodormancy occurs half of
   August to early September.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary embodiment theory's indexical hypothesis predicts that
   engaging in text-relevant activity while listening to a story will: (1)
   enhance memory for enacted story content; and, (2) result in relatively
   greater memory enhancement for enacted atypical events than for typical
   ones (Glenberg \& Robertson, 1999, 2000). To date, indexical hypothesis
   predictions and applications have been examined only with adults and
   elementary school-aged children. The present study extended previous
   research by comparing an activity-based listening strategy to a
   listening-only strategy with 56 preschool children. The first hypothesis
   was supported in that children in the activity-based condition recalled
   more story actions than children in the listening-only condition. At the
   same time, this effect was relatively greater for children who were
   initially better at remembering story content than for initially poorer
   story rememberers. Consistent with previous research findings, no
   statistical differences between conditions were observed on memory for
   nonaction story content. The second hypothesis - that children in the
   activity-based strategy would exhibit comparatively greater memory
   enhancement for atypical story events relative to typical ones - was not
   supported. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are
   discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The financial market was well developed in France in the years before
   World War I, and there were many newspapers that provided information to
   investors. Yet commentators at the time faulted the financial press for
   inaccuracy and biases, which they linked to the existence of payments
   made by companies for coverage in the editorial section. This article
   tests whether the payment scheme induced a systematic bias in the
   coverage of companies listed on the Paris stock exchanges by newspapers.
   The results show that, although firms' media coverage was affected, the
   performance of firms actually touted by the press was good. Thus, the
   media bias can also be explained by newspapers choosing the companies'
   exposures according to their editorial policy.}},

Abstract = {{Isoflavones are members of flavonoids which belong to phytoestrogens, a
   group of non-steroid plant substances the chemical structure of which is
   similar to 17-beta-estradiol. One of the richest sources of isoflavones
   is soybeans and legumes. The most important representatives of this
   class of compounds which have biological activity are daidzein and
   genistein. Isoflavones are able to bind to estrogen receptors (ER)
   however, their affinity to ER-beta is higher than ER-alpha. Interaction
   isoflavones with ER lead to their activation, which causes cell
   response. The last epidemiological studies provide evidence that in Asia
   where soya is present in the traditional diet, women have less negative
   symptoms of menopause compared with the Western population. Clinical
   studies carried out in recent years have shown that soy protein or
   genistein supplementation reduces the number of hot flushes in post
   menopausal women. Similar results are shown for bone health. Genistein
   supplementation causes an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and
   decrease in levels of bone resorption markers at a level comparable to
   hormone therapy. Isoflavones have also positive effects on the
   cardiovascular system. For all these reasons isoflavones are becoming an
   increasingly popular and safe alternative to hormone therapy for women
   with menopausal symptoms. This article describes the structure and
   metabolism of isoflavones as well as mechanism of action and results of
   clinical studies in postmenopausal women receiving isoflavones.}},

   of the TS-MAV dynamics is formulated by decoupling and linearizing a
   nonlinear model based on quaternions. Identification of the model
   parameters was carried out using a prediction error method and flight
   test data. Two control structures were synthesized to examine the
   benefits of using an anti-windup proportional-integral regulator in the
   inner control loop rather than in the outer control loop. It was found
   that a regulator in the inner loop reduced overshoot and eliminated an
   unstable pole. Flight tests with a TS-MAV test bed showed that a nine
   percent overshoot was reduced to zero thereby demonstrating the enhanced
   responsiveness of the vehicle using this control strategy.}},

   which assists in treatment planning. With multiple regression analysis,
   the expected value that each angle should take in a norm individual when
   the remaining angles are given is estimated. The residual difference
   between the measured angle and its expected value then indicates the
   deviation from a harmonic appearance in the respective angle.
   The MHM was applied to a data set of 134 Korean individuals identified
   as the norm population (Class I, mean age: 19.6 years) and to 87
   patients (Class III, mean age: 21.2 years). From the number and size of
   the residuals, the two populations could be separated almost completely.
   Almost all patients showed residuals larger than any residual in the
   norm population (sensitivity: 99 per cent), whereas 90 per cent of all
   norm individuals showed no extreme residuals. The MHM can also be used
   to assist in visualizing different treatment effects, thereby assisting
   the orthodontist in choosing the best course of treatment for each
   patient.}},

Abstract = {{Remodelling is the central feature that occurs in the progression of
   heart failure. However, unloading of the heart with a left ventricular

   also lead to improved myocardial function and this improvement can be
   sufficient to allow removal of the device leaving the patient to lead a
   normal life. We review the molecular changes that have been demonstrated
   with LVAD unloading in patients bridged to transplantation and also
   those that have occurred in the myocardium of patients that have
   recovered their myocardial function enough to have the device removed.
   Changes in both the myocyte and the matrix are reviewed.}},

Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{In many industries firms have to make quantity decisions before knowing
   the exact state of demand. In such cases, channel members have to decide
   which firm will own the units until demand uncertainty is resolved. The
   decision about who should retain ownership depends on the balance of
   benefit and risk to each member. Ownership, after all, is costly.
   Whichever member owns the units accepts the risk of loss if more units
   are produced than can be sold. But ownership also grants firms the
   flexibility to respond to demand once it becomes known by adjusting
   price. In this study, we analyze ownership decisions in distribution
   channels and how those decisions are affected by demand uncertainty. We
   model demand based on micro-modeling of consumer utility functions and
   capture demand uncertainty related to market size and price sensitivity.
   This study shows that as long as the degree of uncertainty about market
   size is intermediate, the retailer and the manufacturer both benefit
   when the manufacturer maintains ownership of the units. But when there
   is substantial uncertainty about market size, the retailer and the
   channel are better off if the retailer takes ownership but the
   manufacturer still prefers to maintain ownership. Thus, there is
   potential for channel conflict regarding ownership under high levels of
   uncertainty. We show that, using product returns, the manufacturer can
   achieve the same outcome under retailer ownership as under manufacturer
   ownership. This provides an additional new rationale for the prevalence
   of product returns. The first-best outcome (from the perspective of
   total channel profit), however, is under retailer ownership without
   product returns when uncertainty is high (i.e., product returns reduce
   the total channel profit). Negotiations between the manufacturer and the
   retailer can lead to the first-best outcome but only under quite
   restrictive constraints that include direct side payments by the
   retailer to the manufacturer and the retailer being pessimistic about
   its outside option (when an agreement cannot be reached) during the
   negotiation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper has two purposes First we examine the relationship between
   daily price volatility and trading activity one year before and after a
   change in contract size by examining the results of contract splits in
   the Australian share price Index futures and the U K FTSE-100 futures
   contracts and a reverse contract split in the Australian Bank Bill
   Acceptance futures contract Second we evaluate the effect of the change
   in contract size on the use of the particular futures market. We find
   that after a contract size change the change in total trading frequency
   has the power to explain the change in daily price volatility
   Specifically after a contract split trading frequency increased,
   resulting in increased daily price volatility and vice versa after a
   reverse contract split Most of the average trade size variable has an
   immaterial impact on price volatility However decomposing the total
   trading frequency Into four trade size classes, we find that the trading
   frequency for small and large trade size categories are highly
   significant in explaining changes in daily price volatility after the
   contract splits Finally we find the change in contract size for each
   futures market was successful because within three years following the
   change the adjusted trading volume and open interest surpassed the
   levels prior to the change and have continued to increase thereafter

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We investigate whether vacuum solutions in flux compactifications that
   are obtained with smeared sources (orientifolds or D-branes) still
   survive when the sources are localised. This seems to rely on whether
   the solutions are BPS or not. First we consider two sets of BPS
   solutions that both relate to the GKP solution through T-dualities: (p +
   1)-dimensional solutions from spacetime-filling Op-planes with a
   conformally Ricci-flat internal space, and p-dimensional solutions with
   Op-planes that wrap a 1-cycle inside an everywhere negatively curved
   twisted torus. The relation between the solution with smeared
   orientifolds and the localised version is worked out in detail. We then
   demonstrate that a class of non-BPS AdS(4) solutions that exist for IASD
   fluxes and with smeared D3-branes (or analogously for ISD fluxes with
   anti-D3-branes) does not survive the localisation of the (anti)
   D3-branes. This casts doubts on the stringy consistency of non-BPS
   solutions that are obtained in the limit of smeared sources.}},

Abstract = {{How cognitive control is recruited and implemented has become a major
   focus of researchers in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Current
   theories posit that cognitive control operates at the level of general
   rules-for example, in a Stroop task, ``attend to the color of the
   stimulus.{''} Here we report behavioral evidence suggesting that
   cognitive control is implemented much more locally, operating at the
   level of specific stimuli appearing in a task block. In addition, we
   report neural evidence that many of the regions implicated in cognitive
   control on the Stroop task, including anterior cingulate cortex and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, operate at a local level.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Fusarium head blight (FHB) of small grain cereals is a worldwide disease
   that reduces yield and causes deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination in
   grains. Non-decomposed residues from the previous crop present on the
   soil surface are considered the principal inoculum sources for Fusarium
   graminearum and F. culmorum, the most important Fusarium species that
   cause FHB in Europe. The objective of this study was to investigate the
   effect of the amount of previous residues on the FHB disease under
   natural conditions and on DON contamination in soft wheat following
   grain maize. Field experiments were conducted in two cropping seasons
   and two sites to compare four maize residue densities on the soil
   surface and in the first 10 cm of soil in tilled and non-tilled fields.
   Ploughing to a 30 cm depth significantly reduced FHB severity (by 63\%)
   and DON occurrence (by 80\%) in each year and site. FHB severity and DON
   contamination significantly increased with the density of the residues
   left by the preceding crop. This study confirms that conservation
   tillage may increase DON concentration in wheat grain compared to
   ploughing which buries residues. This increase varies to a great extent
   not only because of the annual weather conditions and the nature of the
   preceding crop, but also because of the amount of infected crop residues
   remaining on the soil surface, which depends on the soil tillage methods
   and the preceding crop.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This clinical trial is focussed on the 12-month results of a
   new method for refractive correction, femtosecond lenticule extraction
   (FLEx).
   Patients and Methods: In a prospective 6-month study 108 eyes were
   treated in Erfurt and Marburg. Both a flap and a lenticule of
   intrastromal corneal tissue were simultaneously cut utilising the Carl
   Zeiss Meditec AG (Jena, Germany) Visu-Max femtosecond laser system.
   Thereafter, the lenticule was manually removed and the flap
   repositioned. 31 patients all treated in Erfurt volunteered for a
   12-month follow-up. UCVA and BSCVA after 12 months, objective and
   manifest refraction as well as slit-lamp examination and late side
   effects were documented. Results: 62 eyes of 31 patients were examined
   in this study. The spherical equivalent before surgery was -4.81 (+/-
   1.16) D; after 12 months -0.15 (+/- 0.46) D were manifest. No
   significant change was observed after the 6 months control. Starting
   with UCVA of 0.12 (+/- 0.09) before surgery UCVA was 1.10 (+/- 0.26)
   after 12 months. In one patient corneal ectasia was diagnosed. All other
   patients did not have any late side effects. Conclusion: The stability
   of the correction of myopic astigmatism with the FLEx procedure is very
   good. The fact that one patient presented with a corneal ectasia
   demonstrates that one general problem of refractive corneal surgery
   persists with this new fs technology.}},

Abstract = {{The Sinos River basin is located Northeast of the state of Rio Grande do
   Sul (29 degrees 20' to 30 degrees 10' S and 50 degrees 15' to 51 degrees
   20' W), Southern Brazil, covering two geomorphologic provinces: the
   Southern plateau and central depression. It is part of the Guaiba basin
   and has an area of approximately 800 km(2), encompassing 32
   municipalities. The objective of this study was to monitor water quality
   in the Sinos River, the largest river in this basin. Water samples were
   collected at four selected sites in the Sinos River, and the following
   parameters were analysed: pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen
   demand (BOD(5)), turbidity, fecal coliforms, total dissolved solids,
   temperature, nitrate, nitrite, phosphorous, chromium, lead, aluminum,
   zinc, iron, and copper. The results were analysed based on Resolution
   No. 357/2005 of the Brazilian National Environmental Council (CONAMA)
   regarding regulatory limits for residues in water. A second analysis was
   performed based on a water quality index (WQI) used by the Sinos River
   Basin Management Committee (COMITESINOS). Poor water quality in the
   Sinos River presents a worrying scenario for the region, since this
   river is the main source of water supply for the urban core. Health
   conditions found in the Sinos River, mainly in its lower reaches, are
   worrying and a strong indicator of human activities on the basin.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the convergence behavior of the symmetric and the

   continuous-time wide-sense stationary stochastic processes that have
   absolutely continuous spectral measure. It is shown that the
   nonsymmetric sampling series converges in the mean-square sense
   uniformly on compact subsets of the real axis if and only if the power
   spectral density of the process fulfills a certain integrability
   condition. Moreover, if this condition is not fulfilled, then the
   pointwise mean-square approximation error of the nonsymmetric sampling
   series and the supremum of the mean-square approximation error over the
   real axis of the symmetric sampling series both diverge. This shows that
   there is a significant difference between the convergence behavior of
   the symmetric and the nonsymmetric sampling series.}},

Abstract = {{We report the performance of eight density functionals (B3LYP, BPW91,
   OLYP, O3LYP, M06, M06-2X, PBE, and SVWN5) in two Gaussian basis sets
   (Wachters and Partridge-1 on iron atoms; cc-pVDZ on the rest of atoms)
   for prediction of the isomer shift (IS) and quadrupole splitting (QS)
   parameters of Mossbauer spectroscopy. Two sources of geometry (density
   functional theory optimized and X-ray) are used. Our data set consists
   of 31 iron-containing compounds (35 signals), the Mossbauer spectra of
   which were determined at liquid helium temperature and where the X-ray
   geometries are known. Our results indicate that the larger and
   uncontracted Partridge-1 basis set produces slightly more accurate
   linear correlations of electronic density used for prediction of IS and
   noticeably more accurate results for the QS parameters. We confirm and
   discuss the earlier observation of Noodleman and co-workers that
   different oxidation states of iron produce different IS calibration
   lines. The B3LYP and O3LYP functionals have the lowest errors for either
   IS or QS. BPW91, OLYP, PBE, and M06 have mixed success, whereas SVWN5
   and M06-2X demonstrate the worst performance. Finally, our calibrations
   and conclusions regarding the best functional to compute the Mossbauer
   characteristics are applied to candidate structures for the peroxo and Q
   intermediates of the enzyme methane monooxygenase hydroxylase (MMOH) and
   are compared to experimental data in the literature.}},

   recognizing emotions in faces when competing word cues were consistent
   with the emotion in the face than when they were inconsistent or
   irrelevant, and all participants were more accurate in emotion
   recognition when competing word cues were presented auditorily rather
   than visually, and when competing word cues were consistent as opposed
   to inconsistent or irrelevant. Contrary to hypothesized results,

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) maintain a
   higher risk for recurrent GDM and overt diabetes Overt diabetes is a
   risk factor for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but GDM
   alone without subsequent development of overt diabetes may also pose a
   risk for CKD
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - This cross-sectional analysis included
   Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP) participants from 2000 to 2009
   Patient characteristics and kidney function among three categories (GDM
   alone overt diabetes and no history of diabetes) were compared The
   prevalence of microalbuminuria macroalbuminuria and CKD stages 1-2 and
   3-5 was assessed using logistic regression
   RESULTS - Of 37 716 KEEP female participants 571 (1 5\%) had GDM alone
   and 12 100 (32 1\%) had overt diabetes Women with GDM had a higher rate
   of microalbuminuria but not macroalbuminuria than their nonadiabetic
   peers (10 0 vs 7 7\%) that was substantially lower than the 13 6\%
   prevalence in diabetic women In multivariate analysis women with GDM
   alone, compared with nondiabetic women demonstrated increased odds of
   CKD stages 1-2 (multivariate odds ratio 1 54 {[}95\% CI 1 16-2 05])
   similar to the odds for women with overt diabetes (1 68 {[}1 55-1 82])
   In stratified analyses age race BMI and hypertension modified the odds
   for CKD stages 1 2 but not CKD stages 3-5 among women with GDM
   CONCLUSIONS - Women with GDM alone have a higher prevalence of
   microalbuminuria than women without any history of diabetes translating
   to higher rates of CKD stages 1-2 These results suggest that GDM even in
   the absence of subsequent overt diabetes may Increase the risk for
   future cardiovascular and kidney disease}},

Abstract = {{The need for fast drug innovation and the public demand for risk-free
   drugs creates a dilemma for regulatory authorities: less restrictive
   procedures involve uncertainties about benefit/risk profiles of new
   drugs. The European Union has introduced two instruments that regulate
   early market access: conditional approvals (CAs) and approvals under
   exceptional circumstances (ECs). We have studied whether these
   instruments compromise the safety of new drugs and whether they lead to
   earlier access to innovative drugs. Our study shows that neither of
   these regulatory pathways accelerates the approval process for
   innovative drugs. However, the CA pathway shortens the clinical
   development period. Approvals under ECs are associated with longer
   clinical development periods, but this regulatory pathway may open up
   opportunities for specific drugs to be admitted into the market because
   less comprehensive data are required. Despite the fact that these
   advanced approvals are based on limited safety databases, there are no
   special safety issues associated with using these pathways.}},

   human MIC has been found in NOD/SCID (non-obese diabetic/severe combined
   immunodeficiency) mice. However, a phenotypically distinct human MIC was
   not found in the NOD/SCIDIl2rg(-)/(-) (NSG) mouse model. The
   demonstration of a distinct population of human melanoma cells
   responsible for tumorigenesis and tumor cell self-renewal would provide
   an important target for new melanoma therapies. In this study, we show a
   100-fold range in MIC frequency in human melanoma (1 in 18,000 to 1 in
   1,851,000 cells) in the NOD/SCID mouse. In this model, human melanoma
   cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity were enriched
   16.8-fold in tumorigenic cells over unfractionated (UNF) cells, such
   that 1 in 21,000 cells was a MIC. In the NSG mouse, the ALDH expressing
   cell population was enriched 100-fold in tumorigenic cells over UNF
   cells, such that one in four cells was a MIC. Xenograft melanomas that
   developed from ALDH(+) cells displayed robust self-renewal, whereas
   those from ALDH(-) cells showed minimal self-renewal in vitro. Thus,
   ALDH(+) melanoma cells have enhanced tumorigenicity over ALDH(-) cells
   and superior self-renewal ability.}},

Abstract = {{The universality of mathematics and Maxwell's equations is not shared by
   specific plasma models. Computations become more reliable, efficient and
   transparent if specific plasma models are used to obtain only the
   information that would otherwise be missing. Constraints of high
   universality, such as those from mathematics and Maxwell's equations,
   can be obscured or lost by integrated computations. Recognition of
   subtle constraints of high universality is important for (1) focusing
   the design of control systems for magnetic field errors in tokamaks from
   perturbations that have little effect on the plasma to those that do,
   (2) clarifying the limits of applicability to astrophysics of
   computations of magnetic reconnection in fields that have a double
   periodicity or have (B) over right arrow = 0 on a surface, as in a
   Harris sheet. Both require a degree of symmetry not expected in natural
   systems. Mathematics and Maxwell's equations imply that neighboring
   magnetic field lines characteristically separate exponentially with
   distance along a line. This remarkably universal phenomenon has been
   largely ignored, though it defines a trigger for reconnection through a
   critical magnitude of exponentiation. These and other examples of the
   importance of making distinctions and understanding constraints of high
   universality are explained.}},

Title = {{Association of breathlessness with multiple symptoms in chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{66}},

Pages = {{2688-2700}},

Abstract = {{P>Aim.
   This paper is a report of an exploration of relationships between
   demographic and clinical variables and the symptoms of breathlessness,
   depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleeping difficulties and pain for
   patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
   Background.
   Research into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has focused on
   single symptoms and we lack knowledge about possible associations
   between several symptoms.
   Methods.
   A total of 154 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   participated in a cross-sectional study from June 2006 to December 2007
   (response rate 40\%). All underwent pulmonary lung function tests and
   completed questionnaires including demographic variables, the Brief Pain
   Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Lee Fatigue Scale,
   General Sleep Disturbance Scale and the Respiratory Quality of Life
   Questionnaire. Bivariate correlation and multiple regression analyses
   were performed.
   Results.
   Breathlessness was statistically significantly positively associated
   with the other symptoms, after controlling for demographic and clinical
   variables. Younger age was statistically significantly related to more
   breathlessness, anxiety and sleeping difficulties and lower levels of
   education was statistically significantly related to more
   breathlessness, depression and anxiety. In relation to clinical
   variables, smoking was statistically significantly related to more
   depression, whereas more co-morbidity was statistically significantly
   related to more breathlessness and pain. Poorer lung function was
   statistically significantly related to more breathlessness. However,
   higher lung function was related to more sleeping difficulties.
   Conclusion.
   Breathlessness is associated with symptoms such as depression, anxiety,
   fatigue, sleeping difficulties and pain, suggesting the need for an
   expanded focus on symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   guidelines, health care and research.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Oral hormone therapy (HT) and menopausal age are both
   prothrombotic risk factors. The aim of our study was to compare the
   hemostatic parameters in plasma of postmenopausal women after 6 months
   of oral HT with parameters of control (without treatment) postmenopausal
   women.
   Methods: Twenty-seven postmenopausal women were treated with 17
   beta-estradiol (1 mg) and dydrogesterone (5 mg) daily for 6 months. The
   control group (27 women) did not receive any HT. Hemostatic factors,
   such as fibrinogen (FG) concentration, activated partial thromboplastin
   time (APTT), platelet (PLT) count, maximum velocity of clot formation,
   and fibrin lysis half-time were estimated.
   Results: The hemostatic parameters in both groups differ significantly.
   After 6 months oral HT, APTT and the level of FG were higher than in the
   control group (APTT 30.08 seconds vs. 28.18 seconds, p = 0.02; FG 4.14
   g/L vs. 3.03 g/L, p<0.001). However, the higher values of maximal
   velocity of FG polymerization (153.53 mOD/min vs. 92.87 mOD/min,
   p<0.001), maximum absorbance values (0.306 vs. 0.275, p<0.001), and
   fibrin lysis half-time (32.33 minutes vs. 18.11 minutes, p<0.001)
   compared with values in the control group also were observed. There was
   no statistically significant difference in PLT counts between control
   and women treated with oral HT.
   Conclusions: Six months of oral combined HT (17 beta-estradiol and
   dydrogesterone) caused increased initial velocity of clot formation and
   inhibition of fibrinolysis. The increased level of FG and its higher
   polymerization may help explain the increase in venous thrombosis and
   cardiovascular events reported after the use of oral HT.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To review empirical studies on families created by new
   reproductive technologies (NRT) in which only one parent has a genetic
   link to the child.
   Methodology: Literature search was conducted among computerized
   databases. Inclusion criteria were that studies should focus on
   childrearing or parenting, as well as on the psychological adjustment of
   children in: heterosexual families formed through artificial
   insemination with donated semen (AID), single-mother AID families,
   oocyte-donation families, planned lesbian-mother families, planned
   gay-father families, and partial surrogacy families.
   Results: Compared to natural-conception parents, parents in these NRT
   families have better relationships with their children, and their
   children are functioning well.
   Conclusion: Although several studies show that parents in NRT families
   are more emotionally involved in their parenting than are parents in
   naturally conceived families, no empirical evidence was found that the
   psychological adjustment of children in NRT families differs from that
   of their counterparts in natural-conception families.
   Practical implication: The results inform counselors and infertile
   couples that concerns regarding the use of NRT in relation to negative
   consequences for the parent-child relationship or the psychological
   adjustment of the child are till now unfounded. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new video coding scheme based on a simplified
   block structure that significantly outperforms the coding efficiency of
   the ISO/IEC 14496-10 vertical bar ITU-T H.264 advanced video coding
   (AVC) standard. Its conceptual design is similar to a typical
   block-based hybrid coder applying prediction and subsequent prediction
   error coding. The basic coding unit is an 8 x 8 block for inter, and an
   8 x 8 or a 16 x 16 block for intra, instead of the usual 16 x 16
   macroblock. No larger block sizes are considered for prediction and
   transform. Based on this simplified block structure, the coding scheme
   uses simple and fundamental coding tools with optimized encoding
   algorithms. In particular, the motion representation is based on a
   minimum partitioning with blocks sharing motion borders. In addition,
   compared to AVC, the new and improved coding techniques include:
   block-based intensity compensation, motion vector competition, adaptive
   motion vector resolution, adaptive interpolation filters, edge-based
   intra prediction and enhanced chrominance prediction, intra template
   matching, larger transforms and adaptive switchable transforms selection
   for intra and inter blocks, and nonlinear and frame-adaptive de-noising
   loop filters. Finally, the entropy coder uses a generic flexible
   zero-tree representation applied to both motion and texture data.
   Attention has also been given to algorithm designs that facilitate
   parallelization. Compared to AVC, the new coding scheme offers clear
   benefits in terms of subjective video quality at the same bit rate.
   Objective quality improvements are equally significant. At the same
   quality, an average bit-rate reduction of 31\% compared to AVC is
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{An assembly robot needs to be capable of executing an assembly task
   robustly under various uncertainties. To attain this goal, we use a task
   sequence tree model originally proposed for manual assembly. This model
   regards an assembly task under uncertainties as a transformation of the
   contact state concept. The concept may contain several contact states
   with probabilities but these are transformed through a series of task
   elements into the contact state concept having only the goal state at
   the end. The transformed contact state concept can be classified
   according to the terminal condition of each task element. Thus, the
   whole assembly task can be designed as a tree-shaped contingent strategy
   called a task sequence tree. This paper proposes a systematic approach
   for reconfiguring a task sequence tree model for application to a
   robotic assembly task. In addition, by taking a 2D peg-in-hole insertion
   task to be performed by a robot equipped with a force sensor as an
   example, we confirm that the proposed approach can provide a robust
   motion strategy for the task and that the robot can actually execute the
   task robustly under bounded uncertainty according to the strategy.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major concerns in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) is the radio
   resource utilization efficiency, which can be enhanced by efficiently
   managing the mobility of users. To achieve this, we propose in this
   paper the use of mobility-aware clustering. The main idea behind WMN
   clustering is to restrict a major part of the exchanged signaling
   messages due to the mobility of users to a local area (i.e., inside a
   cluster). As such, less wireless links are used by the signaling
   messages, which reduces the resources occupied by a mobile user during
   its service and thus improves the total network capacity. Through
   analytical models and simulations, this work first identifies the cases
   where clustering is helpful. Building on these results, we propose two
   clustering schemes that take into consideration the mobility properties
   of the users in order to improve the WMN performance. We prove that both
   schemes can achieve significant gains in terms of radio resource
   utilization. Specifically, we show that the first scheme fits better
   both large and low-connected wireless mesh networks, whereas the second
   scheme is more suitable for both small to moderate and highly connected
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Given a graph G = (V, E) with strictly positive integer weights omega(i)
   on the vertices i is an element of V, an interval coloring of G is a
   function I that assigns an interval I(i) of omega(i) consecutive
   integers (called colors) to each vertex i is an element of V so that
   I(i) boolean AND I(j) = empty set for all edges \{i, j\} is an element
   of E. The interval coloring problem is to determine an interval coloring
   that uses as few colors as possible. Assuming that a strictly positive
   integer weight delta(ij) is associated with each edge \{i, j\} is an
   element of E, a bandwidth coloring of G is a function c that assigns an
   integer (called a color) to each vertex i is an element of V so that
   vertical bar c(i) - c(j)vertical bar >= delta(ij) for all edges \{i, j\}
   is an element of E. The bandwidth coloring problem is to determine a
   bandwidth coloring with minimum difference between the largest and the
   smallest colors used. We prove that an optimal solution of the interval
   coloring problem can be obtained by solving a series of bandwidth
   coloring problems. Computational experiments demonstrate that such a
   reduction can help to solve larger instances or to obtain better upper
   bounds on the optimal solution value of the interval coloring problem.}},

Abstract = {{Palladium catalysts (1-10 wt.\% Pd) supported on silica were prepared by
   hydrazine reduction of palladium chloride at room temperature. They were
   characterized by XRD, TEM, EDX, H-2-adsorption, and H-2-TPD and tested
   in the gas phase hydrogenation of benzene in the temperature range
   75-250 degrees C. A conventional catalyst (1 wt.\% Pd) obtained by
   calcination then hydrogen reduction of the same metal precursor was
   studied for comparison. Metal particles with a size range 6.8-28.4 nm
   were obtained. Dispersion, hydrogen storage and activity in benzene
   hydrogenation increased with decreasing particle size. In comparison,
   the classical catalyst was found much more dispersed (mean particle size
   of 1.6 nm) and more active (specific rate 1.6-3.7 times higher) than the
   homolog hydrazine catalyst. However, unexpectedly, turnover frequency
   (TOF) calculations indicated a greater reactivity of the metal surface
   atoms for the hydrazine catalyst. It also stored more hydrogen. These
   contrasting results are discussed in relation with the metal particle
   morphology. (C) 2010 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{The context of ornamental horticulture is considered in order to extend
   the techniques of sensory and preference evaluation by taking the
   rosebush as a plant model. In a preliminary study (Boumaza,
   Demotes-Mainard, Huche-Thelier, \& Guerin, 2009), a sensory evaluation
   was conducted in order to set up a list of attributes. Subsequently,
   this list was adapted to assess 10 rosebushes. After the control of the
   panel performance using a multivariate strategy of analysis, the average
   scores were used in product mapping. The evaluation of the preferences
   with regard to these rosebushes was undertaken: 253 subjects were asked
   to rank the products by decreasing order of liking. Thereafter, the
   preference data were subjected to an internal preference mapping and a
   cluster analysis. Six homogeneous segments of consumers were eventually
   retained. By way of performing an external preference mapping, the
   average ranks were regressed upon the sensory attributes using principal
   component regression: the preferences of 67\% of the consumers were
   satisfactorily explained by the attributes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Social organization is an important attribute of the animal society. We
   describe the social structure of a bottlenose dolphins population living
   in Panama City, a seaside resort located on the north-west coast of
   Florida. Study was conducted with 46 individuals. Dolphins are
   associated on average half weight index of 0.11. Preferred long-term
   associations are observed. The proportion of the non-zero association
   indices suggests that some dolphins seem to avoid others. Associations
   between and within sex-classes were investigated using only dolphins of
   known sex and observed at least 4 times. Highly significant differences
   are found in associations between and within sex-classes (Mantel test, t
   = 3.7987; P = 1); indeed, male associations are stronger than between
   inter-sexual associations or between females only. Sociogram of males
   reveals a complex network with strong associations between pairs or
   trios that reach up to 0.97, whereas female associations are lower than
   males. The cluster analysis shows no clear division in the social
   organization of bottlenose dolphins in Panama City, except for dyads,
   triads and their multiple networks. The population structure seems to be
   temporally stable over the study and constant companionships are
   observed in the dolphin population in Panama City.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. This paper describes a metacognitive strategy related to
   the social dimension of the information search process of adolescents.
   Method. A case study that used naturalistic methods to explore the
   metacognitive thinking and associated emotions of ten adolescents. The
   study was framed by Kuhlthau's Information Search Process model and the
   construct of metacognition.
   Analysis. Data analysis used the words and actions of the participants
   to tell the story of their journey through the information search
   process.
   Results. The study found that talk was used as a metacognitive strategy
   to help clarify thinking and that the talk strategy was more likely to
   be implemented face-to-face with trusted family and friends, than with
   the class teacher and college librarian or even social media.
   Conclusions. There is a strong social component attached to
   metacognitive knowledge during the information search process.
   Face-to-face social processes during information seeking are an
   important consideration in the design of library and information systems
   and services for young people. Utilizing the social component of
   metacognitive knowledge to its maximum benefit is an important lesson
   that needs to be taught to young people.}},

   +/- 7.4 vs 30.2 +/- 8.9 mL/m(2), P = .002), with LA remodeling present
   in 64\% of the patients with NSTEMIs. LA passive emptying volume
   increased, with concurrent reductions in conduit and active emptying
   volumes. Although diabetes, major coronary artery disease, and a larger
   myocardial score were predictive of LA remodeling, E' velocity was the
   only independent predictor.
   Conclusions: Patients with NSTEMIs had progressive LA enlargement with
   reductions in conduit and active emptying volumes, reflecting persistent
   left ventricular diastolic dysfunction consequent to coronary artery
   disease and associated diabetes. The measurement of LA volumes after
   NSTEMI may be useful to monitor chronic diastolic dysfunction resulting
   from ischemic burden. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2010;23:1251-8.)}},

Abstract = {{The fungus Geotrichum candidum 4013 produces two types of lipases
   (extracellular and cell-bound). Both enzymes were tested for their
   hydrolytic ability to p-nitrophenyl esters and compounds having a
   structure similar to the original substrate (triacylglycerols). Higher
   lipolytic activity of extracellular lipase was observed when
   triacylglycerols of medium- (C12) and long- (C18) chain fatty acids were
   used as substrates. Cell-bound lipase preferentially hydrolysed
   trimyristate (C14). The differences in the abilities of these two
   enzymes to hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl esters were observed as well. The
   order of extracellular lipase hydrolysis relation velocity was as
   follows: p-nitrophenyl decanoate > p-nitrophenyl caprylate >
   p-nitrophenyl laurate > p-nitrophenyl palmitate > p-nitrophenyl
   stearate. The cell-bound lipase indicates preference for p-nitrophenyl
   palmitate. The most striking differences in the ratios between the
   activity of both lipases (extracellular : cell-bound) towards different
   fatty acid methyl esters were 2.2 towards methyl hexanoate and 0.46
   towards methyl stearate (C18). The Michaelis constant (K-m) and maximum
   reaction rate (V-max) for p-nitrophenyl palmitate hydrolysis of
   cell-bound lipase were significantly higher (K-m 2.462 mM and V-max
   0.210 U/g/min) than those of extracellular lipase (K-m 0.406 mM and
   V-max 0.006 U/g/min). Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the Impact of intra-operative
   cell salvage (ICS) on the early outcome after open repair (OR) of
   ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA)
   Methods This is a retrospective review of 73 consecutive patients who
   underwent emergency OR of infrarenal rAAA with ICS between 2005 and 2008
   (Group 1), compared to 51 repairs from 2002-2004 with no ICS (Group II)
   In addition, a transfusion protocol of platelets and fresh frozen plasma
   (FFP) administration on admission and during surgery was adopted in
   patients in Group I to maintain coagulation competence
   Results ICS reduced bank blood demand by 63 6\% (from 11 to 4 units, P<0
   001) compared to controls, and had a strong impact on rates of
   postoperative complications (P=0 05), or death (43 8\% vs 52 9\%, P<0
   05) or in-hospital LOS (P<0 07) in these patients Patients surviving in
   Group I had significantly higher postoperative haemoglobin level (11 5
   vs 9 6 g/dL, P<0 05) and platelet count (267 vs 95 x 10(9)L, P<0 001), a
   shorter APTT (31 s vs 47 s, P<0 05) and a lower INR (1 3 vs 2 1, P<0 01)
   than patients who died postoperatively ICS volume was significantly
   higher in patients with suprarenal aortic clamping and in those who had
   bifuricated grafting reconstruction (P<0 05), but amount of red blood
   cells (RBC) collected did not influence outcome
   Conclusion These results suggest that intraoperative cell salvage,
   minimizing perioperative homologous blood transfusion, Is an important
   determinant of outcome after rAAA repair Combined administration of
   balanced blood components may contribute to Improve the survival of the
   patients}},

Abstract = {{The regulators of apoptosis Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, p53, and Hsp70 were
   analyzed immunohistochemically in the developing human mandible of eight
   human conceptuses from weeks 5 to 10 of gestation. During this period,
   all proteins displayed an increased pattern of expression in the
   mandible ectomesenchyme and in newly formed bone, except for caspase-3,
   which showed decreased expression in the ectomesenchyme, but appeared
   first in the ossification zone at the 7th wk of development.
   Simultaneously, the oral epithelium showed weak (p53) to strong (hsp70)
   expression of all proteins investigated, while in Meckel's cartilage
   cells, bcl-2 was expressed weakly and hsp70 was expressed moderately.
   Cells on the surface of the forming bone were predominantly bax
   positive, and only occasionally bcl-2 positive. Only a few cells on the
   surface and inside the bony spicules co-expressed bax and bcl-2.
   Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated biotin-dUTP
   nick-end labelling (TUNEL)-positive cells were found to be apoptotic
   osteoblasts. The expression of all proteins investigated changed
   dynamically during early mandible development and the subsequent
   differentiation of Meckel's cartilage and bone. While interactions
   between those factors might be associated with the survival of Meckel's
   cartilage, in the ossification zone they might participate in the
   control of cell numbers, mineralization, and bone remodelling. Among
   many other factors, precise orchestration of pro- and anti-apoptotic
   factors contributes to normal mandible development.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting and diagnosing the causes of change through time in
   archaeological assemblages is a core enterprise of archaeology.
   Evolutionary approaches to this problem typically cast the causes of
   culture change as being either stochastic in origin, or arising from
   selection. Stochastic sources of change include random innovations,
   copying errors, drift and founder effects among dispersing groups.
   Selection is driven by differences in payoffs between cultural variants.
   Most efforts to identify these evolutionary forces in the archaeological
   record have relied on assessing how well the predictions from a
   neutral-stochastic model of cultural transmission fit a data set.
   Selection is inferred when the neutral-stochastic model fits poorly. A
   problem with this approach is that it does not test directly for the
   presence selection. Moreover, it does not account for the fact that both
   neutral-stochastic and selective forces can act at the same time on the
   same cultural variants. A different approach based on the Price Equation
   allows for the simultaneous measurement of selective and stochastic
   forces. This paper extends use of the Price Equation to the analysis of
   selective and stochastic forces operating on multiple artifact types
   within an assemblage. Ceramic data presented by Steele et al. (2010,
   Vol. 37(6): 1348-1358) from the Late Bronze Age Hittite site of
   Bogazkoy-Hattusa, Turkey, provide an opportunity to evaluate the
   efficacy of this model. The results suggest that selection is a dominant
   process driving the frequency evolution of different bowl rim types
   within the assemblage and that stochastic forces played little or no
   role. It is also clear, however, that we should be attentive to
   combinations of direct and indirect selective effects within assemblages

Abstract = {{The process whereby hydrogeologists interpret the available information
   to produce a justifiable set of simplifying assumptions to describe a
   groundwater system is called conceptual modelling. Although this process
   is inherent in all hydrogeological assessments and can therefore be
   regarded as synonymous with hydrogeological practice there are no
   standard specifications for it. A framework for conceptual modelling has
   been designed to both assist in the planning and process of the work and
   to provide an audit trail to facilitate independent scrutiny. The
   application of this framework is illustrated by two case histories, one
   of a small-scale investigation for a proposed cemetery and the other of
   an investigation of the migration of a large-scale sulphate plume in a
   public supply aquifer. This framework is applicable across the full
   range of scales of hydrogeological systems, and indeed is readily
   extendable to other analogous areas of endeavour in the management of
   natural resources.}},

Abstract = {{Deformation within a steady-state compressional orogen, i.e., where
   tectonic accretion is, on geological time scales, balanced by surface
   erosion, can best be described by a stationary velocity field.
   Instantaneous deformation results from spatial gradients in the velocity
   field, whereas total accumulated strain results from the integration of
   this instantaneous deformation along material paths following the flow
   lines defined by the velocity field. We have synthesized the net strain
   distributions for rocks exposed at the surface of such an orogenic
   system using simple, linear velocity fields corresponding to (a) simple
   shear within a dipping shear zone and (b) pure vertical shear. In both
   cases we demonstrate the development of surface patterns of finite
   strain accumulation that do not reflect the geometry of the assumed
   velocity field in a simple manner. Large gradients in finite strain
   arise as a consequence of the geographic variation in particle residence
   time imposed by the surface boundary, even for the limiting case where
   no instantaneous strain gradient exists. Such patterns of deformation
   are often recognised in exhumed orogenic systems, but have commonly been
   assumed to reflect more complex velocity fields resulting from
   nonlinear, localizing crustal rheologies. We therefore demonstrate that
   caution should be exercised in interpreting observed strain patterns
   because a proportion of the observed strain localization must be
   attributed to this purely kinematic (or geometric) effect - and this
   proportion may be significant in many systems. Such kinematic effects
   should be quantified, and subtracted from observed strain distributions
   before they are used to infer the rheological behavior of crustal rocks.
   We also suggest that in a simple shear (thrust) setting, kinematic
   strain localization may in fact nucleate strain softening on the side of
   the deforming region that is stable or fixed with respect to the Earth's
   surface and thus be responsible for the asymmetry that characterizes the
   large majority of thrust systems. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{The effect of long-term hormonal treatment on voiding patterns during
   filling cystometry and on urethral histology in a postpartum,

Journal = {{BJU INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To study whether long-term treatment with oestrogen (E-2), selective E-2
   receptor modulators (SERMs), or growth hormone (GH) can prevent the
   development of abnormal voiding patterns during filling cystometry (CMG)
   in a postpartum, ovariectomized (Ovx) female rat.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   Immediately after spontaneous delivery, 60 primiparous Sprague-Dawley
   rats were randomly divided into six equal groups. One group served as
   uninjured sham controls and five groups underwent intravaginal balloon
   dilatation. On day seven, previously dilated rats underwent bilateral
   Ovx and implantation of a subcutaneous hormone-delivery pump. The five
   treatment groups received normal saline (control), E-2, raloxifene,
   levormeloxifene, or GH for 7 weeks. Conscious CMG was performed 7 weeks
   after Ovx. Urethral sphincter tissue was harvested for elastin
   immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction of
   alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor mRNA.
   RESULTS
   No abnormal voiding patterns were detected in the group treated with GH.
   The E-2, raloxifene and levormeloxifene groups had greater detrusor
   overactivity and urethral relaxation incontinence than control rats. The
   raloxifene group had a significantly lower baseline bladder pressure and
   opening pressure. GH-treated rats had higher elastin content in the
   urethra. Urethral alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor mRNA concentration was
   significantly lower in the SERM-treated rats compared with controls.
   CONCLUSIONS
   GH prevents the development of abnormal voiding patterns during filling
   CMG in a rat model of parturition-induced incontinence; E-2 and SERMs
   may worsen voiding patterns.}},

   management using MTA for perforative defect of internal root resorption.
   During the endodontic treatment, the granulation tissue was removed and
   the root canal prepared. Calcium hydroxide was placed as a temporary
   dressing for 30 days. After this period, the root canal space and the
   perforation defect were filled with MTA. The clinical findings and
   periapical radiographs indicated success of treatment until 2 years of
   follow-up. However, the radiograph after 8 years showed an extensive
   radiolucent area in the middle third of the root with separation of the
   apical and coronal root segments. These findings were observed more
   accurately by using cone-beam computerized tomography. (Oral Surg Oral

   resected. Local recurrence occurred 6 years later as a 15 cm diameter
   liver tumor. Histological examination of the resected lesion showed
   features of an aggressive form of SET. Two years later, the patient
   presented with complaints of neck pain and ensuing examinations revealed
   a tumor of the cranial base. A new surgical resection was performed and
   histological examination confirmed a metastasis of the SET. Few weeks
   later, the patient presented an irreducible psoitis due to an iliac bone
   metastasis. He died within 1 month. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{A perforated, non rotating shadow band is described for separating
   global solar irradiance Into its diffuse and direct normal components
   using a single pyranometer Whereas shadow bands are normally solid so as
   to occult the sensor of a pyranometer throughout the day, the proposed
   band has apertures cut from its circumference to intermittently expose
   the instrument sensor at preset intervals Under clear sky conditions the
   device produces a saw tooth waveform of irradiance data from which it is
   possible to reconstruct separate global and diffuse curves The direct
   normal irradiance may then be calculated giving a complete breakdown of
   the irradiance curves without need of a second instrument or rotating
   shadow band This paper describes the principle of operation of the band
   and gives a mathematical model of its shading mask based on the results
   of an optical ray tracing study An algorithm for processing the data
   from the perforated band system is described and evaluated In an
   extended trial conducted at NREL's Solar Radiation Research Laboratory,
   the band coupled with a thermally corrected Eppley PSP produced
   independent curves for diffuse, global and direct normal irradiance with
   low mean bias errors of 5 6 W/m(2), 0 3 W/m(2) and 2 6 W/m(2)
   respectively, relative to collocated reference instruments Random
   uncertainties were 9 7 W/m(2) (diffuse), 17 3 W/m(2) (global) and 19 0
   W/m(2) (direct) When the data processing algorithm was modified to
   include the ray trace model of sensor exposure, uncertainties Increased
   only marginally, confirming the effectiveness of the model Deployment of
   the perforated band system can potentially increase the accuracy of data
   from ground stations in predominantly sunny areas where instrumentation
   is limited to a single pyranometer (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights

Title = {{The impact of shift patterns on junior doctors' perceptions of fatigue,

Abstract = {{Background The organisation of junior doctors' work hours has been
   radically altered following the partial implementation of the European
   Working Time Directive. Poorly designed shift schedules cause excessive
   disruption to shift workers' circadian rhythms.
   Method Interviews and focus groups were used to explore perceptions
   among junior doctors and hospital managers regarding the impact of the
   European Working Time Directive on patient care and doctors' well-being.
   Results Four main themes were identified. Under ``Doctors shift
   rotas{''}, doctors deliberated the merits and demerits of working seven
   nights in row. They also discussed the impact on fatigue of long
   sequences of day shifts. ``Education and training{''} focused on
   concerns about reduced on-the-job learning opportunities under the new
   working time arrangements and also about the difficulties of finding
   time and energy to study. ``Work/life balance{''} reflected the conflict
   between the positive aspects of working on-call or at night and the
   impact on life outside work. ``Social support structures{''} focused on
   the role of morale and team spirit. Good support structures in the work
   place counteracted and compensated for the effects of negative role
   stressors, and arduous and unsocial work schedules.
   Conclusions The impact of junior doctors' work schedules is influenced
   by the nature of specific shift sequences, educational considerations,
   issues of work/life balance and by social support systems. Poorly
   designed shift rotas can have negative impacts on junior doctors'
   professional performance and educational training, with implications for
   clinical practice, patient care and the welfare of junior doctors.}},

Abstract = {{Abdominal fat, and in particular, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), is the
   critical fat depot associated with metabolic aberrations. At present,
   VAT can only be accurately measured by computed tomography or magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI). This study was designed to compare a new
   abdominal bioelectrical impedance (BIA) device against total abdominal
   adipose tissue (TAAT) and VAT area measurements made from an abdominal
   MRI scan, and to assess its reliability and accuracy. One-hundred twenty
   participants were recruited, stratified by gender and BMI. Participants
   had triplicate measures of abdominal fat and waist circumference (WC)
   with the AB-140 (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) and WC measurements using a
   manual tape measure. A single abdominal MRI scan was performed as the
   reference method. Triplicate measures with the AB-140 showed excellent
   precision for ``visceral fat level,{''} trunk fat \%, and WC. AB-140
   ``visceral fat level{''} showed significantly stronger correlations with
   MRI TAAT area than with MRI VAT area (r = 0.94 vs. 0.65 in men and 0.92
   vs. 0.64 in women). AB-140 WC showed good correlation with manual WC
   measurements (r = 0.95 in men and 0.90 in women). AB-140 and manual WCs
   showed comparable correlations with MRI TAAT area (r = 0.92 and 0.96 in
   men and 0.88 and 0.88 in women). AB-140 is a simple, quick, and precise
   technique to measure abdominal fat and WC in healthy adults. It provides
   a useful proxy for TAAT measured by MRI, comparable to the correlation
   obtained with manual WC measurements. Neither the AB-140 abdominal fat
   measures nor WC measurement appear to provide a useful proxy measure of
   VAT.}},

Abstract = {{In strategic accounts of democratization, credible commitments by the
   opposition shape whether incumbents will relinquish power. Revisiting
   Kalyvas's study of Algeria and Belgium, this article introduces evidence
   from Egypt that shows the structural readiness of incumbents remains as
   consequential as commitment credibility. During the period 1990-2008 the
   credibility of democratic commitments by the Egyptian opposition
   improved along the lines identified by Kalyvas. Unlike its Algerian
   counterpart, the Islamic movement in Egypt was able to ``silence the
   radicals{''} and, after 1998, emit a non-dissonant message of electoral
   participation without militia violence. This improvement in commitment
   credibility was not reciprocated by Egyptian elites, who enjoyed western
   support and a sturdy repressive apparatus. Similar factors obstructed
   the Algerian opposition and they indicate a more disciplined, less
   dissonant Islamic party would have been unlikely to effect a democratic
   transition. Transitions are most likely when a credibly committed
   opposition faces an elite ready to rotate power. The second factor helps
   explain the success of the Catholic party in Belgium and the failure of
   comparable Islamic movements in North Africa.}},

   and first concepts of a methodology for the identification structured
   modeling and formalization of functional requirements of multifunctional
   systems Service hierarchies specify multifunctional systems in terms of
   their provided sub-functions called services together with their mutual
   relationships and dependencies A service hierarchy describes the
   functionality of multifunctional systems in a structured way Each
   service is specified independently and the specification is added to the
   service hierarchy Modes help to specify the feature interactions and by
   that functional dependencies between the services The approach is based
   on the Focus theory for modeling interface behavior and services (C)

Abstract = {{Issue addressed: Many good health promotion programs are implemented and
   evaluated but not published. The potential for the field to learn from
   these programs is therefore reduced. This article describes the design
   of an intervention to increase skills and confidence in writing for
   publication amongst health promotion practitioners in the Eastern
   Metropolitan Region (EMR) of Victoria.
   Methods: Health promotion practitioners from Community and Women's
   Health funded organisations in the EMR participated in the intervention,
   which was based on peer learning principles through a Short Course with
   key design elements. Two workshops where held over a two month period
   with a peer review process in between.
   Results: Of the 26 novice participants in the workshops, 14 wrote an
   article that was published in some form. At four weeks post the course,
   another four had an article in draft format which they planned to submit
   in the near future. All participants indicated a desire to continue to
   write for publication.
   Conclusions: Expecting health promotion practitioners to publish their
   work has had limited success in the past. This relatively short
   intervention has shown that to succeed, practitioners require a range of
   supports to enable them to gain the skills and confidence needed to
   write for publication.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Infection is the most frequent complication after heart
   transplantation (HTx) In this report and brief literature review we
   present a recipient who some 6 weeks post HTx had two donor related
   infections a ``common' primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and
   simultaneously a highly unusual donor-related Strongyloides stercoralis
   infection
   METHODS The parasite was discovered by chance in a skin biopsy CMV was
   treated with ganciclovir and the strongyloidiasis was cured with two
   courses of anti-helminthic therapy initially with ivermectine and
   albendazol and, in response to eosinophilia with ivermectine monotherapy
   The patient s recovery was further complicated by two successive
   rejection episodes a relapse of the CMV syndrome and a novel influenza
   A/H1N1 infection These episodes were treated with steroids ganciclovir
   and oseltamivir respectively
   RESULTS It took almost 9 months before a permanent IgG anti-CMV response
   was seen At 13 months post-HTx coronary angiography showed only slight
   vessel wall abnormalities At present the patient is back at home and in
   good condition
   CONCLUSION Until now only 4 recipient-derived strongyloidiasis cases
   have been described in post HTx patients all diagnosed by autopsies This
   is the first report of a donor related Strongyloides infection in a
   patient after HTx J Heart Lung Transplant 2010 29 1433-7 (C) 2010

Abstract = {{We demonstrate enhancement by 1 order of magnitude of the high-order
   harmonics generated in argon by combining a fundamental field at 1300 nm
   (10(14) W cm(-2)) and its orthogonally polarized second harmonic at 650
   nm (2 x 10(13) W cm(-2)) and by controlling the relative phase between
   them. This extends earlier work by ensuring that the main effect is the
   combined field steering the electron trajectory with negligible
   contribution from multiphoton effects compared to the previous schemes
   with 800/400 nm fields. We access a broad energy range of harmonics
   (from 20 eV to 80 eV) at a low laser intensity (far below the ionization
   saturation limit) and observe deep modulation of the harmonic yield with
   a period of p in the relative phase. Strong field theoretical analysis
   reveals that this is principally due to the steering of the recolliding
   electron wave packet by the two-color field. Our modeling also shows
   that the atto chirp can be controlled, leading to production of shorter
   pulses. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America}},

   performance-wise, but their implementation is a non-trivial,
   time-consuming task-affecting the interpreter's maintenance for years to
   come, too. Recent research addresses this issue by providing ways of
   leveraging existing just-in-time compilation infrastructures.
   Though there has been considerable research on improving the efficiency
   of just-in-time compilers, the area of optimizing interpreters has
   gotten less attention-as if the implementation of a dynamic translation
   system was the ``ultima ratio{''} for efficiently interpreting
   programming languages. We present optimization techniques for improving
   the efficiency of interpreters without requiring just-in-time
   compilation-thereby maintaining the ease-of-implementation
   characteristic that brought many people to implementing an interpreter

   sulfur bacterium}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{780-790}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Two strains of purple sulfur bacteria of the family
   Ectothiorhodospiraceae were isolated from moderately saline steppe lakes
   (with pH above 9.0) of the Transbaikal region (strain B7-7) and Mongolia
   (strain M10). The cells of the novel strains were spiral-shaped, 2.0-3.2
   x 9.6-20.0 mu m, motile due to a polar tuft of flagella. Photosynthetic
   pigments were represented by bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids of
   the spirilloxanthin series. Photosynthetic membranes were represented by
   long strands of lamellae distributed throughout the whole cell; unlike
   most Ectothiorhodospiraceae species, the membranes were not packed into
   regular stacks. Bacteria were capable of weak growth on sulfide and slow
   grow on hydrogen under photoautotrophic conditions. The best growth was
   noted on sulfide in the presence of acetate and bicarbonate. Thiosulfate
   did not stimulate phototrophic growth, even in the presence of organic
   substrates. The new isolates were alkaliphiles growing at a pH optimum
   of 9-10. Growth was possible within a salinity range of 0-80 g/l NaCl,
   with an optimum at 5-15 g/l NaCl. The morphology, the structure of the
   photosynthetic apparatus (strands of lamellae), and the physiology of
   the new strains were similar to those of Thiorhodospira sibirica.
   However, analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the
   studied isolates were closely related to the type strain
   Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii (99\% similarity) of the family
   Ectothiorhodospiraceae, whereas the level of similarity between the new
   strains and Thiorhodospira sibirica was only 94-95\%. According to the
   results of DNA-DNA hybridization, the DNA-DNA homology level between the
   tested strains was almost 100\%; the similarity between the new isolates
   and the type strain Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii was only 58\%. The
   isolates differed from other representatives of the genus
   Ectothiorhodospira in the structure of the gene encoding the key enzyme
   of autotrophic CO2 fixation, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase
   (RuBisCo), which was similar to the RuBisCo genes of members of another
   family of sulfur bacteria, Chromatiaceae. The new isolates of purple
   bacteria were described as a new species of the genus
   Ectothiorhodospira, Ect. magna sp. nov. with the type strain B7-7(T) (=
   VKM B-2537 = DSM 22250).}},

Title = {{Results of a Pilot Study With a Signal Enhancement Algorithm for HiRes
   120 Cochlear Implant Users}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Cochlear implant users still experience severe limitations
   regarding sound quality, music appreciation, and speech perception in
   adverse listening situation. To improve hearing in noisy environments,
   the incorporation of signal enhancement algorithms was initiated.
   Method: The study group consisted of 13 postlingually deafened adults
   using HiRes 120. Participants were fitted with 2 versions of the noise
   reduction algorithm: a moderate and a strong setting. In an immediate
   session, the HSM sentence test in speech-shaped noise was administered
   using the clinical program as well as both noise reduction programs.
   Participants were asked to try all 3 programs in everyday listening
   situations at home and provide a rating of sound quality and speech
   perception via a questionnaire (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid
   Benefit).
   Results: During the fitting, no difficulties were encountered, and all
   participants accepted the noise reduction programs without any
   acclimatization. All participants achieved better results with both
   noise reduction programs in the HSM sentence test in noise compared with
   the clinical program. Group mean speech perception scores were highly
   significantly better for the ClearVoice settings compared with the
   clinical program score. The majority preferred one of the ClearVoice
   conditions, with 4 participants for the strong and 3 for the moderate
   setting.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a real potential benefit for noise
   reduction algorithms in cochlear implant processors. Although algorithm
   parameters were not optimized individually, a significant improvement
   could still be achieved. Further investigation is required to develop
   fitting guidelines and achieve parameter optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Breastfeeding accounts for about 40\% of mother-to-child transmission of

   safe feeding alternatives exist. However, as replacement feeding is not
   safely available in many parts of the world, and because breastfeeding
   provides optimal nutrition and protection against other infant
   infections, there is intense ongoing research to make breastfeeding safe
   for HIV-1-infected mothers in resource-limited settings. More research
   is needed to determine the optimal duration of breastfeeding, optimal
   weaning practices, and which individual antiretroviral prophylactic

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) causes a range of deleterious effects in wildlife, but
   little is known about its effects on amphibians. Our objective was to
   determine whether Hg affects performance and behavior in two-lined
   salamanders (Eurycea bislineata). We collected salamanders from
   Hg-contaminated and reference sites and assessed speed, responsiveness,
   and prey capture ability. Mercury concentrations were >17 x higher in
   salamanders from the contaminated sites and were among the highest
   documented in amphibians. In the first, but not in the second,
   locomotion trial, we found a significant effect of Hg on speed and
   responsiveness. In the prey capture experiment, reference salamanders
   ate approximately twice as many prey items as the contaminated
   salamanders. Together, our results suggest that sublethal Hg
   concentrations may negatively affect salamanders by reducing their
   ability to successfully execute tasks critical to survival. Future work
   is warranted to determine whether Hg has other sublethal effects on
   salamanders and whether other amphibians are similarly affected. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a genetic locus
   at human chromosome 8q24 as having minor alleles associated with lower
   levels of plasma triglyceride (TG) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), higher
   levels of HDL-C, as well as decreased risk for myocardial infarction.
   This locus contains only one annotated gene, tribbles homolog 1 (TRIB1),
   which has not previously been implicated in lipoprotein metabolism. Here
   we demonstrate a role for Trib1 as a regulator of lipoprotein metabolism
   in mice. Hepatic-specific overexpression of Trib1 reduced levels of
   plasma TG and cholesterol by reducing VLDL production; conversely,
   Trib1-knockout mice showed elevated levels of plasma TG and cholesterol
   due to increased VLDL production. Hepatic Trib1 expression was inversely
   associated with the expression of key lipogenic genes and measures of
   lipogenesis. Thus, we provide functional evidence for what we believe to
   be a novel gene regulating hepatic lipogenesis and VLDL production in
   mice that influences plasma lipids and risk for myocardial infarction in
   humans.}},

Abstract = {{Over 85\% of equids live in developing countries, where they are usually
   used for work. We aimed to identify environmental factors associated
   with potential welfare problems in working equids, helping target
   welfare interventions towards the most vulnerable animals. Over 5 years,
   non-invasive behavioural and physical data were collected from 5481
   donkeys, 4504 horses, and 858 mules across nine developing countries.
   Hoof and limb problems were over 90\% prevalent, and 85\% of equids were
   thin. Older, thinner animals had the most problems, and species
   differences in susceptibility were found. Equids used to transport
   people by cart, to carry goods by pack, or to work in bricks kilns had
   more problems than other equids. Rural equids had more problems than
   urban ones, but urban equids had more lesions, and were more aggressive
   towards observers. Equids were significantly thinner when climates were
   warmer. These results should aid the development and targeting of
   specific welfare interventions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Incubation of pacific cod eggs was divided into eight series, in which
   temperatures were set at -0.04A degrees C to +4.03A degrees C and warm
   and cold conditions alternated. The morphological changes that took
   place during the embryogenesis were described in detail using the
   results of the incubation. Twenty-two morphological characters that
   could be identified easily and that characterized the morphogenesis were
   defined in the course of development. The results of the incubation and
   data from the literature showed that the duration of the embryonic
   period in the Pacific cod's lifecycle grew exponentially as water
   temperature decreased. It was found during the experiment that
   developing cod eggs survived low water temperatures up to freezing, as
   well as abrupt warming or cooling (over 3A degrees C). According to the
   widely accepted Rass scale, the first stage of the Pacific cod
   embryogenesis takes 21\% of its total duration, the second stage 23\%,
   the third, 17\%, and the fourth, 39\%. However, at a temperature below
   0A degrees C, the relative duration of the stages of cleavage and
   embryonic shield was slightly shortened, whereas the mature embryo stage
   extended to almost half of the embryogenesis period. A more
   comprehensive analysis of temperature effects on embryogenesis revealed
   that the reduction of the rate of embryogenesis upon a temperature
   decrease occurred mostly at later stages of embryo growth. Modeling of
   development using defined morphological characters showed that the
   duration of embryogenesis grew linearly as the incubation temperature
   dropped in the first half of the embryogenesis and exponentially in the
   second half. A function was selected that described the obtained results
   most satisfactorily and that could be used for estimating the duration
   of the entire embryogenesis or any its stages within the range of water
   temperatures typical for Pacific cod.}},

Abstract = {{A set S of vertices of a connected graph G is convex, if for any pair of
   vertices u, v is an element of S, every shortest path joining u and v is
   contained in S. The convex hull CH (S) of a set of vertices S is defined
   as the smallest convex set in G containing S. The set S is geodetic, if
   every vertex of G lies on some shortest path joining two vertices in S,
   and it is said to be a hull set if its convex hull is V (G). The
   geodetic and the hull numbers of G are the minimum cardinality of a
   geodetic and a minimum hull set, respectively. In this work, we
   investigate the behavior of both geodetic and hull sets with respect to
   the strong product operation for graphs. We also establish some bounds
   for the geodetic number and the hull number and obtain the exact value
   of these parameters for a number of strong product graphs. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The associations between the quality of teacher student interactions and
   first grade academic and adaptive behavior outcomes were examined in a
   study of 106 Portuguese students in 64 first grade classrooms. Students'
   vocabulary, print concepts, math, and adaptive skills were assessed both
   at the end of preschool and in first grade. Classrooms were observed in
   the spring of first grade. After taking into account family risk factors
   and preschool skills, the quality of teacher student interactions,
   particularly in terms of classroom organization, was positively
   associated with students' first grade vocabulary and print concepts. In
   addition, classroom quality predicted number identification outcomes
   differently depending on student skills prior to school entry. Students
   with lower preschool math skills seemed to benefit from higher quality
   teacher student interactions. These findings provide further support for
   the unique contribution of the quality of teacher student interactions
   in first grade and suggest that it may be an important mechanism to
   improve academic skills. (C) 2010 Society for the Study of School

Title = {{Smoothing algorithms for mean-flow extraction in large-eddy simulation
   of complex turbulent flows}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Based on physical arguments, the importance of separating the mean-flow
   from turbulence in the modeling of the subgrid-scale eddy-viscosity is
   emphasized. Therefore, two distinct time-domain smoothing algorithms are
   proposed to estimate the mean-flow as the simulation progresses, namely,
   an exponentially weighted moving average (or exponential smoothing) and
   an adaptive low-pass Kalman filter. These algorithms highlight the
   longer-term evolution or cycles of the flow but erase short-term
   fluctuations. Indeed, it is our assumption that the mean-flow (in the
   statistical sense) may be approximated as the low-frequency component of
   the velocity field and that the turbulent part of the flow adds itself
   to this ``unsteady mean.{''} The cutoff frequency separating these two
   components is fixed according to some characteristic time-scale of the
   flow in the exponential smoothing, but inferred dynamically from the
   recent history of the flow in the Kalman filter. In practice, these two
   algorithms are implemented in large-eddy simulations that rely on a
   shear-improved Smagorinsky's model. In this model, the magnitude of
   mean-flow rate of strain is subtracted from the magnitude of the
   instantaneous rate of strain in the subgrid-scale eddy-viscosity. Two
   test-cases have been investigated: a turbulent plane-channel flow
   (Re-w=395) and the flow past a circular cylinder in the subcritical
   turbulent regime (Re-D=4.7 x 10(4)). Comparisons with direct numerical
   simulation and experimental data demonstrate the good efficiency of the
   whole modeling. This allows us to address nonhomogeneous unsteady
   configurations without adding significant complication and computational
   cost to the standard Smagorinsky's model. From a computational
   viewpoint, this modeling deserves interest since it is entirely local in
   space. It is therefore adapted for parallelization and convenient for
   boundary conditions. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The nonlinear behavior and in-plane stability of parabolic shallow
   arches with elastic rotational supports are investigated. A central
   concentrated load is applied to create the compression in the supports.
   Nonlinear buckling analysis based on the virtual work formulation is
   carried out to obtain the critical load for both symmetric snap-through
   buckling and anti-symmetric bifurcation buckling. It is found that the
   effect of rotational stiffness of the elastic supports on the critical
   loads is significant. The critical load increases as either the initial
   stiffness coefficient alpha or the stiffening rate beta increases. The
   effect of the stiffening rate beta on the critical loads decreases, as
   the initial stiffness coefficient alpha increases. In addition, the
   influence of rotational stiffness on the bifurcation buckling is larger
   than that on the snap-through buckling. The limit of the geometric
   parameter lambda between the bifurcation and snap-through buckling modes
   also increases with the increase in the stiffening rate beta. In
   addition, the snap-through buckling mode governs the buckling of the
   arch with larger stiffening rates.}},

Abstract = {{Gastric cardia cancer (GCC), which occurs at the gastric-esophageal
   boundary, is one of the most malignant tumors. Despite its high
   mortality and morbidity, the molecular mechanism of initiation and
   progression of this disease is largely unknown. In this study, using
   proteomics and metabolomics approaches, we found that the level of
   several enzymes and their related metabolic intermediates involved in
   glucose metabolism were deregulated in GCC. Among these enzymes, two
   subunits controlling pyruvic acid efflux, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)
   and pyruvate dehydrogenase B (PDHB), were further analyzed in vitro.
   Either down-regulation of LDH subunit LDHA or overexpression of PDH
   subunit PDHB could force pyruvic acid into the Krebs cycle rather than
   the glycolysis process in AGS gastric cancer cells, which inhibited cell
   growth and cell migration. Our results reflect an important glucose
   metabolic signature, especially the dysregulation of pyruvic acid efflux
   in the development of GCC. Forced transition from glycolysis to the
   Krebs cycle had an inhibitory effect on GCC progression, providing
   potential therapeutic targets for this disease. Molecular \& Cellular
   Proteomics 9: 2617-2628, 2010.}},

Abstract = {{Hematophagy is a feeding habit that involves the ingestion of huge
   amounts of heme. The hematophagous hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus evolved
   many genetic resources to protect cells against heme toxicity. The
   primary barrier against the deleterious effects of heme is the
   aggregation of heme into hemozoin in the midgut lumen. Hemozoin
   formation is followed by the enzymatic degradation of heme by means of a
   unique pathway whose end product is dicysteinyl-biliverdin IX-gamma
   (Rhodnius prolixus biliverdin, RpBv). These mechanisms are complemented
   by a heme-binding protein (RHBP) in the hemolymph that attenuates the
   pro-oxidant effects of heme. In this work, we show that when insects are
   fed with blood enriched with a heme analog, Sn-protoporphyrin (SnPP-IX),
   both hemozoin synthesis and RpBv production are inhibited in a
   dose-dependent manner. These effects are accompanied by increased
   oxidative damage to the midgut epithelium and inhibition of oviposition,
   indicating that hemozoin formation and heme degradation are protective
   mechanisms that work together and contributed to the adaptation of this
   insect to successfully feed on vertebrate blood. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In the early 20th century, artists and administrators at New York City's
   American Museum of Natural History relied upon the tools of visual
   education to help visitors `virtually witness' the prehistoric past.
   This decision to reconstruct a world no one had ever seen aroused hot
   debate among the museum's staff. Reconstructions forced the museum's
   scientists, artists and administrators to decide whether emotional,
   scientific or artistic truths were in conflict and, if so, which should
   take priority. The conflicts over the museum's reconstructions of the
   past illuminate the difficulties of rendering information that could not
   be verified by eyewitnesses, and the limitations of visual education
   when it came to representing scientific and historical information.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous Si3B3N7 ceramic shows intrinsic photoluminescence. Three
   distinctive emission regions have been observed. Excitation with
   wavelengths between 254 and 330 nm stimulates intense blue emissions
   with peak maxima ranging from 447 to 479 nm. Exciting between 315 and
   420 nm results in two broad emission peaks; the first in the range
   between 400 and 440 nm, and the second between 560 and 690 nm. Of these
   two latter emissions, the one in the violet region dominates in
   intensity over the other one in the red region, thus a violet color is
   perceived with the eye via excitation with 330 nm or higher wavelengths.
   The three distinct intrinsic emissions in the photoluminescence spectrum
   of amorphous Si3B3N7 ceramic are related to defect centers in three
   topologically different regions in its structure. Dependence of emission
   on excitation wavelength is associated with the Red-Edge Effect and can
   be explained with a reabsorption mechanism at the red excitation edge.

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{76}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article is an overview of shifting political-administrative
   relationships in South Africa, with particular reference to growing
   politicization (partisan control of the bureaucracy). Studies of
   politicization of public services are important because political
   involvement in management has often led to negative effects on service
   delivery. The article sets out a theoretical framework for
   political-administrative relationships, examining the growing
   politicization of public services, the impact of New Public Management
   (NPM) and political-administrative relationships in developing
   countries. It then looks at political-administrative relationships in
   South Africa, including the apartheid history, the development of a new
   framework in the democratic South Africa and politicization in the
   staffing of the public service. It examines three functional areas - the
   decentralization of powers, contract appointments and performance
   management - and discusses the implications of this changing framework
   for service delivery. The methodology consisted of interviews with a
   number of senior government officials, including three current
   directors-general and a former Minister for the Public Service and
   Administration, an analysis of government legislation, Public Service
   Commission (PSC) data including surveys, unpublished data of the
   Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA), policy papers of
   the African National Congress (ANC) and an Organisation for Economic
   Co-operation and Development (OECD) study of political involvement in
   bureaucracies. The article concludes that growing politicization of the
   public service has contributed to poor service delivery, and that the
   South African government needs to place greater emphasis on merit as the
   basis for appointments and promotions.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{425-430}},

Abstract = {{Background/aim:
   Refugees experience higher levels of emotional, psychological and
   physical distress than the general migrant population during settlement
   in a new country. Safety in the home can be a major concern and is an
   issue of which occupational therapists should be aware. Occupational
   therapists working with refugees in many contexts feel unprepared and
   overwhelmed. As refugee settlement workers attend to home safety of
   refugees during the settlement process, this study aimed to develop an
   in-depth understanding of their perceptions of this issue. Such
   information can contribute to occupational therapists' knowledge and
   practice when working with refugees.
   Methods:
   An exploratory qualitative case study approach used 16 semi-structured
   interviews and observation of a settlement worker assisting newly
   arrived refugees. Participants were settlement service staff (an
   occupational therapist, case coordinators and cultural support workers).
   Results:
   Three themes are reported: considerations for safety in the homes of
   refugees; factors influencing home safety for refugees; and sensitivity
   to culture. Participants described tailoring home safety-related
   services to each individual based on factors that influence home safety
   and sensitivity to culture.
   Conclusion:
   Awareness of home safety issues can increase cultural competence and
   inform practice and policy.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes two new techniques, in the framework of set
   membership (SM) theory, to derive off-line an approximation of a given
   non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) law. The obtained
   approximated control laws satisfy input constraints and guarantee a
   bounded worst-case approximation error. Such a bound can be tuned to
   obtain a tradeoff between closed-loop performance, on-line evaluation
   complexity, off-line computational burden and memory usage. The
   presented techniques are suboptimal, since their worst-case
   approximation error is not minimal; however, they are able to obtain
   good accuracy with efficient on-line computation. Both approaches are
   based on the prior information given by a finite number nu of nominal
   control moves, computed off-line and stored. The first technique relies
   on the piecewise linear interpolation of the off-line computed data,
   while the second approach is based on the computation of the
   (suboptimal) upper and lower bounds of the nominal NMPC law, on the
   basis of the partial information given by a subset of the whole off-line
   computed data. A numerical example and an automotive case study are
   presented in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches
   and to compare their performance.}},

Journal = {{ANESTHESIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{113}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background Results from previous studies have shown favorable effects
   from the addition of buprenorphine to local anesthetics used for
   interscalene or axillary perivascular brachial plexus blocks The main
   objective of the current study was to determine whether addition of
   buprenorphine could enhance bupivacaine analgesia after infragluteal
   sciatic nerve block
   Methods One hundred and three consenting adult patients for elective
   foot and ankle outpatient surgeries were prospectively assigned
   randomly, in double-blind fashion, to one of three groups Group 1
   received 0 5\% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1 200,000 for infragluteal
   sciatic block plus 1 ml normal saline intramuscularly Group 2 received
   bupivacaine sciatic block along with intramuscular buprenorphine (0 3
   mg) Group 3 received bupivacaine plus buprenorphine for infragluteal
   sciatic block and 1 ml normal saline intramuscularly
   Results Although patients receiving buprenorphine either for sciatic
   block or intramuscularly had less pain in the post-anesthesia care unit
   compared with patients receiving only bupivacaine, the individual pair
   wise comparison of the analysis of variance model showed no statistical
   difference However, only buprenorphine added to bupivacaine for sciatic
   block prolonged postoperative analgesia Patients receiving a combination
   of buprenorphine and bupivacaine for sciatic block had lower numeric
   rating pain scores and received less opioid medication at home thin
   patients in the other two groups
   Conclusions The results show that buprenorphine may enhance and prolong
   the analgesic effect of bupivacaine when used for sciatic nerve blocks
   in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery under general anesthesia
   but does not do so to the extent shown in previous studies using
   brachial plexus models with mepivacaine and tetracaine}},

Volume = {{157}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the Leptochloopsis virgata esparto patches growing
   in the Dominican Republic. These communities thrive mostly in shaded
   areas, as happens in the southwest of the island and the Cibao valley,
   where xericity records are high and vegetative inactivity lasts for over
   7 months. The Leptochloopsis virgata esparto patches tend to be located
   in the Caribbean-Atlantic Subprovince, on the Quaternary marls of the
   Cibao valley, Azua, Bani, Lago Enriquillo, and on the serpentines of
   Puerto Plata, with an ombrotype ranging from semiarid to subhumid, but
   with a semiarid and dry character in the areas colonized by the
   espartillo and a thermotype which always remains infra-tropical. The
   high percentage of endemic species and media give rise to a high number
   of endemic, ecologically and geobotanically, highly valuable habitats.
   This paper suggests two new alliances and four associations. These
   latter, at least, present an endemic character and, consequently, should
   be considered as priority habitats for preservation purposes, since they
   are located in man-altered areas and the risk of species extinction
   cannot be ignored.}},

Abstract = {{A logistic model was employed to correlate the outbreak of highly
   pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) with related environmental factors and
   the migration of birds. Based on MODIS data of the normalized difference
   vegetation index, environmental factors were considered in generating a
   probability map with the aid of logistic regression. A Bayesian maximum
   entropy model was employed to explore the spatial and temporal
   correlations of HPAI incidence. The results show that proximity to water
   bodies and national highways was statistically relevant to the
   occurrence of HPAI. Migratory birds, mainly waterfowl, were important
   infection sources in HPAI transmission. In addition, the HPAI outbreaks
   had high spatiotemporal autocorrelation. This epidemic spatial range
   fluctuated 45 km owing to different distribution patterns of cities and
   water bodies. Furthermore, two outbreaks were likely to occur with a
   period of 22 d. The potential risk of occurrence of HPAI in Mainland
   China for the period from January 23 to February 17, 2004 was simulated
   based on these findings, providing a useful meta-model framework for the
   application of environmental factors in the prediction of HPAI risk.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a process engine is one of the key factors that
   contribute to the successful deployment of systems, based on a
   service-oriented architecture. A novel service process engine that can
   be self-configured dynamically is introduced in the paper. It is based
   on the Jini platform, and leverages of Jini services to provide key
   functionalities. It automatically maintains the global performance by
   performing load balancing and configuring the system structure
   dynamically. A heuristic algorithm is applied to indicate every client's
   request with a workload tag after a service process model is designed.
   Based on workload tags of client requests and the status of available
   services in the engine, a controller allocates the requests to
   appropriate services and dynamically reconfigures the engine based on
   fuzzy control algorithms. Algorithms and the architecture for the engine
   are discussed in detail; in addition, performance experiments are
   performed to show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by recent clinical and laboratory findings of important
   effects of pulsatile pressure and flow on arterial adaptations, we
   employ and extend an established constrained mixture framework of growth
   (change in mass) and remodelling (change in structure) to include such
   dynamical effects. New descriptors of cell and tissue behavior
   (constitutive relations) are postulated and refined based on new
   experimental data from a transverse aortic arch banding model in the
   mouse that increases pulsatile pressure and flow in one carotid artery.
   In particular, it is shown that there was a need to refine constitutive
   relations for the active stress generated by smooth muscle, to include
   both stress- and stress rate-mediated control of the turnover of cells
   and matrix and to account for a cyclic stress-mediated loss of elastic
   fibre integrity and decrease in collagen stiffness in order to capture
   the reported evolution, over 8 weeks, of luminal radius, wall thickness,
   axial force and in vivo axial stretch of the hypertensive mouse carotid
   artery. We submit, therefore, that complex aspects of adaptation by
   elastic arteries can be predicted by constrained mixture models wherein
   individual constituents are produced or removed at individual rates and
   to individual extents depending on changes in both stress and stress
   rate from normal values.}},

Abstract = {{The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) is a simple test measuring global
   physical function. It is commonly used to predict mortality in patients
   with cardiac and pulmonary diseases, but it is also useful in assessing
   the functional status of patients with a variety of other medical
   conditions. We sought to determine (1) the characteristics of the 6MWD
   in patients listed for liver transplantation (LT), (2) the existence of
   a relationship between the 6MWD and the quality of life, and (3) the
   relationship between the 6MWD and survival in LT candidates. The 6MWD
   was prospectively measured in all patients listed for LT. The 6MWD was
   determined when the listed Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)
   score was >= 15. Patients were followed until LT, death, removal from
   the wait list, or the end of the study period. Quality of life was
   assessed with the Short Form 36 (SF-36). In 121 patients, the mean 6MWD
   was 369 122 m; it was not related to age, height, weight, body mass
   index, albumin level, or etiology of liver disease and showed a moderate
   correlation with the physical component score (PCS) on the SF-36 (r =
   0.4) and a moderate inverse correlation with the native MELD score (r =
   -0.61). In an unadjusted analysis, a high native MELD score, a low 6MWD,
   and a low PCS were associated with mortality, with only the 6MWD
   retaining significance after adjustment for covariates. Each 100-m
   increase in the 6MWD was significantly associated with increased
   survival (hazard ratio = 0.48, P = 0.0001), with 6MWD < 250 m being
   associated with an increased risk of death (P = 0.0001). In conclusion,
   the 6MWD is significantly reduced in patients awaiting LT and is
   inversely correlated with the native MELD score. A pretransplant 6MWD <
   250 m is a risk for death on the wait list. Liver Transpl 16:1373-1378,

Journal = {{CURRENT GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Genomic structural changes, such as gene Copy Number Variations (CNVs)
   are extremely abundant in the human genome. An enormous effort is
   currently ongoing to recognize and catalogue human CNVs and their
   associations with abnormal phenotypic outcomes. Recently, several
   reports related neuropsychiatric diseases (i.e. autism spectrum
   disorders, schizophrenia, mental retardation, behavioral problems,
   epilepsy) with specific CNV. Moreover, for some conditions, both the
   deletion and duplication of the same genomic segment are related to the
   phenotype. Syndromes associated with CNVs (microdeletion and
   microduplication) have long been known to display specific
   neurobehavioral traits. It is important to note that not every gene is
   susceptible to gene dosage changes and there are only a few dosage
   sensitive genes. Smith-Magenis (SMS) and Potocki-Lupski (PTLS) syndromes
   are associated with a reciprocal microdeletion and microduplication
   within chromosome 17p11.2. in humans. The dosage sensitive gene
   responsible for most phenotypes in SMS has been identified: the Retinoic
   Acid Induced 1 (RAI1). Studies on mouse models and humans suggest that
   RAI1 is likely the dosage sensitive gene responsible for clinical
   features in PTLS. In addition, the human RAI1 gene has been implicated
   in several neurobehavioral traits as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA2),
   schizophrenia and non syndromic autism. In this review we discuss the
   evidence of RAI1 as a dosage sensitive gene, its relationship with
   different neurobehavioral traits, gene structure and mutations, and what
   is known about its molecular and cellular function, as a first step in
   the elucidation of the mechanisms that relate dosage sensitive genes
   with abnormal neurobehavioral outcomes.}},

Title = {{Discrete Event Simulation: The Preferred Technique for Health Economic
   Evaluations?}},
Journal = {{VALUE IN HEALTH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1056-1060}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives:
   To argue that discrete event simulation should be preferred to cohort
   Markov models for economic evaluations in health care.
   Methods:
   The basis for the modeling techniques is reviewed. For many health-care
   decisions, existing data are insufficient to fully inform them,
   necessitating the use of modeling to estimate the consequences that are
   relevant to decision-makers. These models must reflect what is known
   about the problem at a level of detail sufficient to inform the
   questions. Oversimplification will result in estimates that are not only
   inaccurate, but potentially misleading.
   Results:
   Markov cohort models, though currently popular, have so many limitations
   and inherent assumptions that they are inadequate to inform most
   health-care decisions. An event-based individual simulation offers an
   alternative much better suited to the problem. A properly designed
   discrete event simulation provides more accurate, relevant estimates
   without being computationally prohibitive. It does require more data and
   may be a challenge to convey transparently, but these are necessary
   trade-offs to provide meaningful and valid results.
   Conclusion:
   In our opinion, discrete event simulation should be the preferred
   technique for health economic evaluations today.}},

Abstract = {{The 2010 Academic Emergency Medicine (AEM) consensus conference ``Beyond
   Regionalization{''} aimed to place the design of a 21st century
   emergency care delivery system at the center of emergency medicine's
   (EM's) health policy research agenda. To examine the lessons learned
   from existing regional systems, consensus conference organizers convened
   a panel discussion made up of experts from the fields of acute care
   surgery, interventional cardiology, acute ischemic stroke, cardiac
   arrest, critical care medicine, pediatric EM, and medical toxicology.
   The organizers asked that each member provide insight into the barriers
   that slowed network creation and the solutions that allowed them to
   overcome barriers. For ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
   (STEMI) management, the American Heart Association's (AHA's) Mission:
   Lifeline aims to increase compliance with existing guidelines through
   improvements in the chain of survival, including emergency medical
   services (EMS) protocols. Increasing use of therapeutic hypothermia
   post-cardiac arrest through a network of hospitals in Virginia has led
   to dramatic improvements in outcome. A regionalized network of acute
   stroke management in Cincinnati was discussed, in addition to the effect
   of pediatric referral centers on pediatric capabilities of surrounding
   facilities. The growing importance of telemedicine to a variety of
   emergencies, including trauma and critical care, was presented. Finally,
   the importance of establishing a robust reimbursement mechanism was
   illustrated by the threatened closure of poison control centers
   nationwide. The panel discussion added valuable insight into the
   possibilities of maximizing patient outcomes through regionalized
   systems of emergency care. A primary challenge remaining is for EM to
   help to integrate the existing and developing disease-based systems of
   care into a more comprehensive emergency care system.

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the thermal decomposition of processed poly(lactic acid)
   has been studied and compared to that of raw material. Processing
   consisted of two different industrial processes: 1) Injection (with or
   without further annealing): 2) Extrusion followed by injection (with or
   without further annealing). For this study, an integral method (based on
   the general analytical solution), differential methods (based on the
   first conversion derivative and on the 2nd derivative) and special
   methods have been used. On the other hand, a method based on the maximum
   decomposition rate has been considered. By doing that. the kinetic
   parameters (reaction order, frequency factor and activation energy) have
   been determined. It has been demonstrated that there was only one
   first-order reaction for the entire conversion range. A new equation
   (based on the second conversion derivative plot as a function of
   temperature) was developed allowing the calculation of the reaction
   order. This method quantifies peak areas (and not peak heights, as
   reported by Kissinger). It is very useful because it considers both peak
   shape and width. Activation energy, as determined by using the general
   analytical solution, was 318 kJ/mol for unprocessed poly(lactic acid)
   whereas it was 280 +/- 5 kJ/mol for processed materials. All the
   processed materials had approximately the same thermal stability (T-5 =
   333.0-335.8 degrees C, at 95\% confidence level), which was slightly
   lower than that of unprocessed materials (T-5 = 337.5 degrees C). PLA
   melting (during extrusion and injection) was responsible for
   depolymerization reactions (the small molecules formed during melting
   processes can volatilize readily). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Longitudinal surveys have emerged in recent years is an important data
   collection tool tor population studies where the primary interest is to
   examine population changes over time at the individual level
   Longitudinal data are often analyzed through the generalized estimating
   equations (GEE) approach The vast majority of existing literature on the
   GEE method however is developed under non survey settings and are
   inappropriate for data collected through complex sampling designs In
   this paper the authors develop a pseudo GEE approach for the analysis of
   survey data They show that survey weights must and can be appropriately
   accounted in the GEE method under a joint randomization framework The
   consistency of the resulting pseudo-GEE estimators is established under
   the proposed framework Linearization variance estimators are developed
   for the pseudo-GEE estimators when the finite population sampling
   tractions are small or negligible, a scenario often held for large-scale
   surveys Finite sample performances of the proposed estimators are
   investigated through an extensive simulation study using data from the
   National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth The results show that
   the pseudo GEE estimators and the linearization variance estimators
   perform well under several sampling designs and for both continuous and

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Combination treatment with toxins and fillers is the standard regimen in
   facial rejuvenation. Systematic studies of botulinum toxin alone and in
   combination with hyaluronic acid (HA) have not, however, been conducted
   in the lower face.
   OBJECTIVE
   To evaluate safety and effectiveness and compare combination treatment
   with onabotulinumtoxinA and a 24-mg/mL smooth, cohesive HA gel filler
   with either treatment alone for rejuvenation of the perioral area and
   lower face in female subjects.
   METHODS
   Ninety female participants aged 35 to 55 were randomized to one of three
   groups: 24-mg/mL cohesive gel alone (n=30), onabotulinumtoxinA alone
   (n=30), or the combination (n=30). Effectiveness outcomes included
   perioral, lip fullness, and oral commissure assessments and scores on
   the Cosmetic Improvement and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scales.
   Adverse events were monitored throughout.
   RESULTS
   For all end points and most time points, subjects treated with
   onabotulinumtoxinA plus the 24-mg/mL cohesive gel had greater
   improvement from baseline than subjects treated with onabotulinumtoxinA
   or the 24-mg/mL cohesive gel filler alone.
   CONCLUSION
   Based on a range of end points, onabotulinumtoxinA and 24-mg/mL cohesive
   HA gel treatments are effective and safe when either alone or in
   combination to rejuvenate the lower face. Combination therapy is
   superior to either modality used alone.

Abstract = {{Aims: Food insecurity is a lack of assured access to sufficient
   nutritious food. We aimed to investigate the demographic and
   socio-economic determinants of food insecurity in New Zealand and
   whether these determinants vary between males and females.
   Methods: We used data from the longitudinal Survey of Families, Income
   and Employment (SoFIE) (n=18,950). Respondents were classified as food
   insecure if, in the past 12 months, they had to use special food grants
   or food banks, been forced to buy cheaper food to pay for other things,
   or had to go without fresh fruit and vegetables often. Logistic
   regression analyses were used to investigate the association of
   demographic and socioeconomic factors on food insecurity. Models were
   repeated stratifying by males and females.
   Results: More than 15\% of the SoFIE population in NZ were food insecure
   in 2004/05. The prevalence of food insecurity was much greater in
   females (19\%) than males (12\%). The adjusted odds of food insecurity
   was significantly higher in females compared to males (OR 1.6, 95\% CI
   1.5-1.8). In univariate analyses, food insecurity was associated with
   sole parenthood, unmarried status, younger age groups, Maori and Pacific
   ethnicity, worse self-rated health status, renting, being unemployed and
   lower socioeconomic status. Income was the strongest predictor of food
   insecurity in multivariate modelling (OR 4.9, 95\% CI 4.0-5.9 for lowest
   household income quintile versus highest). The associations of
   demographic and socioeconomic factors with food insecurity were similar
   in males and females.
   Conclusions: Food insecurity is a timely and relevant issue, as it
   affects a significant number of New Zealanders. Targeted policy
   interventions aimed at increasing money available in households are
   needed.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00420.2010.-BACE1 (beta-site amyloidogenic cleavage
   of precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1) is a beta-secretase protein that
   plays a central role in the production of the beta-amyloid peptide in
   the brain and is thought to be involved in the Alzheimer's pathogenesis.
   In type 2 diabetes, amyloid deposition within the pancreatic islets is a
   pathophysiological hallmark, making crucial the study in the pancreas of
   BACE1 and its homologous BACE2 to understand the pathological mechanisms
   of this disease. The objectives of the present study were to
   characterize the localization of BACE proteins in human pancreas and
   determine their function. High levels of BACE enzymatic activity were
   detected in human pancreas. In normal human pancreas, BACE1 was observed
   in endocrine as well as in exocrine pancreas, whereas BACE2 expression
   was restricted to beta-cells. Intracellular analysis using
   immunofluorescence showed colocalization of BACE1 with insulin and BACE2
   with clathrin-coated vesicles of the plasma membrane in MIN6 cells. When
   BACE1 and -2 were pharmacologically inhibited, BACE1 localization was
   not altered, whereas BACE2 content in clathrin-coated vesicles was
   increased. Insulin internalization rate was reduced, insulin receptor
   beta-subunit (IR beta) expression was decreased at the plasma membrane
   and increased in the Golgi apparatus, and a significant reduction in
   insulin gene expression was detected. Similar results were obtained
   after specific BACE2 silencing in MIN6 cells. All these data point to a
   role for BACE2 in the IR beta trafficking and insulin signaling. In
   conclusion, BACE2 is hereby presented as an important enzyme in
   beta-cell function.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To explore whether interpersonal and intermanual sensory
   referral occurs following anesthetic block of a limb and to test
   theories of disinhibition of mirror neuron activity and transcallosal

   Design: Case series.
   Setting: Outpatient surgery at the University of California San Diego

   Patients: Six patients who underwent orthopedic surgery.
   Main Outcome Measures: Patient verbal ratings.
   Results: Patients with brachial plexus blocks experienced touch
   sensations in the anesthetized arm when watching another person's arm
   being touched or when the contralateral intact hand was touched.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of rapid
   reorganization of functional connectivity in the adult human brain, most
   likely in S2 neurons. This finding suggests that conscious perception of
   touch results from fluctuating mosaics of cortical excitation and
   inhibition between different regions within the patient's own S2 neurons
   and, more remarkably, from viewing others' sensations.}},

Abstract = {{Activating mutations of GNAq protein in a hotspot at codon 209 have been
   recently described in uveal melanomas. Since these neoplasms share with
   thyroid carcinomas a high frequency of MAP kinase pathway-activating
   mutations, we hypothesized whether GNAq mutations could also play a role
   in the development of thyroid carcinomas. Additionally, activating
   mutations of another subtype of G protein (GNAS1) are frequently found
   in hyperfunctioning thyroid adenomas, making it plausible that
   GNAq-activating mutations could also be found in some of these nodules.
   To investigate thyroid papillary carcinomas and thyroid hyperfuncioning
   nodules for GNAq mutations in exon 5, codon 209, a total of 32 RET/PTC,
   BRAF, and RAS negative thyroid papillary carcinomas and 13
   hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules were evaluated. No mutations were
   identified. Although plausible, GNAq mutations seem not to play an
   important role in the development of thyroid follicular neoplasms,
   either benign hyperfunctioning nodules or malignant papillary
   carcinomas. Our results are in accordance with the literature, in which
   no GNAq hotspot mutations were found in thyroid papillary carcinomas, as
   well as in an extensive panel of other tumors. The molecular basis for
   MAP-kinase pathway activation in RET-PTC/BRAF/RAS negative thyroid
   carcinomas remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to isolate and identify fungi associated
   with R. reniformis in cotton roots. Soil samples were collected in
   cotton fields naturally infested with R. reniformis and from cotton
   stock plants cultured in the greenhouse. Nematodes extracted from the
   soil were observed under the stereoscope, and discolored eggs and
   vermiform stages colonized with mycelia were cultured on 1.5\% water
   agar supplemented with antibiotics, and incubated at 27 degrees C.
   Identification of the nematophagous fungi was based on the morphological
   characters, and the ITS regions and 5.8S rDNA amplified by PCR using the
   primers ITS1 and ITS4. The parasitism percentage on vermiform nematodes
   from greenhouse samples was 21.2\%, and the percentages from cotton
   fields in Limestone, Henry, and Baldwin counties in Alabama were 3\%,
   23.2\%, and 5.6\%, respectively. A total of 12 fungi were identified
   from R. reniformis vermiform stages and eggs. The most frequently
   isolated fungi were Arthrobotrys dactyloides (46\%) and Paecilomyces
   lilacinus (14\%), followed by Phoma exigua (4.8\%), Penicillium
   waksmanii and Dactylaria brochophaga (3.6\%), Aspergillus glaucus group
   (2.4\%). Cladosporium herbarum, Cladosporium cladiosporioides, Fusarium
   oxysporum, Torula herbarum, Aspergillus fumigatus, and an unidentified
   basidiomycete were less frequent (1.2\%). A high percentage (16.8\%) of
   fungi from colonized nematodes was not cultivable on our media. Out of
   those 12 fungi, only four have been previously reported as nematophagous
   fungi: three isolates of Arthrobotrys dactyloides, and one isolate of
   Dactylaria brochopaga, Paecilomyces lilacinus, and Fusarium oxysporum.
   Molecular identification of Arthrobotrys dactyloides and Dactylaria
   brochopaga was consistent with the morphological identification, placing
   these two fungi in the new genus Drechslerella as proposed in the new
   Orbilaceae classification.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the development of the leadership activity of the
   academic-managers in the Spanish higher education institution.
   Academic-managers are those teachers who perform leadership roles in
   college temporarily (Deem and Brehony, 2005). Indeed, academic-managers
   taken into account in this study are those Deans and Department
   Directors in charge of leadership responsibilities, in a context where
   management is characterized by non-professionalism, temporariness and
   where managers are elected based on representativeness criteria. We
   opted for a qualitative methodology and the data was obtained from 23
   interviews and one focus group. The results allow us to identify three
   periods in the development of the managerial tasks. The first one
   consists in a early learning and contextualization, the second one is
   the development of functions, and the last one the institutional
   projection and relay in management tasks. Finally, we compare the main
   aspects in the development of academic roles. The comparison between the
   three main academic functions (teaching, research and management) allows
   us to identify new perspectives for future research work.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Socio-emotional difficulties are thought to be important
   maintaining factors of eating disorders. Several studies point to
   deficits in facial affect recognition in anorexia nervosa (AN). However,
   the majority of these studies fail to control for comorbidity and its
   effect on emotional processing. This study aims to explore how patients
   with AN recognize happiness and sadness in human faces, controlling for
   different comorbidities, namely anxiety, depression, and
   obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
   Methods: Thirty patients with AN, and 40 healthy participants completed
   a facial emotion recognition task. This task measured discrimination
   accuracy, response bias and response time towards sad and happy faces
   presented at different durations (500 ms, 2000 ms). The associations
   between facial affect recognition and clinical symptoms and intelligence
   quotient were explored.
   Results: Regression analysis showed that discrimination accuracy of sad
   faces presented for 500 ms was significantly associated with AN
   diagnosis, body mass index, and Obsessive- compulsive symptoms. However,
   the level of Obsessive-compulsive symptoms was the strongest predictor
   of a poor discrimination of briefly presented sad faces.
   Conclusions: Our results support previous studies that report emotional
   processing deficits in AN with obsessionality playing a pivotal role in
   this deficit.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To determine the impact of comorbid chronic diseases on
   mortality in older people.
   Design Prospective cohort study (1992-2006). Associations between
   numbers of chronic diseases or mutually exclusive comorbid chronic
   diseases on mortality over 14 years, by Cox proportional hazards model
   adjusting for sociodemographic variables or Kaplan-Meier analyses,
   respectively.
   Setting Population based, Australia.
   Participants 2087 randomly selected participants aged >= 65 years old,
   living in the community or institutions.
   Main results Participants with 3-4 or >= 5 diseases had a 25\% (95\% CI
   1.05 to 1.5, p = 0.01) and 80\% (95\% CI 1.5 to 2.2, p<0.0001) increased
   risk of mortality, respectively, by comparison with no chronic disease,
   after adjusting for age, sex and residential status. When cardiovascular
   disease (CVD), mental health problem or diabetes were comorbid with
   arthritis, there was a trend towards increased survival (range 8.2-9.5
   years) by comparison with CVD, mental health problem or diabetes alone
   (survival 5.8-6.9 years). This increase in survival with arthritis as a
   comorbidity was negated when CVD and mental health problems or CVD and
   diabetes were present in disease combinations together.
   Conclusion Older people with >= 3 chronic diseases have increased risk
   of mortality, but discordant effects on survival depend on specific
   disease combinations. These results raise the hypothesis that patients
   who have an increased likelihood of opportunity for care from their
   physician are more likely to have comorbid diseases detected and
   managed.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of the ITER project, an investigation has been
   conducted on an alternative vessel and blanket design, aimed at reducing
   cost and production risk.
   The modifications proposed have a strong impact on plasma control since
   they affect the main conducting structures surrounding the plasma
   column, providing passive stabilization but at the same time shielding
   the field generated by the active coils to control the plasma motion and
   shape.
   An extensive analysis was performed to assess the plasma vertical
   controllability and the modified requirements to the in-vessel vertical
   stability coils system as well as to the external Poloidal Field coils
   system. A similar analysis was aimed at assessing the performance of the
   shape control system in presence of the modified structures.
   The effect on plasma breakdown was also evaluated in terms of maximum
   initial loop voltage, quality of magnetic null and the flux loss related
   to the breakdown delay that was quantified under the same hypothesis
   employed by ITER for the baseline design.
   Furthermore, the modified design presents issues for the magnetic
   diagnostic system, related to the shielding of the probes by the eddy
   currents, which were analysed with a 3D model.
   The results of the analyses performed have some general interest in
   particular regarding the influence on plasma stability of 3D structures
   with close proximity to the plasma.
   The present paper aims at giving an overview of the analyses that have
   been carried out and a summary of the results in terms of impact of the
   modified design on plasma control and scenario, and in general an
   evaluation of the role of passive structure in plasma vertical stability
   and shape control. (C) 2010 EURATOM. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Purpose Rectal cancer surgery is impaired by a high rate of
   postoperative sexual dysfunction cause of frequent nerve injuries The
   aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate sexual function in a
   group of male patients after total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal
   cancer, using an autonomic nerve sparing technique
   Methods All patients underwent autonomic nerve preserving TME Sexual
   function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function
   standardized questionnaire All patients were studied preoperatively and
   at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery
   Results Fifty-one patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum were
   enrolled, after excluding 16 patients not sexually active, nine with T4
   stage disease and six with metastatic disease, 20 patients were
   prospectively evaluated The preoperative erectile function (EF) domain
   score of the International Index of Erectile Function was 24 3 (+/- 4 1)
   The score of the EF domain was 176 (+/- 7 5), 19 19 (+/- 7 2), 203 (+/-
   7 4), 205 (+/- 7 4), and 206 (+/- 7 4) at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months
   after surgery In the group of patients in which there were no
   macroscopic damages to the nerves, only two out of 15 (13 3\%) developed
   erectile dysfunction All five patients in whom incomplete pelvic nerve
   preservation was necessary developed erectile dysfunction
   Conclusion Our data show that nerve sparing technique can reduce the
   incidence of sexual dysfunction Unfortunately, the technique is not
   applicable in every patient Indications and techniques of autonomic
   nerve preservation are not standardized Controlled trials with long-term
   follow-up seem to be necessary}},

Abstract = {{Background: After tracheal resection and end-to-end anastomosis,
   granulation tissue formation and stenosis along the anastomotic line are
   major problems. This experimental study in rats evaluated the effects of
   hyperbaric oxygen therapy on the healing of tracheal anastomosis after
   irradiation.
   Methods: Forty-four rats were divided into four groups: Group I (n = 12)
   underwent tracheal anastomosis after irradiation (30 Gy) and received
   hyperbaric oxygen treatment; Group II (n = 12) underwent tracheal
   anastomosis and received hyperbaric oxygen treatment; Group III (n = 11)
   underwent tracheal anastomosis after irradiation (30 Gy); and Group IV
   (n = 9) underwent only tracheal anastomosis. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment
   was administered at 2.5 atmospheres of absolute pressure once a day for
   1 week. The rats were sacrificed 28 days after tracheal anastomosis. The
   cross-sectional area (CSA) of the tracheal lumen was compared between
   groups. Inflammation, fibrosis, epithelization, alveolar congestion and
   alveolar hemorrhage were evaluated by histological analysis.
   Results: The rats in all groups survived the study period, except for
   two in Group III which died from anastomotic dehiscence.
   Macroscopically, rats in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy groups showed
   excellent healing at the anastomosis. In these groups, CSA scores and
   epithelization were higher than in the other groups. There was local
   necrosis at the anastomosis in 3 rats in Group III. Fibrosis and
   alveolar congestion observed in Groups III and IV were significantly
   higher than in Groups I and II.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that hyperbaric oxygen treatment
   contributes to the healing of tracheal anastomosis following irradiation
   and may be a useful supportive treatment after tracheal resection and
   end-to-end anastomosis.}},

Title = {{Patient-reported peripheral neuropathy of doxorubicin and cisplatin with
   and without paclitaxel in the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer:

Abstract = {{Objective. In COG 184, the addition of paclitaxel to cisplatin and
   doxorubicin offered no additional clinical benefit, yet was associated
   with increased provider-rated toxicity. We now compare patient-reported
   neuropathy between treatment arms and patient reports to the clinician
   reports of neuropathy.
   Methods. Of 659 enrolled patients, 552 were randomly assigned to receive
   either cisplatin 50 mg/m(2)+ doxorubicin 45 mg/m(2)+ G-CSF 5 mu g/kg on
   days 2-11 ({''}CD{''}), or the above regimen plus paclitaxel 160 mg/m(2)
   infused over 3 h ({''}CDP{''}). Patient-reported neuropathy was measured
   with 11-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Neurotoxicity
   (FACT-Ntx) Scale, at baseline, and 4 weeks and 6 months post
   chemotherapy. Group differences on patient-reported neuropathy over
   time, and correspondence between patient and provider ratings, were
   evaluated by fitting linear mixed models to the data.
   Results. After adjusting for non-significant baseline differences in
   neuropathy, the average neuropathy (FACT-Ntx) score of CDP-treated
   patients was 5.2 points lower/worse (95\% CI: 4.0-6.5; p<0.001) than the
   average score observed in CD-treated patients. The difference diminished
   after 6 months but still remained statistically significant
   (difference=1.6; 95\% CI: 0.3-2.8; p=0.014). The sensory component was
   most significantly affected. Each increase (worsening) of grade in
   provider-rated toxicity was significantly associated with change in
   patient-reported severity of 4-6 points in the 11-item total score and
   2-3 points in the 4-item sensory neuropathy score.
   Conclusion. Patient-reported neuropathy was worse in COP-treated
   patients compared to CD-treated patients, especially in the sensory
   component. Patient-reported change corresponded with provider grade, but
   offered more detail on the nature of impact. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This study examines the soil hydrological and erosional effects of ant
   mounds during summer and winter conditions following a wildfire in scrub
   terrain in eastern Spain. Forty rainfall simulations (1 m(2) plots, 1 h
   duration, 78 mm h(-1) intensity) were carried out over plots with mounds
   (n = 20) and mound-free control plots (n = 20) in August 2002, and
   repeated in December. By winter, some of the mound material had been
   removed and some vegetation regrowth occurred. Overall, mound presence
   increased soil erodibility in summer and winter due to the availability
   of highly erodible mound material. However, mound plots showed higher
   mean overland flow rates in summer (10.1 vs 6.9\% for control plots) but
   lower rates in winter (59.3 vs 74.4\% for control plots). This reversal
   is suggested to be caused by (i) post-fire changes in ground cover and
   (ii) seasonal differences in antecedent soil moisture. First,
   immediately after burning, an absorbent ash layer covered much of the
   soil surface, but this was partially masked by less permeable mound
   material, reducing infiltration on mound plots. By winter, the ash layer
   had been largely removed and ash particles clogged soil surface pores,
   reducing overall infiltration on control plots compared to mound plots.
   Second, during summer, the dry soil underneath the absorbent ash cover
   has a high infiltration capacity. In winter, soils are near saturation,
   resulting in a much greater runoff coefficient. Under these wet soil
   conditions, the presence of macropores (i.e. nest entrances) becomes
   important, reducing overland flow in mound plots. Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Objective: The authors' objective is to describe the disparity between
   the case-fatality rates for inflicted versus unintentional injuries of
   children, and to emphasize its utility as a way of estimating the
   effectiveness of the ascertainment of inflicted injuries of children.
   Method: Determination, comparison, and explanation of the
   case-fatality-rate disparity in four injury databases were derived from
   hospitalized injury cases.
   Results: The CFR disparity is 6-14-fold in the 4 injury databases. The
   CFR disparity varies strongly and inversely with the observed incidence
   of inflicted injuries in the databases.
   Conclusions: A large disparity between the case fatality rates (CFRs) of
   inflicted and unintentional injuries exists in a number of injury
   databases. Inflicted injuries have much higher CFRs than unintentional
   injuries. The disparity can be accounted for by ``missed{''}
   (incorrectly diagnosed) and ``missing{''} (unseen) cases.
   Practice implications: Present diagnostic criteria for physically
   abusive (inflicted) injuries are forensically-driven and too
   conservative for public health purposes. New public-health-oriented case
   definitions for ``inflicted injury{''} are needed. Programs to reduce
   injury recidivism in young children should be a part of overall injury
   prevention. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The crosslink density of carbon black-reinforced natural rubber (NR) was
   correlated with H-1 chemical shift by liquid-state H-1 NMR spectroscopy.
   Instead of observing the rubber directly with the solid-state NMR
   technique, we used toluene molecules in the liquid state as probes to
   explore the inner cavities of the rubber sample. Four NR composites with
   different carbon black contents of 20, 40, 60, and 80 phr were tested.
   The toluene signals were split into two: one from the bulk solvent and
   the other from inside the rubber. The chemical shift difference between
   those two split signals was observed to be in linear relationship with
   the carbon black content. The samples thermally aged at 70 degrees C for
   100 days showed larger chemical shift differences than the unaged
   sample. Furthermore, the chemical shift difference was directly
   proportional to the apparent crosslink density obtained independently by
   the conventional swelling method. This result offers by far the simplest
   method to measure the apparent crosslink density in rubber. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The seismic rehabilitation of historical masonry buildings necessitates

   loading. It was seen that although the fibres enhance the flexural
   toughness of hydraulic lime mortar, the material is weakest in Mode I
   fracture. In Part-2 of this paper, the authors describe the strain rate
   sensitivity of hydraulic lime mortar on the basis of impact testing of
   notched beams. The mixes were identical to those examined in Part-1, and
   the dynamic response was evaluated using a drop-weight impact machine
   for strain rates in the range of 10(-6) to 10 s(-1). The authors found
   that compared to fibre reinforced Portland cement-based mortar and

Abstract = {{Tubular construction is synonymous with modern architecture. The
   familiar range of tubular sections square, rectangular and circular
   hollow sections - has been recently extended to include elliptical
   hollow sections (EHSs). Due to differing flexural rigidities about the
   two principal axes, these new sections combine the elegance of circular
   hollow sections with the improved structural efficiency in bending of
   rectangular hollow sections. Following the introduction of structural
   steel EHSs, a number of investigations into their structural response
   have been carried out. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of
   recent research on EHSs together with a sample of practical
   applications. The paper addresses fundamental research on elastic local
   buckling and post-buckling, cross-section classification, response in
   shear, member instabilities, connections and the behaviour of
   concrete-filled EHSs. Details of full-scale testing and numerical
   modelling studies are described, and the generation of statistically
   validated structural design rules, suitable for incorporation into
   international design codes, is outlined.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To determine whether radiologists can recognize images retouched to
   include sham lesions.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten representative key images were selected of
   aortic dissection, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, colon
   cancer, liver metastasis, hepatic cyst, gallbladder stones, splenic
   artery aneurysm, adrenal adenoma, and stomach cancer from abdominal
   computed tomography (CT) imaging performed in 2008. Five of the key
   images were replaced with retouched images using image-editing software.
   The time to complete retouching was recorded for each image.
   Radiologists were requested to make a diagnosis for the 10 images, and
   were then asked to identify possible retouched images. The time taken to
   reach a decision in each case was recorded. Thirty radiologists (13
   residents and 17 attending radiologists) participated as reviewers.
   RESULTS: The time to complete retouching was 15.2 +/- 3.15 min. None of
   the reviewers recognized that some images were retouched during
   diagnosis. The rate of correct diagnosis was 90\% (range 71.7-100\%).
   After reviewers were informed of possible image retouching, the
   detection rate of retouched images was 50\% (40-58.3\%). This rate was
   statistically the same as random choice (p = 0.876). There was no
   significant difference between residents and attending radiologists in
   the detection rate of retouched images (p = 0.786). The time to
   diagnosis and the time to detection of the retouched images were
   15(14-17) and 6(5-7) min, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Digital images can be easily retouched, and radiologists
   have difficulty in identifying retouched images. Radiologists should be
   aware of the potential fraudulent use of retouched images. (C) 2010 The

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a training-based channel estimation scheme for
   achieving quality-of-service discrimination between legitimate and
   unauthorized receivers in wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   channels. The proposed method has applications ranging from user
   discrimination in wireless TV broadcast systems to the prevention of
   eavesdropping in secret communications. By considering a wireless MIMO
   system that consists of a multiple-antenna transmitter, a legitimate
   receiver (LR) and an unauthorized receiver (UR), we propose a
   multi-stage training-based discriminatory channel estimation (DCE)
   scheme that aims to optimize the channel estimation performance of the
   LR while limiting the channel estimation performance of the UR. The key
   idea is to exploit the channel estimate fed back from the LR at the
   beginning of each stage to enable the judicious use of artificial noise
   (AN) in the training signal. Specifically, with knowledge of the LR's
   channel, AN can be properly superimposed with the training data to
   degrade the UR's channel without causing strong interference on the LR.
   The channel estimation performance of the LR in earlier stages may not
   be satisfactory due to the inaccuracy of the channel estimate and
   constraints on the UR's estimation performance, but can improve rapidly
   in later stages as the quality of channel estimate improves. The
   training data power and AN power are optimally allocated by minimizing
   the normalized mean-square error (NMSE) of the LR subject to a lower
   limit constraint on the NMSE of the UR. The proposed DCE scheme is then
   extended to the case with multiple LRs and multiple URs. Simulation
   results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   DCE scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust global router called NTHU-Route 2.0 that
   improves the solution quality and runtime of NTHU-Route by the following

   3) two implementation techniques. We report convincing experimental
   results to show the effectiveness of each individual enhancement. With
   all these enhancements together, NTHU-Route 2.0 solves all ISPD98
   benchmarks with very good quality. Moreover, NTHU-Route 2.0 routes 7 of
   8 ISPD07 benchmarks and 12 of 16 ISPD08 benchmarks without any overflow.
   Compared with other state-of-the-art global routers, NTHU-Route 2.0 is

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Special Committee on Electronic Publication was re-established at
   the XVII International Botanical Congress (IBC) in Vienna in 2005, with
   the mandate to consider on the issues relating to the electronic
   publication of nomenclatural novelties and to report to the XVIII IBC in
   Melbourne in 2011. With the global push to inventory biodiversity and to
   develop information systems to disseminate data, issues surrounding
   speed of publication, copyright and licensing, and permanence and
   accessibility of information have surfaced. Electronic publication is
   central to these issues, and the insistence of the International Code of
   Botanical Nomenclature (Code) on distribution of printed matter for
   effective publication is seen by many as a hindrance to progress.
   Against this backdrop, the Committee conducted extensive negotiations
   and discussions on a wide range of issues on electronic publication,
   which are here summarized in the Committee's report. The Committee
   unanimously supports the extension of effective publication to
   electronic publication, but in a well-regulated way that will establish
   the basis for long-term archiving and discovery. The Committee has put
   forward a set of eleven proposals (Special Committee on Electronic
   Publication, 2010) to amend the Code to permit electronic publications
   to be considered effectively published under specified conditions on or
   after 1 January 2013. It is proposed that electronic material will be
   effectively published only when distributed in Portable Document Format
   (PDF) in an online serial publication with an International Standard
   Serial Number (ISSN). An additional proposal extends this to PDF with an
   International Standard Book Number (ISBN). Further proposals strengthen
   this by forbidding post-publication alteration and by discounting
   preliminary versions as not effectively published. The current method
   for establishing the date of effective publication is amended to account
   for electronic material. These changes to the Articles of the Code are
   supported by a set of Recommendations for best practice for electronic
   publication of nomenclatural novelties, covering aspects of archiving
   and immutability, dissemination of data, and clear designation of
   versions as preliminary or final. This report provides the supporting
   documentation for the set of proposals that are also published in this
   issue. It is necessary that the two be read alongside each other.}},

Abstract = {{Osseous lesions of the glenoid cavity and humeral head are predictive of
   recurrence after Bankart arthroscopic procedures. The objective of this
   study was to analyze, for each glenoid and humeral defect plain x-ray
   criteria of the Instability Severity Index Score ( ISIS), two aspects:
   inter-and intraobserver reliability of their qualitative and
   quantitative assessment and correlations between positive criteria and
   their quantitative measurement. Thirty-one medical files were retained
   for evaluation of the glenoid and 26 for humeral notch assessment. The
   yes or no response for the ISIS criterion was completed by its
   quantitative measurement using the Griffiths and Sugaya CT methods for
   the glenoid and the P/R index calculation on plain x-rays with internal
   rotation for the Hill-Sachs lesion. Three observers provided two
   consecutive readings for each criterion. The analysis of the glenoid
   radiological criterion of the ISIS seems sufficiently reproducible for
   daily practice. When the evaluation is positive, bone loss is greater
   than 15\%, without a maximum value established. In this study, the
   analysis of the ISIS humeral notch criterion was not reproducible. It
   can be improved using the P/R index and should be completed by CT
   imaging.

Abstract = {{This paper has two core purposes First building on Nelson and Sampat s
   work we outline the social technology conceptual framework and explain
   why we favour using it to explore two global health initiatives Second
   we discuss the evolution of those initiatives through the lens of the
   interaction between social technologies physical technologies and
   general institutions Thus we reflect both on evolving conceptual
   landscapes on the one hand and organisational and institutional terrains
   on the other
   The first section of the paper presents an intellectual journey and
   outlines our understanding and adoption of the social technology
   conceptual framework This framework we argue has a number of advantages
   over alternative theoretical approaches and perspectives The second
   section describes the context in which product development partnerships
   (PDPs) a type of global health initiative based on a public-private
   partnership (PPP) have arisen The third section develops case studies of
   the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and the Malaria
   Vaccines Initiative (MVI) as social technology experiments and looks at
   the complex dynamics between organisation management scientific and R\&D
   success and general institutional environments We look at these social
   technologies as having integrator and broker roles classifications which
   we argue are useful in analysing the different roles taken on by these
   PDPs In the conclusion we reflect on the useful ways in which the
   concept of social technologies can shed light on complex and networked
   initiatives (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Introduction In the United Kingdom (UK) ethnic minority groups from the
   Indian sub-continent (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) are at increased
   risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) related mortality and morbidity The
   aim of this study was to assess the variation in recording of clinical
   data by ethnicity following the implementation of an electronic
   centralised cardiac rehabilitation register in the North West of England
   Methods Data were collected over 18 months for all individuals (n=1993)
   assessed for entry into the cardiac rehabilitation programme
   Analysis of the recording of clinical data was undertaken by ethnicity
   with adjustment for gender, age group and deprivation
   Results Most patients on the database had their ethnicity recorded (94
   4\%) South Asians (Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi) were less likely
   to have clinical data items recorded compared to the majority White
   British group The disparity in recording of clinical data was most
   marked for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score (adjusted OR
   0 16 95\% CI 0 07-0 36) body mass index (adjusted OR 0 54, 95\% CI 0
   37-0 79) pulse (0 60 95\% Cl 0 42-0 88) blood glucose (adjusted OR 0 64,

   and one type I X-ray burst from the source, which allowed the nature of
   IGR J17380-3749 to be determined. The burster radiation spectrum during
   the flares was hard-a power law with a photon index alpha = 1.8-2.0 or
   bremsstrahlung corresponding to a plasma with a temperature kT = 90-140
   keV. The spectral shape at the flare peaks turned out to be the same,
   despite a more than twofold difference in flux (the peak flux recorded
   in the energy range 18-100 keV reached similar to 20 mCrab). The upper
   limit on the flux from the source in its quiescent (off) state in the
   range of 18-40 keV was 0.15 mCrab (3 sigma).}},

Abstract = {{We use hand-collected data on the management quality of firms making
   seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) to
   analyze the relationship between management quality and equity issue
   characteristics, and to compare the effect of management quality on SEOs
   versus IPOs. We hypothesize that higher quality managers are more
   credible to equity market investors, thereby reducing the information
   asymmetry they face in the market and outsiders' information production
   costs. Therefore, the equity issues of higher management quality firms
   will have more reputable underwriters, smaller underwriting spreads, and
   other expenses, and smaller SEO discounts. Further, since better
   managers will be able to select better projects, higher management
   quality firms will have larger offer sizes. Finally, since SEO firms are
   likely to suffer from less information asymmetry compared to IPO firms,
   these effects will be smaller for SEOs than for IPOs. Our findings
   support the above hypotheses. Our direct tests of the relationship
   between management quality and information asymmetry, and our comparison
   of information asymmetry in SEOs versus IPOs provide further support for
   these hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{The statistical problem for network tomography is to infer the
   distribution of X, with mutually independent components, from a
   measurement model Y = AX, where A is a given binary matrix representing
   the routing topology of a network under consideration. The challenge is
   that the dimension of X is much larger than that of Y and thus the
   problem is often ill-posed. This paper studies some statistical aspects
   of network tomography. We first develop a unifying theory on the
   identifiability of the distribution of X. We then focus on an important
   instance of network tomography-network delay tomography, where the
   problem is to infer internal link delay distributions using end-to-end
   delay measurements. We propose a novel mixture model for link delays and
   develop a fast algorithm for estimation based on the General Method of
   Moments. Through extensive model simulations and real Internet trace
   driven simulation, the proposed approach is shown to be favorable to
   previous methods using simple discretization for inferring link delays
   in a heterogeneous network.}},

Abstract = {{Since 2004, an East African genotype of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has
   emerged, causing significant epidemics of an arthralgic syndrome. In
   addition, this virus has been associated for the first time with
   neonatal transmission and neurological complications. In the current
   study, pregnant Rhesus macaques were inoculated with an enzootic or
   epidemic strain of CHIKV to compare pathogenesis and transplacental
   transmission potential. Viremias were similar for both strains and
   peaked at 2-3 days post-inoculation (dpi). Viral RNA was detected at
   necropsy at 21 dpi in maternal lymphoid, joint-associated, and spinal
   cord tissues. The absence of detectable viral RNA and the lack of
   germinal center development in fetuses indicated that transplacental
   transmission did not occur. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all
   dams and fetuses. Our study establishes a non-human primate model for
   evaluating vaccines and antiviral therapies and indicates that Rhesus
   macaques could serve as a competent enzootic reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{Conclusion: Long-term denervation-induced satellite cells (SCs)
   deficiency impairs facial muscle regenerative capacity. Delayed
   reinnervation can reactivate residual SCs to engage in muscle
   regeneration. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be
   elucidated. Objective: To evaluate the effects of denervation and
   delayed reinnervation on SCs in facial muscle. Methods: This was a
   prospective, randomized, controlled study in the rat facial nerve
   ligation and delayed decompression model. Animals were divided into
   denervation, 8-week-delay, and 16-week-delay reinnervation groups.
   Sham-operated animals served as a control group. Specific markers were
   used to investigate the differences in SC status, including quiescent
   (Pax7) and activated (myoD and myogenin) SCs and regenerative myofibers
   (embryonic myosin heavy chain, eMyHC). Quantitative assessment was
   performed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Results: Activated SCs
   were detected 2-4 weeks after denervation and maintained for 4-8 weeks,
   accompanied by regenerating myofibers, whereas no SCs were detected
   beyond 20 weeks post-denervation. The myoD and myogenin up-regulation
   peaked 6-8 weeks after denervation and declined gradually to normal
   baseline 12 weeks after denervation. The 8-week-delay reinnervation
   group showed more activated SCs and regenerating myofibers than the
   16-week-delay group, as well as greater up-regulation of myoD and
   myogenin (p < 0.05), suggesting reactivation of SCs for repair of
   adjacent fibers.}},

Abstract = {{The algebraic code excited linear prediction (ACELP) algorithm, because

   algorithm for the stochastic codebook of ACELP speech coders. The
   proposed UPR algorithm discusses the search breadth, the order of the
   search direction and the update frequency based on the pulse replacement
   method. In addition, there are many derivative types of UPR algorithms
   discussed. The proposed approaches can achieve the lowest computational
   complexity with imperceptible degradation of the speech quality.
   Furthermore, the normalised degradation ratio based on the standard
   subjective quality measurement is proposed to fairly compare the
   performance. The experimental results will verify the claims.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmacogenetic tests are proposed as a means of targeting therapy to
   patients such that ineffective medicine prescription and adverse events
   are reduced and overall benefit in terms of improved health outcomes is
   maximized. However, the true impact of introducing pharmacogenetic tests
   into clinical practice remains to be confirmed. This commentary presents
   some of the key requirements in developing a pharmacogenetic clinical
   practice model in a hospital setting. The analysis considers the need to
   select carefully which pharmacogenetic tests are best offered, while
   balancing the cost to the institution given the potential benefits to
   the patient population base. Drawing on our experience in Taiwan, we
   recommend that developing a hospital task force for pharmacogenetic
   testing is a recommended approach to: (1) set quality standards on how
   best to conduct the test, (2) provide a pro forma for interpreting
   results, (3) prescribe treatment appropriately according to results, and
   (4) design an educational program for all relevant health care team
   members. To further support the implementation of pharmacogenetic
   testing in the hospital setting, it is necessary to promote audit of
   clinical practice by building hospital-based registries to facilitate
   the collection of health care resource use and outcome data that records
   the clinical uptake of testing. We suggest that well-conducted economic
   evaluations, relevant to local practice, are essential pieces of
   information to guide institutional decision making on how best to
   develop the appropriate use of pharmacogenetic tests in clinical
   practice. Drug Dev Res 71:502-506, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a virtual transmit diversity scheme which is
   able to achieve a full transmit diversity gain with only single transmit
   antenna. We use locally generated random sequences at a transmitter to
   emulate independent space-time coded channel coefficients to achieve
   full transmit diversity gain at the receiver. The performance of such a
   virtual transmit diversity scheme is analyzed and compared with
   traditional Alamouti transmit diversity scheme. The properties of
   locally generated fading channel coefficients to achieve 2 x 1 virtual
   transmit diversity gain are studied and it is revealed that either
   Gaussian or evenly distributed random sequences can be applied to the
   virtual transmit diversity schemes. The 2 x 1 virtual transmit diversity
   scheme will also be generalized to N-t x 1 virtual transmit diversity
   scheme in this paper. The work is significant to introduce a new
   sub-optimal approach to achieve N-t x 1 transmit diversity at a very low

Abstract = {{TRAIL is a novel therapeutic agent for potential use in glioblastoma
   multiforme therapy; however, glioblastoma multiforme cells exhibit
   resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To evaluate the effects of
   cisplatin on sensitivity of human glioma cell line U251 to Ad-TRAIL and
   to investigate the potential mechanism, U251 cells were transfected with
   Ad-TRAIL and then exposed to cisplatin. The proliferation inhibition of
   the treated cells was studied by the method of MTT. The cell apoptosis
   was analyzed by Hoechst33342 staining and by flow cytometry with
   propidium iodide staining. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was introduced to
   detect the mRNA expression of TRAIL, DR4, DR5, Caspase 3, and survivin.
   Protein expression of DR5 and cleaved Caspase 3 was detected by Western
   blot assay. The results showed that the combination treatment of
   cisplatin and Ad-TRAIL could inhibit the proliferation of U251 cells
   significantly compared with the alone treatment (P < 0.01), which was
   chiefly attributed to the induction of obvious apoptosis. The
   enhancement of Ad-TRAIL by cisplatin was due to the up-regulation of DR5
   but not DR4 expression, and followed by the down-regulation of survivin
   and activation of Caspase 3. In conclusion, cisplatin could enhance the
   apoptosis induction of U251 cells to adenovirous vector carried TRAIL.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) designed for mission-critical
   applications suffer from limited sensing capacities, particularly fast
   energy depletion. Regarding this, mobile sinks can be used to balance
   the energy consumption in WSNs, but the frequent location updates of the
   mobile sinks can lead to data collisions and rapid energy consumption
   for some specific sensors. This paper explores an optimal barrier
   coverage based sensor deployment for event driven WSNs where a dual-sink
   model was designed to evaluate the energy performance of not only static
   sensors, but Static Sink (SS) and Mobile Sinks (MSs) simultaneously,
   based on parameters such as sensor transmission range r and the velocity
   of the mobile sink v, etc. Moreover, a MS mobility model was developed
   to enable SS and MSs to effectively collaborate, while achieving
   spatiotemporal energy performance efficiency by using the knowledge of
   the cumulative density function (cdf), Poisson process and M/G/1 queue.
   The simulation results verified that the improved energy performance of
   the whole network was demonstrated clearly and our eDSA algorithm is
   more efficient than the static-sink model, reducing energy consumption
   approximately in half. Moreover, we demonstrate that our results are
   robust to realistic sensing models and also validate the correctness of
   our results through extensive simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Laser photocoagulation treatment is often complicated by a side effect
   of visual impairment, which is caused by the unavoidable laser-induced
   retinal destruction. At present no specific is found to cure this
   retinopathy. The aim of this study was to observe the neuroprotective
   effect of bFGF on laser-induced retinal injury. Chinchilla rabbits were
   divided into three groups and argon laser lesions were created in the
   retinas. Then bFGF or dexamethasone, a widely used ophthalmic
   preparation, or saline was given severally by retrobulbar injection. The
   retinal lesions were evaluated histologically and morphometrically, and
   visual function was examined by ERG. The results showed that bFGF
   administration better preserved morphology of retinal photoreceptors and
   significantly diminished the area of the lesions. Furthermore, bFGF
   promoted the restoration of the ERG b-wave amplitude. In rabbits treated
   with dexamethasone, however, the lesions showed almost no ameliorative
   changes. This is the first study to investigate the potential role of
   bFGF as a remedial agent in laser photocoagulation treatment. These
   findings suggest that bFGF has significant neuroprotective properties in
   the retina and this type of neuroprotection may be of clinical
   significance in reducing iatrogenic laser-induced retinal injuries in
   humans.

Abstract = {{We propose a scheme to induce intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) at an
   arbitrary site in microelectromechanical cantilever arrays. The idea is
   to locate the particular cantilever beam in the array that one wishes to
   drive to an oscillating state with significantly higher amplitude than
   the average and then apply small adjustments to the electrical signal
   that drives the whole array system. Our scheme is thus a global
   closed-loop control strategy. We argue that the dynamical mechanism on
   which our global driving scheme relies is spatiotemporal chaos and we
   develop a detailed analysis based on the standard averaging method in
   nonlinear dynamics to understand the working of our control scheme. We
   also develop a Markov model to characterize the transient time required
   for inducing ILMs. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The core competencies of a mobile agent includes its ability to roam
   freely in different Internet environments, its ability to adapt itself
   to various types of online servers depending on the characteristics of
   said server, and its ability to detect its environment and automatic
   adaptation to said environment while executing the tasks that are
   assigned by the users. Because of these competencies, the concept of
   mobile agent is widely used in many different fields, such as Internet
   business, wireless communication, and information security technologies.
   Akl and Taylor (1983) suggested the concept of superkey to resolve the
   key management issues faced by the mobile agent. Later, Volker and
   Mehrdad (1998) proposed a tree base mobile agent model for access
   control. The proposed scheme is based upon the studies of public key and
   a hierarchical mobile agent model with addition of Elliptic Curve
   Cryptosystem (ECC). ECC enhances the operational ability of mobile agent
   model, because of shorter key length and higher efficiency on encryption
   and decryption. In addition, after a period of time, due to error or
   change in the user's rights, said user will be forced to log out of the
   system. At the same time, to prevent a user from continuing to use the
   old key, the system must keep modifying the key so as to change the
   original access rights of the key, this action could cause unnecessary
   error and risks, in addition to the large amount of computations that
   the system needs to perform. Hence, this paper proposes date-constraint
   key management scheme, where a date is attached to the key, so as to
   give a validity period to the key. Thus, key management can be more
   efficient. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel non-centrosymmetric borate, BiCd3(AlO)(3)(BO3)(4), has been
   prepared by solid state reaction methods below 750 degrees C.
   Single-crystal XRD analysis showed that it crystallizes in the hexagonal
   group P6(3) with a=10.3919(15) angstrom, c=5.7215(11) angstrom. Z=2. In
   its structure, AlO6 octahedra share edges to form 1D
   (1)(infinity){[}AlO4](5-) chains that are bridged by BO3 groups through
   sharing O atoms to form the 3D (3)(infinity){[}AlBO4](2-) framework. The
   3D framework affords two kinds of channels that are occupied by
   Bi3+/Cd2+ atoms only or by Bi3+/Cd2+ atoms together with BO3 groups. The
   IR spectrum further confirmed the presence of BO3 groups.
   Second-harmonic-generation measurements displayed a response of about
   0.5 x KDP (KH2PO4). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum showed a band
   gap of about 3.19 eV. Solid-state fluorescence spectrum exhibited the
   maximum emission peak at around 390.6 nm. Band structure calculations

Abstract = {{With growing interest in extending GIS to support multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) methods, enhancing GIS-based MCDM with
   sensitivity analysis (SA) procedures is crucial to understand the model
   behavior and its limitations. This paper presents a novel approach of
   examining multi-criteria weight sensitivity of a GIS-based MCDM model.
   It explores the dependency of model output on the weights of input
   parameters, identifying criteria that are especially sensitive to weight
   changes and to show the impacts of changing criteria weights on the
   model outcomes in spatial dimension. A methodology was developed to
   perform simulations where the weights associated with all criteria used
   for suitability modelling were varied one-at-a-time (OAT) to investigate
   their relative impacts on the final evaluation results. A tool which
   incorporates the OAT method with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)
   within the ArcGIS environment was implemented. It permits a range of
   user defined simulations to be performed to quantitatively evaluate
   model dynamic changes, measures the stability of results with respect to
   the variation of different parameter weights, and displays spatial
   change dynamics. A case study of irrigated cropland suitability
   assessment addressing the application of the new GIS-based AHP-SA tool
   is described. It demonstrates that the tool is spatial, simple and
   flexible. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a platform technology with experimental results that
   show the scientists and biologists a way to rapidly investigate and
   analyze the biological effects of localized extremely low frequency
   (ELF) electromagnetic field (EMF) on living cells. The proximity effect
   of the localized ELF-EMF on living cells is revealed using the
   bio-compatible microplatform on which an on-glass inductive coil array,
   the source of the localized ELF-EMF in micro scale, is designed,
   fabricated and operated with a field strength of 1.2 +/- 0.1 mT at 60 Hz
   for cell culturing study. After a 72 h ELF-EMF exposure, HeLa (human
   cervical cancer) and PC-12 (rat pheochromocytoma) cells exhibit about
   18.4\% and 12.9\% cell proliferation rate reduction, respectively.
   Furthermore, according to the presented dynamic model, the reduction of
   the proliferation can be attributed to the interference of signal
   transduction processes due to the tangential currents induced around the
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{Zebrafish have received considerable attention as an organism-based
   model in the development of pharmacological agents. Many small molecules
   applied to zebrafish show important behaviours and may constitute new
   kinds of markers for clinical purposes.(3) Analysis of these molecules
   can facilitate the development of useful tools for monitoring
   environmental changes.(4) Many chemicals that are toxic to the
   environment are known to influence the sensory systems of humans(5) and
   fish.(6) One important sensory system in all fish is the lateral line
   organ,(7) which is readily accessible for the assessment of
   environmental changes.(8) Neuromasts, which are located on the surface
   of the fish body, are one of the major components of the lateral lines
   of the zebrafish.(9) Copper-enriched water is known to affect the
   olfactory system in fish. Therefore, small molecules that induce
   specific patterns in the neuromasts of zebrafish should provide an
   important animal model with which to explore the effects of
   environmental changes on the sensory system.(10.11) Recently, chemical
   sensors based on the rhodamine skeleton(12) have been designed to
   specifically detect metal ions, such as Cu(II)(13) and
   Fe(III)/Hg(II),(14) in zebrafish. However, there has been no report of
   these rhodamine derivatives used in the specific recognition of the
   sensory system of zebrafish. Commonly, the sensory system is studied
   with antibody staining assays of scarified fish. Here, we report that a
   new rhodamine derivative can be used as a fluorescent chemical probe to
   visualize the neuromasts and intestinal villi of living zebrafish. Based
   on the specific recognition of this area in zebrafish, we narrowed the
   possible enzymes targeted by this rhodamine probe to alkaline
   phosphatase and confirmed this with a binding assay. It is a
   well-recognized challenge to develop a fluorescent chemical probe that
   specifically recognizes a particular enzyme. Furthermore, the transfer
   of phosphate groups to certain enzymes can activate their catalytic
   reactivity, triggering a cascade reaction in a signal transduction
   pathway. The alkaline-phosphatase-specific recognition by this rhodamine
   derivative may be applicable to clinical purposes.}},

Abstract = {{S-nitrosylation, a post-translational modification of cysteine residues
   induced by nitric oxide, mediates many physiological functions Due to
   the labile nature of S nitrosylation, detection by mass spectrometry
   (MS) is challenging Here we developed an S-alkylating labeling strategy
   using the irreversible biotinylation on S-nitrosocysteines for
   site-specific identification of the S-nitrosoproteome by LC-MS/MS Using
   COS-7 cells without endogenous nitric oxide synthase, we demonstrated
   that the S-alkylating labeling strategy substantially improved the
   blocking efficiency of free cysteines minimized the false-positive
   identification caused by disulfide interchange and increased the
   digestion efficiency for improved peptide identification using MS
   analyses Using this strategy, we identified total 586 unique
   S-nitrosylation sites corresponding to 384 proteins in
   S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP)/L-cysteine-treated mouse MS-1
   endothelial cells, including 234 previously unreported S-nitrosylated
   proteins When the topologies of 84 identified transmembrane proteins
   were further analyzed their S-nitrosylation sites were found to mostly
   face the cytoplasmic side implying that S-nitrosylation occurs in the
   cytoplasm In addition to the previously known acid/basic motifs the ten
   deduced consensus motifs suggested that combination of local
   hydrophobicity and acid/base motifs in the tertiary structure contribute
   to the specificity of S-nitrosylation Moreover the S-nitrosylated
   cysteines showed preference on beta-strand having lower relative surface
   accessibility at the S-nitrosocysteines}},

Abstract = {{A recently proposed product quantization method is efficient for large
   scale approximate nearest neighbor search, however, its performance on
   unstructured vectors is limited. This paper introduces residual vector
   quantization based approaches that are appropriate for unstructured
   vectors. Database vectors are quantized by residual vector quantizer.
   The reproductions are represented by short codes composed of their
   quantization indices. Euclidean distance between query vector and
   database vector is approximated by asymmetric distance, i.e., the
   distance between the query vector and the reproduction of the database
   vector. An efficient exhaustive search approach is proposed by fast
   computing the asymmetric distance. A straight forward non-exhaustive
   search approach is proposed for large scale search. Our approaches are
   compared to two state-of-the-art methods, spectral hashing and product
   quantization, on both structured and unstructured datasets. Results show
   that our approaches obtain the best results in terms of the trade-off

Abstract = {{KNN (k nearest neighbor) is widely discussed and applied in pattern

   introduce neighborhood model as a uniform framework to understand and
   implement neighborhood outlier detection. Furthermore, a
   neighborhood-based outlier detection algorithm is also given. This
   algorithm integrates rough set granular technique with outlier
   detecting. We propose a neighborhood-based metric on outlier detection,
   and compare neighborhood outlier detection with DIS, KNN and RNN. The
   experimental results show that neighborhood-based metric is able to
   measure the local information for outlier detection. The detected
   accuracies based on neighborhood outlier detection are superior to DIS,
   KNN for mixed dataset, and a litter better than RNN for discrete

Abstract = {{Thin-films of lead tellurium selenide were evaporated on silicon
   substrates from a resource of PbTe(0.92)Se(0.08) bulk crystal grown by
   Bridgman method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope
   (SEM), and energy-dispersive analysis by X-ray (EDAX) were used to
   characterize the structural and surface morphological properties, as
   well as chemical compositions of the thin-films. The results indicate
   that thin-films of lead tellurium selenide have a polycrystalline
   structure and a preferred orientation during the deposition. It was also
   revealed that the grains appear as rectangles. By comparison of the
   optical properties of the thin-films deposited at different
   substrate-temperatures, it was found that substrate temperature has an
   important effect on the infrared optical properties of thin-films. The
   refractive index of the lead tellurium selenide thin-films lies between
   5.2 and 5.8, and the extinction coefficient is lower than 0.1. When the
   wavelength is greater than 6 mu m, the extinction coefficient of the
   thin-films is as less as 10(-3). It can be inferred that lead tellurium

Abstract = {{A response function is usually used to describe the scalability of a
   protocol for high-speed network. This requires detailed knowledge of the
   time-domain sending rate. However, studies about the performance of
   eXplicit Control Protocol (XCP) mainly focus on the steady-state
   behavior and few address this problem. Under a model with single
   bottleneck, the time-domain sending rate of XCP is derived in this
   paper. Simulation results show that this analytic time-domain sending
   rate is accurate. Combined with a periodic loss model, the response
   function of XCP is further derived. Unlike response functions of other
   protocols, the response function of XCP is related to not only the loss
   event rate, but also the per-flow bandwidth. Simulation results show
   that it forms fin upper bound for the throughput of XCP with given loss
   event rate and per-flow bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{Gejiu is one of the largest polymetallic tin ore districts in the world
   Located at the westernmost end of the South China tungsten-tin province
   (or Nanling tungsten-tin province) it is a granite-related (Gejiu
   granite) magmatic-hydrothermal system Nine samples from two phases of
   Gejiu granitic intrusions have been analyzed by SHRIMP and/or LA-ICPMS
   zircon U-Pb techniques yielding ages ranging from 774 +/- 25 Ma to 850
   +/- 085 Ma Whole rock analysis shows that both phases are high-K and
   alkali-rich granites and their ACNK values fall mainly into a small
   range of 1 0-1 1 Moreover Harker diagrams indicate that granites
   experienced strong fractional crystallization during magmatic evolution
   Most granites display relative enrichment in LREE and strong Eu
   depletion The whole rock average epsilon(Nd)(t) values of the Gejiu
   granites vary from -93 to -69 whereas a range of -8 12<epsilon(Hf)(t)<1
   21 is defined by magmatic zircons Sr-Nd-Hf isotope data indicate that
   the granites have been mainly derived from crustal melts with minor
   Input of mantle component Two stage Nd and Hf model ages together with
   isotopic characteristics indicate that the Gejiu granite magmas were
   possibly derived from partial melting of Mesoproterozoic continental

Abstract = {{Commentators routinely urge that it is morally permissible forcibly to
   treat psychiatric patients (1) to preserve the patient's best interests

   of beneficence toward others, while appreciating personal autonomy as a
   positive value to be weighted against other factors. Varying by
   jurisdiction, legal statutes usually require, in addition, at least (3)
   that there exists the threat of harm to self or others. In this paper, I
   argue against embracing the first two elements of this prevailing view.
   I also argue for a very restricted reading of the third element, based
   on the moral limits of permissible state action.}},

Abstract = {{Testicular germ cell cancers are the most common solid malignancies in
   young men, but their pathogenesis remains undetermined although some
   epidemiological data have implicated both environmental and genetic
   factors. Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is secreted by
   Sertoli cells, and promotes germ stem cell proliferation by activating
   RET, a tyrosine kinase receptor. Over-expression of GDNF in adult
   transgenic mice induces the development of testicular tumours that mimic
   human seminoma, the most frequent testicular germ cell tumour.
   Activating mutations of RET were previously reported in several types of
   cancer, including thyroid, pituitary, adrenal and melanoma cancer. Both
   mouse experimental model and clinical studies suggested that mutations
   or selective polymorphisms of RET might be associated with human
   seminoma. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted this study in a French
   University Hospital and carried out an association study using tissue
   samples from 66 paraffin-embedded seminoma tumours. The most frequently
   mutated exons of the RET proto-oncogene were sequenced to identify
   mutations or selective polymorphisms. No somatic mutations were
   identified. The polymorphic variants frequencies did not differ from
   those in a control Caucasian population. Human classical seminoma that
   occurs in young men does not appear to be linked with mutations or
   relevant polymorphisms of RET.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the influence of climate on cumulative and
   interannual growth patterns of 18 full-sib families of hybrid poplars
   (Populus x smithii Boivin) derived from different geographical locations
   (state counties) of natural stands of aspen parents (trembling aspen
   (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata
   Michx.)). The hybrids were subsequently planted in 1982 in southern
   mid-Michigan at Michigan State University (MSU) Sandhill Research Area.
   Cumulative measures of hybrid poplar productivity (diameter, height,
   basal area, and stem volume) in 2009 (28 years since plantation
   establishment) were related via correlation analysis to geographical
   distances and climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) between
   parental county locations and between parental locations and the
   plantation site. Tree-ring analysis methods (dendrochronology) were also
   used to quantify the influence of climate (i.e., mean temperature and
   total precipitation at monthly and 3-month seasonal scales) on
   interannual basal area growth rates of hybrid poplars. Analyses of
   cumulative measures of growth indicated a maternal effect: full-sib
   families had higher productivity if they had a maternal parent
   originating from a state county that was close to or had higher
   temperature (annual and summer) and summer precipitation than
   corresponding parameters of the planting site. Principal component
   analysis indicated that 17 of the 18 full-sib families shared a large
   amount of common growth variation. Dendrochronological analyses of
   interannual growth-climate relationships indicated that growth was
   mainly affected by the degree of late summer to fall moisture stress in
   both the current and previous growth season, and the degree of winter
   harshness.}},

   high-band for LP mode. which has the similar current distribution to
   that of the fundamental mode of the conventional circular slot, is
   employed the first-higher order resonant mode of the circular slot. Two

   pH of 5.3, with shaking at 200 rpm, and a temperature of 30 degrees C
   for a 14-day period of incubation. The biosurfactant was purified, in
   accordance with surfactant properties, by solvent fractionation using
   silica gel column chromatography. The chemical structure of the
   strongest surface-active compound was elucidated through the use of NMR
   and mass spectroscopy, and noted to be monoolein, which then went on to
   demonstrate antiproliferative activity against cervical cancer (HeLa)
   and leukemia (U937) cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.
   Interestingly, no cytotoxicity was observed with normal cells even when
   high concentrations were used. Cell and DNA morphological changes, in
   both cancer cell lines, were observed to be cell shrinkage, membrane
   blebbling, and DNA fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
   infections are important risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC). Yet, there have been few studies on adherence to screening
   recommendations for groups at high risk for HCC. We assessed whether
   demographic factors or medical conditions affected screening
   participation among HBV/HCV carriers. Methods: The study population
   consisted of 15 565 men and women who visited the National Cancer
   Center, Korea between August 2002 and July 2009. A self-administered
   questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic
   characteristics, medical history, including chronic HBV and HCV
   infection, and health check-up history. HBV surface antigen and HCV
   antibody levels were measured in serum. Results: Among 781 HBV carriers,
   596 (76.3\%) were aware of their infection and 451 (57.8\%) had ever
   been tested by ultrasonography. Among HCV carriers, 49 of 127 (36.6\%)
   were aware of their infection and 61(48.0\%) had ever been tested by
   ultrasonography. Among HBV carriers, male sex (OR, 1.68; 95\% CI,
   1.22-2.31), family history of liver disease (OR, 2.04; 95\% CI,
   1.43-2.90), medical history of hyperlipidemia (OR, 2.70; 95\% CI,
   1.36-5.33), and awareness of infection status (OR, 4.30; 95\% CI,
   2.99-6.17) were associated with being tested. Among HCV carriers,
   awareness of infection (OR, 3.77; 95\% CI, 1.72-8.26) was significantly
   associated with being tested by ultrasonography. Conclusion: Male sex,
   family history of liver disease, medical history of hyperlipidemia, and
   awareness of high risk status were associated with being tested by
   ultrasonography. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background : It has been demonstrated that flow cytometric detection of
   minimal residual disease (MRD) has a prognostic significance in the
   treatment of patients with acute leukemia. We investigated the
   significance of flow cytometric MRD detection for the first time in
   Korea.
   Methods : We analyzed the results of MAD detection in morphologically
   complete remission bone marrow aspirates from 89 patients with
   newly-diagnosed or relapsed acute leukemia, in which leukemic cells had
   cross-lineage antigen expression. Patients were grouped based on MRD
   frequencies: >= 1.0\%, high MAD; <1.0\%, low MRD.
   Results : Forty-seven ALL patients consisted of 10 with high and 37 with
   low MRD levels. Patients with high MRD levels showed a tendency of more
   frequent relapse than those with low MRD levels (40.0\% and 13.5\%,
   respectively) (P=0.08). High MAD group showed a tendency of short
   relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), although the
   differences were not statistically significant. Forty-two AML patients
   consisted of 16 with high and 26 with low MAD levels. There were no
   correlations between the MRD levels and relapse rate, RFS or OS. AML
   patients with high MRD levels showed significantly higher rate of
   unfavorable cytogenetic risk categories and lower rate of favorable risk
   categories (P=0.03).
   Conclusions : MRD detection by flow cytometric assay of cross-lineage
   antigen expression would be useful in predicting treatment outcome in
   patients with ALL rather than AML. We expect that the establishment of
   the standardization of methods, time to test or antibody combination
   would be achieved through further trials in this country. (Korean J Lab

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Objective Cavernous carotid aneurysms (CCAs) can present with visual
   symptoms or with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). As surgical treatment of
   these aneurysms can be technically challenging, endovascular management
   has emerged as the preferred treatment modality.
   Methods A retrospective review was conducted of 113 patients who
   underwent endosaccular treatment for CCAs. Presenting symptoms, aneurysm
   size, use of stent assistance, rate of thromboembolic complications,
   presence of SAH and angiographic follow-up were reviewed.
   Results 29 patients (26\%) with CCAs presented with diplopia due to
   cranial nerve palsies. Mean aneurysm size in this group was 17 mm. Three
   patients (2.6\%) presented with SAH with a mean aneurysm size of 15.3
   mm. Mean length of stay for ruptured versus non-ruptured aneurysms was
   11.7 and 1.7 days, respectively. Clinically significant thromboembolic
   complications occurred in four cases (3.5\%). Stent assistance was
   required in 53 cases (47\%). Of the 86 patients (76\%) returning for
   follow-up angiography (mean 6.2 months), 58 (75\%) had no residual
   aneurysm and 14 (12\%) showed regrowth. Thirteen patients (11.5\%)
   underwent repeat endovascular treatment.
   Conclusions CCAs commonly produce diplopia and cranial nerve palsies
   when a critical size is reached (mean 17 mm in our series). Aneurysm
   obliteration with internal carotid artery preservation is the preferred
   treatment modality and can be accomplished with coil embolization with
   or without stent assistance. Although recurrence and retreatment can
   occur, the thromboembolic risk of endovascular treatment is low.
   Consideration should be given to treatment of asymptomatic CCAs 15 mm or
   larger due to potential risks of cranial neuropathy and SAH.}},

Abstract = {{We have calculated the optical structure of wurtzite ZnO doped with
   Silicon (Si). The calculations are based on the density functional
   theory with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the
   projector augmented wave pseudopotentials. The GGA with the Perdew Burke
   Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional are employed in the
   simulations. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials are utilized for the geometry
   optimization to render the computations tractable as well as to enhance
   the efficiency. We investigate two kinds of defects in ZnO, namely the
   substitution of Zn by Si and O by Si. The optical properties, including
   dielectric function, reflectivity and absorption coefficient of wurtzite
   ZnO are calculated. The variation in the band gap and energetics have
   been validated against published results. The dielectric properties
   follow a steep decreasing trend for the low energy level. In addition,
   the reflectivity and absorption coefficients reduce abruptly due to the
   doping. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Melatonin is an important endocrine signal for darkness in mammals
   Transcriptional activation of the arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase
   gene encoding for the penultimate enzyme in melatonin synthesis drives
   the daily rhythm of the hormone in the pineal gland of rodents Rhythmic
   arylalkylanune-N acetyltransferase expression is controlled by the cAMP
   signal transduction pathway and involves the activation of beta
   adrenergic receptors and the inducible cAMP early repressor In addition,
   the rat arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase promoter contains an E box
   element which can interact with clock proteins Moreover the pineal gland
   of mice shows a circadian rhythm in clock proteins such as the
   transcriptional repressor Period1, which has been shown to control
   rhythmic gene expression in a variety of tissues However the role of
   Period1 in the regulation of pineal melatonin synthesis is still unknown
   Therefore, circadian rhythms in arylalkylamine N acetyltransferase, beta
   adrenergic receptor and inducible cAMP early repressor mRNA levels (real
   time PCR) arylalkylamine N acetyltransferase enzyme activity
   (radiometric assay) and melatonin concentration radio immuno assay (RIA)
   were analyzed in the pineal gland of mice with a targeted deletion of
   the Period1 gene (Per1-/-) and the corresponding wildtype In Per1-/- the
   amplitude in arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase expression was
   significantly elevated as compared to wildtype In contrast, beta
   adrenergic receptor and inducible cAMP early repressor mRNA levels were
   not affected by the Period1 deficiency This indicates that the molecular
   clockwork alters the amplitude of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase
   expression In vitro, pineal glands of Per1-/- mice showed a day night
   difference in arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase expression with high
   levels at night This suggests that a deficient in Period1 elicits
   similar effects as the activation of the cAMP signal transduction
   pathway in wildtype mice (C) 2010 IBRO Published by Elsevier Ltd All

Abstract = {{The copper-TEMPO-catalysed aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols based
   on the new supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysts is presented.
   CuCl2 acts as a homogenous catalyst dissolved in the small quantity of
   ionic liquid dispersed in the form of film on the solid support. A
   bi-modal pore structure silica with a highly developed surface and an
   ionogel were used as solid supports. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium
   octylsulfate as the most active ``catalyst-philic{''} phase was found.
   The application of SILP catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols allows
   the high yields of corresponding aldehydes (92-95\%). The catalysts were
   used in seven cycles without significant loss of activity. High
   recoveries of the catalysts were observed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Topical capsaicin is an established treatment option for various pain
   conditions. In a randomized double-blind multi-centre study, 281
   patients suffering from chronic soft tissue pain were treated either
   with a cream containing capsaicin 0.05\% ('Finalgon (R) CPD Warmecreme',
   n = 140) or placebo (n = 141). Of these, 151 were excluded from the ITT
   analysis, as they had in addition to their soft-tissue pain, pain of
   other origin. The primary outcome measure was a positive treatment
   response, defined as a pain sum score reduction of 30\% or more After 3
   weeks of treatment, the median pain sum score had decreased by 49\%
   (capsicum group) and 23\% (placebo group) (ITT analysis, p = 0.0006).
   The odds ratio of the responders in favour for capsaicin was 4.3 (CI
   97.5\% lower limit 1.9, p < 0.0001). Improvements in the secondary
   efficacy measures confirmed the results. Likewise, all outcome measures
   had significantly more improved in the capsaicin-treated compared with
   the placebo-treated chronic back pain sufferers. All patients were
   included in the safety assessments. More adverse events occurred in the
   capsicum group (n = 13) than in the placebo group (n = 6). The capsaicin
   cream was generally well tolerated. The results indicate that capsaicin
   cream is useful in patients with chronic soft tissue pain and is also
   efficacious in patients with chronic back pain for which effectiveness
   was already demonstrated in earlier clinical trials. Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Elastin like polypeptides (ELPs) made from the repeating pentapeptides
   (Val-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly) are protein based biopolymers that contain useful
   properties, including the ability to self-assemble, biocompatibility,
   and stimuli sensitivity. However, due to the repeated consumption of
   specific amino acids, long ELPs generally have low expression yields in
   in vitro and in vivo systems. This is because of the lack of specific
   amino acids during the translation process. In this study, ELP fusion
   proteins of various lengths were prepared by recursive directional
   ligation (RDL) and expressed in a cell-free protein synthesis system. By
   measuring TCA-precipitated radioactivity with a liquid scintillation
   counter, their expression profiles were investigated. The expression
   levels of an ELP fusion protein were improved by almost 2-fold by adding
   specific amino acids. Additionally, we determined that the amount of
   increase in expression levels depends on the length of the ELPs. This
   study suggests a useful strategy to improve the yield of longer
   repetitive polypeptides such as ELPs or silk-like polypeptides (SLPs).

Abstract = {{PtRu/C catalysts with different mean particle sizes have been
   synthesised by microwave-assisted polyol process at various pH values
   and characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy
   dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Their
   electrochemical performances have been tested by cyclic voltammetry,
   amperomeric i-t, and CO-stripping techniques. The effects of pH values
   on performances of the PtRu/C catalysts have been mainly investigated.
   It has been found that the particle size, composition and catalytic
   activity of the PtRu/C catalyst are very sensitive to the pH value of
   reducing solution, and the PtRu/C catalyst prepared at the pH value of 8
   exhibits the better performance for methanol electrooxidation than the
   other samples. The size of the nanoparticles decreases as the pH value
   increases from 0.2 to 10 with the largest size of 4.4 nm and the
   smallest one of 2.1 nm. The two metal elements distribute uniformly in
   the catalyst and their metal loadings are similar to the theoretical

Abstract = {{Runaway youths are at high risk of developing stress, and it is critical
   to improve our conceptualization of the relationships between stress and

   stress and coping: (a) the Resiliency Model (RM) of Family Stress,
   Adjustment, and Adaptation; and (b) the Lazarus and Folkman's Stress,
   Appraisal, and Coping Model (SACM). Stress and coping among runaway
   youths are explained through the application of these two theoretical
   models. The RM explains stress and coping among ``throwaway{''} youths
   and at-risk youths living with their families. The SACM is better suited
   for explaining runaway youths who are currently living in shelters or on
   the streets, as well as ``systems{''} or ``independent{''} youths. This
   theoretical framework can be utilized in planning and developing crisis
   assessment and interventions for runaway youths experiencing high levels
   of stress.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To investigate the effects of bortezomib on cell apoptosis and
   proliferation in human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts (HTFs) after
   cotreatment with TGF-beta.
   METHODS. The effect of bortezomib on the apoptosis and cell
   proliferation of cultured HTFs was determined with FACS analysis and
   3-{[}4,5-demethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] (MTT)
   assay with or without cotreatment of TGF-beta. The apoptotic effect of
   cotreatment of bortezomib and TGF-beta through the PI3K/Akt pathway was
   determined by Western blot analysis. The mRNA level of Bcl-2 and Bax was
   determined by RT-PCR. p53 expression, DNA-PKcs cleavage, and c-Jun
   phosphorylation were determined.
   RESULTS. Cotreatment with bortezomib (5 mu M) and TGF-beta (10 mu M)
   increased the proportion of apoptotic cells in HTFs on FACS analysis,
   whereas either bortezomib or TGF-beta treatment alone did not. The MTT
   assay also showed that when bortezomib was cotreated with TGF-beta, the
   cell proliferation of HTFs induced by TGF-beta treatment was
   significantly decreased at 72-hour incubation. The cotreatment of
   bortezomib and TGF-beta specifically decreased the Akt phosphorylation
   induced by TGF-beta, indicating on Western blot analysis that these
   changes are mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. The mRNA level of an
   apoptosis-related factor, Bcl-2, was significantly reduced, and p53
   expression, DNA-PKcs cleavage, and c-Jun phosphorylation were increased
   after cotreatment.
   CONCLUSIONS. Bortezomib-induced apoptosis is potentiated by TGF-beta
   cotreatment in cultured HTFs by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway,
   indicating that the effect of bortezomib may be potentiated when the
   level of TGF-beta is elevated, as is observed in the postoperative
   period. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2010;51:6232-6237)

   The aim of this study is to research the milk biochemical taste
   components in organic (ORG) and conventional (CON) systems for different
   season. In study, all data were investigated for all season of 2004.
   Milk fat levels in both groups for summer season were lower than any
   other season. Average milk fat values in ORG treatment were lower than
   the values of CON treatment in all season except winter period.
   Therefore, a decrease in fat percentage for organic milk can directly
   lead to taste loss. Similarly, total solid rates in conventional milks
   in spring period were more favorable than rates in organic milk for
   desired taste. However, the pH value in organic milk was more acceptable
   for required flavor in summer season.}},

Abstract = {{Background: An inherited predisposition is an important factor in the
   etiology of myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age. However, the
   extent of the risk for early-onset MI in relatives of young patients is
   still unclear, due to the paucity of family history data. Hence familial
   aggregation of early-onset MI was investigated in a cohort of relatives
   of Italian patients who had survived MI who occurred at the age of 45 or
   earlier.
   Methods: In the framework of a case-control study, lifetime data and
   early-onset MI status for 11,696 relatives of cases and 8897 relatives
   of controls were collected using a standardized questionnaire.
   Results: Occurrence of early-onset MI in females was very uncommon
   (Kaplan-Meier risk=0.6\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.82\%,
   for female case relatives), and significantly lower than that for male
   case relatives (5.0\%, 95\% CI: 4.41-5.56\%). The hazard ratio (HR) for
   case relatives was approximately 3-fold greater than that for control
   aunts (taken as reference category). Risk for early-onset MI to siblings
   (HR=1.7, 95\% CI: 1.33-2.18) was significantly different from that to
   parents (HR=0.9, 95\% CI: 0.71-1.16). The familial risk ratio lambda(R)
   was 2.6 (95\% CI: 2.30-2.89) for case relatives, using control parents
   as reference population for early-onset MI risk estimates (i.e. 37 per
   100,000 in fathers and 7 per 100,000 in mothers).
   Conclusion: We evaluated the risk of early-onset MI by category of
   relatives, obtaining evidence for familial aggregation of the disease in
   this Italian sample and providing figures for genetic counselling and
   planning genetic epidemiological studies. (C) 2010 European Federation

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Perineal rectosigmoidectomy was the most popular operation
   performed for rectal prolapse in the first half of the 20th century.
   However, high recurrence rates relegated it to a back-up role for
   elderly or other high-risk patients who were not candidates for an
   abdominal operation. Recent series (combined with levatorplasty =
   Altemeier procedure) revealed excellent results across a broader
   spectrum of patients and inspired this ongoing consecutive series of
   cases.
   METHODS: This is a review of 103 (99 women) consecutive patients (mean
   age, 68.9 y; range, 20-97 y) who underwent the Altemeier procedure
   between 2000 and 2009. Patients were placed in the prone jackknife
   position: 93 patients (90\%) with the use of general anesthesia and 10
   patients (10\%) with the use of spinal anesthesia. The mean follow-up
   was 43 months (range, 3 mo to 10 y).
   RESULTS: The mean time for the operation was 97.7 minutes (range, 50-180
   min) with a mean 7.2 cm of rectum resected (range, 2.5-26.7 cm). The
   mean blood loss was 66.9 mL (range, 0-350 mL). The mean time to
   tolerating a diet was 2.3 days (100\% within 4 d) and mean postoperative
   length of hospital stay was 4.2 days (93\% within 6 d). There was no
   mortality, minimal morbidity (14\%), and no recurrence. Preoperative
   constipation (61\% of patients) improved in 94\% and preoperative fecal
   incontinence (47\% of patients) improved in 85\%, whereas 15\% developed
   new onset of seepage or incontinence to flatus.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Altemeier procedure for rectal prolapse provided
   excellent results across all age groups with minimal morbidity, allowing
   for short hospital stays and periods of convalescence. To this point,
   there has been no evidence of recurrence in this group of patients,
   pending longer periods of follow-up, especially among patients from the
   younger age groups.}},

Abstract = {{Civil law rules were adopted in Florida that granted married women
   property rights long before legal reforms occurred in northern states
   This article analyzes white wives' property and law in Florida between
   1820 and 1860 Initially, married women s property rights were
   inadvertently protected by treaty law and limited to women who married
   before 1818 Wives' right to own separate property in Florida was
   subsequently re-confirmed in statute and extended to include later
   marriages In contrast, nonwhites generally lost the rights and property
   they had enjoyed under Spain's civil law in the same period This
   contrast reveals that in Florida (and other southern borderlands) it was
   not concern for women, or simply legal precedent, but the desire to
   incorporate new territory and expand slavery that influenced the
   development of marital property law This challenges previous histories,
   which have excluded the earlier acts in the Southern borderlands and
   emphasized those passed in the Northeast beginning in the late 1840s
   While those later acts were influenced by the early woman's rights
   movement and by concern for families reduced to poverty during the rise
   of market capitalism, this case study indicates that expansion of United
   States territory and slavery were responsible for the earlier married
   women s property rights in southern borderland territories such as
   Florida}},

Abstract = {{Systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is caused by misfolded
   immunoglobulin light-chain proteins that aggregate and deposit as unique
   fibrils, ultimately leading to organ failure and death. Recent
   developments that have significantly aided the management of patients
   with AL include diagnostic techniques for definitive typing of amyloid
   deposits by use of laser microdissection with mass spectrometry and
   customized protein bioinformatics, and validated staging and
   response-scoring systems that improve clinical trial design. The
   widespread use of cardiac biomarker staging and serum-free light-chain
   levels to evaluate response to therapy has also improved care. Standard
   therapies such as oral melphalan and dexamethasone or autologous stem
   cell transplant continue to be important options, while thalidomide and
   its analogs, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, and the proteasome-inhibitor
   bortezomib have activity in AL and have expanded our armamentarium.
   Continued improvement in outcomes, however, will require the commitment
   and cooperation of pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies,
   academic investigators, and cooperative groups/consortia. This effort
   will involve the conduct of well-designed clinical trials of new agents
   and combinations within a modern framework that categorizes the study
   populations of patients with AL, defines the end points appropriate to
   those populations and to the different phases of clinical trials,
   employs the newly available staging and response criteria, and
   standardizes adverse event reporting.}},

   interventions}},
Journal = {{NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1027-1032}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Internal carotid artery (ICA) agenesis has been usually
   reported as an asymptomatic condition in association with other
   congenital anomalies. However, it is less well described in the context
   of clinical neurological syndromes.
   Method: Five cases of ICA agenesis are reviewed. The diagnosis of ICA
   agenesis was based on the absence of bony carotid canal on computed
   tomography. Brain CT and magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans were done
   in all the patients and four vessels digital angiograms were obtained in
   two. Clinical presentation, coexistent radiological findings and
   associated abnormalities are reviewed.
   Findings: The initial presentations were pulsatile tinnitus, ischemic
   stroke, migraine, Horner's syndrome, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   Collateral circulation was supplied via the posterior communicating
   artery and the anterior communicating artery. Ophthalmic artery was
   supplied by meningeal arteries. On CT, all cases demonstrated agenesis
   of the bony carotid canal. Smaller cavernous sinus were detected in all
   cases, enlargement of the foramen spinosum was found in three patients
   and hyper-pneumatization of the petrous apex was detected in two cases.
   In one patient a cerebral aneurysms was detected and treated with an
   endovascular approach. Other associated vascular abnormalities were
   aortic origin of the vertebral artery in two patients, ICA coiling in
   two cases and fenestration of basilar artery in one case.
   Conclusion: ICA agenesis is usually asymptomatic but occasionally may be
   associated with ischemic stroke. Collateral supply is usually effective
   in preventing stroke but may become inefficient leading to ischemia.
   Associated anomalies such as cerebral aneurysms are commonly depicted on
   the same side as the ICA agenesis and may represent a potential
   life-threatening condition.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with temporal lobe seizures sometimes experience what John
   Hughlings Jackson described as ``dreamy states{''} during seizure onset.
   These phenomena may be characterized by a re-experiencing of past
   events, feelings of familiarity (deja vu), and hallucinations. In
   previous reports, patients have been aware of the illusory nature of
   their experiences. Here, however, the case of a patient with a
   documented 37-year history of temporal lobe epilepsy who is not aware is
   described. Fifteen years ago, the patient saw visions of traumatic
   autobiographical events that he had never previously recalled. He
   believed them to be veridical memories from his childhood, although
   evidence from his family suggests that they were not. The patient's
   psychological reaction to the ``recovery{''} of these traumatic
   ``memories{''} was severe enough to qualify as posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD). To our knowledge, this is the first report of PTSD
   caused by the misattribution of mental states that accompany a seizure.

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to describe the associations between depressive
   symptoms and some working conditions according to broad occupational
   categories in France.
   These data came from the decennial health survey conducted in 2003 in
   France by the National Institute for Statistics and Economics Studies
   (6,082 men, 5,521 women). The data collected included: depressive
   symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale),
   psychosocial factors at work and potential confounding factors.
   Associations between psychosocial work factors and depressive symptoms
   varied, according to occupational category and sex. Time pressure was
   significantly associated with depressive symptoms in the less advantaged
   occupational categories. The lack of job control was associated with
   depressive symptoms only in managers and associate professionals and
   technicians. Only low social support was systematically associated with
   depressive symptoms, regardless of occupational category.
   These results should be taken into account to adapt strategies of mental
   health disorders prevention at work, for a better efficacy.}},

   Spectroscopy-Directed Restricted Fluid Therapy versus Standard Fluid
   Therapy in Patients Undergoing Elective Colorectal Surgery}},

Abstract = {{There are substantial data supporting the concept that algorithms that
   effectively limit fluid volumes to patients undergoing elective surgery,
   particularly intraoperatively, significantly reduce perioperative
   morbidity. We hypothesized that intraoperative fluid limitation could be
   safely accomplished when guided by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
   monitoring, and that this fluid restriction regimen would result in a
   reduction in postoperative morbidity when compared with standard
   monitoring and fluid therapy. The intent of this pilot study was to
   demonstrate the feasibility and ease of conduct of this study protocol
   before expanding to the multicenter pivotal trial. We performed a
   prospective, (2:1) randomized, pilot study at two centers. A total
   enrollment of 24 fully evaluable patients undergoing elective open
   colorectal surgery (16 restricted, 8 standard) was planned. After
   providing informed consent, patients were randomized to standard fluid
   resuscitation (500 LR induction bolus, then LR 7 mL/kg/h x 1 h, then 5
   mL/kg/h) or restricted fluid resuscitation (no induction bolus, then LR
   2 mL/kg/h). Subsequent fluid bolus infusions were guided by physiologic
   parameters (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, heart rate > 100 bpm, or
   oliguria) in the standard group, and by tissue oxygen saturation from
   NIRS (tissue oxygen saturation (StO(2)) < 75\%, or 20\% below baseline;
   or the same physiologic parameters) in the restricted group. Primary
   endpoints were major postoperative complications. A total of 27 patients
   were randomized (18 restricted, 9 standard). Age, gender, ethnicity,
   past medical history, and body mass index were similar. American Society
   of Anesthesiologists class was somewhat higher in the restricted group
   (American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 in 77\% of restricted vs
   44\% of standard patients; P = 0.194). Median total intraoperative
   fluids were less in the restricted group (1300 mL) when compared with
   the standard group (3014 mL) (P = 0.021). Total fluids for the
   hospitalization were also statistically significantly decreased in the
   restricted group. Complications occurred in about two-thirds of
   patients, and complication rates were not statistically different
   between groups (1.6/restricted patient vs 2.1/standard patient; P =
   0.333). Primary indications for boluses (n = 93) given to study patients
   were: hypotension (69\%); oliguria (15\%); and tachycardia (14\%), with
   multiple indications per bolus. In only two instances did the StO(2)
   drop to less than 75 per cent, or decrease by 20 per cent from baseline
   in the 3 minutes before bolus as an indication for fluid administration.
   Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery with a fluid restricted
   strategy had only rare episodes of decreased StO(2), suggesting that
   adequate tissue perfusion was maintained in this group. As a result,
   NIRS monitoring did not significantly influence intraoperative fluid
   management of patients undergoing colorectal surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of living cells with their environment is linked to
   their adhesive and elastic properties Even if the mechanics of simple
   lipid membranes is fairly well understood the analysis of single cell
   experiments remains challenging in part because of the mechanosensory
   response of cells to their environment To study the mechanical
   properties of living cells we have developed a tool that borrows from
   micropipette aspiration techniques atomic force microscopy and the
   classical John son Kendall Roberts test We show results from a study of
   the adhesion properties of living cells as well as the elastic response
   and relaxation We present models that are applied throughout the
   different stages of an experiment which indicate that the contribution
   of the different components of the cell are active at various stages of
   compression retraction and detachment Finally we present a model that
   attempts to elucidate the surprising logarithmic relaxation observed
   when the cell is subjected to a given deformation}},

Abstract = {{The influence of prior, irretrievable, investment (sunk cost) on
   commitment to a course of education was investigated. The moderating
   effects of the emotions of anger and fear over this commitment decision
   were also investigated. A total of 425 participants (214 male) with a
   mean age of 19.92 years were recruited from an undergraduate population.
   A computer program simulated the process of arranging to undertake a
   course of education. Participants were induced to feel either anger or
   fear and, then, invested one of three amounts of sunk cost (under
   budget, on budget, or over budget) to signing up for a course.
   Participants then decided how much time they wished to commit to this
   course or to an alternative, identical course with a better chance of
   success. Results revealed a significant sunk cost effect of prior
   investment on commitment to a course of education. Results also revealed
   that anger increased the magnitude of this sunk cost effect. Results did
   not reveal any effect of fear on the sunk cost effect. Theoretical
   implications and practical applications were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Zirconium umbite, K2ZrSi3O9 center dot H2O, is a microporous framework
   ion exchanger whose potential as a carrier for Zn2+ ions in
   antimicrobial formulations has not yet been investigated. Accordingly,
   batch Zn2+-exchange kinetics of synthetic zirconium umbite (K-UM) and
   the subsequent antimicrobial action of the zinc-bearing phase (Zn-UM)
   against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli are reported.
   Nonstoicheiometric over-exchange of Zn2+ for K+ was observed and
   attributed to hydrolysis and complexation reactions of Zn2+ within the
   umbite framework. The exchange process, which was described by a simple
   pseudo-first-order model (k (1) = 2.69 x 10(-4) min(-1), R (2) = 0.992),
   did not achieve equilibrium within 120 h at 25 A degrees C, by which
   time the uptake of zinc was found to be 1.04 mmol g(-1). The minimal
   bactericidal concentrations of Zn-UM for E. coli and S. aureus were
   found to be > 10 g cm(3) and < 1.0 g cm(3), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic model was recently proposed to describe the effect of aging on
   deposit thermal conductivity and the thermal performance of a
   shell-and-tube heat exchanger undergoing crude oil fouling. The model is
   adapted for implementation within a dynamic, distributed system with
   spatial and temporal distributions, relaxing several of the previous
   assumptions. The evolution of surface roughness is also considered,
   using conjectural linear and asymptotic functions. Simulations are
   performed for a single tube representative of a refinery exchanger. The
   results demonstrate the substantial effects over time of aging and
   roughness on heat transfer and pressure drop. Roughness effects yield
   apparently negative initial fouling resistances, as reported in some
   experimental tests. The importance of accounting for roughness dynamics
   in short time scale pilot plant scale tests and aging over longer time
   scales in industrial applications is highlighted. (C) 2010 American

Abstract = {{Electrically conducting polymers hold promise for developing advanced
   neuroprostheses, bionic systems and neural repair devices. Among them,
   poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonate
   (PEDOT:PSS) exhibits superior physicochemical properties but
   biocompatibility issues have limited its use. We describe combinations
   of electrochemical and molecule self-assembling methods to consistently
   control neural cell development on PEDOT:PSS while maintaining very low
   interfacial impedance. Electro-adsorbed polylysine enabled long-term
   neuronal survival and growth on the nanostructured polymer. Neurite
   extension was strongly inhibited by an additional layer of PSS or
   heparin, which in turn could be either removed electrically or further
   coated with spermine to activate cell growth. Binding basic fibroblast
   growth factor (bFGF) to the heparin layer inhibited neurons but promoted
   proliferation and migration of precursor cells. This methodology may
   orchestrate neural cell behavior on electroactive polymers, thus
   improving cell/electrode communication in prosthetic devices and
   providing a platform for tissue repair strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a numerical tool developed to quantify the role of processes
   controlling the spatio-temporal distribution of the NO ultraviolet and
   O-2((1)Delta(g)) infrared nightglows in the Venus night side upper
   atmosphere, observed with the VIRTIS and SPICAV instruments on board
   Venus Express. This numerical tool consists in a two-dimensional
   chemical-transport time-dependent model which computes in a hypothetical
   rectangular solving domain the spatio-temporal distributions of the
   number densities of the four minor species at play in these two
   nightglow emissions. The coupled nonlinear system of the four partial
   differential equations, describing the spatio-temporal variations of the
   minor species, has been solved using a finite volume method with a
   forward Euler method for the time integration scheme. As an application,
   we have first simulated a time-constant supply of atoms through the
   upper boundary of the solving domain. The fluxes are inhomogeneous
   relative to its horizontal direction, in order to simulate regions of
   enhanced downward flow of oxygen and nitrogen giving rise to NO and O-2
   brightening. Given that these two emissions show large time variations,
   we have also simulated a time-dependent downward flux of O and N atoms.
   It results from these simulations that the lack of correlation between
   the NO and O-2((1)Delta(g)) nightglows largely result from to the
   coupling between horizontal and vertical transport processes and the
   very different chemical lifetimes of the two species. In particular, we
   have quantified the role of each process generating spatio-temporal
   de-correlations between the NO and O-2((1)Delta(g)) nightglows. (C) 2010

   have been partially described on physical bases in the past but can now

   concerning the particular conditions under which heat transfer
   transients in the cathode tip during the PAC pilot arc take place,

Abstract = {{In the forward channel of a networked control system (NCS), by defining
   the network states as a hidden Markov chain and quantizing the
   network-induced delays to a discrete sequence distributing over a finite
   time interval, the relation between the network states and the
   network-induced delays is modelled as a discrete-time hidden Markov
   model (DTHMM). The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced
   to derive the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of the parameters of
   the DTHMM. Based on the derived DTHMM, the Viterbi algorithm is
   introduced to predict the controller-to-actuator (C-A) delay during the
   current sampling period. The simulation experiments demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the modelling and predicting methods proposed.}},

   repetition frequency of 25 kHz, the corresponding conversion efficiency
   from the pump laser to the Raman laser was 20.1\%, which is comparable

Abstract = {{Objective
   In 1975, the Puerto Rican community successfully sued the New York City
   Department of Education, mandating the city to provide bilingual
   education to its Spanish-speaking English learner (EL) students. The
   settlement, known as the ``Aspira Consent Decree,{''} has been amended
   over time to include EL students of all language groups and now requires
   public schools that have at least 15 students of the same language group
   in two contiguous grades to offer bilingual education. Yet observational
   studies of bilingual education classrooms in the city document that
   Spanish-speaking EL students may be the only language group that
   receives native-language instruction, while students from other language
   groups who are enrolled in bilingual education primarily receive English
   instruction.
   Method
   I use this difference in treatment dosage to estimate the effect of
   bilingual education on the time that it takes students to learn English.
   Results and Conclusions
   Students who enroll in bilingual education classrooms learn English less
   quickly, but the effect of bilingual education is the same for
   Spanish-speaking and other students, implying that negative selection
   mechanisms are at work.}},

   regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between
   affective reaction factors and ADA knowledge, perceived reasonableness
   of workplace accommodations, and experience working with people with
   disabilities. Results Exploratory factor analysis revealed three
   underlying attitude dimensions: (a) Negative Cognitive and Affective
   Reactions, (b) Positive Attitudes toward Accommodations, and (c)
   Positive Attitudes towards Equal Treatment of People with Disabilities
   in the Workplace. Multiple regression analysis results indicated that
   positive attitudes toward people with disabilities in the workplace are
   associated with positive beliefs about the reasonableness of
   accommodating people with disabilities in the workplace and positive
   attitudes are related to higher level of experience working with people
   with disabilities. Conclusions The construct validity of the Affective
   Reactions subscale of the Disability Questionnaire is supported by the
   identification of three underlying attitudinal constructs.}},

Title = {{Preliminary assessment of feral goldfish impacts on ponds, with
   particular reference to native crucian carp}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{413-422}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Introductions of an Asian cyprinid, goldfish Carassius auratus, are
   known to pose a genetic threat to crucian carp Carassius carassius,
   which is native to northern parts of central and western Europe,
   including southeast England. However, there are no known studies in
   Europe of goldfish impacts on crucian carp growth and life-history
   traits, nor on the recipient ecosystems. The present study is the first
   such attempt, and compares the plants, invertebrates and fish biology
   (growth, condition, reproduction) in six ponds, two containing crucian
   carp only (allopatry), two containing goldfish only (allopatry), and two
   with both species (sympatry). Feral goldfish growth was greatest in
   sympatry with native crucian carp, whereas crucian carp growth was
   similar regardless of goldfish presence or absence. However, body
   condition (LK) and relative fecundity (per unit of body weight) of
   crucian carp was greatest in sympatry with feral goldfish. LK increased
   significantly with increasing water conductivity in goldfish but not in
   crucian carp, and LK was not related to pond invertebrate densities in
   either fish species. Differences in the plant and aquatic invertebrate
   communities observed in the study ponds could not be attributed to the
   introduction and establishment of goldfish, however non-native plant and
   invertebrate species were observed only in ponds containing goldfish.
   Differences in growth and condition between the two Carassius species
   does not appear to be due to differences in available food, so elevated
   somatic growth and reproductive output in crucian carp and faster growth
   in goldfish in sympatry may be due to non-dietary competitive
   interactions. The present preliminary study highlights the difficulties
   of assessing `real world' impacts of non-native species on native
   species and ecosystems as well as the need for further study of feral
   goldfish impacts on European pond ecosystems in general and on native
   congener crucian carp in particular.}},

Abstract = {{The isolation, characterization, and regulation by light and nitrogen of
   the lycopene beta-cyclase gene from Chlorella zofingiensis Donz
   (CzlcyB), involved in the biosynthesis of astaxanthin and lutein, have
   been performed in this work. These carotenoids are of high commercial
   value as dyes in food and as nutraceuticals. The open reading frame
   (ORF) of CzlcyB encoded a polypeptide of 546 amino acids. A single copy
   of CzlcyB has been found in C. zofingiensis. The chararacteristic
   Rossmann or dinucleotide binding fold, present in most lycopene
   cyclases, has been also identified in the LCYb of C. zofingiensis
   (CzLCYb). Heterologous genetic complementation in Escherichia coli
   showed the ability of the predicted protein to cycle both lycopene and
   delta-carotene. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the deduced protein
   forms a cluster with the rest of the lycopene beta-cyclases (LCYb) of
   the chlorophycean microalgae studied, being very closely related to LCYb
   of plants. Transcript levels of CzlcyB were increased under nitrogen
   deprivation, but no increase was observed under high-light conditions.
   However, high irradiance triggered astaxanthin synthesis, while nitrogen
   deprivation by itself could not induce it. The combination of high
   irradiance and nitrogen deprivation led to a significant enhancement of
   the astaxathin accumulation.}},

   springs (Cassano Irpino group, Serino springs, etc.) that are all
   outside the park boundaries. Using integrated hydrogeological data
   analysis, we defined the main aspects of aquifer vulnerability to
   pollution and identified the factors that may locally increase the risk
   of resource contamination. Finally, the effective recharge of the
   various groundwater bodies was evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified, fast, and innovative method was developed to count the
   total cell number in blastocysts. Murine blastocysts (N = 195) were used
   in this study. They were obtained after 10h culture of initial
   blastocysts, compact morulae grades I and II recovered from
   superovulated mouse. After culture, the blastococysts were selected to
   test the new proposal of counting. The process was done after embryo
   fixation in a sodium citrate solution, and adherence in glass slide.
   Following, the coloration was done using a fast panoptic coloration kit.
   As a result, it was possible to identify the blastomeres and count them
   in each blastocyst. This method provided a fast and effective analysis
   of the total cell number when compared with other techniques. Moreover,
   this new method shows advantages related to the cell visualization,
   which can be done in more simple equipment like stereoscopic microscope.
   Other interesting observed point was the long period of time and quality
   that the coloration stays on slides, considering other techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Disaster mental health (DMH) is vital to comprehensive
   disaster preparedness for communities. A train-the-trainer (TTT) model
   is frequently used in public health to disseminate knowledge and skills
   to communities, although few studies have examined its success. We
   report on the development and implementation of a DMH TTT program and
   examine variables that predict dissemination.
   Methods: This secondary analysis examines 140 community-based mental
   health providers' participation in a TTT DMH program in 2005-2006.
   Instructors' dissemination of the training was followed for 12 months.
   Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to predict
   dissemination of the training program.
   Results: Sixty percent of the trainees in the DMH TTT program conducted
   training programs in the 12-month period following being trained. The
   likelihood of conducting training programs was predicted by a
   self-report measure of perceptions of transfer of training. The number
   of individuals subsequently trained (559) was predicted by prior DMH
   training and sex. No other variables predicted dissemination of DMH
   training.
   Conclusions: The TTT model was moderately successful in disseminating
   DMH training. Interventionat the organizational and individual level, as
   well as training modifications, may increase cost-effective
   dissemination of DMH training. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness.

Abstract = {{Being underweight is associated with a poorer outcome after
   haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We investigated whether
   nutritional status affects a patient's ability to mobilise stem cells.
   Weights, heights, peripheral blood CD34 counts and total collected stem
   cells were collected on 305 patients.
   Those patients who were underweight had a lower median peripheral blood
   CD34 count than those who were not underweight (36.0 vs. 53.0 x 10(6)/L
   (p = 0.0047)). However, the proportion of patients achieving a
   collection containing the minimum number of CD34 cells required to

Abstract = {{Receiver functions (RFs) from two permanent stations (CUIG and ZAIG) of
   the Mexican broadband network were calculated to infer the crustal
   structure at both sites. The data were stacked to allow uncertainty
   estimations and inverted using two global optimization algorithms:
   simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Strong and systematic
   azimuthal dependence was observed in the stacked functions at CUIG site,
   which is located in the Mexican volcanic belt (MVB). Assuming a
   one-dimensional five-layer model per azimuthal stack, these variations
   were explained with the same upper crustal structure including a
   superficial similar to 2 km-thick low-velocity layer associated with the
   MVB and a well-defined Conrad interface around 15 km depth, different
   depths for the Moho discontinuity, and variations in both the S-wave
   velocity and Poisson's ratio for the upper mantle. Our inversion of
   observed RFs at CUIG and theoretical considerations suggest an eastward
   crustal thickening of at least 5 km below the Valley of Mexico. We
   tested the sensitivity of the modeling procedure by applying it to the
   recordings at ZAIG station. In this case, no azimuthal dependence was
   noticed in the stacked functions. After a simultaneous inversion of
   three different azimuthal stacks, a single four-layer model
   satisfactorily explained all data, thus revealing a flat one-dimensional
   crustal model below the Mexican Mesa Central, where ZAIG station is
   located. These results support the resolution and robustness of the
   applied method at both sites.}},

Title = {{Effects of postharvest treatments on fruit quality of sweet pepper at
   low temperature}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{2716-2722}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Postharvest storage of sweet pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum
   L.) at low temperatures could impair their physical and chemical
   composition. Therefore, maintenance of essential nutrition support or
   altered gas exchange could preserve fruit quality, minimizing chilling
   injury. Thus our aim was to determine the response to postharvest
   application of a low concentration of nitrogen (urea) or antitranspirant
   (pinolene) during a period of 21 days at 5 degrees C.
   RESULTS: The results indicate that storage at 5 degrees C was effective
   with respect to maintaining firmness of sweet pepper fruits for 21 days,
   while application of antitranspirant increased firmness compared with
   non-sprayed fruits. Additionally, urea maintained color while increasing
   total phenolics and the activity of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase,
   lowering lipid peroxidation. Composition of free amino acids was
   affected to a minor extent.
   CONCLUSION: Maintaining quality is of paramount importance in the
   postharvest period. This study shows the effect of both temperature and
   spraying treatments with regard to maintaining fruit quality during this
   period, and provides new insights into the physiological role of enzymes
   of the antioxidant system during pepper storage at low temperature. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper examines ownership decision of Chinese outward foreign direct
   investment (FDI) with a focus on the choice between a wholly owned
   subsidiary and a joint venture entry mode. Based on literature review
   and findings from our case study of ten Chinese outward investing firms,
   we develop a conceptual framework that integrates the resource-based and
   institution-based views of international business strategy. The
   framework reflects special characteristics of Chinese outward FDI. On
   the resource side, Chinese outward FDI is both asset exploiting and
   asset augmenting, and accordingly, both transaction costs and strategic
   intents have an impact on the FDI ownership decision of Chinese firms.
   On the institution side, when investing overseas, Chinese firms adjust
   their entry strategies to attain regulative and normative institutional
   legitimacy in host countries. Meanwhile, they also need to comply with
   the rules set by the Chinese government, which provide incentives to and
   impose restrictions on Chinese firms' FDI ownership decisions.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper makes a contribution to the study of impoliteness. More
   particularly, it explores conventionalised impoliteness formulae and
   their basis. It taps into debates about whether impoliteness (or
   politeness, for that matter) can be inherent in expressions, and argues
   that there is a sense in which it can. An important foundation for this
   paper is Terkourafi's (e.g. 2001, 2002) work on formulaic politeness
   expressions. However, it argues that Terkourafi's strong focus on the
   frequency of people's direct experience of linguistic expressions in
   specific contexts, whilst appropriate for politeness, does not entirely
   suit an account of conventionalised impoliteness formulae. Indirect
   experience of impoliteness, especially via metadiscourse, does much to
   shape what counts as impolite and thus what may be conventionalised as
   impolite. Such impoliteness metadiscourse is driven not only by the
   salience of impoliteness, but by the social dynamics of impoliteness
   itself. Finally, this paper proposes two methods for identifying
   conventionalised impoliteness formulae (one being akin to Terkourafi's
   method), and offers a preliminary list of such formulae in English. (C)

   on the chilean cultural field of the poets David and Mauricio Rosenmann
   Taub. Then I focus my attention on the unique strategies they use, which
   I describe as metaphysical games. Their main features are that they
   experiment with language, either with its sound o graphical qualities,
   and also the use of an uninhibited or humoristic tone. Although they
   show divergent ways towards a concentration or explosion of meanings, in
   both cases poetry turns to be a way of recalling absence.}},

Abstract = {{The main aim of the presented work is the integration of a long-period
   fiber grating and a liquid crystal into a hybrid structure, in order to
   develop an innovative fiber optic device controlled by an external
   electric field. The studied long-period fiber grating was fabricated
   using UV irradiation in a boron co-doped fiber (PS1250/1500,
   manufactured by Fibercore). As a liquid crystal we used a typical 5CB
   nematic liquid crystal. The sensing mechanism of the proposed loss
   filter relies on long-period fiber grating attenuation bands sensitivity
   to optical properties of the liquid crystal layer. The results obtained
   show that the long-period fiber grating with a nanosized liquid crystal
   layer exhibits one order of magnitude higher electrical sensitivity and
   a lower level of the voltage control than the long-period fiber grating
   with a micro-sized liquid crystal layer.}},

Abstract = {{The title compound, C23H26F2N2O4, is a dipeptidic inhibitor of
   gamma-secretase, one of the enzymes involved in Alzheimer's disease. The
   molecule adopts a compact conformation, without intramolecular hydrogen
   bonds. In the crystal structure, one of the amide N atoms forms the only
   intermolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bond; the
   second amide N atom does not form hydrogen bonds. High-resolution
   synchrotron diffraction data permitted the unequivocal location and
   refinement without restraints of all H atoms, and the identification of
   the characteristic shift of the amide H atom engaged in the hydrogen
   bond from its ideal position, resulting in a more linear hydrogen bond.
   Significant residual densities for bonding electrons were revealed after
   the usual SHELXL refinement, and modeling of these features as
   additional interatomic scatterers (IAS) using the program PHENIX led to
   a significant decrease in the R factor from 0.0411 to 0.0325 and
   diminished the r.m.s. deviation level of noise in the final difference
   Fourier map from 0.063 to 0.037 e angstrom (3).}},

Abstract = {{In the face of rapid population ageing, the long-run fall in effective
   retirement ages in most OECD countries needs to be reversed. There are
   some positive signs that this is beginning to happen, but early exit
   from the labour force, i.e. well before official old-age pension ages,
   still remains a very common phenomenon in OECD countries. In this paper
   we first compare recent trends in the labour situation of older workers
   across OECD countries. This is followed by a discussion of supply-side
   and demand-side factors that have been driving these trends. In
   particular, new evidence is presented on incentives to retire that are
   embedded in pension systems. We conclude that recent reforms in most
   countries in this area are working in the direction of encouraging later
   retirement, although in a few countries there are still substantial
   incentives to stop working early. We then examine to what extent there
   are barriers on the demand side which may also be discouraging work at
   an older age such as age discrimination, seniority rules in wage
   setting, low training participation and employment protection rules. We
   conclude that countries have also begun to tackle these barriers as
   well. Nevertheless, while considerable pension reform has undoubtedly
   strengthened incentives to continue working at an older age, further
   action is still required on the demand side to ensure that those older
   workers who wish to work longer can do so.}},

Abstract = {{The two-dimensional problem of gravity-driven laminar flow of a thin
   layer of fluid down a heated wavy inclined surface is discussed. The
   coupled effect of bottom topography, variable surface tension and
   heating has been investigated both analytically and numerically. A
   stability analysis is conducted while nonlinear simulations are used to
   validate the stability predictions and also to study thermocapillary
   effects. The governing equations are based on the Navier-Stokes
   equations for a thin fluid layer with the cross-stream dependence
   eliminated by means of a weighted residual technique. Comparisons with
   experimental data and direct numerical simulations have been carried out
   and the agreement is good. New interesting results regarding the
   combined role of surface tension and sinusoidal topography on the
   stability of the flow are presented. The influence of heating and the
   Marangoni effect are also deduced.}},

   to cope with real-time timetable disturbances (i.e., multiple train
   delays and blocked tracks) more effectively. This dynamic traffic
   control system co-ordinates the speed of successive trains on open track
   (re-timing), solves expected route conflicts (re-ordering) and provides
   dynamic use of platform tracks in a station or alternative paths in a
   corridor between stations (local re-routing). We adopt blocking time
   theory for a microscopic modeling track occupation and signaling
   constraints and alternative graphs for optimal solving dynamic traffic
   control problems with the aim of increasing the punctuality by a more
   intelligent use of infrastructure capacity at a network scale.}},

Abstract = {{The lysosomal system comprises a specialized network of organelles
   crucial for the sorting digestion recycling and secretion of cellular
   components With their content of hydrolytic enzymes lysosomes regulate
   the degradation of a multitude of substrates that reach these organelles
   via the biosynthetic or the endocytic route Gene defects that affect one
   or more of these hydrolases lead to LSDs (lysosomal storage diseases)
   This underscores the apparent lack of redundancy of these enzymes and
   the importance of the lysosomal system in cell and tissue homoeostasis
   Some of the lysosomal enzymes may form multiprotein complexes which
   usually work synergistically on substrates and in this configuration may
   respond more efficiently to changes in substrate load and composition A
   well characterized lysosomal multienzyme complex is the one comprising
   the glycosidases beta gal (beta galactosidase) and NEU1 (neuramidase 1)
   and of the serine carboxypeptidase PPCA (protective protein/cathepsin A)
   Three neurodegenerative LSDs are caused by other single or combined
   deficiency of these lysosomal enzymes Sialidosis (NEU1 deficiency) and
   galactosialidosis (combined NEU1 and 0 gal deficiency secondary to a
   primary defect of PPCA) belong to the glycoprotein storage diseases
   whereas GM1 gangliosidosis (beta gal deficiency) is a glycosphingolipid
   storage disease Identification of novel molecular pathways that are
   deregulated because of loss of enzyme activity and/or accumulation of
   specific metabolites in various cell types has shed light on mechanisms
   of disease pathogenesis and may pave the way for future development of
   new therapies for these LSDs}},
