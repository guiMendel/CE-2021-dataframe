Abstract = {{To investigate the role of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 in vivo,
   we generated IRS-2-deficient mice by gene targeting. Although homozygous
   IRS-2-deficient mice (IRS-2(-/-) mice) had a body weight similar to
   wildtype mice, they progressively developed type 2 diabetes at 10 weeks.
   IRS-2(-/-) mice showed insulin resistance and a defect in the
   insulin-stimulated signaling pathway in liver but not in skeletal
   muscle. Despite insulin resistance, the amount of beta -cells was
   reduced to 83\% of that in wild-type mice, which was in marked contrast
   to the 85\% increase in the amount of beta -cells in IRS-1-deficient
   mice (IRS-1(-/-) mice) to compensate for insulin resistance. Thus, IRS-2
   plays a crucial role in the regulation of beta -cell mass. On the other
   hand, insulin secretion by the same number of cells in response to
   glucose measured ex vivo was significantly increased in IRS-2(-/-) mice
   compared with wild-type mice but was decreased in IRS-1(-/-) mice. These
   results suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-S may play different roles in the
   regulation of beta -cell mass and the function of individual beta
   -cells.}},

Abstract = {{Size distribution measurements and classification performance tests
   under low pressure conditions ranging from 123 to 300 Torr were
   systematically carried out for nano-meter sized silver particles formed
   in a nitrogen gas flow at atmospheric pressure using a new type of
   differential mobility analyzer (LPDMA) based on the Vienna type design
   concept which has a short classification zone. Although the values of
   the volumetric average diameter, D-V,D-DMA, are approximately 7\% larger
   than those of the volumetric average diameter, D-V,D-TEM, obtained from
   the transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation results of the
   silver particles collected at the LPDMA inlet, both the DMA and TEM size
   measurements are found to have good correlation in the range from 6 to
   15 nm. When the ratio of the sheath gas flow rate and aerosol gas flow
   rate is set at 5:1, the theoretical sizes calculated from the
   classification voltage applied to the LPDMA at 160 Torr are also found
   to be in good correlation with those of D-V,D-TEM obtained from the TEM
   observation results of the silver particles collected after the
   classification by the LPDMA in the range from 6 to 25 nm, although the
   theoretical sizes set by the LPDMA are approximately 14\% larger than
   those of D-V,D-TEM measured from the TEM observation results after the
   classification by the LPDMA.
   The geometric standard deviations of the size distributions obtained
   from the TEM images after classification range from 1.08 to 1.17, and
   they are approximately equal to the theoretical value (1.093) of the
   particles classified by the LPDMA, which is derived from the assumption
   that the broadening effects by Brownian diffusion are ignored, whereas
   the geometric standard deviations of the size distributions obtained
   from the TEM images before the classification range from 1.34 to 1.50
   and are greater than those after classification. Thus, we experimentally
   demonstrate the validity of our LPDMA system in size measurements and
   classification of the nm-sized particles under low pressure conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a political-institutional explanation for why the
   relatively dynamic economies of both Thailand and Malaysia suffered
   devastating blows from the 1997 financial crisis, and why Malaysia
   seemed to suffer less and recovered faster than Thailand. The financial
   crises in Thailand and Malaysia originated from the rise of new
   financial politics, a form substantially different from industrial
   politics. Attributes of major financial actors and their institutional
   relationships contributed to the vulnerability of the financial systems
   of both countries. However, Thailand's financial institutions contained
   more serious institutional problems than Malaysia's, problems that have
   continued to impede Thailand's recovery Thailand's institutional
   problems have included: the country's central bank and securities
   exchange regulators both have lacked political autonomy; political
   parries have been personality-based, ecliptic, turncoat, and regional;
   private conglomerates have been politically influential: and strong
   local factions have exerted strong influence on politicians. However,
   various institutional reforms introduced after the crisis may have
   significant, positive impact on the health of Thai financial politics.
   By contrast, the Malaysian state has always been relatively efficient.
   The central bank enjoys strong political autonomy while the securities
   exchange regulators lack comparable autonomy. The ruling coalition,
   Barisan Nasional (National Front), dominates both its members and
   opposition parties. Influential conglomerates, including those belonging
   to the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), are active
   participants in financial politics. However: local factions are much
   weaker in Malaysia than in Thailand. Finally, the conclusion suggests
   several institutional reforms for these countries to consider.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Open reduction and internal fixation has been recommended as
   the treatment for most unstable injuries of the Lisfranc
   (tarsometatarsal) joint. It has been thought that purely ligamentous
   injuries have a poor outcome despite such surgical management.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients who underwent
   open reduction and screw fixation of a Lisfranc injury in a seven-year
   period. Among ninety-two adults treated for that injury, forty-eight
   patients with forty-eight injuries were followed for an average of
   fifty-two months (range, thirteen to 114 months). Fifteen injuries were
   purely ligamentous, and thirty-three were combined ligamentous and
   osseous. Patient outcome was assessed with use of the American
   Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) midfoot score and the
   long-form Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (MFA) score.
   Results: The average AOFAS midfoot score was 77 points (on a scale of 0
   to 100 points with 100 points indicating an excellent outcome), with
   patients losing points for mild pain, decreased recreational function,
   and orthotic requirements. The average MFA score was 19 points (on a
   scale of 0 to 100 points, with 0 points indicating an excellent
   outcome), with patients losing points because of problems with ``leisure
   activities{''} and difficulties with ``life changes and feelings due to
   the injury.{''} Twelve patients (25 percent) had posttraumatic
   osteoarthritis of the tarsometatarsal joints, and six of them required
   arthrodesis. The major determinant of a good result was anatomical
   reduction (p = 0.05). The subgroup of patients with purely ligamentous
   injury showed a trend toward poorer outcomes despite anatomical
   reduction and screw fixation.
   Conclusions: Our results support the concept that stable anatomical
   reduction of fracture-dislocations of the Lisfranc joint leads to the
   best long-term outcomes as patients so treated have less arthritis as
   well as better AOFAS midfoot scores.}},

Abstract = {{Renal tubular acidosis is a constellation of syndromes arising from
   different derangements of tubular acid transport. Recent advances in the
   biology of urinary acidification have allowed us to discern various
   molecular mechanisms responsible for these syndromes. This report
   relates clinical disorders of acidification to the underlying defective
   mechanisms responsible for them. A clinical classification of these
   disorders is presented, integrating each disorder with the prevailing
   serum potassium concentration. That renal tubular acidosis can be
   associated with low normal, or high serum potassium concentration is now
   explainable by identifying the specific defect in transport causing each
   syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anterior transposition of the inferior oblique muscle is a
   popular treatment for dissociated vertical divergence. It seems that
   this surgical procedure may alter the palpebral fissure.
   Objectives: To investigate the alteration of the palpebral fissure with
   inferior oblique muscle anterior transposition when it is performed as
   the sole operative procedure and to report the cases of patients who
   developed noticeable upper eyelid retraction after inferior oblique
   muscle anterior transposition preceded by large superior rectus muscle
   recessions.
   Methods: The change in the height of the palpebral fissure surgery was
   evaluated from photographs by 2 masked observers in 3 groups of
   patients. The control, group underwent inferior oblique muscle recession
   without transposition. The second group (or the insertion study group)
   underwent transposition of the inferior oblique muscle that was level
   with the inferior rectus muscle insertion. The third group (or the 2-mm
   study group) had the inferior oblique muscle placed 2 mm anterior to the
   inferior rectus muscle insertion. Also, the insertion study and the
   control groups were evaluated after surgery for bulging and elevation of
   the lower eyelid on upgaze.
   Results: The narrowing of the palpebral fissure after surgery
   (mean+/-SD) was -0.14+/-0.4 mm in the 16 patients in the control group,
   -1.2+/-0.9 mm in the 14 patient in the insertion study group, and
   -2.1+/-0.5 mm in the 6 patients in the 2-mm study group. The differences
   were statistically significant between the control and the insertion
   study groups (P=.001, t test) and between the control and the 2-mm study
   groups (P<.001, t test). One of the 16 control patients and 10 of the 14
   insertion study patients showed bulging of the lower eyelid on upgaze
   after surgery. This difference was statistically significant (P<.001,
   Fisher exact test). In addition, 3 patients were seen who developed
   marked upper eyelid retraction when anterior transposition of the
   inferior oblique muscles followed previous large superior rectus muscle
   recessions.
   Conclusions: Anterior transposition of the inferior oblique muscle
   causes significant narrowing of the palpebral fissure as a sole
   procedure. When preceded by large superior rectus muscle recessions, it
   can cause upper eyelid retraction.}},

Abstract = {{A practical energy source which does not release carbon dioxide is
   needed in order to protect the environment the earth. One proposed
   solution is use of a cassette type nuclear reactor for supplying energy
   for air conditioning, heating, and hot water in an office building. This
   paper clarifies the essential points for a compact reactor designed to
   be installed in the basement of a building, and establishes the concept
   of the nuclear reactor. The essential points are as follows
   (1) Construction of the system in a factory and transportation to the
   installation site by trailer.
   (2) Passive safety characteristics which do not require operation of an
   external electrical power source.
   (3) Safety characteristics for seismic activity or lire, for buildings
   which do not require additional earthquake or fire-resistant design.
   (4) Long term remote operation of the compact reactor.
   The concept of the district-heating reactor MR-1G was discussed and
   analyzed, and it was proven that the MR-1G satisfies the essential
   points of the conceptual design requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Numerous surveys carried out in India report the high
   prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Such studies have not included the
   population of Kerala. We estimated the prevalence of type 2 diabetes
   mellitus in Neyyattinkara taluk, Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala
   state.
   Methods. All panchayat wards in the taluk were grouped into urban,
   highland, midland or coastal, and one ward from each stratum was
   randomly selected for the study. All households were listed and adults,
   20 years or older, screened for high ( > 110 mg/dl) random blood sugar
   (RBS) by a glucometer test. Those with high RES were reassessed by a
   fasting oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), consisting of initial
   examination of venous blood for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values,
   administration of 75 g of glucose dissolved in distilled water, and
   examination of venous blood for postprandial plasma glucose (PPPG)
   exactly 2 hours after the administration of glucose. Diabetes was
   diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria as either
   FPG > 139 mg/dl, or PPPG > 199 mg/ di, or both. Impaired glucose
   tolerance (IGT) was diagnosed if PPPG was 140-199 mg/dl.
   Results. Out of 4988 eligible subjects, 3899 were available for the
   study, a response rate of 78.2\%. Response was highest in the highland
   area (86.2\%), and lowest in the coastal area (73.6\%). The overall
   crude prevalence rate of type 2 diabetes was 5.9\%. It was highest in
   the urban (12.4\%), followed by midland (8.1\%), highland (5.8\%), and
   coastal (2.5\%) regions. Ageing was associated with greater prevalence
   of type 2 diabetes in all regions and both sexes. Women showed a higher
   prevalence in the highland and coastal areas and men in the urban and
   midland areas. When compared to a population with standard age structure
   suggested by the World Health Organization for international
   comparisons, prevalence in the age group 30-64 years was found to be
   16.9\% in the urban, 10.1\% in the midland, 6.8\% in the highland and
   3.6\% in the coastal regions, respectively. Overall age-adjusted
   prevalence of type 2 diabetes in 30-64-year-olds in Neyyattinkara was
   9.2\% among men, 7.4\% among women, and 8.2\% for all persons. There was
   not much difference in prevalence if the American Diabetes Association
   criteria for diagnosis were used. The prevalence of impaired glucose
   tolerance was fairly low in this population. Out of 229 diabetics in the
   sample, 175 (76.5\%) were already diagnosed and under treatment, while
   our survey identified 54 new diabetics (23.5\%).
   Conclusion. Though prevalence of type 2 diabetes is high in this
   population, the detection rate is also high. However, impaired fasting
   glucose and impaired glucose tolerance are low. The reasons for this
   need to be elucidated.}},

   dehydrogenase by affinity labelling and site-directed mutagenesis}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{267}},
Number = {{22}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The 2',3'-dialdehyde derivative of ADP (oADP) has been shown to be an
   affinity label for the NAD(+) binding site of recombinant Candida
   boidinii formate dehydrogenase (FDH). Inactivation of FDH by oADP at pH
   7.6 followed biphasic pseudo first-order saturation kinetics. The rate
   of inactivation exhibited a nonlinear dependence on the concentration of
   oADP, which can be described by reversible binding of reagent to the
   enzyme (K-d = 0.46 mm for the fast phase, 0.45 mm for the slow phase)
   prior to the irreversible reaction, with maximum rate constants of 0.012
   and 0.007 min(-1) for the fast and slow phases, respectively.
   Inactivation of formate dehydrogenase by oADP resulted in the formation
   of an enzyme-oADP product, a process that was reversed after dialysis or
   after treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol (> 90\% reactivation). The
   reactivation of the enzyme by 2-mercaptoethanol was prevented if the
   enzyme-oADP complex was previously reduced by NaBH4, suggesting that the
   reaction product was a stable Schiff's base. Protection from
   inactivation was afforded by nucleotides (NAD(+), NADH and ADP)
   demonstrating the specificity of the reaction. When the enzyme was
   completely inactivated, approximately 1 mol of {[}C-14]oADP per mol of
   subunit was incorporated. Cleavage of {[}C-14]oADP-modified enzyme with
   trypsin and subsequent separation of peptides by RP-HPLC gave only one
   radioactive peak. Amino-acid sequencing of the radioactive tryptic
   peptide revealed the target site of oADP reaction to be Lys360. These
   results indicate that oADP inactivates FDH by specific reaction at the
   nucleotide binding site, with negative cooperativity between subunits
   accounting for the appearance of two phases of inactivation. Molecular
   modelling studies were used to create a model of C. boidinii FDH, based
   on the known structure of the Pseudomonas enzyme, using the modeller 4
   program. The model confirmed that Lys360 is positioned at the
   NAD(+)-binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis was used in dissecting
   the structure and functional role of Lys360. The mutant Lys360 --> Ala
   enzyme exhibited unchanged k(cat) and K-m values for formate but showed
   reduced affinity for NAD(+). The molecular model was used to help
   interpret these biochemical data concerning the Lys360 --> Ala enzyme.
   The data are discussed in terms of engineering coenzyme specificity.}},

Abstract = {{Two human Pavlovian SCR conditioning experiments are reported,
   investigating CS-coding in negative patterning (RTP). In Experiment 1,
   NP was run with two pairs of letter stimuli (C, N, and M, J), reinforced
   by shock when alone but not in compound. Controls with the same
   paired-unpaired sequence saw two additional nonreinforced letters (X and
   H) instead of compounds. The NP group learned the element-compound
   differentiation, but the controls did not discriminate reinforced from
   nonreinforced letters. The availability of an abstract rule (such as
   stimulus number) for distinguishing between reinforced and nonreinforced
   CSs led to discrimination in NP. but its unavailability resulted in no
   discrimination in the controls. In Experiment 2, NP was run with one
   pair of letters (reinforced as elements but not in compound). A control
   group had the same paired-unpaired sequence, but their compound
   contained two different letters from the reinforced ones. The NP
   discrimination was learned, but the controls failed to differentiate the
   reinforced elements from the nonreinforced compound. It was concluded
   that the NP discrimination was not based on the number of reinforced and
   nonreinforced stimuli, because this dimension was available to both
   groups in Experiment 2. The abstract dimension of separate versus
   together, on the other hand, was available only in NP, suggesting that
   it is the SINE QUA NON for the acquisition of the kind of NP
   discriminations we have been studying. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Aims-To analyse the histopathology of ``deep retinal vascular anomalous
   complex{''} or ``chorioretinal anastomosis{''}.
   Methods-Six patients with a deep retinal vascular anomalous complex (age
   range 66-88 years) had fundus photography and fluorescein angiography
   not more than 14 days before foveal translocation surgery. Four patients
   were also documented with indocyanine green angiography. The surgical
   specimens were serially sectioned and stained in a stepped fashion with
   Masson trichrome, periodic acid Schiff, and phosphotungstic acid
   haematoxylin, a histochemical stain for fibrin.
   Results-A subretinal fibrovascular membrane was surrounded by a rim
   consisting of diffuse drusen (basal laminar deposits), retinal pigment
   epithelium, and amorphous, fibrinous material interspersed with remains
   of outer segments in all specimens. In two specimens vascular structures
   were identified that left the specimen towards the retina. Amorphous
   material with the remains of outer segments was not found on the retinal
   side of the fibrovascular tissue itself but in four specimens a small
   neuroretinal portion (outer nuclear layer) was adherent to the complex.
   In three specimens a thin fibrocellular membrane was seen at the
   choroidal side of the diffuse drusen.
   Conclusion-Deep retinal vascular anomalous complex represents
   histologically neovascularisation growing out of the neuroretina, into
   the subretinal space, which mimics choroidal neovascularisation. The
   term therefore appears rightly chosen.}},

Volume = {{104}},

Abstract = {{The central part of the Fennoscandian Shield in Finland is composed of
   the Palaeoproterozoic Svecofennian domain and the Archaean Karelian
   craton with a Palaeoproterozoic allochthonous and autochthonous cover. A
   cryptic suture separating these areas and another tentative suture
   dividing the Svecofennian into central and southern parts have been
   proposed. The chemical composition of sedimentary rocks (N = 300) within
   the study area, including the effects of palaeoweathering, hydraulic
   sorting, depositional environment and post-depositional processes, have
   been studied in order to delineate sediment source components. The main
   proposed source components for the Archaean sedimentary rocks are
   weathered 3.0-3.2 Ga greenstone + granite +/- TTG and local 2.7 Ca
   sources. Autochthonous 2.2-1.9 Ga cover rocks were mainly derived from a
   mixture of chemically weathered palaeosol (2.2-235 Ca), sedimentary
   rocks derived from the palaeosol, and mafic dykes and plateau volcanics
   (mainly 2.2-2.1 Ga) although in places locally derived non-weathered
   Archaean sources dominated. Archaean crust and 2.0-1.92 low-K bimodal
   rocks from a primitive island are are the proposed source for the
   allochthonous Western Kaleva cover rocks. These formed in a subsiding
   foredeep during initial collision from orogenic detritus in the same
   oblique collision zone. The central Svecofennian sedimentary rocks can
   be divided into local are-derived rocks (less than or equal to 1.89 Ga)
   and older (greater than or equal to 1.91 Ca) rocks from a mixture of
   Western Kaleva sources and a 1.91-2.0 Ca mature island arc/active
   continental margin source. Rifting followed by increased subsidence
   during initial collision in the NE and subsequent are reversal caused
   rapid erosion from the mountain belt, exposing diverse source
   compositions as seen in the large variation of Th/Sc (2-0.5), and
   deposition into an oblique hinterland basin further developing into a
   subduction related foredeep. Mature greywackes from the southern
   Svecofennian in the study area resemble passive margin sediments with a
   source dominated by inferred alkaline-affinity complexes and Archaean
   rocks. Less mature rocks also occur and had sources dominated either by
   island arc/active continental margin rocks or local picritic rocks. In
   the sedimentary record the Archaean-Proterozoic transition up to 2.1 Ga
   was dominated by input of mainly mafic plateau-type volcanic
   contribution to the Archaean detritus. Palaeoproterozoic sediments
   having a crustal component (less than or equal to 2.1 Ga) show higher
   Th/Sc, Th/Cr, and lower Sm/Nd and Eu/Eu{*} relative to the Archaean
   rocks but locally low Th/Cr ratios complicate the situation. Ba
   depletion relative to K, Rb and Th is a characteristic feature of the
   sedimentary rocks of the central Fennoscandian Shield indicating high
   amounts of Ba lost from the elastic record during 2.3-1.9 Ga and further
   recycled back to the mantle forming a subduction component and an
   enriched mantle component. Ba depletion seems to have been especially
   characteristic of chemical weathering during 2.35-2.2 Ga under CO2-rich
   and low-O-2 atmosphere. Whether this strong Ba depletion is
   characteristic of the Archaean-Proterozoic transition and quiet
   supercontinent stages in general remains to be determined. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The authors had previously mapped a new locus-DFNA17, for nonsyndromic
   hereditary hearing impairment-to chromosome 22q12.2-q13.3. DFNA17 spans
   a 17- to 23-cM region, and MYH9, a nonmuscle-myosin heavy-chain gene, is
   located within the linked region. Because of the importance of myosins
   in hearing, MYH9 was tested as a candidate gene for DFNA17. Expression
   of MYH9 in the rat cochlea was confirmed using reverse transcriptase-PCR
   and immunohistochemistry. MYH9 was immunolocalized in the organ of
   Corti, the subcentral region of the spiral ligament, and the Reissner
   membrane. Sequence analysis of MYH9 in a family with DFNA17 identified,
   at nucleotide 2114, a G-->A transposition that cosegregated with the
   inherited autosomal dominant hearing impairment. This missense mutation
   changes codon 705 from an invariant arginine (R) to histidine (H),
   R705H, within a highly conserved SH1 linker region. Previous studies
   have shown that modification of amino acid residues within the SH1 helix
   causes dysfunction of the ATPase activity of the motor domain in myosin
   II. Both the precise role of MYH9 in the cochlea and the mechanism by
   which the R705H mutation leads to the DFNA17 phenotype (progressive
   hearing impairment and cochleosaccular degeneration) remain to be
   elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{A one-meter long column packed with silica gel is used to separate light
   hydrocarbons. The silica gel has been modified with several kinds of gas
   chromatography stationary phases. Among these, PEG 2000 shows fairly
   good effect when using 80-100 meshes silica gel for the separation of
   mixture of methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propylene and
   n-, i-butane. The different behavior of silica gel between batch to
   batch is also found. When silica gel is coated with a small amount of
   Al2O3 prepared with sol-gel method, better resolution has been observed
   on a 2-meter column compared with the non-modified silica gel.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated a group of young elite cyclists at the age of
   19-20 years. The cardiac characteristics, left ventricular function and
   structure, after long-term and high intensity endurance training, were
   examined by echocardiography during resting conditions. In comparison
   with an age-matched control group, the elite cyclists had significantly
   lower systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and total body fat and a
   significantly higher physical fitness. Left ventricular mass, left
   ventricular mass indexed for differences in body size, and both systolic
   and diastolic dimensions of the left ventricle were increased
   significantly in the elite cyclist soup. No significant difference was
   found in left ventricular function. Left ventricular diastolic function
   was examined (E/A-ratio, E = early passive, A= late active, atriale
   induced transmitral diastolic flow) and showed no significant difference
   between the two groups in spite of the structural changes observed in
   the left ventricular structure. We conclude that structural but not
   functional cardiac changes can be observed in elite cyclists when

Abstract = {{A large collection of bacterial strains, immunotrapped from soil and
   from the wheat rhizoplane, was subjected to polyphasic taxonomy by
   examining various pheno- and genotypic parameters. Strains were grouped
   on (inter) repetitive extragenic palindromic DNA (REP) PCR profiles at
   the intraspecies level, Pheno- and genotypic characters were assessed
   for representatives from 13 different REP groups. Strains of nine REP
   groups constituting two physiological BIOLOG clusters fell in the
   coherent DNA-DNA reassociation group of Ochrobactrum anthropi. Strains
   of two REP groups constituting a separate BIOLOG cluster fell in the
   coherent DNA-DNA reassociation group of Ochrobactrum intermedium.
   Additional phenotypic characters differentiating O. anthropi and O.
   intermedium were found. REP group K strains constituted a different
   BIOLOG cluster, a separate DNA-DNA reassociation group and a distinct
   phylogenetic lineage in 16S rDNA homology analysis, indicating that REP
   group K strains represent a new species. Diagnostic phenotypic
   characters were found. Closest relatives were Ochrobactrum species. The
   name Ochrobactrum grignonense sp. nov. is proposed (type strain OgA9a(T)
   = LMG 18954(T) = DSM 13338(T)). REP group J strains again constituted a
   different BIOLOG cluster, a separate DNA-DNA reassociation group and
   showed, as a biological particularity, a strict preference for the
   rhizoplane as habitat. Diagnostic phenotypic characters were found. This
   indicated that REP group J strains represent a further new species,
   although phylogenetic analyses using 16S rDNA homology were not able to
   separate the cluster of REP group J sequences significantly from 16S
   rDNA sequences of Ochrobactrum anthropi. The name Ochrobactrum tritici
   sp. nov. is proposed (type strain SCII24(T) = LMG 18957(T) = DSM
   13340(T)).}},

Title = {{Is the circumferential tensile modulus within a human medial meniscus
   affected by the test sample location and cross-sectional area?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the material properties of the human menisci is paramount to
   understanding their biomechanical functions within the knee. One
   important intrinsic material property governing the biomechanical
   functions of the meniscus is the circumferential tensile modulus. The
   purpose of this study was to determine if the circumferential tensile
   modulus of the human medial meniscus depends on the location and
   thickness of the sample tested. The following three hypotheses were
   tested: (a) the circumferential location (anterior, central, and
   posterior) does not significantly affect the tensile modulus, (b) the
   radial location (inner to outer) significantly affects the tensile
   modulus, and (c) the thickness (cross-sectional area) significantly
   affects the tensile modulus. Test samples, whose length was oriented in
   parallel with the circumferential collagen fibers, were collected from
   different circumferential and radial locations throughout 30 human
   medial menisci. Samples of three different thicknesses (0.5, 1.5, and
   3.0 mm) were taken from three equal groups of 10 menisci (i.e., one
   thickness per group). The circumferential tensile modulus was measured
   under quasi-static loading. Statistical analysis showed no significant
   effect of the circumferential or radial location of the sample on the
   circumferential tensile modulus. This indicates that an overall
   circumferential tensile modulus may be calculated for the human medial
   meniscus by averaging the values determined at the various locations.
   However, the thickness of the test sample had a significant effect on
   the measured circumferential tensile modulus; the modulus varied
   inversely with the thickness. Thus, moduli determined from test samples
   that are too small in cross-sectional area overestimate the effective
   modulus of the tissue on the whole, and the cross-sectional area of the
   sample must be considered when determining a representative
   circumferential tensile modulus for the medial meniscus in a human knee.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent dramatic rise in fluconazole use, there has been an
   increase in Candida species resistant to that agent. This has led to the
   clinical development of newer triazoles such as voriconazole that have
   greater potency and a broader spectrum of activity. We therefore
   hypothesized that fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans and Candida
   krusei would be susceptible to voriconazole. Susceptibility testing was
   performed on 205 isolates of C. albicans collected from 1984 to 1995,
   and on C. albicans and C. krusei that were identified as fluconazole
   resistant since 1995. The anti fungal agents used were amphotericin B,
   5-flucytosine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole and voriconazole.
   Three C. albicans and 26 C. krusei isolates had a minimum inhibitory
   concentration (MIC) greater than or equal to 20 mg/l and were defined as
   fluconazole resistant. Of these, 28 isolates were susceptible to less
   than or equal to 2.5 mg/l voriconazole, with a mean MIC of 0.78 mg/l.
   The mean amphotericin B MIC for these same strains was 0.98 mg/l. Only
   one isolate of C. krusei was relatively resistant to voriconazole with a
   MIC of 5 mg/l. Of these 29 isolates, there were ten
   amphotericin-resistant strains of C. krusei (MIC > 2 mg/l) but all were
   susceptible to less than or equal to 2.5 mg/l voriconazole. The higher
   potency of voriconazole may be useful in the treatment of fluconazole-
   and amphotericin-resistant C. albicans and C. krusei. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Exogenous administration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha has been shown
   to both enhance and attenuate cutaneous healing in a dose-dependent
   manner. We examined the effects of tumor necrosis factor inhibition in
   the healing wound by both systemic and local administration of tumor
   necrosis factor-binding protein. Male Balb/C mice underwent dorsal skin
   incision with subcutaneous implantation of 20 mg polyvinyl alcohol
   sponges (4 per animal). In Experiment I, one group (n = 20) received
   intraperitoneal injections of tumor necrosis factor-binding protein (3
   mg/kg) at the time of wounding, while another group (n = 20) received
   saline. Four animals from each group were euthanized on days 1.3, 5, 7,
   and 14 postwounding. In Experiment II, one group (n = 10) received an
   intraperitoneal injection of tumor necrosis factor-binding protein (3
   mg/kg) at the time of wounding and every third day thereafter. Another
   group (n = 10) received an intraperitoneal injection of saline at the
   time of wounding and every third day thereafter. In Experiment III, one
   group received a single intraperitoneal injection of tumor necrosis
   factor-binding protein (3 mg/kg) at the time of wounding (n = 7), or on
   postwounding day 4 (n = 7). or day 7 (n = 7). Another group received
   saline injections at the time of wounding (n = 7), or on postwounding
   days 4 or 7 (n = 7, respectively). All animals in Experiments II and III
   were killed at postwounding day 14. Wound breaking strengths were
   assessed using a tensiometer. Wound fluid collected from the implanted
   sponges was assayed for tumor necrosis factor-ex and tumor necrosis
   factor-binding protein levels using a biological assay and enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay, respectively. Collagen gene expression in sponge
   granulomata was assessed by Northern analysis. Collagen deposition in
   sponges was quantified by measuring hydroxyproline content. Wounds were
   significantly weaker in the animals that received repeated injections of
   tumor necrosis factor-binding protein with a mean wound breaking
   strength of 93.1 g vs. 186.6 g in controls (p < 0.05). Wound breaking
   strength in groups that received a single injection of tumor necrosis
   factor-binding protein on either day 0, 4, or 7 postwounding were no
   different than their respective controls, There was no difference in the
   mean hydroxyproline content of sponges between any of the tumor necrosis
   factor-binding protein groups and their respective controls. Northern
   analysis for collagen I and III expression also revealed no differences.
   These data indicate that continued systemic administration of tumor
   necrosis factor-binding protein resulted in significantly weaker wounds
   with no corresponding differences in wound collagen content, and
   collagen gene expression. This suggests that tumor necrosis
   factor-<alpha> inhibition throughout healing leads to a qualitatively
   impaired wound without a quantitative alteration in collagen deposition.}},

Abstract = {{The human Kell blood group system is important in transfusion medicine,
   since Kell is a polymorphic protein and some of its antigens can cause
   severe reactions if mismatched blood is transfused, while maternal
   alloimmunization may lead to fetal and neonatal anemia. In humans, Kell
   is an M-r 93,000 type II membrane glycoprotein with
   endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity that is linked by a single
   disulfide bond to another protein, XK, that spans the membrane ten
   times. An absence of XK leads to clinical symptoms termed the McLeod
   syndrome. We determined the cDNA sequence of the mouse Kell homologue,
   the organization of the gene, expression of the protein and its
   enzymatic function on red cells. Comparison of human and mouse Kell cDNA
   showed 80\% nucleotide and 74\% amino acid sequence identity. Notable
   differences are that the mouse Kell protein has eight probable N-linked
   carbohydrate side chains, compared to five for human Kell, and that the
   mouse homologue has one more extracellular cysteine than human Kell
   protein. The mouse Kell gene (Kel), like its human counterpart, is
   similarly organized into 19 exons. Kel was located to proximal
   Chromosome 6. Northern blot analysis showed high expression in spleen
   and weaker levels in testis and heart. Western blot analysis of red cell
   membrane proteins demonstrated that mouse Kell glycoprotein has an
   apparent M-r of 110,000 and, on removal of N-linked sugars, 80,000. As
   in human red cells, Kell is disulfide-linked to XK and mouse red cells
   have endothelin-3-converting enzyme activity.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vaginal
   delivery on the pelvic floor by serial measurement of pudendal nerve
   terminal motor latency, perineal descent, and anal pressure before and
   after delivery. METHODS: Eighty pregnant females (40 primigravidae, 40
   multigravidae) expecting vaginal delivery were prospectively evaluated.
   Measurements of pudendal nerve terminal motor latency, perineometry, and
   manometry were performed two to three months before delivery and two to
   three days, two months, and six months after delivery. RESULTS: Before
   delivery, pudendal nerve terminal motor latency showed no significant
   difference between primigravidae and multigravidae. Perineal plane at
   straining was lower and the descent was larger in multigravidae than
   primigravidae. Anal squeeze pressure was also lower in multigravidae
   than primigravidae. Two to three days after delivery, regardless of the
   group, pudendal nerve terminal motor latency was prolonged, perineal
   plane at straining became lower, the descent increased, and anal squeeze
   pressure decreased. Two months after delivery, pudendal nerve terminal
   motor latency recovered to the level before delivery. Perineal descent
   also recovered somewhat, but remained increased after six months had
   passed. In primiparae, perineal plane at straining remained lower after
   six months had passed. However, in multiparae the plane remained lower
   only for two months and recovered by six months postpartum. Anal squeeze
   pressure also showed a moderate recovery, but still remained
   significantly lower at six months postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: Pudendal
   nerve damage and functional impairment in the pelvic floor sphincter
   musculature occurs during vaginal delivery. Pudendal nerve terminal
   motor latency recovers after two months, whereas functional disturbance
   in the pelvic floor persists at least until six months.}},

Abstract = {{Vitamin C, including ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid, is one of
   the most important nutritional quality factors in many horticultural
   crops and has many biological activities in the human body. The content
   of vitamin C in fruits and vegetables can be influenced by various
   factors such as genotypic differences, preharvest climatic conditions
   and cultural practices, maturity and harvesting methods, and postharvest
   handling procedures. The higher the intensity of light during the
   growing season, the greater is vitamin C content in plant tissues.
   Nitrogen fertilizers at high rates tend to decrease the vitamin C
   content in many fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C content of many crops
   can be increased with less frequent irrigation. Temperature management
   after harvest is the most important factor to maintain vitamin C of
   fruits and vegetables; losses are accelerated at higher temperatures and
   with longer storage durations. However, some chilling sensitive crops
   show more losses in vitamin C at lower temperatures. Conditions
   favorable to water loss after harvest result in a rapid loss of vitamin
   C especially in leafy vegetables. The retention of vitamin C is lowered
   by bruising, and other mechanical injuries, and by excessive trimming.
   Irradiation at low doses (1 kGy or lower) has no significant effects on
   vitamin C content of fruits and vegetables. The loss of vitamin C after
   harvest can be reduced by storing fruits and vegetables in reduced O-2
   and/or up to 10\% CO2 atmospheres; higher CO2, levels can accelerate
   vitamin C loss. Vitamin C of produce is also subject to degradation
   during processing and cooking. Electromagnetic energy seems to have
   advantages over conventional heating by reduction of process times,
   energy, and water usage. Blanching reduces the vitamin C content during
   processing, but limits further decreases during the frozen-storage of
   horticultural products. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, to improve the plasma uniformity in addition to the
   plasma density of an inductively coupled plasma source, both permanent
   magnets and a Helmholtz type axial electromagnet were installed to a
   conventional planar inductively coupled plasma source and the effects of
   various magnet combinations on the polysilicon etch rates and etch
   uniformities were studied. The application of weak axial electromagnetic
   held to a planar inductively coupled plasma showed increased plasma
   densities, therefore, increased polysilicon etch rates compared with
   those by conventional inductively coupled plasmas. However, the
   application of the electromagnetic field degraded the etch uniformity.
   By using both an optimized permanent magnets and the axial electromagnet
   around the chamber wall, we found the improvement of polysilicon etch
   uniformity in addition to the increase of polysilicon etch rate due to
   the combination of the better features of both magnets. Among the
   permanent magnet configurations used with axial electromagnetic field in
   this experiment, a permanent magnet configuration with two poles/site
   showed the polysilicon etch uniformity at approximately 3.0\% up to 15 G
   of axial electromagnetic field. The use of the magnetized inductively
   coupled plasma also decreased the average ion energy to the wall from 20
   to 15 eV, therefore, decreased the possible contamination of the
   substrate caused by sputtering of the chamber wall. (C) 2000 Published

Abstract = {{In this paper, a non-linear control scheme for the TCSC
   (thyristor-controlled series compensator) to dampen power oscillations
   and to improve the transient stability of power systems is presented.
   Based on an one-machine-infinite-bus system, a non-linear mathematical
   model is established which is proven as an affine non-linear system.
   With the help of the feedback linearization technique, the affine
   non-linear model is exactly transferred to a linear model, and then the
   control scheme is designed for the TCSC based on the global
   linearization, where the input signal uses local measurements only. The
   effectiveness and robustness of the proposed non-linear control scheme
   are demonstrated with one-machine test system, where the TCSC modeling
   and power system simulations are performed by using the program system
   NETOMAC. In comparison with a conventional control scheme, significant
   improvements of dynamical performance in the test power system are
   achieved by the proposed non-linear control strategy for the TCSC.}},

Abstract = {{Recently the role of various cytokines in the pathogenesis of chronic
   rhinosinusitis has come under investigation. Various studies have
   reported increased levels of interleukin-3, interleukin-4,
   interleukin-5, interleukin-13, and granulocyte macrophage-colony
   stimulating factor in the sinonasal mucosa of patients with chronic
   rhinosinusitis. The present study investigated the levels of
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta),
   interleukin-5 (IL-5), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and
   turner necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), in the sinonasal mucosa of
   patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, and evaluated the response of
   these cytokines to oral corticosteroids. Chronic rhinosinusitis subjects
   (n = 15) and control subjects (n = 9) underwent ent nasal endoscopy and
   biopsy of the sinonasal mucosa. Chronic rhinosinusitis subjects were
   subsequently tr treated with a 10-day tapering dose of prednisone
   followed by a second sinonasal endoscopic exam and biopsy. Mucosal
   biopsy specimens were immunostained for IL-I beta, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, and
   TNF-a. In chronic rhinosinusitis subjects, mucosal levels of IL-1 beta
   IL,-6 IL-8, and TNF-alpha were significantly elevated when compared with
   control subjects, and levels of IL-5 demonstrated a strong trend toward
   elevation. In posttreatment chronic rhinosinusitis subjects, levels of
   IL-6 were significantly decreased when compared with pretreatment
   levels, and TNF-alpha levels demonstrated a significant trend coward
   reduction. These findings support the hypothesis that the inflammatory
   response in chronic rhinosinusitis is associated with elevated levels of
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, and suggest that oral corticosteroids may
   evert a benefic beneficial effect by significantly reducing the levels
   of IL-6 and TNF-alpha.}},

Abstract = {{Responsiveness of neck nodes to induction chemotherapy often differs
   from that of the primary tumour. We have conducted a retrospective study
   to evaluate the results of treating the neck in a cohort of 350 patients
   with locally advanced (T3-4) head and neck carcinomas treated with
   radiation therapy at the primary location of the tumour after induction
   chemotherapy. One hundred and thirty-nine patients (40\%) did not have
   neck nodes on diagnosis (N0). The treatment of the neck included surgery
   in 65 patients. Neck dissections were carried out before radiotherapy in
   37 patients and after radiotherapy in 28 patients. The frequency of neck
   treatment failure was 24\%. There was a tendency to better neck control
   when treatment included neck dissection, independently of the neck stage
   or response to chemotherapy. This tendency was statistically significant
   in patients with an advanced regional tumour (N2-3) who did not achieve
   a complete regional response after chemotherapy. In a multivariate
   analysis the variables that were related to the regional failure were
   the relapse of the tumour at the primary site, the neck stage (N), the
   type of treatment used in the neck, and the grade of regional response
   after induction chemotherapy. Our results lead us to suggest that after
   induction chemotherapy neck surgery is advisable in all cases with
   advanced regional disease (N2-3), independently of the grade of response
   achieved after induction chemotherapy, and is also advisable in N1
   patients in whom induction chemotherapy does not achieve a complete
   response.}},

Abstract = {{Wound dehiscence with exposure of the lower anastomosis is a limb- and
   life-threatening complication of femorodistal bypass. Plastic surgeons
   consider pedicle flaps to be unreliable in patients with arterial
   disease. Despite this opinion, we attempted to treat exposure
   complications using pedicle muscle flaps after careful study of
   vascularization on control angiography. The purpose of this report is to
   describe our results. From 1994 to 1997, infection-related exposure of
   the distal anastomosis was observed in three men and two women with a
   mean age of 76 years (range, 66 to 89 years). The exposed anastomosis
   was located on the dorsalis pedis artery in three cases, the anterior
   tibial artery in the upper third of the leg in one, and the anterior
   tibial artery in the lower third of the leg in one. The bypass material
   was a vein graft in three cases and a cuffed PTFE prosthesis in two
   cases. Bacteriological examination identified Staphylococcus aureus in
   three cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one case, and both in one case.
   Two patients were diabetics and one was undergoing corticosteroid
   treatment. The anastomosis was covered with a pedicle muscle flap
   fashioned from the extensor digitorum in four cases and the lateral head
   of the gastrocnemius in one case. Our results showed that anastomoses on
   the anterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery are at higher risk
   for infection-related exposure but this complication can be treated
   using pedicle muscle flaps. This alternative should be considered before
   bypass removal or amputation.}},

Abstract = {{An entanglement witness (EW) is an operator that allows the detection of

   operators to be optimal, i.e., to detect entangled states in an optimal
   way. We show how to optimize general EW, and then we particularize our
   results to the nondecomposable ones; the latter are those that can
   detect positive partial transpose entangled states (PPTES's). We also
   present a method to systematically construct and optimize this last
   class of operators based on the existence of ``edge{''} PPTES's, i.e.,
   states that violate the range separability criterion {[}Phys. Lett. A
   232, 333 (1997)] in an extreme manner. This method also permits a
   systematic construction of nondecomposable positive maps (PM's). Our
   results lead to a sufficient condition for entanglement in terms of
   nondecomposable EW's and PM's. Finally, we illustrate our results by
   constructing optimal EW acting on H = C-2 x C-4. The corresponding PM's
   constitute examples of PM's with minimal ``qubit{''} domains,

Abstract = {{Herpetofaunal assemblages were surveyed on four different forest types
   in the Big Sandy Creek Unit of the Big Thicket National Preserve in Polk
   County. Texas. The forest types surveyed wan Floodplain Hardwood, Lower
   Slope Hardwood Pine, Upper Slept: Pins Oak and Upland Pine. During 1998
   and 1999, 1866 individual amphibians and reptiles of 40 species ware
   recorded. A Monte. Carlo contingency table analysis demonstrated that
   the four forest types held significantly different herpetofaunal
   assemblages. Sorenson's coefficient of community percentages showed that
   forest types adjacent to one another along a moisture-elevation gradient
   had the most species of herpetofauna in common. Soil texture influences
   vegetation through soil moisture availability, and differences in
   herpetofaunal assemblages seemed to he related to differences in
   moisture availability among forest types. Greater abundance of
   amphibians and snakes was found in the: two more mesic forest types in
   the lower elevations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: It has been shown that paclitaxel (TXL) can strongly enhance
   tumor cells' sensitivity to radiation. We examined whether the
   radiosensitizing effect of paclitaxel can be further enhanced when it is
   delivered systemically as a polymer-drug conjugate that provides
   enhanced tumor uptake and prolonged release of TXL in the turner,
   Methods and Materials: C3Hf/Kam mice bearing 8-mm murine ovarian OCa-1
   tumors were treated with i.v.-injected Poly(L-glutamic acid)-paclitaxel
   (PG-TXL) at an equivalent TXL dose of 80 mg/kg, followed 23 h later by
   single doses of local radiation ranging from 5 to 15 Gy, To determine
   how long the radiopotentiation persisted at extended times after PG-TXL
   administration, mice with OCa-1 tumors were given i.v. PG-TXL and 4. 23,
   48, 72, 120, or 168 h later their tumors were irradiated at a dose of 10
   Gy, Antitumor activity was determined by delay in tumor growth, Cell
   cycle distribution was assayed using how cytometry. Tumor vascular
   volume was estimated using Tc-99 m-labeled red blood cells,
   Results: PG-TXL strongly potentiated the radioresponse of the OCa-1
   tumor. The enhancement factors ranged from 2.79 to 4.28, depending on
   radiation dose, when PG-TXL preceded radiation by 23 h. The enhancement
   factor derived from radiation close-response curves was as high as 5.13.
   The radiosensitizing effect of PG-TXL was also dependent on the interval
   between PG-TXL administration and radiation delivery, with greater
   enhancement been observed when the interval was decreased. The
   percentage of G2/M cells was significantly increased to 21.4\% 38 h
   after PG-TXL but declined to a preinjection level of 14.8\% 72 h after
   PG-TXL. PG-T,YL only moderately increased the tumor vascular volume by
   37\% 24 h after PG-TXL administration,
   Conclusion: PG-TXL markedly potentiated response of OCa-1 tumor to
   radiation. When compared to literature data obtained from the same tumor
   model used here, PG-TXL exhibited stronger radiosensitization effect
   than TXL, Although its action is possibly mediated by arrest of cells in
   G2/M phases of cell cycle and by increased turner blood supply, PG-TXL
   may exert its radiopotentiation activity through increased tumor uptake
   of PC-TILL and sustained release of TXL in the tumor, Our results show
   that conjugation of TXL to a polymer has the potential to further
   enhance its radiosensitizing activity and that clinical trials of PG-TXL
   in combination with radiation is warranted, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential and the feasibility of offshore
   wind energy for Hong Kong. The 1998 wind data taken from an island were
   analysed. The wind resource yields an annual mean wind speed of 6.6 mis
   and mean wind power density of 310 W/m(2). With commercially available
   1.65 MW wind turbines placed on the whole of Hong Kong's territorial
   waters, the maximum electricity generating potential from offshore wind
   is estimated to be 25 TWh which is about 72\% of the total 1998 annual
   electricity consumption. However, potential is significantly reduced if
   other usages of the sea such as shipping are considered. A hypothetical
   offshore wind farm of 1038 MW capacity is then sited on the East-side
   waters. The extreme wind and wave climates, as well as the seasonal
   variation of wind power and demand are examined. The electricity
   generation costs are estimated and compared with the local retail
   tariff. Initial results indicate the wind farm is economically viable
   and technically feasible. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A predictive time domain chatter model is presented for the simulation
   and analysis of chatter in milling processes. The model is developed
   using a predictive milling force model, which represents the action of
   milling cutter by the simultaneous operations of a number of
   single-point cutting tools and predicts the milling forces from the
   fundamental workpiece material properties, tool geometry and cutting
   conditions. The instantaneous undeformed chip thickness is modelled to
   include the dynamic modulations caused by the tool vibrations so that
   the dynamic regeneration effect is taken into account. Runge-Kutta
   method is employed to solve the differential equations governing the
   dynamics of the milling system for accurate solutions. A Windows-based
   simulation system for chatter in milling is developed using the
   predictive model, which predicts chatter vibrations represented by the
   tool-work displacements and cutting force variations against cutter
   revolution in both numerical and graphic formats, from input of tool and
   workpiece material properties, cutter parameters, machine tool
   characteristics and cutting conditions. The system is verified with

Abstract = {{The effect of varying silica source on the nucleation and
   crystallization of TPA-silicalite-1 was investigated. A direct
   experimental method, involving a two-stage varying-temperature
   synthesis, was used to determine the nucleation period for colloidal
   crystals of TPA-silicalite-1 with different silica sources, including
   tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and amorphous silica (Ludox TM and Ludox LS).
   For syntheses performed at 60 degreesC with TEOS as silica source, the
   duration of the nucleation was about 72 h, and a very rapid increase in
   the crystal population occurred during the initial crystallization time.
   However, with the amorphous silica sources (Ludox TM or Ludox LS), the
   duration of the nucleation period was extended to about 120 h, and the
   nucleation profile consisted of a self-accelerating nucleation rate at
   the beginning of the nucleation period. The two-stage synthesis method
   could be used to determine the nucleation profile for the various silica
   sources. However, this technique overestimated the crystal concentration
   at the earliest stage of nucleation with amorphous silica. The use of
   amorphous silica gave rise to a broader crystal size distribution
   compared to that of TEOS. However, it was found that for both TEOS and
   amorphous silica the vast majority of the nucleation occurred during an
   induction period when little or no crystal growth was observed. In
   addition, Raman spectroscopy revealed structural differences between
   Ludox TM and Ludox LS which may account for differences in the
   nucleation processes observed for these two amorphous silicas. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Mixtures of calcium and magnesium hydroxides and calcium
   dihydrogenphosphate in various molar ratios were ground in water with a
   fine grinding machine, which features multiring grinding media.
   Mechanochemical amorphization of the mixtures occurs quickly by
   grinding. The mixtures, after grinding for 5, 20, and 60 min, were then
   subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 573 K for 24 h. The influence of
   Mg/(Mg + Ca) molar ratio on the thermal behavior of the mechanically
   activated powders and the structure of the final products has been
   investigated. The microhomogeneity of Mg, Ca, and P elements on the
   samples is enhanced by the mechanochemical treatment. A shift in the
   X-ray diffraction peaks was observed among the final products with
   different grinding times, presumably due to a partial substitution of
   calcium by magnesium.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive toxicity studies have historically centered on
   post-fertilization events. A thorough assessment of reproductive hazards
   to an organism should include all aspects of its life cycle. Cadmium is
   a teratogenic and carcinogenic heavy metal that occurs naturally in the
   environment but is also released anthropogenically. The effect of
   cadmium administration on oocyte development in Xenopus laevis was
   studied. Adult female Xenopus were injected in the dorsal lymph sac with
   cadmium chloride (CdCl2) at doses of 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 3.0 or 5.0 mg/kg
   every other day for 21 days. Significant adverse effects of Cd on oocyte
   development were observed. The percentage of oocytes at all stages of
   oogenesis was decreased while the population of atretic oocytes
   increased dramatically (P < 0.0001). Numerous oocytes exhibited a
   speckled or mottled appearance and the incidence of completely atretic
   oocyte follicles increased. The observations indicate that Cd has the
   potential to significantly disrupt oogenesis and that examination of
   developing gametes may be a useful parameter for assessing the influence
   of environmental contaminants on reproductive capacity. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Umbilical cord blood can be used as a source of bone marrow
   repopulating cells for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Large
   variations in the frequencies of white blood cells and hematopoietic
   progenitor cells have been found for umbilical cord blood. These
   variations may be due in part to specific circumstances during labor and
   delivery.
   STUDY DESIGN: In this study we analyzed the relationship between stress
   factors occurring during parturition and the frequencies of nucleated
   cells, leukocyte subsets, CD34(+) cells, and hematopoietic progenitor
   cells, as determined in semisolid medium cultures of umbilical cord
   blood.
   RESULTS: We observed that a prolonged first stage of labor resulted in
   increases in the numbers of nucleated cells, granulocytes, CD34(+)
   cells, and hematopoietic progenitor cells in umbilical cord blood.
   Evaluation of parameters that indicate stress of the infant during
   delivery demonstrated higher numbers of nucleated cells, granulocytes,
   CD34(+) cells, and hematopoietic progenitor cells in umbilical cord
   blood from children with lower venous pH.
   CONCLUSION: Longer duration stress during delivery increased the numbers
   of nucleated cells, granulocytes, CD34(+) cells, and hematopoietic
   progenitor cells, possibly by causing mobilization of various cell
   populations by endogenous cytokines. As long as umbilical cord blood
   harvesting does not interfere with the delivery, umbilical cord blood
   collected after stressful deliveries may provide optimal units for
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Study objective: Although the addition of H-2 blockers to H-1
   antagonists has been promoted for use in anaphylaxis, there have been no
   large studies establishing the advantage of this approach in treating
   acute allergic syndromes. In this study we tested the hypothesis that
   combined H-1 and H-2 blockage results in improved outcomes in patients
   treated for acute allergic syndromes compared with treatment with H-1
   blockade alone.
   Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 91
   adult patients with acute allergic syndromes were treated with either 50
   mg of diphenhydramine and saline solution (control group) or with 50 mg
   of diphenhydramine and 50 mg of ranitidine (active group). These
   patients were treated with parenteral administration. Patients were
   recruited from an emergency department at an urban academic medical
   center. The primary endpoints were resolution of urticaria, angioedema,
   or erythema at 2 hours after protocol treatment. Areas of cutaneous
   involvement, heart rates, blood pressures, respiratory findings, and
   symptom scores were also assessed at baseline, 1 hour, and 2 hours.
   Results: There were significantly more patients without urticaria at 2
   hours among the patients in the active group compared with those in the
   control group. Both groups had similar proportions of urticaria at
   baseline. Logistic regression models to predict resolution of urticaria,
   which accounted for baseline urticarial involvement, showed odds ratios
   in favor of the active group treatment. Similar findings were observed
   when the absence of boil 1 urticaria and angioedema was considered as
   the dependent variable. There was not a significant difference between
   the 2 groups with regard to the absence of erythema or angioedema
   (irrespective of the presence of urticaria) at 2 hours. Blood pressure
   and symptoms did not show differences between the 2 groups over time.
   Lower heart rates were observed 1 hour after treatment in the active
   treatment group (mean reduction 10 beats/min) compared with those found
   in the placebo group (mean reduction 6 beats/min).
   Conclusion: These data show that adding H-2 blockers to H-1 antagonists
   results in additional improvement of certain cutaneous outcomes for
   patients presenting with acute allergic syndromes. These findings favor
   the recommendation for using combined H-1 and H-2 antihistamines in
   acute allergic syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Prostaglandin A(2) (PGA(2)), an experimental chemotherapeutic agent,
   causes growth arrest associated with decreased cyclin D1 expression in
   several cancer cell lines. Here, using human non-small-cell lung
   carcinoma H1299 cells, we investigated the mechanisms whereby PGA(2)
   down-regulates cyclin D1 expression. Transcription rates of the cyclin
   D1 gene, studied using a cyclin D1 promoter-luciferase construct and
   nuclear run-on assays, were not affected by PGA(2) treatment. Instead,
   the cyclin D1 mRNA was rendered unstable after exposure to PGA(2). Since
   the stability of labile mRNA is modulated through binding of proteins to
   specific mRNA sequences, we sought to identify protein(s) recognizing
   the cyclin D1 mRNA. In electrophoretic mobility-shift assays using
   radiolabeled RNA probes derived from different regions of cyclin D1
   mRNA,we observed that (i) lysates prepared from PGA(2)-treated cells
   exhibited enhanced protein-cyclin D1 RNA complex formation; (ii) the
   kinetics of complex formation correlated closely,vith that of cyclin D1
   mRNA loss; and (iii) binding occurred within a 390-base cyclin D1 3'
   untranslated region (UTR) (K12). This binding activity could be
   cross-linked, revealing proteins ranging from 30 to 37 kDa. The
   RNA-binding protein AUF1, previously associated with the degradation of
   target mRNAs, bound cyclin D1 mRNA, because anti-AUF1 antibodies were
   capable of supershifting or immunoprecipitating cyclin D1 mRNA protein
   complexes. Finally, insertion of K12 in the 3'UTR of reporter genes
   markedly reduced the expression and half-life of the resulting chimeric
   mRNAs in transfected, PGA(2)-treated cells. Our data demonstrate that
   PGA(2) down-regulates cyclin D1 expression by decreasing cyclin D1 mRNA
   stability and implicates a 390-base element in the 3'UTR in this
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To assess the effects of contrast material on the viability
   of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) cells and the ability of such cells
   to attach to a recipient bed, because seeding of TCC into the upper
   urinary tract is a possibility during retrograde pyelography or
   percutaneous procedures.
   Methods. Primary cultures of TCC cells were established and placed in
   either quarter, half, or full-strength contrast for 10 minutes or
   one-quarter strength contrast for 10, 30, and 60 minutes. Cells were
   then removed from the contrast agent, resuspended in urothelium-specific
   media, and incubated for 5 days, after which the cells were counted.
   Results. A pronounced decrease in cell viability was observed with
   increasing exposure time and contrast material concentration. Cells
   incubated for 10, 30, and 60 minutes with contrast yielded an average of
   79\%, 60\%, and 12\% of the control group growth, respectively (P
   <0.001). Likewise, plates incubated with quarter, half, and
   full-strength contrast yielded 79\%, 27\%, and 10\% of the control group
   growth, respectively (P <0.001). The difference in the response of
   low-grade superficial and high-grade invasive bladder tumors was not
   statistically significant.
   Conclusions. TCC cells that have been exposed to dilute contrast
   material for a short period are able to attach and grow on an adequate
   recipient bed. However, increasing the contrast concentration and/or the
   exposure time appears to decrease the viability and adherence of the TCC
   cells. UROLOGY 56: 876-879, 2000. (C) 2000, Elsevier Science Inc.}},

   adaptations determine the ability of species to establish populations in
   different environments. By systematically documenting differences in the
   way these factors vary as sediment organic concentration varies for both
   opportunistic and equilibrium species, we can better understand the
   mechanisms underlying this correlation between sediment organic
   concentration and species distributions. I-lt re, we present the results
   of experiments examining the interactions among food concentration,
   Feeding rate, growth rate, and reproductive output (measured as egg
   number and size) for the equilibrium species Abarenicola pacifica. A.
   pacifica is a large, long-lived, iteroparous, sub-surface
   deposit-feeding polychaete. Individual worms were reared throughout most
   of one generation in sediments differing only in the concentration of
   organic matter. Juveniles ( < 20 mg AFDW) had higher feeding rates and
   growth rates in sediments of higher organic concentration throughout the
   range tested. These results are consistent with the predictions from
   optimal fr,raging theory. Rs worms grew, however, these patterns
   changed. Once worms reached a mean body size of <similar to>50 mg AFDW,
   feeding rate was greater on sediments: of lower organic concentration
   (although it rook worms in the sediments with lower organic
   concentration longer to reach this size). Differences in growth rates
   among treatments decreased as worms grew. For worms > 100 mg AFDW,
   growth rates were uniformly low (approximate to 1\%/day) on all
   sediments, but the early advantage obtained by worms in the high organic
   treatments resulted in much greater body sizes after 200 days. Worms had
   higher tissue triacylglyceride concentrations and produced mole eggs
   (independent of worm size) as sediment organic concentration increased.
   We conclude that A. pacifica alters its feeding rate in response to
   variations in food resources in such a way as to maximize its energy
   intake and thereby maximize fitness. Future studies should investigate
   whether opportunistic species las well as other equilibrium species)
   also have this ability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Current mammalian embryo cryopreservation protocols typically employ an
   interrupted slow freezing (ISF) procedure. In general, ISF consists of
   initial slow cooling, which raises the extracellular solute
   concentration, and results in cell dehydration. Permeating
   cryoprotective agents (CPAs), such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), are
   typically included in the medium to protect the cells against high
   solute concentrations. As this ISF procedure continues, slow cooling is
   terminated at an intermediate temperature (T-p), followed by plunging
   into liquid nitrogen (LN2). If the slow cooling step allowed a critical
   concentration ({[}CPA](c)) of CPA to be reached within the cell, the CPA
   will interact with the remaining intracellular water during rapid
   cooling, resulting in the majority of the intracellular solution
   becoming vitrified and preventing damaging intracellular ice formation
   (IIF). This study presents a theoretical model to develop efficient ISF
   procedures, on the basis of previously developed data for the rat
   zygote, The model was used to select values of initial CPA
   concentrations and slow cooling rates (from initial estimated ranges of
   0 to 4 molal DMSO and 0 to 2.5 degreesC/min cooling rates) that would
   allow the intracellular solute concentration to exceed the critical
   concentration. The optimal combination was then determined from this
   range based on minimizing the duration of slow cooling.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudohypoparathyroidism type IB (PHPIB) is characterized by renal
   resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the absence of other
   endocrine or physical abnormalities. Familial PHPIB has been mapped to
   20q13, near GNAS1, which encodes G(s)alpha, the G protein alpha -subunit
   required for receptor-stimulated cAMP generation. However, G(s)alpha
   function is normal in blood cells from PHPIB patients, ruling out
   mutations within the G(s)alpha coding region. In mice G(s)alpha is
   expressed only from the maternal allele in renal proximal tubules (the
   site of PTH action) but is biallelically expressed in most other
   tissues. Studies in patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy
   suggest a similar G(s)alpha imprinting pattern in humans. Here we
   identify a region upstream of the G(s)alpha promoter that is normally
   methylated on the maternal allele and unmethylated on the paternal
   allele, but that is unmethylated on both alleles in all 13 PHPIB
   patients studied. Within this region is an alternative promoter and
   first exon (exon 1A), generating transcripts that are normally expressed
   only from the paternal allele, but that are biallelically expressed in
   PHPIB patients. Therefore, PHPIB is associated with a paternal-specific
   imprinting pattern of the exon 1A region on both alleles, which may lead
   to decreased G(s)alpha expression in renal proximal tubules. We propose
   that loss of exon 1A imprinting is the cause of PHPIB.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We evaluate the role of protein kinase C in excitatory
   purinergic neurotransmission in the mouse bladder.
   Materials and Methods: In isolated mouse detrusor strips contractile
   responses to electrical field stimulation were mostly mediated by neural
   released acetylcholine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The changes in
   neurotransmission were measured indirectly by recording the contraction
   of detrusor strips in response to repetitive electrical field
   stimulation by trains of electrical pulses at 8 Hz. 1 second in
   duration.
   Results: A protein kinase C activator, 1 to 2.5 nM.
   (beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (beta-PDBu), but not the inactive form
   alpha-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, significantly enhanced neurogenic
   detrusor contractions. The purinergic component of the evoked detrusor
   contractions in the presence of atropine was specifically sensitive to
   this enhancing effect by beta-PDBu but the cholinergic component in the
   alpha,beta-methylene ATP treated detrusors remained unaffected. This
   enhancing effect of beta-PDBu was dependent on the extracellular calcium
   (Ca2+) concentration. A P and/or Q type Ca2+ channel blocker, 0.1 and
   0.3 mu M. omega-conotoxin-MVIIC, and protein kinase C inhibitors, 0.3
   and 1 mu M. staurosporine and 0.3 and 1 mu M. bisindolylmaleimide I but
   not 0.1 and 0.3 mu M. omega-conotoxin-GVIA, an N type Ca2+ channel
   blocker, abolished the effect of beta-PDBu. Moreover, beta-PDBu did not
   affect the muscle responses induced by the exogenous agonists carbachol
   or alpha,beta-methylene ATP and potassium chloride.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the activation of Ca2+ channel,
   especially the P and/or Q type, may be involved in the enhancing effect
   of protein kinase C activator beta-PDBu on muscle contractions elicited
   by excitatory purinergic neurotransmission in the mouse detrusor strips.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To compare molecular associations between the vesicular
   stomatitis virus (VSV)-New Jersey isolates of the 1995 outbreak with
   those from previous outbreaks between 1982 and 1985 in the western
   United States.
   Sample Population-23 virus isolates considered representative of the
   1995 outbreak of vesicular stomatitis.
   procedure-Viral gene coding for surface-envelope protein G was evaluated
   by use of nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.
   Results-Changes in up to 0.77\% of the nucleotide bases and 1.35\% of
   the amino acids were detected among the 1995 viral isolates, whereas
   changes in up to 3.2 and 2.9\% of the nucleotides and amino acids,
   respectively, were found, compared with the 1982 to 1985 viruses.
   insertions or deletions were not found in the entire gene, which spanned
   1,554 nucleotide bases.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Phylogenetic analysis indicated that
   the 1995 VSV-New Jersey belongs to a lineage distinct from that of the
   1982 to 1985 viruses that caused previous outbreaks in the western
   United States. Furthermore, it also is distinct from strains from
   Central America and from the Georgian Hazelhurst strain.}},

Abstract = {{During low-temperature faulting of Cambrian quartzite (Assynt, NW
   Scotland), stress concentrations develop at grain contacts either at the
   onset of deformation, prior to the establishment of a through-going
   fault plane, or within the damage zone remote from the main displacement
   segment. Such concentrations contribute to the development of
   intragranular microfractures, cataclastic microstructures and fault
   rocks. This contribution considers the progressive deformation sequence
   that precedes microfracturing and cataclasis. The complexity of this
   deformation is revealed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) electron
   backscattered diffraction (EBSD). Dauphine twinning is a widespread
   feature associated with grain contact stress concentration and forms
   distinctive EBSD microstructures. Automatic SEM/EBSD analysis reveals
   that whilst initial indentation causes dauphine twinning of many grains,
   continued indentation results in the formation of an arcuate array of
   subgrains via low temperature plasticity and/or microcracking, which
   overprint the dauphine twins. These observations are consistent with
   transmission electron microscopic analysis of quartz crystals used far
   microhardness indentation tests, which reveal that indentation causes an
   intensely deformed region to develop, comprising a high density of
   microfractures and a submicron scale `blocky' microstructure that
   accommodates any `plastic' deformation. Deformation mechanisms and
   associated microstructures develop sequentially with progressive
   indentation and may provide sites of microfracture nucleation via
   low-temperature ductile fracture. The new microstructures assist
   diffusive mass transfer (DMT) processes by the formation of a cellular
   or subgrain array that represents a reduction of several orders of
   magnitude in apparent grain size and hence in diffusion path length.
   Concomitantly, associated microfracturing perturbs local thermodynamic
   equilibrium, leading to enhanced DMT, crack healing and cementation
   overgrowths. Together, these processes form the aseismic creep and
   sealing components of fault zone development. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: The Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) score is
   correlated with age and sociodemographic variables. The aim of the study
   was to determine an individualized CAMCOG cut-off score for dementia,
   taking such correlates into account.
   Method: From the general population 150 people aged 65-84 years were
   examined with CAMDEX which includes CAMCOG, and a neuropsychological
   test battery. Data from 130 non-demented people were entered in setwise
   multiple regression analyses to identify variables predicting the CAMCOG
   score.
   Results: The variables age, social class, matrimonial status, general
   knowledge ar id intellectual level explained 66\% of the variance of the
   CAMCOG scores. A cut-off defined as a difference between actual and
   predicted CAMCOG score less than or equal to -4.41 resulted in a
   sensitivity of 88.2\% and a specificity of 89.2\% for very mild to

Abstract = {{1 The NHE1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger plays an important role in
   the regulation of intracellular pH and in cardiac cell injury caused by
   ischaemia and reperfusion. SL 59.1227 is a novel imidazolypiperidine
   Na+/H+ antiport inhibitor which is structurally unrelated to previously
   described acylguanidine inhibitors such as cariporide.
   2 Recovery of pH(i) following an intracellular acid load was measured in
   CCL39-derived PS120 variant cells, selectively expressing either NHE1 or
   NHE2 isoforms of the Na+/H+ exchanger, pH(i) recovery was potently and
   selectively slowed by SL 59.1227 in NHE1-expressing cells (IC50 3.3 +/-
   1.3 nM) versus NHE2-expressing cells (2.3 +/- 1.0 muM). The respective
   IC50 values for cariporide were 103 +/- 28 nhl (NHE1) and 73 +/- 46 muM
   (NHE2).
   3 In anaesthetized rats following left coronary artery occlusion (7 min)
   and reperfusion (10 min) SL 59.1227 (10-100 mug kg(-1) min(-1) i.v.)
   inhibited ischaemia-mediated ventricular tachycardia (71-100\%) and
   reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (75-87\%) and prevented
   mortality. Bolus i.v. administration of SL 59.1227 (1 mg kg(-1))
   produced anti-arrhythmic effects when administered either before or
   during ischaemia.
   4 Cardiac infarct size was determined in anaesthetized rabbits following
   left coronary artery occlusion (30 min) and reperfusion (120 min).
   Infarct size measured as a percentage of the area at risk was 36.2 +/-
   3.4\% (control group) versus 15.3 +/- 3.9\% (SL 59.1227 0.6 mg kg(-1)
   i.v.).
   5 SL 59.1227 is the first example of a potent and NHE1-selective
   non-acylguanidine Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor. It possesses marked
   cardioprotective properties.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of somatic mutations in V regions of Ig genes is important for
   understanding various biological processes. It is customary to estimate
   Ag selection on Ig genes by assessment of replacement (R) as opposed to
   silent (S) mutations in the complementary determining regions and S as
   opposed to Ii mutations in the framework regions. In the past such an
   evaluation was performed using a binomial distribution model equation,
   which is inappropriate for Ig genes in which mutations have four
   different distribution possibilities (R and S mutations in the
   complementary-determining region and/or framework regions of the gene).
   In the present work, we propose a multinomial distribution model for
   assessment of Ag selection, Side-by-side application of multinomial and
   binomial models on 86 previously established Ig sequences disclosed 8
   discrepancies, leading to opposite statistical conclusions about Ag
   selection. We suggest the use of the multinomial model for ail future

Abstract = {{In recent years, the demand for composite materials has grown in many
   directions. Although polymer composites have long been classified as
   structural materials for purposes such as mechanical enhancement and
   weight savings, the need for conducting polymer composites is growing.
   Vapor-grown carbon nanofibers (VGCFs), used as reninforcements for
   thermoplastic matrices, have potential application as conducting
   polymers, enhancing both stiffness and thermal stability(1-4). This
   article discusses the processing of VGCFs from the perspective of their
   electrical and thermal properties, availability, and application in the

Abstract = {{The (A) over tilde (2)Sigma (+) state of Ar . NO is studied using (1+1)
   resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy. Higher
   quality spectra than obtained in other studies allow the identification
   of a number of previously unreported features. The spectrum is analyzed
   using two models: a rigid van der Waals complex in which NO is weakly
   bonded to Ar; and a complex in which the free internal rotation of NO is
   hindered by the anisotropy caused by the presence of the Ar atom. It is
   concluded that as the intermolecular stretch is excited, then the
   anisotropy decreases, and the angular motion of the complex becomes more
   and more like that of a free rotor. Near the origin, the complex has an
   average geometry approaching linear, whereas when the intermolecular
   stretch is excited, an average geometry closer to T-shaped occurs;
   however, when the anisotropy is small, the concept of geometry becomes
   ill-defined. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Unipolar ICD electrodes are routinely implanted at the right ventricular
   apex (RVA). However, inappropriate pacing/sensing parameters and/or high
   DFT may limit the appropriateness of the lead's implantation at the RVA.
   This study examined the effects on DFT of ICD leads implanted in the
   RVOT, attached to the high interventricular septum as an alternate
   location. DFT, defibrillation impedance, and sensing and pacing
   characteristics were measured at the time of implantation in 28
   consecutive patients. Group A consisted of 12 patients in whom the ICD
   implantation criteria in the RVA were not satisfied, and whose lead was
   placed in the RVOT. Group B consisted of 16 patients with ICD electrodes
   implanted at the RVA. Mean DFT in group A was 11 +/- 4 J (4.5-20 J)
   versus 12 +/- 6 J (4-20 J) in the group B (P = 0.58). Defibrillation
   impedance wets 81 +/- 9 Ohm (69-92 Ohm) in group A versus 77 +/- 15 Ohm
   (46-93 Ohm) in group B (P = 0.43). R wave amplitude, slew rate, pacing
   threshold, and pacing impedance were comparable in both groups. In the
   perioperative period, the electrode needed to be repositioned in two
   patients from group A. There was no further dislodgment of RVOT
   defibrillation leads or other lead related complications during a
   follow-up of 23 +/- 9 months. The placement of ICD leads in the RVOT is
   an alternative to the RVA position. However, active-fixation ICD leads
   should be considered to limit the risk of electrode dislodgment.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical ventilation is the mainstay of therapy for acute lung injury,
   a disease with remainingly high morbidity and mortality. As a result of
   an improved understanding that mechanical ventilation itself can
   contribute to and aggravate the disease process, The term
   ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) has been introduced. Main risk
   factor for VALI are (1) alveolar overdistention caused by excessivly
   high tidal volumes and/or inspiratory pressures (volu-/barotrauma), as
   well as (2) cyclic alveolar collapse promoted by insufficient
   endexpiratory pressure. So called ``lung-protective ventilatory
   strategies{''} aim at minimizing these risk factors by the use of small
   tidal volumes and high PEEP levels.
   High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) can be regarded as an
   ultimate form of this approach, combining minimal pressure changes with
   a high continuous distending pressure (CDP). That CPD is generated using
   high fresh gas flows ({''}Super-CPAP{''}), while a piston pump
   incorporated into the system creates an oscillatory flow at frequencies
   ranging from 3-7 Hz. An initial lung volume recruitment manoeuvre is
   mandatory for the optimal use of HFOV. Whereas for many years HFOV is a
   well established therapy for the infant respiratory distress syndrome,
   experience in adults is still rare. First results, however, look
   promising, and HFOV might as well turn out as a valuable treatment
   modality for ARDS.}},

Abstract = {{Over 90 per cent of paediatric HN infections are maternally acquired
   most of these in sub-Saharan Africa. Mortality trends underscore the
   humanitarian and ethical obligation for urgent global action to protect
   children from HN. With the adoption of anti-retroviral therapy in
   pregnancy, mother-to-child transmission rates have declined to 4-6 per
   cent in the USA and other industrialised countries. In low-resource
   settings, where most of the children are continuously being exposed to
   NN, the cost of anti-retroviral therapy is prohibitive. Very few
   developing countries apart from Botswana, Thailand and Brazil have
   national policies for integration of preventive anti-retroviral therapy
   in antenatal clinics. This paper reviews anti-retro viral and
   non-anti-retroviral interventions for prevention of mother-to-child
   transmission of HIV. To support the health of mothers as well, it
   supports the implementation of a comprehensive package of care in
   pregnancy and post-partum, such as access to antenatal and delivery
   services; anti-retroviral preventive therapy; malaria treatment; family
   planning; multivitamin, iron and folate supplementation; counselling on
   feeding options; post-natal care for the child and post-partum care for
   the mother, and calls for a strategy for advocacy, programme

Abstract = {{Oligemic regions, in which the cerebral blood flow is reduced without
   impaired energy metabolism, have the potential to evolve toward
   infarction and remain a target for therapy. The aim of this study was to
   investigate this oligemic region using various MRI parameters in a rat
   model of focal oligemia. This model has been designed specifically for
   remote-controlled occlusion from outside an MRI scanner. Wistar rats
   underwent remote partial MCAO using an undersize 0.2 mm nylon
   monofilament with a bullet-shaped tip. Cerebral blood flow (CBF(ASL))
   using an arterial spin labeling technique, the apparent diffusion
   coefficient of water (ADC), and the relaxation times T(1) and T(2) were
   acquired using an 8.5 T vertical magnet. Following occlusion there was a
   decrease in CBF(ASL) to 35 +/- 5\% of baseline throughout the middle
   cerebral artery territory. During the entire period of the study there
   were no observed changes in the ADC. On occlusion, T(2) rapidly
   decreased in both cortex and basal ganglia and then normalized to the
   preocclusion values. T(1) values rapidly increased (within approximately
   7 min) on occlusion, In conclusion, this study demonstrates the
   feasibility of partially occluding the middle cerebral artery to produce
   a large area of oligemia within the MRI scanner. In this region of
   oligemic flow we detect a rapid increase in T(1) and decrease in T(2).
   These changes occur before the onset of vasogenic edema. We attribute
   the acute change in T(2) to increased amounts of deoxyhemoglobin; the
   mechanisms underlying the change in T(1) require further investigation.

Abstract = {{Vanadium nitride (VN) and zirconium nitride (ZrN) films were prepared by
   an ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) method. The substrate temperature
   (150, 300 and 500 degreesC), nitrogen ion beam energy (150-1000 eV) and
   incident angle (45 and 0 degrees) were chosen as the processing
   variables. The ion sputtering/channeling effect and the energy input
   model can be used to explain the changes in preferred orientation of VN
   and ZrN. In VN we observed a change in preferred orientation from (111)
   to (200) at 300 degreesC growth temperature with normal incident
   ion-beam energy of higher than 350 V. For ZrN films, 750 V was required
   to reach similar conditions. We also observed an increase in (200) by
   increasing the substrate temperature of VN to 500 degreesC. An
   accelerated grain growth was formed, leading to a hillock-like surface
   topology in VN films grown at 500 degreesC with 45 degrees incident ion
   beam at 500 V acceleration voltage. This might be caused by an ion
   beam-assisted surface diffusion process. VN films with a completely
   (111)-oriented texture have been grown and an ion sputtering/channeling
   model is still used to elucidate the result. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Functional asymmetries between hemispheres have been reported in
   relation to spatial and temporal information processing. Here we used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the influence of
   task on activity in extrastriate areas during selective spatial
   attention. During bilateral visual stimulation, subjects attended either
   the left or the right hemifield. Within the attended side, the task was
   either to discriminate the orientation of the stimuli or to judge their
   temporal characteristics. The bilateral stimulation caused symmetric
   activation of the left and right occipitotemporal junction. Within these
   regions we investigated the modulatory effects attention and the effect
   of task upon these. A region of interest approach was used to compare
   activity in the two hemispheres. The signal at occipitotemporal junction
   was analyzed in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, with attended side, type
   of task, and hemisphere as factors. We found that, in both hemispheres,
   activity was higher when attention was directed to the contralateral
   hemifield compared with the ipsilateral hemifield. However, the size of
   these contralateral attentional modulations was dependent on the task.
   In the left occipitotemporal junction, contralateral modulations were
   stronger during the temporal task, while in the right occipitotemporal
   junction contralateral modulations were stronger during orientation
   discrimination. Overall, this pattern of activity lead to a significant
   three-way interaction between attended side, type of task, and
   hemisphere. We conclude that task characteristics influence brain
   activity associated with spatial selective attention. Our results
   support the hypothesis that temporal and orientation processing are
   preferentially associated with the left and right hemisphere,
   respectively. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The strong-property-fluctuation theory is developed for the
   homogenization of the linear dielectric, magnetic, and magnetoelectric
   properties of a two-constituent bianisotropic composite. The notion of a
   bianisotropic comparison medium (BCM) is introduced to serve as a
   springboard for the Dyson equation satisfied by the ensemble-averaged
   electromagnetic held. With the constitutive properties of the BCM
   serving as the zeroth-order solution of the Dyson equation, the
   first-order correction, known as the bilocal approximation, is obtained.
   Wave propagation in the composite can be described in this manner by a
   nonlocal effective medium containing information about the spatial
   correlations of the constitutive properties. For scales larger than the
   correlation length, the nonlocality vanishes and a local effective
   medium emerges. Analytical results for the local effective constitutive
   properties are presented after assuming a spherical particulate topology
   far the constituent mediums. Illustrative numerical results are

Abstract = {{Polystyrene latexes were prepared by emulsion polymerization. Styrene
   was used as monomer, potassium persulfate was the reaction initiator and

   (anionic), Triton X-100 and Vulcastab LW (nonionic), and
   hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (cationic), were used. The prepared
   latexes were characterized according to concentration, density, pH,
   ionic strength, particle size, particle size distribution and surface
   charge.
   For prepared latexes with anionic surfactant, the effects of
   temperature, initiator concentration, surfactant concentration and
   amount of monomer on the latex size were investigated. Scanning electron
   microscopy was used as a tool for latex characterization. The results
   show that by increasing temperature, initiator and emulsifier
   concentration, the latex diameter decreases. However, size increases by
   increasing the amount of monomer. A potentiometric titration technique
   was employed for determination of surface charge. It was found that for
   all latexes, surface charge densities are in the same range.

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. A pattern electroretinogram (PERG) in which stimuli displaying
   the frequency-doubling (FD) illusion are presented simultaneously to
   multiple parts of the visual field nas evaluated for its ability to
   diagnose glaucoma. This multiregion FD PERG is referred to in the
   current study as the MFP.
   METHODS. The nine stimulus regions were temporally modulated at
   incommensurate frequencies typically producing an FD percept. Two other
   spatial scales of the stimuli were also investigated. The sensitivity
   and specificity of MFP were examined using linear and quadratic
   discriminant methods.
   RESULTS. Even with the simpler linear discriminant classification,
   sensitivities and specificities of 100\% were obtained in eyes with
   moderate to severe glaucoma. Of eyes with glaucoma strongly suspected,
   67\% were classified as being glaucomatous. Stimulus patterns having
   differing spatial scales produced different PERG visual field
   dependencies.
   CONCLUSIONS. The differing results for the 16-fold change in spatial
   scale may reflect the accessing of different mechanisms. The MFP method
   appears to have significant value for the diagnosis of glaucoma.}},

Abstract = {{Incomplete factorizations are popular preconditioning techniques for
   solving large and sparse linear systems. in the case of highly
   indefinite complex-symmetric linear systems, the convergence of Krylov
   subspace methods sometimes degrades with increasing level of fill-in.
   The reasons for this disappointing behaviour are twofold. On the one
   hand, the eigenvalues of the preconditioned system tend to 1, but the
   `convergence' is not monotonous. On the other hand, the eigenvalues with
   negative real part, on their move towards 1 have to cross the origin,
   whence the risk of clustering eigenvalues around 0 while `improving' the
   preconditioner. This makes it risky to predict any gain when passing
   from a level to a higher one. We examine a remedy which consists in
   slightly moving the spectrum of the original system matrix along the
   imaginary axis. Theoretical analysis that motivates our approach and
   experimental results are presented, which displays the efficiency of the
   new preconditioning techniques. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The fatigue crack growth rates in 316L and 316LN stainless steel were
   measured to compare the resistance to fatigue crack growth of the alloys
   and to evaluate the effects of nitrogen addition to the alloys. Fatigue
   crack growth tests were carried out at 1 Hz with a sinusoidal tension
   stress wave form (R = 0.2) between 25 degreesC and 600 degreesC in air.
   Crack lengths were monitored by direct current potential drop method.
   316LN stainless steel showed better crack growth resistance than 316L
   stainless steel did. The characteristics of the cyclic plastic strain
   zone of 316L and 316LN stainless steel at the crack tip were analyzed
   with micro hardness test, the X-ray diffraction method and transmission
   electron microscopy. The improvement of the fatigue crack growth
   resistance of 316LN stainless steel is discussed in relation to the
   degree of crack closure, strain induced martensite transformation and
   the dislocation structure in the cyclic plastic stain zone at the
   fatigue crack tip. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied biopsies from the Achilles tendons of patients undergoing
   open repair for a subcutaneous rupture of their Achilles tendons (27
   men, 11 women; mean age, 45.3 +/- 13.8 years) and specimens of Achilles
   tendons from persons with no known tendon ailments (43 men, 3 women;
   mean age, 64.2 +/-. 9.7 years). Histologic examination was performed
   using stained slides that were interpreted using a semiquantitative
   grading scale assessing fiber structure and arrangement, rounding of the
   nuclei, regional variations in cellularity, increased vascularity,
   decreased collagen stainability, hyalinization, and glycosaminoglycan.
   We gave up to three marks for each of these variables, with 0 being
   normal and 3 being maximally abnormal. All the histology slides were
   assessed twice in a blinded manner; the agreement between two readings
   ranged from 0.56 to 0.87 (kappa statistics). The score of ruptured
   tendons was significantly greater than the average score of control
   tendons (20.5 +/- 3.6 versus 6.5 +/- 2.1), and there was significantly
   higher degeneration in the ruptured tendons. Nonruptured Achilles
   tendons, even at an advanced age, and ruptured Achilles tendons are
   clearly part of two distinct populations. Using these staining
   techniques, light microscopic degeneration is not a feature of tendons
   from healthy, older persons.}},

Abstract = {{Molar heat capacities at constant volume (C, of trifluoromethane (R23)

   From the triple point to 342 K, and pressures up to 33.5 MPa.
   Measurements were conducted on the liquid in equilibrium with its vapor
   and on compressed liquid and gaseous samples. The samples were of high
   purity, as verified by chemical analysis. Calorimetric quantities are
   reported for the two-phase (C-v((2))), saturated-liquid (C-sigma or
   C-x'), and single-phase (C-v) molar heat capacities. The C-v((2)) data
   were used to estimate vapor pressures for values less than 100 kPa by
   applying a thermodynamic relationship between the two-phase internal
   energy U-(2) and the temperature derivatives of the vapor pressure. The
   triple-point temperature and the enthalpy of fusion were also measured.
   The principal sources of uncertainty are the temperature rise
   measurement and the change-of-volume work adjustment. The expanded
   relative uncertainty (with a coverage factor k = 2 and thus a
   two-standard deviation estimate) is estimated to be 0.7\% for C-v, 0.5\%
   for C-v((2)) and 0.7\% for C-sigma.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of childhood asthma has increased markedly in many
   Western societies during recent decades. We wanted to study whether the
   incidence and severity of childhood asthma in Finland had changed during
   the time-period 1976-95. Hospital admission rates from 1976 to 1995 were
   obtained from the National Hospital Discharge Register and the
   individual intensive care unit (ICU) registers of the five university
   hospitals in Finland. The number and length of treatment periods for
   childhood asthma in all Finnish hospitals and at the ICUs of the five
   university hospitals were analyzed, The number of children receiving
   special reimbursement for asthma medication costs was obtained from the
   central register of the Social Insurance Institution. The data showed
   that during the time-period investigated, hospital admissions as a
   result of asthma had increased by 2.8-fold, but the mean length of
   hospital stay had more than halved (from 7.3 to 2.6 days). The increase
   in hospital admissions showed greatest significance in the 0-4-year
   age-group among both sexes (p < 0.001). In contrast, a significant
   reduction in hospital admissions was found among the 10 14-year
   age-group (p < 0.001). No discernible change in admission to ICUs was
   seen. During the same time-period, the number of children receiving
   special reimbursement for asthma medication costs increased 7.5-fold,
   Hence, a major increase has occurred in the number of children diagnosed
   with asthma that has not been paralleled by a proportionate increase in
   the number of hospital admissions. While the prevalence of mild and
   moderate asthma has increased, the occurrence of severe asthma has
   remained essentially unchanged.}},

Abstract = {{Tamoxifen (TAM) is widely used in the treatment of breast cancer. The
   cytostatic effects of TAM have been attributed to the antagonism of
   estrogen receptor (ER) and inhibition of estrogen-dependent
   proliferative events. However, the mechanism by which TAM is also
   effective against certain ER-negative breast tumors remains to be
   elucidated. Here we report that TAM induced the activity of
   caspase-3-like proteases in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines
   MDA-MB-231 and BT-20, as evidenced by the cleavage of fluorogenic
   tetrapeptide substrate and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. The
   activation of caspase-1-like proteases preceded TAM-induced chromatin
   condensation and nuclear fragmentation, the typical apoptotic
   morphologies. Pretreatment of cells with a specific inhibitor of
   caspase-3, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde, or with a general inhibitor
   of caspases, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone,
   prevented TAM-induced apoptosis. TAM also stimulated c-Jun NH2-terminal
   kinase (JNK) 1 activity, and interfering with the JNK pathway by
   overexpressing a DN JNK1 mutant attenuated TAM-induced apoptosis. In
   addition, treatment of cells with a lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin E
   blocked TAM-induced caspase-3 and JNK1 activation as well as apoptosis,
   whereas water-soluble antioxidants N-acetyl L-cysteine and glutathione
   had little effect. Thus, this study demonstrates that TAM induces
   apoptosis in ER-negative breast cancer cells through caspase-3 and JNK1
   pathways, which are probably initiated at the cell membrane by an
   oxidative mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{B cells and dendritic cells (DC) internalize and degrade exogenous Ags
   and present them as peptides bound to MHC class II molecules for
   scrutiny by CD4(+) T cells. Here we use an Ab specific for a processed
   form of the model Ag, hen egg lysozyme (HEL), to demonstrate that this
   protein is not efficiently presented by lymph node DC following s.c.
   immunization. HEL presentation by the DC can be dramatically enhanced
   upon coinjection of a microbial adjuvant, which appears to act by
   enhancing peptide loading onto MHC class II. CD40 cross-linking or the
   presence of a high frequency of T cells specific for HEL can similarly
   improve presentation by DC in vivo. For any of these activating stimuli,
   CD8 alpha (+) DC consistently display the highest proportion of

Abstract = {{Background: From March 1986 through May 1991, we conducted a randomized
   nutritional intervention trial, the General Population Trial, in
   Linxian, China, a region with epidemic rates of squamous esophageal and
   adenomatous gastric cardia cancers, We found that participants who
   received selenium, beta -carotene, and vitamin E had significantly lower
   cancer mortality rates than those who did not. In the current study, we
   examined the relationship between selenium levels measured in pretrial
   (1985) sera from participants and the subsequent risk of developing
   squamous esophageal, gastric cardia, and gastric non-cardia cancers
   during the trial. Methods: This study was designed and analyzed in
   accord with a stratified case-cohort sampling scheme, with the six
   strata defined by sex and three age categories. We measured serum
   selenium levels in 590 case subjects with esophageal cancer, 402 with
   gastric cardia cancers, and 87 with gastric non-cardia cancers as well
   as in 1062 control subjects. Relative risks (RRs), absolute risks, and
   population attributable risk for cancers were estimated on the basis of
   the Cox proportional hazards models. All statistical tests are
   two-sided. Results: We found highly significant inverse associations of
   serum selenium levels with the incidence of esophageal (P for trend
   <10(-4)) and gastric cardia (P for trend <10(-6)) cancers. The RR and
   95\% confidence interval (CI) for comparison of highest to lowest
   quartile of serum selenium was 0.56 (95\% CI = 0.44-0.71) for esophageal
   cancer and 0.47 (95\% CI = 0.33-0.65) for gastric cardia cancer. The
   population proportion of these cancers that is attributable to low
   selenium levels was 26.4\% (95\% CI = 14.45-38.36), We found no evidence
   for a gradient of serum selenium associated with incidence of gastric
   non-cardia cancer (P for trend = .96), with an RR of 1.07 (95\% CI =
   0.55-2.08) for the highest to lowest quartile of serum selenium,
   Conclusions: Our study supports findings from previous prospective
   studies and randomized trials that variations in selenium levels affect
   the incidence of certain cancers. In the United States, where
   intervention trials of selenium are in the planning stages,
   consideration should be given to including populations at high risk for
   squamous esophageal and gastric cardia cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Increasing age, socioeconomic factors, and declining
   function and health have been linked to driving cessation, but little is
   known about the consequences of stopping driving. This study was
   designed to test the hypothesis that driving cessation leads to a
   decline in out-of-home activity levels.
   Methods. In 1989 a survey of driving practices was administered to
   surviving noninstitutionalized members of the New Haven Established
   Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) cohort. Of
   1,316 respondents, 502 were active drivers as of 1988, 92 had stopped
   driving between 1982 and 1987, and 722 never drove or stopped before
   1982. Information on sociodemographic and health-related variables came
   from in-home EPESE interviews in 1982, 1985, and 1988, and from yearly
   phone interviews. Activity was measured at all three in-home interviews,
   and an activity measure was created based on self-reported participation
   in nine out-of-home activities. A repeated measures random-effects model
   was used to test the effect of driving cessation on activity while
   controlling for potential confounders.
   Results. Driving cessation was strongly associated with decreased
   out-of-home activity levels (coefficient-1.081, standard error 0.264, p
   < .001) after adjustment for sociademographic and health-related
   factors.
   Discussion. The potential consequences of driving limitations or
   cessation should be taken into account when advising older drivers and
   developing alternative transportation strategies to help maintain their
   mobility.}},

Abstract = {{The assembly of an organism requires the interaction between different
   layers of cells, in many cases via an extracellular matrix. In the
   developing Drosophila larva, muscles attach in an integrin-dependent
   manner to the epidermis, via a specialized extracellular matrix called
   tendon matrix. Tiggrin, a tendon matrix integrin ligand, is primarily
   synthesized by cells distant to the muscle attachment sites, yet it
   accumulates specifically at these sites. Previous work has shown that
   the PS integrins are not required for tiggrin localization, suggesting
   that there is redundancy among tiggrin receptors, We have examined this
   by testing whether the PS2 integrin can recruit tiggrin to ectopic
   locations within the Drosophila embryo, We found that neither the wild
   type nor modified forms of the PS2 integrin, which have higher affinity
   for tiggrin, can recruit tiggrin to new cellular contexts. Next, we
   genetically manipulated the fate of the muscles and the epidermal muscle
   attachment cells, which demonstrated that muscles have the primary role
   in recruiting tiggrin to the tendon matrix and that cell-cell contact is
   necessary for this recruitment. Thus we propose that the inherent
   polarity of the muscle cells leads to a molecular specialization of
   their ends, and interactions between the ends produces an
   integrin-independent tiggrin receptor. Thus, interaction between cells
   generates an extracellular environment capable of nucleating
   extracellular matrix assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of CO2 wedged hepatic
   venography (CO2 WHV) by comparing it with direct transjugular (DP) and
   indirect arterial portography (IP).
   Methods: Twenty-one CO2 WHV and IP examinations were performed in 20
   patients; 13 of them also underwent DP within 48 h of CO2 WHV and IP. IP
   involved the injection of iodinated contrast into the superior
   mesenteric and splenic arteries. DP was performed from a transjugular
   approach, during transjugular intrahepatic portosystem shunt placement,
   with the injection of iodinated contrast into the superior mesenteric or
   splenic vein. The parameters evaluated were visualization of vessels and
   varices, portal vein thrombosis detection, and complications.
   Results: CO2 WHV depicted the splenic vein in 57\%, the superior
   mesenteric vein in 62\%, the main portal vein in 90\%, the right portal
   vein in 95\%, and the left portal vein in 90\% of patients. It also
   demonstrated gastroesophageal varices in seven cases, a splenorenal
   shunt in one case, mesenteric varices in one case, and a recanalized
   umbilical vein in one case; other varices were also seen.
   Conclusion: CO2 WHV is a good and safe technique for demonstrating the
   portal circulation. It may provide information not obtainable by LP and
   DP. However, IP provides better demonstration of the variceal network.}},

Abstract = {{Although there may be a close relationship between B lymphocytes and
   osteoclasts, or bone resorbing cells, little is known about the role of
   B lymphocytes in bone formation. We compared in vivo new bone induction
   in mice homozygous for the B-cell deficient (mu MT) gene knockout, which
   lack functional B lymphocytes, with bone induction in control wild-type
   (C57BL/6) mice. Our comparison used two models of new bone induction in
   vivo: endochondral osteoinduction by subcutaneous implantation of
   recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) and osteogenic
   regeneration after tibial bone marrow ablation. The expression of
   bone-specific proteins (bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, and osteocalcin)
   and inflammatory/ immunomodulatory cytokines (interleukin-1 alpha and -1
   beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) was assessed by
   Northern blot analysis or reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction, respectively. Ossicles induced by rhBMP-2 were larger in
   volume and mass in mu MT knockout mice, but relative volumes of the
   newly induced bone, cartilage, and bone marrow were similar in the two
   groups. Six days after tibial bone marrow ablation, mu MT knockout mice
   resorbed the initial blood clot faster and formed more trabecular bone,
   paralleled by greater levels of bone sialoprotein mRNA than in the
   wild-type mice. mu MT knockout and wild-type mice also differed in the
   expression pattern of inflammatory/immunomodulatory cytokines during the
   development of the newly induced bone, suggesting that a genetic lack of
   B lymphocytes may create a change in the immunological milieu at the
   site of new bone induction, which stimulates the initial accumulation
   and proliferation of mesenchymal progenitor.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The oscillator strengths for optical transitions between the
   lowest-order single-electron energy subbands are obtained within the
   dipole approximation as functions of the axially applied magnetic field.
   Confinement of the electron is by the magnetic field potential as well
   as by some fictitious potential of the quantum wire with a spatial
   variation across the cylinder thickness. The radiation field is taken as
   that of the circularly polarized light along the axis of the cylinder.
   Within the framework of the dipole approximation, the only allowed
   transitions associated with this polarization are those between the
   electron-energy subbands whose azimuthal quantum numbers differ by
   unity. As a result of the Zeeman splitting of the non-zero
   azimuthal-quantum number states, several branches of the oscillator
   strengths emerge from the zero-field branch on taking into account the
   possible permutations of the sign of the relevant azimuthal quantum
   numbers. The main prediction is the enhancement of the oscillator
   strengths for transitions between the subbands whose energy gaps open up
   on increasing confinement of the electron due to the magnetic field
   potential. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim of study: Isolated porcine small intestine submucosa
   has been used as a resorbable bio-scaffold for site-specific tissue
   remodeling. This study performed in swine evaluated the functional
   competency and remodeling characteristics of cardiac pulmonary leaflets
   constructed from porcine-derived small intestine submucosa.
   Methods: Four clinically normal swine were used for this study. Under
   general anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass, each swine had one
   pulmonary valve leaflet excised and replaced with a leaflet constructed
   from a single layer of porcine small intestine submucosa. The animals
   were sacrificed one each, at 56, 63, 88 and 111 days postoperatively.
   Histopathological evaluation was carried out to compare substitute
   leaflets with normal host valve leaflets, and valve functional
   competence was determined using echocardiography.
   Results: Histopathological analysis of the substituted valve leaflet at
   the time of sacrifice revealed that, simultaneous with resorption of the
   submucosal matrix, progressive replacement with fibrous connective
   tissue and microvasculature similar to mature host tissue had occurred.
   Factor VIII staining demonstrated progression of endothelialization of
   all substitute leaflet surfaces with time. Normal valvular competence
   was noted immediately following surgery, and at the time of sacrifice.
   Conclusion: This study supports the hypothesis that single-layer porcine
   small intestine submucosa can be used to replace mature pulmonary valve
   leaflets. The implanted matrix is resorbed, and a leaflet with
   histologically identifiable features, normal functional competency and
   anatomic apposition to the host leaflets remains.}},

Abstract = {{The self-exchange velocity (SEV) of neighboring unlike ions, has been
   evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations of molten CsCl, (Li, K)Cl

   order as the internal mobilities it is conjectured that there is a
   strong correlation between these two properties. The pair correlation
   functions, and the self-diffusion coefficients and the SEV's of Li+, K+,
   and Cs+ with reference to Cl- have also been calculated. The results
   allow to conclude that the self-exchange velocity of the cations become
   V-cs < V-K < V-Li at X-Cs =0.1 and V-Li < V-K < V-Cs at X-Cs > 0.4. The
   sequence of the self-diffusion coefficients agrees with that of the

Abstract = {{In order to study the disappearance of superconductivity in PrBa2Cu3O7,
   the charged state around Cu(2) site was investigated by Cu-NQR. in the
   normal coxnducting and paramagnetic state in R1-xPrxBa2Cu3O7 (R=Y and
   Nd) over the whole range of x. The NQR. frequency of the Cu(2) site iis
   almost independent of x irrespective of R.. These results suggest that
   the doped holes in x=0 become localized with increasing x without
   substantial change of charge distribution around the Cu(2) site. The
   origin for the disappearance of superconductivity in PrBa2Cu3O7 is
   supposed to be some mechanism without noticeable charge transfer.}},

Abstract = {{The thrombin receptor-tethered ligand SFLLRNP (abbreviation formed by
   one letter amino acid codes expressing Ser-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg-Asn-Pro)
   consists of the Phe-2 residue essential for the receptor activation. In
   order to explore the molecular characteristics of this Phe-2-phenyl, a
   series of trifluorophenylalanines {[}(F-3)Phe] was incorporated into
   this S/Phe/LLRhTP for evaluation of their ability to induce the human
   platelet aggregation A complete set of (F-3)Phe in the L-configuration,
   namely, (2,3,4-F-3)Phe, (2,3,5-F-3)Phe, (2,3,6-F-3)Phe, (2,4,5-F-3)Phe,
   (2,4,6-F-3)Phe, and (3,4,5-F-3)Phe, was prepared from trifluorobenzyl
   bromides and diethyl acetamidomalonate. S/(2,3,4-F-3)Phe/LLRNP was
   equipotent to S/PhenLRNP, while (2,4,5-F-3)Phe-containing analog was
   almost twice as potent as those. (2,4,6-F-3)Phe-analog exhibited about a
   half of the activity of S/Phe/LLRNP. (3,4,5-F-3)Phe-, (2,3,5-F-3)Phe-,
   and (2,3,6-F-3)Phe-analogs were very weak. The analysis of these assay
   results suggested that Phe-2-phenyl of SFLLRNP is in the edge-to-face
   CH/pi interaction with the receptor aromatic group, utilizing the
   Phe-2-phenyl edge along with benzene hydrogens at position 2-3 or 5-6.
   The computer-assisted semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations by
   MOPAC showed that the fluorine atom decreases the electron density of
   its ortho, meta, and para hydrogens, and thus increases their acidity
   more strongly in that order. All these suggested that H --> F
   replacements reinforce the edge-to-face CH/pi interaction to enhance
   biological activity. The H --> F replacement on the Phe-phenyl group was
   found to render an effective structural examination; i.e., to identify
   the hydrogens in the CW/pi interaction, and to intensify the CH/pi
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has established that there is an increase in endothelial
   permeability in hyperthermic rats. This work assessed the potential of
   the calcium channel blocker (E)-l -bis(4-fluorophenyl)methyl-4-(3
   -phenyl-2propenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (flunarizine) as a
   pretreatment to ameliorate this extravasation. Five groups of male rats
   (n=12 rats per group, 400-500 g) were given 0, 0.3, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg
   flunarizine (FL0, FL0.3, FL1, FL2, and FL3, respectively) by gavage 30
   min prior to induction of hyperthermia. Hyperthermia was achieved by
   placing unrestrained animals in their own cages in a chamber maintained
   at 41.5 degreesC until a core temperature (T-c) of 42.6 degreesC was
   attained. Then, 25 mg/kg of Evans blue in saline was administered via a
   jugular cannula. After 15 min the animals were anesthetized,
   exsanguinated, tissues removed and washed in saline, and Evans blue
   extracted with formamide. As the dose of flunarizine was increased,
   there was a significant (P <0.05) reduction of Evans blue recovered from
   the liver, kidney, lung, spleen, and intestinal tissue. Endurance time
   in the heat to reach a T-c of 42.6 degreesC increased significantly from
   194+/-39 min (mean+/-SD) with FL0 to 275+/-33 min with FL1, but
   decreased again with FL2 (206+/-42) and FL3 (199+/-60). Thus,
   flunarizine pretreat- ment attenuated hyperthermia-induced
   extravasation, and 1 mg/kg flunarizine markedly increased the tolerance
   time to heat exposure.}},

Abstract = {{The Denwa Formation (similar to 300m thick) representing a part of the
   unconformity bounded Triassic (Pachmarhi-Denwa) succession of the
   Satpura Gondwana basin, is characterized by two different fluvial styles
   marked by contrasting architectural elements within the alluvial system.
   These fluvial styles are distinct from the underlying Pachmarhi
   Formation representing an alluvial plain with channel belts
   characterised by multiple-channel, sandy braided rivers.
   The lower part of the Denwa Formation is characterized by an alternation
   of medium to fine grained. thick, sheet-like, sandstone bodies and red
   mudstone intervals having centimetre to decimetre scale fine grained
   sandstone interlayers. The thick sandstone bodies are comprised of
   several groups of storeys, and individual storeys are made up of
   macroform strata reflecting frontal, oblique and vertical accretion. It
   is evident from the overall architecture that the lower part of the
   Denwa Formation represents an alluvial plain characterised by sandy,
   braided channel belts and associated floodplain / basin.
   The upper part of the Denwa Formation is characterised by conspicuous
   absence of thick multistorey sandstone bodies. It is predominantly a
   mudstone dominated, sand-poor succession characterized by ribbon-shaped
   bodies encased within pedoturbated mudstones. Ribbon-shaped bodies
   internally show inclined heterolithic (sand-mud) stratification
   representing lateral accretion of channel bars of high sinuosity rivers.
   The upper part of the Denwa Formation is interpreted to represent
   deposits of a network of meander channels laterally separated by
   well-developed and stable interfluve and floodplain areas.
   The changes in the fluvial styles represented in the Denwa succession
   have been attributed to changes in the aggradation rate, avulsion
   frequency and climatic setting.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory mediators of sepsis induce apoptosis in many cell lines. We
   tested the hypothesis that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in vivo
   results in induction of early apoptotic and survival pathways as well as
   evidence of late-stage apoptosis in the heart. Hearts were collected
   from control rats and at 6, 12, and 24 h after LPS injection (4 mg/kg).
   Activation of an apoptotic pathway was identified by a 1,000-fold
   increase in caspase-3 activity at 24 h (P < 0.05). Confirmation of these
   results occurred when terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
   dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining identified myocardial cells
   undergoing DNA fragmentation with significant levels at 24 h post-LPS
   injection. LPS also caused early proapoptotic mRNA (Bax) to increase
   (16\% at 24 h, P, 0.05), whereas the Bax protein initially decreased
   (35\% at 6 h, P, 0.05) and then returned to baseline values by 24 h. Six
   hours after LPS injection, Bcl-2 (early prosurvival) mRNA levels
   increased, whereas its protein levels decreased (70\%, P < 0.05) and
   then returned to baseline levels by 24 h. Mitochondrial cytochrome c
   levels decreased, suggestive of mitochondrial involvement. Thus
   involvement of proapoptotic and prosurvival pathways in the heart occurs
   during a septic inflammatory response.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of a floating junction (FJ) at the surface of a solar cell
   is one way to obtain good-quality surface passivation. The development
   of FJ-passivated solar cells, however, has been hindered by the frequent
   occurrence of shunting across the FJ. Shunting can occur at specific
   regions of the FJ, such as at isolated points of the base contact or at
   the edges of the solar cell. This paper presents an experimental
   technique to determine the shunt resistance across local regions of an
   FJ, thereby providing a means to compare the prevalence of shunting in
   one region to another. By locating and quantifying the shunting in
   specific regions of an FJ, valuable insight into its cause can be
   obtained. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropy fields in excess of 120 kA/m (1500 Oe) have been produced in
   3-5-nm-thick polycrystalline films of Co by oblique sputtering of Ta
   underlayers. The unusually high anisotropy is magnetostatic in origin
   and is induced by corrugations on the surface of an obliquely sputtered
   Ta underlayer. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy reveals
   4 nm columnar grains of Ta tilted toward the Ta source and elongated
   perpendicular to the Ta flux in the film plane. The anisotropy field of
   the Co film increases with both the underlayer thickness and the angle
   between the Ta source and the film normal. In spin valve samples, the
   anisotropy is attenuated by more than an order of magnitude across a
   4-nm-thick Cu spacer. Magnetoresistance measurements on a spin valve
   indicate less than 2 degrees dispersion in hard axis directions, and
   despite the nanometer-scale roughness of the underlayer there is weak
   broadening of the ferromagnetic resonance line. (C) 2000 American

Abstract = {{The paper considers whether financial reports of the past can be based
   exclusively on measurements of past events or whether imagining future
   events is a necessary condition for such measurements. Using an
   idealised notion of a factual account of each event completed at the
   moment at which the event occurs, the analysis brackets out arguments
   about the incomplete or constructivist character of accounting
   representations. Notwithstanding the assumption of immaculate
   perception, the paper demonstrates that accounts of the past require
   unexpungible assumptions about hypothetical future events. Retrospection
   requires anticipation. Difficulties which commitment to
   anticipation-free financial reporting generates is illustrated in a
   discussion of three discourses about accounting. A description of
   financial reporting time which goes beyond a mere chronological

Title = {{Kinematic strategies for upper arm-forearm coordination in three

Abstract = {{This study addressed the question of how the three-dimensional (3-D)
   control strategy for the upper arm depends on what the forearm is doing.
   Subjects were instructed to point a laser-attached in line with the
   upper arm-toward various visual targets, such that two-dimensional (2-D)
   pointing directions of the upper arm were held constant across different
   tasks. For each such task, subjects maintained one of several static
   upper arm-forearm configurations, i.e., each with a set elbow angle and
   forearm orientation. Upper arm, forearm, and eye orientations were
   measured with the use of 3-D search coils. The results confirmed that
   Donders' law (a behavioral restriction of 3-D orientation vectors to a
   2-D ``surface{''}) does not hold across all pointing tasks, i.e., for a
   given pointing target, upper arm torsion varied widely. However, for any
   one static elbow configuration, torsional variance was considerably
   reduced and was independent of previous arm position, resulting in a
   thin, Donders-like surface of orientation vectors. More importantly, the
   shape of this surface (which describes upper arm torsion as a function
   of its 2-D pointing direction) depended on both elbow angle and forearm
   orientation. For pointing with the arm fully extended or with the elbow
   flexed in the horizontal plane, a Listing's-law-like strategy was
   observed, minimizing shoulder rotations to and from center at the cost
   of position-dependent tilts in the forearm. In contrast, when the arm
   was bent in the vertical plane, the surface of best fit showed a
   Fick-like twist that increased continuously as a function of static
   elbow flexion, thereby reducing position-dependent tilts of the forearm
   with respect to gravity. In each case, the torsional variance from these
   surfaces remained constant, suggesting that Donders' law was obeyed
   equally well for each task condition. Further experiments established
   that these kinematic rules were independent of gaze direction and eye
   orientation, suggesting that Donders' law of the arm does not coordinate
   with Listing's law for the eye. These results revive the idea that
   Donders' law is an important governing principle for the control of arm
   movements but also suggest that its various forms may only be limited
   manifestations of a more general set of context-dependent kinematic
   rules. We propose that these rules are implemented by neural velocity
   commands arising as a function of initial arm orientation and desired
   pointing direction, calculated such that the torsional orientation of
   the upper arm is implicitly coordinated with desired forearm posture.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats is an experimental analogue of
   human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This study was undertaken to
   define the effects of chronic nephrosis on the pituitary-ovarian axis
   and on fertility. Chronic nephrosis was induced by puromycin
   aminonucleoside and followed for 112 days. The estrous cycle was
   evaluated daily in all rats, whereas biochemical parameters, hormonal
   concentrations, and fertility were measured on Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84,
   and 112 (n = 8). Animals were divided in four experimental groups: A, 8,
   C, and D. Group A was used to determine LH, FSH, progesterone, and
   estradiol concentrations. Group B was used to evaluate fertility, and
   groups C and D were added to clarify the role of male rats in the
   fertility of nephrotic female rats. The results showed a persistent
   proteinuria in nephrotic rats; the estrous cycle of nephrotic animals
   was disrupted. The LH and estradiol concentrations were significantly
   low at all time points evaluated, whereas no significant changes were
   noted in FSH or progesterone values. In addition, fertility and litter
   size were diminished in nephrotic female rats. Interestingly, the
   presence of a male rat or its urine resulted in a positive influence on
   serum estradiol concentrations of nephrotic female rats. These data
   indicate that experimental chronic nephrosis results in a
   pituitary-ovarian dysfunction that is characterized by low LH
   concentration, hypoestrogenism, failure of the hormonal feedback
   control, and diminution of fertility. In addition, they show the
   positive effect of a male rat on the fertility of a nephrotic female,
   which strongly suggests the participation of pheromones.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological and clinical data suggest that selenium may prevent
   prostate cancer, but the biological effects of selenium on normal or
   malignant prostate cells are not well known. We evaluated the effects of
   sodium selenite (Na2SeO3,) or l-selenomethionine (SeMet) on monolayer
   and anchorage-independent growth in a series of normal primary prostate
   cultures (epithelial, stromal, and smooth muscle) and prostate cancer
   cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145). We observed differential,
   dose-dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis within prostate cancer
   cells (compared with normal prostate cells) treated with 1-500 muM of
   Na2SeO3 or SeMet. Na2SeO3 more potently inhibited growth at any given
   concentration. The androgen-responsive LNCaP cells were the most
   sensitive to selenium growth suppression (IC50 at 72 h for Na2SeO3 and
   SeMet were 0.2 and 1.0 muM, respectively). Growth of the primary
   prostate cells virtually was not suppressed (IC50 at 72 h for Na2SeO3
   and SeMet were 22-38 and >500 muM, respectively), We also observed that
   DNA condensation and DNA fragmentation (terminal
   deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end
   labeling/fluorescence-activated cell sorting) were elevated in
   selenium-treated cells and that activated caspase-3 colocalized with
   terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling-stained
   cells by immunofluorescence, Higher basal poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
   (PARP) expression levels and PARP cleavage (a substrate for caspase-3)
   were observed during apoptosis in tumor cells, compared with normal
   cells. Selective tumor cell death was associated with an increase in
   sub-G(0)-G(1) cells after propidium iodide staining and
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. SeMet caused an increase
   in arrest in the G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle selectively in cancer
   cells. Inhibition of cancer cell growth by SeMet was associated with
   phosphorylation of P-Tyr15-p34/cdc2, which caused growth arrest in the
   G(2)-M phase. Anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cells in
   soft agar was sensitive to selenium, Our results suggest that Na2SeO3 is
   the more potent inducer of apoptosis in normal and cancer prostate
   cells. Our SeMet results involving PARP and G(2)-M cell-cycle arrest
   (cited above) indicate that SeMet selectively induces apoptosis in
   cancer but not primary cells of the human prostate. Our overall findings
   are relevant to the molecular mechanisms of selenium actions on prostate
   carcinogenesis and help demonstrate the selective, dose-dependent
   effects of selenium (especially SeMet) on prostate cancer cell death and
   growth inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{One of the earliest responses to DNA damage in eukaryotic cells is
   activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-I), a DNA strand
   break-dependent nuclear enzyme which covalently modifies proteins with
   poly(ADP-ribose). Here, we show that conditional over-expression of
   PARP-1 in stably transfected hamster cells, which causes cellular
   over-accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) by several-fold, strongly
   suppresses alkylation-induced sister-chromatid exchange (SCE), while
   cytotoxicity of alkylation treatment is slightly enhanced. Viewed
   together with the known potentiation of SCE by abrogation of PARP-1
   activity, our results provide evidence that PARP-1 activity is an
   important regulator of alkylation-induced SCE formation, imposing a
   control that is strictly negative and commensurate with the level of
   enzyme activity. Int. J. Cancer 88:351-355. 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Background. Lung transplantation for patients on ventilators is a
   controversial use of scarce donor lungs. We have performed 500 lung
   transplants in 12 years and 21 of these have been in
   ventilator-dependent patients.
   Methods. A retrospective review of patient records and computerized
   database was performed. Living patients were contacted to confirm their
   health and functional status.
   Results. Patients included 13 men and 8 women with a mean age of 43
   years. Sixteen patients were considered stable awaiting lung transplant,
   whereas 5 patients were unstable with acute graft failure after prior
   lung transplantation. Stable patients had been ventilated for a mean of
   57 +/- 46 days whereas unstable patients had been supported for 10 +/- 9
   days. Half of the patients required cardiopulmonary bypass support
   during the transplant, and there was no statistical difference in the
   frequency of CFB in stable and unstable patients (p = 0.61). Three
   hospital deaths included 0 of 16 of the stable patients and 3 of 5 of
   the unstable patients (p = 0.01). Long-term actuarial survival was
   significantly better in stable versus unstable patients (p = 0.02), with
   5-year survival 40\% for stable patients and 0\% for unstable patients.
   Conclusions. Lung transplantation can be successfully conducted in
   stable patients who have become ventilator dependent after listing for
   transplantation. Acute retransplantation for early lung dysfunction is
   high risk and has produced poor long-term results. (Ann Thorac Surg

Abstract = {{PROBLEM: Reduction of excess numbers of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) is an example of a potential use for immunocontraception as
   a means of wildlife population management.
   METHOD OF STUDY: A 4 year multifaceted study was conducted to determine
   the long term effects of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)
   contraceptive vaccine on the fertility and behavior of female and male
   white-tailed deer. Deer were monitored for breeding behavior, hormone
   levels, pregnancy, fawning and GnRH specific antibody levels.
   RESULTS: Treatment lead to reduced fawning rates, altered estrus
   behavior, reduced concentrations of progesterone, contraception and
   failure to maintain pregnancy following conception. GnRH immunized does
   bred to untreated bucks had an 88\% reduction in fawning caused by
   either immunocontraception or immunocontragestion. The vaccine effect is
   reversible, directly related to the antibody titer. Infertility lasted
   up to two years without boosting. GnRH immunized bucks demonstrated no
   interest in sexual activity when paired with control females. Depending
   on the immunization schedule, antlers either dropped early or remained
   in velvet.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that GnRH vaccine is
   effective in inducing a reversible infertility in white-tailed deer, the
   infertility lasting up to two years without boosting.}},

Abstract = {{Pod-specific calling behaviour of resident killer whales has been shown
   to include: discrete call types not shared among pods, different
   production rates of shared call types, and differences in the detailed
   structure of shared call types. To investigate the mechanisms leading to
   pod-specific calling, we compared the repertoire and structure of calls
   produced by three different matrilineal units within the same pod, and
   described call features encoding matrilineal-unit distinctiveness. The
   three matrilineal units had different production rates of shared calls,
   including one call type used almost exclusively by one matrilineal unit.
   Cross-validated discriminant function analyses revealed matrilineal-unit
   distinctive structure in five of the six shared call types examined,
   with duration of the terminal component being the most distinctive
   feature for all call types containing a terminal component. Calls
   generally consist of low- and high-frequency components that may follow
   different time-frequency contours. In our sample, a particular
   high-frequency contour was consistently paired with a particular
   low-frequency contour, both contours had roughly equal overall
   variability, and each contained independent matrilineal-unit distinctive
   information. The only call type that did not differ structurally between
   matrilineal units is reportedly used more in interpod meetings than in
   intrapod contexts. The differences in calling behaviour between
   matrilineal units were similar in form to previously described
   differences between pods, although more subtle. These results suggest
   that pod-specific calling behaviour in resident killer whales arises
   primarily as a consequence of accumulated drift or divergence between
   highly cohesive matrilineal units as they gradually separate into
   different pods. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal

   without major ethical problems. Indeed, the entire corpus cavernosum is
   obtained from the surgery procedure, which allows creating a
   standardized procedure to prepare HCC strip. In addition, human tissue,
   if kept in the fridge in the condition described, does not loose its
   ability to contract to phenylephrine (PE; alpha agonist), angiotensin IT
   (AG II) and KCl up to 4 days. Furthermore, once contracted with PE, HCC
   relaxes to acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent mechanism); sodium
   nitroprusside (endothelium-independent mechanism); cromakalim (CRK), a
   K-ATP channel opener; or alprostadil, a synthetic PGE(2) (ALPR). In
   conclusion, we have standardized a procedure that allows the use of HCC
   strips to evaluate drug activity and/or to study pathophysiological
   mechanisms with an intact functional human tissue up to 4 days from the
   surgery procedure. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To clarify the histological basis for the optical difference in
   the cornea and sclera, we investigated the surface ultrastructure of
   D-periodic collagen fibrils.
   Methods: The fibril arrangement and topology of D-periodic collagen
   fibrils from corneas and scleras of mice were examined by transmission
   and scanning electron microscopy, as well as by atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). The banding patterns were estimated by densitometry and compared
   with the profile made by computer simulation from the protein sequence
   of amino acids.
   Results: Considerable association of proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycanson
   XI bands of corneal D-periodic collagen fibrils was seen with ruthenium
   red staining. Atomic force microscopy imaging showed that the depth of
   the groove in the D-periodicity of corneal collagen fibrils was shallow
   compared with that of the sclera.
   Conclusions: Corneal collagen fibrils are associated with many
   extracellular matrix components on both elevated and depressed surfaces
   of D-periodic bands, which may serve to maintain interfibrillar spaces,
   resulting in corneal transparency. (C) 2000 Japanese Ophthalmological

Abstract = {{Reactive oxygen species act as second messengers in the signal
   transduction induced by inflammatory stimuli such as interleukin-1
   (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS). We have previously shown that both IL-l and LPS induce the
   urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene expression in RC-K8
   human malignant lymphoma cells. Here, we provide evidence that an
   oxidative stimulation by either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) Or menadione
   (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (MQ)), a quinone compound that generates
   reactive oxygen species, causes the up-regulation of uPA expression in
   both RC-K8 cells and H69 human small cell lung carcinoma cells. uPA
   accumulation in their conditioned media was significantly increased
   after treatment with H2O2 or MQ and it was dose-dependent of the
   stimulus. Northern blotting analysis revealed that uPA mRNA levels in
   both RC-K8 and H69 cells were increased approximately 2-fold 9h after
   treatment with H2O2. The half-lives of uPA mRNA were not changed before
   and after H2O2 stimulation. A synthetic antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine
   (NAC), completely inhibited the H2O2-induced uPA mRNA accumulation. The
   inhibition of the on-going protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) did
   not inhibit the H2O2-induced uPA mRNA accumulation. These results
   suggest that the oxidative stress induces uPA accumulation through
   activating uPA gene transcription. Therefore, the stimuli that generate
   reactive oxygen species may influence many biological cell-functions
   mediated by the uPA/plasmin system by regulating uPA expression in
   malignant cells. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of tributyltin (TBT), an endocrine-disrupting
   chemical, on the morphology and viability of cultured rat cortical
   astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes exhibited smooth and planiform
   morphology under normal conditions. Following exposure to TBT, however,
   they showed rapid morphological changes that are characterized by
   asteriated cell bodies and process formation in a time- and
   concentration-dependent manner. Higher concentrations of TBT produced
   progressive cell death of the astrocytes. In serum-free medium, TBT at a
   concentration as low as 200 nM induced the stellation. Pharmacological
   studies revealed that the morphological changes were alleviated by
   application of diverse free radical scavengers or antioxidants such as
   catalase, superoxide dismutase, Trolox, ascorbic acid and
   N-acetyl-L-cysteine, suggesting that TBT-induced stellation is caused by
   oxidative stress involving free radicals, particularly reactive oxygen
   species. Furthermore, we found that the astrocyte stellation was
   abolished by treatment with inhibitors of phospholipase C,
   mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or tyrosine phosphatase. The
   data suggest that TBT causes the stellation through intracellular
   signaling cascades rather than its non-specific toxicity. These findings
   provide an important insight for reconciling the problems in assumed
   aversive actions of this environmental pollutant for mammals.}},

   open conformation of the CO2S-N-SO2C bridge (crystallographic twofold
   symmetry for 2, pseudo-C-2 symmetry for 3 and 4), whereas in 6-8 the
   anions adopt the folded or hair-pin conformation (pseudo-C-s symmetry),
   which is a prerequisite in lamellar structures. The interdependence of
   bond lengths and angles within N-(SO2C)(2) and HN(SO2C)(2) moieties is
   substantiated. In 6-8, the {[}DA18C6](2+) macrocycles exhibit the
   well-known ``biangular{''} C-i conformation and are connected to two
   symmetry related anions by N-H...O hydrogen bonds; structures 4 and 3
   respectively display O-H...N bonded cation-anion pairs or C(O)-O-H...O=S
   mediated anion chains. Weak hydrogen bonds C-H...O are observed in all
   the crystal packings. The hitherto unreported amines HN(Q-4-X)(2), where
   X is C(O)OMe or C(O)NH2, were obtained by treating the corresponding
   dicarboxylic acid with OSCl2 to form the bis(acyl chloride) and
   subjecting the latter to methanolysis or ammonolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic significance of postchemoradiation
   pathologic stage and implications for further therapy following
   preoperative chemoradiation and surgery for advanced/recurrent rectal
   cancer,
   Methods and Materials: Seventy-seven patients with advanced (fixed or
   tethered T4) or recurrent rectal cancer were treated with preoperative
   chemoradation followed by surgical resection of disease. Chemotherapy
   consisted of either of bolus 5-FU 500 mg/m(2) per day or continuous
   venous infusion 225 mg/m2 per day for the duration of radiation,
   Radiation therapy was planned to be delivered to the whole pelvis to a
   dose of 35 Gy followed by a boost to the area of the tumor of 5-15 Gy,
   Total radiation doses ranged from 40 to 63 Gy with a median of 55.8 Gy,
   Surgical resection was then carried out 6-10 weeks following the
   completion of treatment (median, 7 weeks). Twenty-eight patients
   underwent abdominoperineal resection and and 49 patients had
   sphincter-sparing surgical procedures. None of the patients received
   postoperative chemotherapy, Follow-up in these patients ranges from 1
   year to 8 years with a median of 3 years.
   Results: Significant downstaging of disease was observed with 12/77
   (16\%) having no residual disease(pTO) and 13\% (10/77) found to have
   pT1-2, N0 disease, 31\% (24/77) with pT3-4, N0 and 40\% (31/77) for
   pT0-4, N1-2 cancers. Survival by pathologic stage was 100\% for pT0-2,
   NO cancers, 80\% for pT3-4, N0 and 73\% for pTx, N1-2, Local recurrence
   of disease was observed in 0\% of patients with pT0-2, NO as compared
   with 13\% (3/24) in pT3-4, NO and 16\% (5/31) in pT0-4, N1-2 patients.
   Conclusion: Downstaging following preoperative chemoradiation is a
   significant prognostic factor, Patients with pT0, T1, or T2 disease have
   an excellent prognosis and are unlikely to fail locally or with systemic
   disease. However, patient with T3/T4 or N+ disease may benefit from
   further adjuvant chemotherapy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background Tinea capitis is the most common dermatophytosis of childhood
   with increasing incidence. Whereas griseofulvin is considered by many as
   the mainstay of treatment, newer oral antifungal agents, including
   fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine have demonstrated higher
   efficacy, resulting in shorter treatment durations.
   Objectives We aimed to determine the optimum regimen for the treatment
   of childhood tinea capitis with itraconazole.
   Methods A mycological culture outcome-dependent combination of a 28-day
   continuous and facultative additional 14-day courses with itraconazole
   was used in 42 children (20 girls; 22 boys) aged 12-140 months (mean 66)
   with tinea capitis due to Microsporum canis (n = 26) and Trichophyton
   violaceum (n = 16). The drug was given orally according to the patients'
   body weight (50 mg daily for < 20 kg; 100 mg daily for greater than or
   equal to 20 kg) over 4 weeks. Direct microscopy and fungal culture as a
   parameter for efficacy were repeated 2 weeks after termination of
   treatment. Assessment of efficacy was based on the evaluation of results
   from light microscopy and culture at 8 weeks after initiation of
   treatment, and in the case of a further positive mycological culture at
   14 and 20 weeks, respectively. A positive fungal culture at these times
   resulted in an additional course for 2 weeks with the initially chosen
   itraconazole dosage.
   Results In 34 of 42 patients a single 4-week course of itraconazole
   resulted in a complete mycological cure of lesions as demonstrated by
   light microscopy and mycological culture. Four of 42 patients had to be
   treated by a second itraconazole course for 2 weeks, and four children
   received a third course of itraconazole for 2 weeks until all lesions
   showed negative direct microscopy and mycological culture. No abnormal
   haematological or biochemical results occurred. Apart from transient,
   completely reversible indigestion in two children, no side-effects were
   observed.
   Conclusions A culture-based 28-day continuous therapeutic regimen plus
   facultative cultural outcome-dependent additional 14-day courses of a
   body weight-adapted dosage of itraconazole in tinea capitis due to M.
   canis and T. violaceum is discussed; this offers the advantage of an
   effective therapy with complete negative direct microscopy as well as
   negative cultural results, within a shorter active treatment period (cf.
   previous studies with continuous administration of itraconazole).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In a previous study of diltiazem (DTZ) pharmacokinetics in
   renal transplant patients, we speculated that a polymorphic enzyme could
   be involved in O-demethylation of diltiazem. The aim of this in vitro
   study was to investigate whether O-demethylation of DTZ is mediated by
   cytochrome P-450-2D6 (CYP2D6).
   Methods: DTZ was incubated with transfected human liver epithelial
   (THLE) cells expressing CYP2D6 (T5-2D6 clone). Metabolism of DTZ was
   studied over a concentration range of 12.5-400 muM and in the presence
   of quinidine (a CYP3D6 inhibitor) or erythromycin (a CYP3A4 inhibitor).
   THLE cells lacking CYP2D6 activity (TS-neo clone) were used as control.
   The culture medium of the cells, in which DTZ was dissolved, was
   analysed for DTZ and metabolites prior to and after 8 h of incubation
   using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, UV detection).
   Authentic O-demethyl-DTZ (Mx) was not available, and this metabolite was
   therefore not identifiable.
   Results: Desacetyl-O-demethyl-DTZ (M4) was exclusively produced during
   incubations of DTZ with THLE cells expressing CYP2D6. The rate of M4
   formation was described using Michaelis Menten kinetics in the
   concentration range of DTZ used. Production of M4 was inhibited by
   quinidine, but not erythromycin. An unidentified chromatographic peak,
   which was interpreted to be Mr, showed the same pattern of formation as
   M4 both in absence and presence of inhibitors. N-demethylated
   metabolites, formed by CYP3A4, were not observed in any of the cell
   lines.
   Conclusion: Evidence was provided in vitro that O-demethylation of DTZ
   is mediated by the polymorphic isoenzyme CYP2D6. Involvement of CYP2D6
   in the metabolism of DTZ may have clinical implications regarding
   pharmacokinetic variability and interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid, reliable method for the multiresidue analysis of eight commonly
   used fungicides by micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) was
   developed. Excellent separation of the eight fungicides (carbendazim,
   metalaxyl, captan, procymidone, folpet, captafol, vinclozolin and
   iprodione) is achieved within about 10 min by using optimized
   electrophoretic conditions that include the addition of a mixture of
   organic modifiers to the running buffer for improved resolution. The
   sensitivity of the method is enhanced by using an enrichment step that
   involves on-column high-salt stacking. Limits of detection in the
   microgram-per-liter region and relative standard deviations from 2.1 to
   5.9\% are thus obtained for the fungicides without detracting from peak
   resolution. These results reveal that the high-salt stacking method
   provides highly improved sensitivity and enables highly flexible
   adjustment of the selectivity of the separation method. Also, the method
   surpasses other stacking alternatives used in MEKC and affords routine
   analyses of fruit juice containing fungicides at trace levels following
   a straightforward sample treatment. The robustness of the high-salt
   stacking method as demonstrated in this work makes MEKC methods
   involving stacking procedures an attractive choice for routine analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Assisted hatching was first described in 1990. The introduction of an
   artificial opening in the zona pellucida of the developing embryo should
   guarantee successful hatching of the embryo at the blastocyst stage.
   Embryo hatching is essential for subsequent implantation and for
   establishing a pregnancy. The introduction of assisted hatching has
   initiated a controversial discussion about the significance of this
   technique.
   The development of new techniques, such as laser assisted hatching,and
   the increasing knowledge of the hatching process in vitro and in vivo
   has re-opened this discussion. The farmer indications for assisted
   hatching,including maternal age (>38 years), a thick zona pellucida, and
   repeated failure of implantation despite the transfer of good embryos
   are still valid. Whether assisted hatching can raise the pregnancy rate
   following cryopreservation is questionable. Hatching in vivo is
   accomplished by embryonic and uterine factors. The detailed physiology
   of this process and possible disturbances have not yet been elucidated.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background/aims: Toothpastes and mouthrinses containing triclosan have
   been shown to be of some value at inhibiting both plaque and gingivitis.
   However much improved activity can be obtained by the addition of other
   chemicals which increase substantivity or antimicrobial activity. The
   present study was designed to determine whether a new mouthwash
   formulation containing a triglyceride oil was capable of reducing plaque
   reformation when compared to a control rinse containing neither
   triclosan or oil.
   Methods: A total of 24 subjects took part in a double-blind,
   single-centre, crossover study in which rinses were used as the only
   form of oral hygiene over a 4-day period. On the 1st day of each period,
   the subjects were given a prophylaxis to remove all plaque and calculus
   deposits. A single supervised rinse was taken and subsequent 2x daily
   rinses over the following 3 days. 24 and 96 h after the prophylaxis, the
   volunteers returned to the clinic, the plaque disclosed and assessed by
   plaque index and area. The test procedure and wash-out phase were
   repeated until all of the subjects had used both rinses.
   Results: After 24 h, a 12\% reduction in plaque score and a 25\%
   reduction in plaque area was noted for the triclosan/oil rinse compared
   to the control rinse; however, these reductions were not significant
   (p>0.05). After 96 h, the triclosan/oil rinse failed to produce a
   numerical or statistical reduction in plaque whether measured by plaque
   score or area.
   Conclusions: These findings would suggest that the triclosan/oil rinse
   would be of little value at inhibiting dental plaque whether used alone
   or as an adjunct to conventional oral hygiene measures.}},

Abstract = {{We study experimentally the motion of a solid sphere settling under
   gravity in a fluid at rest. The particle velocity is measured with a new
   acoustic method. Variations of the sphere size and density allow
   measurements at Reynolds numbers, based on limit velocity, between 40
   and 7000. At ail Reynolds numbers, our observations are consistent with
   the presence of a memory-dependent force acting on the particle. At
   short times it has a t(-1/2) behaviour as predicted by the unsteady
   Stokes equations and as observed in numerical simulations. At long
   times, the decay of the memory (Basset) force is better fitted by an
   exponential behaviour. Comparison of the dynamics of spheres of
   different densities for the same Reynolds number show that the density
   is an important control parameter. Light spheres show transitory
   oscillations at Re similar to 400, but reach a constant limit speed.}},

Abstract = {{Although the accuracy of job analysis information is critically
   important, standards for accuracy are not clear. Researchers have
   recently begun to address various aspects of job analysis accuracy by
   investigating such things as potential sources of inaccuracy in job
   analysis as well as attempting to reconceptualize our notions of job
   analysis accuracy. This article adds to the debate by first discussing
   how job analysis accuracy has been conceptualized. This points to
   difficulties in the prevalent `true score' model upon which many of
   these discussions have been based. We suggest that discussions of job
   analysis accuracy would benefit from a consideration of the validity of
   job analysis inferences, as a complement to the more traditional focus
   on the validity of job analysis data. Toward this end, we develop a
   model of the inferences made in the job analysis process, outline some
   of the ways these inference could be tested, and discuss implications of
   this perspective. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   Forty-two clinically symptomatic patients with 42 haemodynamically

   treatment the patients were classified into three groups according to
   the angiographic lesions' characteristics summarised as follows: type A,
   a short and concentric stenosis; type B, a tubular lesion, or an extreme
   eccentric lesion; and type C, a diffuse lesion. They were followed after
   PTCBA from one month to six years to compare between the three groups.
   Primary end points were death, stroke, or bypass surgery.
   The clinical success rates in type A, B and C groups were 92\%, 86\% and

   ischaemic stroke / ipsilateral bypass surgery in type A, B and C groups

Abstract = {{Deletions in distal Yq interval 6 represent the cause of 10-15\% of
   idiopathic severe male infertility and map to a region defined AZFc
   (azoospermia factor c). The testis-specific gene DAZ is considered a
   major AZFc candidate, and its deletion has been associated with a severe
   disruption in spermatogenesis. However, DAZ is actually a multicopy gene
   family consisting of seven clustered copies spanning about 1 megabase.
   Only deletions removing the entire DAZ gene cluster together with other
   genes have been reported in infertile males. Because no case of
   spermatogenic failure has been traced to intragenic deletions, point
   mutations, or even deletions not involving all the DAZ copies, the
   definitive proof for a requirement of DAZ for spermatogenesis is still
   debatable. Here we report the first case of a partial deletion of the
   DAZ cluster removing all but one of the copies. This deletion is present
   in a patient affected with severe oligozoospermia who had a testicular
   phenotype characterized by a great quantitative reduction of germ cells
   (severe hypospermatogenesis). The absence of this deletion in the
   fertile brother of the patient suggests that this de novo mutation
   indeed caused the spermatogenic failure.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the development, implementation and evaluation of
   MTutor, a web-based tutorial system, which was developed for students
   undertaking a diploma lever research module.
   The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a problem
   solving approach through an on-line system, to provide additional
   academic support for health care students undertaking a research module.
   The extent to which students found it a useful approach and resource for
   reinforcing teaming and for developing their computer and information
   technology skills was also evaluated. The tutorial was developed around
   a single researchable problem related to communication skills and
   nurse-patient interactions, it was based on an experimental design and
   consisted of four sub-problems supported by a variety of text-based
   resources relevant to the sub-problems. A series of multiple-choice
   questions accompanied each sub-problem and an evaluation questionnaire
   at the end of the tutorial was used to obtain formal feedback on the
   system.
   The evaluation questionnaire revealed that students found the system to
   be easy to use and that the on-line resources provided sufficient
   information with which to answer the tutorial problems. Students felt
   that the tutorial reinforced the taught sessions in the module and that
   working through the problems enhanced their understanding of research
   design. Further piloting of the system is planned to obtain feedback
   from an additional cohort of students as well as lecturers teaching the
   diploma level research module. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{610-617}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The solubility of hydroxyl in coesite was investigated in multianvil
   experiments performed at 1200 degreesC over the nominal pressure range
   5-10 GPa, at an f(O2) close to the Ni-NiO buffer. The starting material
   for each experiment was a cylinder of pure silica glass plus talc, which
   dehydrates at high P and T to provide a source of water and hydrogen
   (plus enstatite and excess SiO2). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectra of the recovered coesite crystals show five sharp bands at 3606,
   3573, 3523, 3459, and 3299 cm(-1), indicative of structurally bonded
   hydrogen (hydroxyl). The concentration of hydrogen increases with
   pressure from 285 H/10(6) Si (at 5 GPa) to 1415 H/10(6) Si (at 10 GPa).
   Assuming a model of incorporation by (4H)(Si) defects, the data are fit
   well by the equation C-OH = Af(H2O)(2)exp(-P DeltaV/RT), with A = 4.38
   H/10(6) Si/GPa, and DeltaV = 20.6 x 10(-6) m(3) mol(-1). An alternative
   model entailing association of hydrogen with cation substitution can
   also be used to fit the data. These results show that the solubility of
   hydroxyl in coesite is approximately an order of magnitude lower than in
   olivines and pyroxenes, but comparable to that in pyropic garnet.
   However, FTIR investigations on a variety of ultrahigh pressure
   metamorphic rocks have failed in all cases to detect the presence of
   water or hydrogen in coesite, indicating either that it grew in dry
   environments or lost its hydrogen during partial transformation to
   quartz. On the other hand, micro-FTIR investigations of quartz crystals
   replacing coesite show that they contain varying amounts of H2O. These
   results support the hypothesis that preservation of coesite is not
   necessarily linked to fast exhumation rates but is crucially dependent
   on limited fluid infiltration during exhumation.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of Salmonella enteritidis infections has greatly increased
   over the last few years. Cardiovascular are amongst the most severe
   extra-digestive complications. The authors report a case of Salmonella
   enteritidis presenting with rupture of a femoral artery mycotic aneurysm
   in a chronic alcoholic patient. Salmonella enteritidis was isolated from
   blood cultures and the operation specimen after the obligatory limb
   amputation. The outcome was finally favourable after appropriate
   antibiotic therapy with a residual, stable grade 3 aortic regurgitation.
   This rare condition is generally observed in immuno-compromised subjects
   and carries a high mortality (40 to 70\% of cases). The initial
   infectious signs may be mashed, and, in these cases, rupture of an
   aneurysm is often the mode of presentation. Rapid treatment is essential
   with, ideally, resection of the aneurysm with reestablishment of
   arterial continuity and adapted, prolonged antibiotic therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 40\% of human breast cancers contain alterations in the
   tumor suppressor p53, The p53 172R-H gain-of-function mutant (equivalent
   to the common 175R-H human breast cancer mutant) has been shown to
   promote aneuploidy and tumorigenesis in the mammary gland in transgenic
   mice and may affect genomic stability in part by causing centrosome
   abnormalities, The precise mechanism of action of these gain-of-function
   mutants is not well understood, and has been studied primarily in
   fibroblast cell lines. A novel p53-null mouse mammary epithelial cell
   line developed from p53-null mice has been used in adenovirus-mediated
   transient transfection experiments to study the properties of this p53
   mutant, Marked centrosome amplification and an increased frequency of
   aberrant mitoses were observed within 72 h of introduction of p53
   172R-H. However, few cells with aberrant centrosome numbers were
   observed in cells stably expressing the p53 172R-H mutant. Furthermore,
   stable expression of this p53 mutant reduced both basal and DNA
   damage-induced apoptosis, This result may be mediated in part through
   abrogation of p73 function. The p53 172R-H mutant, therefore, appears to
   influence tumorigenesis at the molecular level in two distinct ways:
   promoting the development of aneuploidy in cells while also altering
   their apoptotic response after DNA damage,-Murpby, K. L., Dennis, A. P.,

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of long-term chloroquine and ethanol
   administration on renal fluid and electrolyte handling and kidney
   structure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered with
   chloroquine diphosphate (20 mug kg (-1) bw) and/or ethanol (1.6 g kg
   (-1) bw) every third consecutive day for 4 weeks. Urine volume and total
   urinary outputs of Na (+) and K+ were determined from 24-h samples. For
   detailed renal studies, rats were subsequently anaesthetised and
   challenged with a continuous jugular infusion of 0.077 M NaCl at 150 mul
   min (-1) 24 h after the last treatment. After a 3-h equilibration
   period, urine flow, Na+ and K+ excretion rates were determined over a
   4-h period. Plasma concentrations of AVP and aldosterone were measured
   in unanaesthetised rats and in anaesthetised rats after hypotonic saline
   infusion. In separate groups, the rats were anaesthetised with an
   overdose of ether after 4 weeks of treatment and part of the right
   kidney was quickly collected and routinely processed for light
   microscopy. Chloroquine decreased Nai excretion and increased plasma
   aldosterone concentrations in anaesthetised rats. Ethanol alone did not
   alter urinary Na+ outputs or aldosterone levels. Combined chloroquine
   and ethanol increased renal Na+ excretion, but did not affect plasma
   aldosterone levels. In unanaesthetised animals all treatments increased
   aldosterone levels by comparison with control rats. Urinary Na+
   excretion was decreased by separate administration of either chloroquine
   or ethanol, but increased by combined treatment. Microscopic studies
   showed that concurrent chloroquine and ethanol administration induced
   extensive damage of the proximal tubule and collecting ducts cells. The
   results of this study suggest that alcohol consumption and chloroquine
   administration could result in diminished renal function possibly due to
   alteration of renally active hormones or kidney morphology. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Many epidemiological studies have identified chronic alcohol consumption
   as a significant risk factor for cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract
   (UAT) in human. Although acetaldehyde, the first metabolite from ethanol
   by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), is regarded as a carcinogen, how
   systemic production of acetaldehyde particularly affects the UAT remains
   unclear. In our study, we searched for the regional source of
   acetaldehyde in UAT, especially the involvement of bacteria in the human
   normal oral microflora. Here we demonstrate that, among the bacterial
   species identified from the human oral cavity, genus Neisseria had
   extremely high ADH activity and produced significant amounts of
   acetaldehyde when cultured with medium containing ethanol in vitro. The
   ability to produce acetaldehyde was more than 100-fold higher than that
   produced by any other genera we studied. Furthermore, alcohol ingestion
   influences the bacterial composition of the oral microflora, resulting
   in an increased proportion of Neisseria. Although Neisseria present: in
   normal oral microflora is generally non-pathogenic, these findings
   suggest that this microbe can be a regional source of carcinogenic
   acetaldehyde and thus potentially play an important role in
   alcohol-related carcinogenesis in human UAT. Int. J. Cancer 88:342-350,

   that the concentrations of singly- and doubly-ionized helium near the

   the omegatron are too low to account for ionization of helium in the
   local flux tube, therefore the helium is ionized in a hotter region of
   the edge plasma and is transported to the omegatron. A simple
   one-dimensional radial transport model reproduces the observed values of
   charge state flux and density, but only if rapid cross-field transport
   is included, increasing with distance from the separatrix. A constant
   cross-field diffusion coefficient of order 2 m(2)/s and an outward

   filters with Chebyshev approximation of desired attenuation functions.
   The design is quite similar to the Parks-McClellan algorithm, with two
   decisive deviations. The first concerns the choice of a weighting
   function, and secondly, we modify the Remez algorithm in order to be
   able to approximate also nontrivial attenuation functions, Finally, we
   extend our design to minimum-phase FIR filters, which can also equalize
   the phase response of minimum-phase systems. We show that here, phase
   optimization is a consequence of attenuation optimization.}},

   diagnosis was chondrosarcoma in three patients and osteosarcoma in one,
   In two patients total resection of the hemipelvis was required and in
   the other two less, but still massive, resection was undertaken. All
   were treated with an immediate Free vascularised fibular graft which
   included arthrodesis of the hip and reconstruction of the pelvic ring,
   One patient died. The other three have remained free from recurrence.
   Solid union of the graft was achieved between four and 14 months after
   surgery. Shortening of the involved limbs was less than 2 cm, The
   patients had no pain and were independent walkers without external
   support, Emotional acceptance was satisfactory.
   Our results suggest that reconstruction with the use of a free

   Samples were collected from 17,664 asymptomatic individuals for an

   detection rate for colorectal cancer were compared in those with and

   occult blood test was positive in 18.4\% of those with and in 3.8\% of

   deficiency anemia (P<0.05). The highest rate of colorectal cancer was
   found in subjects with both iron deficiency anemia and positive occult

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To analyze the RDH5 gene in patients with fundus albipunctatus
   with and without cone dystrophy and to determine whether the disease is
   stationary or progressive and whether the cone dystrophy is a part of
   fundus albipunctatus or a separate disease.
   METHODS. Fourteen patients from 12 separate Japanese families with
   fundus albipunctatus were examined. Six of the patients from 6 families
   also had a cone dystrophy. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of
   the peripheral blood, and exons 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the RDH5 gene were
   amplified by polymerase chain reaction and were directly sequenced. A
   complete ophthalmic examination was performed including best-corrected
   visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, indirect ophthalmoscopy, fundus
   photography, and electroretinography.
   RESULTS. In all the patients, either a homozygous mutation or compound
   heterozygous mutations in the RDH5 gene were identified. The identified
   mutations were nucleotide position (nt) 103 G to A (Gly35Ser), nt 319 G
   to C (Gly107Arg), nt 394 G to A (Val132Met), nt 719 G insertion (frame
   shift) nt 839 G to A (Arg280His), nt 841 T to C (Tyr281His), and nt 928
   C to GAAG (Leu310 to GluVal). All these mutations except the Arg280His
   were new. The nt 928 C to GAAG mutation was detected in patients with
   and without cone dystrophy. Cone dystrophy was most frequently seen in
   patients over 40 years old.
   CONCLUSIONS. Fundus albipunctatus either with or without cone dystrophy
   is caused by mutations of the RDH5 gene. Cone dystrophy is frequently
   observed in elderly patients with fundus albipunctatus. The conclusion
   was reached that the mutations of the RDH5 gene caused a progressive
   cone dystrophy as well as night blindness.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication process of REBa2Cu3Oy (RE123: RE=Y, Sm, Nd...) system
   superconducting tapes was developed using the Hastelloy substrate by the
   liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) process. The reaction between Hastelloy and
   the Ba-Cu-O melt is prevented by an MgO buffer layer for the melt
   saturated with MgO. The suitable construction for tape processing by LPE
   was consequently found as YBa2Cu3Oy (Y123) < by LPE > /
   YBa2(Cu,Mg)(3)O-y (Y123(Mg)) < by LPE > / MgO / Hastelloy. The
   superconducting properties of the Y123 layer with this construction were
   confirmed on the MgO single crystal substrates. The Y123 / Y123(Mg)/ MgO
   structure revealed a high T-c value of 91 K and a J(c) value of
   1.2x10(5) A/cm(2) (77K, 0T). For short smaples, the Y123(Mg) layer was
   successfully grown on Hastelloy substrate with MgO by the LPE process.
   For the fabrication of long LPE conductors, the ability of the long tape
   LPE apparatus was confirmed as a preliminary study in which the Y123
   layer was grown on the MgO substrates by laterally moving the substrates
   on the melt surface.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The Ikaros gene has been implicated in lymphoid development
   and proliferation from the results of gene targeting studies in mice.
   Recently we reported that the Ikaros gene may be involved in the disease
   progression of chronic myleogenous leukemia (CML), In this report, we
   investigated Ikaros isoforms in human non-lymphoid leukemia cell lines
   and normal granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E)-derived
   colonies.
   Materials and Methods. We evaluated Ikaros gene expression by RT-PCR,
   Southern blotting, sequencing analysis, Northern blotting, and
   immunoblotting.
   Results. Ikaros isoforms Ik-1 and Ik-2,3 were predominantly expressed in
   human non-lymphoid leukemia cell lines. Ik-4 and Ik-8 were also
   detectable as a minor population, In contrast to the previous report in
   mice, multiple Ikaros Isoforms mere expressed in human CFU-GM and
   BFU-E-derived colonies, and the dominant-negative isoform Ik-6 was not
   detectable. me also showed that human Ikaros isoforms contained an
   additional coding sequence In the N-terminal region, which was highly
   homologous to the sequence reported in mice.
   Conclusion. These observations suggest that the Ikaros gene may play
   some role in the development of human non-lymphoid lineage
   hematopoiesis, Moreover, the finding that the dominant-negative isoform
   IK-6, which was overexpressed in patients with blast crisis of CML, was
   rarely detectable in non-lymphoid lineages supports its pathogenetic
   role in human hematologic malignancies. (C) 2000 International Society

Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{The phylogenetic structure of the anemonefish Amphiprion ocellaris was
   established based on sequence data generated for the 5' end of the
   cytochrome b (cytb) gene at 11 sites throughout Southeast Asia.
   Considerable genetic structuring was observed throughout the range of A.
   ocellaris. The region has a complex geography, with the Sunda shelf
   having been exposed during the lower sea levels associated with periods
   of glaciation. The direction of subsequent flooding of the Sunda shelf,
   as a direct consequence of the retreating glacial sheets, can be
   predicted based on the major river drainage systems in the region. Much
   of the phylogeographic structure, including levels of intra-site genetic
   variation, can be explained in terms of the ``seeding{''} of sites on
   the Sunda shelf, by those on the shelf rim, as sea levels rose. We often
   found surface ocean currents in the region, which should influence
   larval dispersal, to be poorly correlated with phylogeographic
   structure. Several geographically close sites, which appear to be
   connected by surface currents, showed significant genetic
   stratification. We hypothesise that the phylogeographic structure of A.
   ocellaris is more reminiscent of the Pleistocene sea level changes than
   surface currents. The high contribution of sea level changes to the
   phylogeographic structure was also supported by several missing
   haplotypes in the generated spanning network. Cytb DNA sequences
   generated for recently recruited A. ocellaris individuals sampled from
   Singapore indicate that, on a local scale, there is a directional inflow
   of recruits, which is dependent on the monsoon seasons. The nature of
   dispersal and genetic structure of reef fish species found on the Sunda
   shelf is clearly complex, and should take into consideration past
   phylogeographic events.}},

Abstract = {{Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are a group of
   heterogeneous diseases that occur after organ transplantation.
   Determination of the origin of the tumor cells not only provides clues
   to its possible pathogenetic mechanism, but also gives prognostic
   guidance in the clinical management of patients. We reviewed the
   clinicopathological features of four cases of PTLD that developed after
   solid organ transplantation. Using microsatellite analysis performed on
   paraffin-embedded tissue and using multiple, highly polymorphic markers,
   we have successfully determined the recipient/ donor origin of the tumor
   cells in all of them. The time of onset of the PTLD ranged from 5 to 11
   mo. All cases were diffuse large cell lymphomas of B-cell lineage, and
   the two cases that have been tested for EBV by in situ hybridization
   were positive. Three of the 4 PTLD were of donor origin and these three
   patients died of diseases unrelated to PTLD. The single patient with
   PTLD of recipient origin died of disseminated PTLD. The mean survival
   length of the three patients with donor origin was 26.3 mo, whereas that
   of the patient with recipient origin was 12 mo. Our results indicate a
   relatively high incidence of PTLD of donor origin among our patients
   with solid organ transplantation, as compared to other reported series.
   Moreover, the finding of the relatively indolent nature of PTLD of donor
   origin supports that determination of the donor/recipient origin of PTLD
   is of prognostic significance.}},

Abstract = {{The Northeast China Transect (NECT), one of the mid-latitude IGBP
   terrestrial transects, runs in parallel to 43 degrees 30' N and ranges
   from 42 degrees to 46 degrees N and from 106 degrees to 134 degreesE.
   The major global change gradient is precipitation decreasing gradually
   from the eastern mountainous region to the middle farmland and then to
   the western pastoral area. Vegetation along the transect varies
   gradually from temperate evergreen conifer-deciduous broad leaf mixed
   forests, deciduous broad leaf forests, woodlands, and shrublands in the
   east to typical steppes and desert steppes in the west, with
   agricultural fields, temperate savannas and meadow steppes in the
   middle. Temporal and spatial climatic variability, especially annual
   precipitation as well as substantial interannual fluctuations and
   innerannual changes, is one of the most notable features of the
   transect. Spatial climatic patterns in the NECT can be defined by three
   important features: a predominantly north-south gradient in mean annual
   temperature (MAT) from less than 3 degreesC in the north-west and in the
   north-east to 3-7 degreesC in the middle; a predominantly west-east
   gradient in mean annual precipitation (MAP) from 100-300 mm in the west,
   300-600mm in the middle, and 600-1000 mn? in the east; and a north-south
   gradient of mean annual potential evapotranspiration (MAPET) that ranges
   from 500-600 mm in the north to 600-700 mm in the south. Temporal
   climatic patterns, the interannual and innerannual variabilities, are
   also high and this temporal variability is highest in the driest and
   coldest portions of the region. Human-induced climate changes will
   result in increases of MAT and MAP, which may in turn influence human
   use of the ecosystems on the NECT. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{contains considerable amounts of extra DNA, which is discarded from the
   somatic founder blastomeres during early cleavage. In Parascaris
   univalens the haploid germline genome is contained in one large compound
   chromosome, which consists of a euchromatic region containing the
   somatic genome flanked by large blocks of heterochromatin. Fluorescence
   in situ hybridization of fractions of the germline-limited satellite DNA
   revealed two highly repeated sequence families establishing the entire
   heterochromatin (HET blocks). The repeats, a pentanucleotide, TTGCA, and
   a decanucleotide, TTTGTGCGTG, constitute separate segments of the HET
   blocks. The blocks are polymorphic in length and, hence, in copy number
   of the repeats, and the arrangement of the segments. The numerous
   sequence variants of both repeats display a disperse distribution. The
   type and rate of base substitutions within both repeat units depend on
   position. Prior to the elimination process in presomatic cells, termed
   chromatin diminution, the chromosomes undergo differential mitotic
   condensation. Interstitial `chromatin linkers' flanking the prospective
   numerous somatic chromosomes remain entirely decondensed. The somatic
   chromosomes are released from the plurivalent chromosomes via excision
   of the linkers at onset of anaphase, followed by exclusion of the
   akinetic linker chromatin and HET blocks from the daughter nuclei. In
   Ascaris suum, the germline-limited satellite, which consists of one 123
   bp repeat, is scattered throughout the numerous chromosomes in small
   heterochromatic knobs of variable sizes, residing at chromosomal ends
   and/or intercalary positions. The programmed breakage, which appears to
   proceed in a similar manner to that in P. univalens, results in the loss
   of all heterochromatic knobs, accompanied by an increase in chromosome
   number. In both species, all germline chromosomes are capped by tracts
   of TTAGGC repeats. In P. univalens, such telomeric tracts also occur at
   the termini of the euchromatic intercalary regions. Upon diminution all
   telomeric tracts are discarded. De novo telomere addition occurs in all
   somatic cell lineages of both species. The presented data shed light on
   the evolutionary history of chromosome aggregation and satellite DNA
   formation, and putative mechanisms involved in the process of
   site-directed breakage to reestablish stable somatic chromosomes.}},

Abstract = {{Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and its endogenous antagonist, the
   interleukin-l receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), play important roles in
   immune responses. In sarcoidosis, IL-1 beta is reported to be increased
   whereas IL-1ra is decreased. It has recently been shown that
   polymorphisms in the IL-1ra and IL-1 beta genes may account for
   variation in the two proteins. These polymorphisms are also reported to
   be associated with several autoimmune diseases. Since this might be
   expected to affect sarcoidosis, an investigation of 108 sarcoidosis
   patients and 113 healthy control subjects was performed.
   The IL-1ra genotype was determined using the polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR), and the IL-1 beta genotype by PCR restriction fragment length
   polymorphism.
   We found no significant differences in IL-ra and IL-1 beta genotypes
   between sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls. Furthermore. there
   was no association between the IL-1 beta genotype and the

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Modern neuronavigation systems lack spatial accuracy during
   ongoing surgical procedures because of increasing brain deformation,
   known as brain shift. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging was used
   for quantitative analysis and visualization of this phenomenon.
   METHODS: For a total of 64 patients, we used a 0.2-T,
   open-configuration, magnetic resonance imaging scanner, located in an
   operating theater, for pre- and intraoperative imaging. The
   three-dimensional imaging data were aligned using rigid registration
   methods. The maximal displacements of the brain surface, deep tumor
   margin, and midline structures were measured. Brain shift was observed
   in two-dimensional image planes using split-screen or overlay
   techniques, and three-dimensional, color-coded, deformable surface-based
   data were computed. In selected cases, intraoperative images were
   transferred to the neuronavigation system to compensate for the effects
   of brain shift.
   RESULTS: The results demonstrated that there was great variability in
   brain shift, ranging up to 24 mm for cortical displacement and exceeding
   3 mm for the deep tumor margin in 66\% of all cases. Brain shift was
   influenced by tissue characteristics, intraoperative patient
   positioning, opening of the ventricular system, craniotomy size, and
   resected volume. Intraoperative neuronavigation updating (n = 14)
   compensated for brain shift, resulting in reliable navigation with high
   accuracy.
   CONCLUSION: Without brain shift compensation, neuronavigation systems
   cannot be trusted at critical steps of the surgical procedure, e.g.,
   identification of the deep tumor margin. Intraoperative imaging allows
   not only evaluation of and compensation for brain shift but also
   assessment of the quality of mathematical models that attempt to
   describe and compensate for brain shift.}},

Abstract = {{The giant diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii is one of the harmful species
   for Nori (Porphyra) culture from autumn to spring in the Harima-Nada,
   eastern part of Seto Inland Sea, Japan. The growth response of C.

   different combinations of temperature (5-30 degreesC) and salinity
   (10-35) under a 130 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 16 h: 8 h LD photo cycle. The
   growth of C. wailesii was observed in most of the combinations examined
   and the maximum growth rate averaged for the four strains was 1.02
   divisions d(-1). The optimum temperature and salinity were 20-25
   degreesC and 20-30, respectively. The range of optimum temperature is in
   good accordance with the field data of water temperature in Harima-Nada
   during the period from October to November, when the autumn bloom of C.
   wailesii occurs. However, the growth rate at 5 to 10 degreesC decreased
   more than half the maximum growth rate. Therefore, the low water
   temperature in Harima-Nada during the period from February to March is
   presumed to be one of the limiting factors that control the spring bloom

Abstract = {{Transient enhanced diffusion of indium implanted in silicon is studied
   in the presence of the end-of-range (EOR) damage layer. To investigate
   the effect of EOR defects on the indium diffusion, the samples that were
   implanted with indium at a high dose (1x10(13)-5x10(14)/cm(2))
   sufficient to produce the amorphous layer were prepared. Transmission
   electron microscopy measurements and Rutherford backscattering
   spectrometry reveal the amorphization threshold of indium implantation
   is around 5x10(13)/cm(2) for 200 keV, In-115(+) implanted with 100 mu
   A/cm(2) beam current density at room temperature. These results are
   consistent with Monte Carlo simulation of implantation. Monte Carlo
   simulations indicate the deviation from the plus one model due to the
   mass effect of indium. After amorphization, following both RTA at 1000
   degrees C and furnace anneal at low temperature (650 and 850 degrees C)
   in nitrogen ambient showed the formation of extrinsic EOR dislocation
   loops below the original amorphous/crystalline interface. During this
   process, strong segregation of indium toward the EOR dislocation loops
   is clearly observed. The profile shift of indium at a concentration of
   1x10(17) atoms/cm(3) is not proportional to the implanted dose. Since
   most interstitials condense into EOR dislocation loops, diffusivity
   enhancement of indium is not proportional to the implant dose above
   amorphization threshold. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{In winter-type white lupin (Lupinus albus L,), an improved understanding
   of the importance of inflorescence levels and yield components among
   environments could be useful when considering selection criteria for
   breeding, We examined inflorescence levels and yield components of
   indeterminate, determinate, and dwarf accessions among a broad range of
   environments. Data mere acquired from date-of-seeding (DOS) and dry
   matter partitioning (DRIP) studies. The DOS studies were conducted from
   1991 to 1993 in north, central, and south Alabama, USA. The DMP studies
   were conducted for 2 Sr in western France and central Alabama. We used
   principal-component analysis to reduce the number of yield components
   for further consideration in future breeding. The first four principal
   components had Eigenvalues >1 and contributed greater than or equal to
   74\% of the variance, Pod number m(-2), seed number m(-2). pod yield
   m(-2), and seed yield m(-2) were highly correlated (r greater than or
   equal to0.80, P less than or equal to0.01) with most principal
   components. The first two to four principal components also had
   biological meaning because yield components that were highly correlated
   with each principal component were associated with a specific
   inflorescence level. Mainstem and primary-branch inflorescence levels
   were most important for yield and yield-component development. Basal
   branches were important in the southeastern USA, but these inflorescence
   levels should be selected against in France. Pod number m(-2) and seed
   weight had the greatest effect on grain yield, Breeding for higher seed
   weight will improve cold tolerance and stabilize grain yield in western
   France, but further testing is needed in Alabama. Selecting germplasm
   with low pod abortion will help increase pod number potential.}},

   Methods: Scheimpflug lens images were recorded in 70 eyes of 38 subjects

   scattering intensity measurements before and after dilatation were
   compared.
   Results: There was a significant positive correlation between the light

   Conclusions: It is possible to estimate the transparency in the anterior

Abstract = {{The a-thrombin peptide, TP508, accelerates the healing of full-thickness
   wounds in both normal and ischemic skin. In wounds treated with TP508, a
   pattern of increased vascularization is consistently observed both
   grossly and microscopically when compared to wounds treated with saline.
   One possible mechanism by which the peptide accelerates wound healing is
   by promoting revascularization of granulation tissue at the injured
   site. To evaluate the angiogenic potential of TP508, the peptide was
   tested in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), where it
   increased the density and size of CAM blood vessels relative to
   controls. Additionally, TP508 stimulated chemokinesis and chemotaxis in
   a dose-dependent fashion in cultured human aortic and human
   microvascular endothelial cells. Taken together, these in vivo and in
   vitro data support an angiogenic role for TP508 in wound healing. A
   working model is presented to explain how this 23-amino-acid peptide,
   which lacks proteolytic activity, is generated during wound healing and
   contributes to the nonproteolytic functions associated with a-thrombin
   during tissue repair. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

   each antigen. The G(L)-OVA and G(L)-6His assays showed the greatest
   specificity while the G(L)-GST assay was slightly more sensitive that
   the G(L)-OVA and G(L)-6His assays; results based on the analysis of 50
   virus neutralisation positive and 50 virus neutralisation negative sera.
   The G(L)-OVA ELISA was selected for further evaluation since it was
   simpler to use than ELISAs based on recombinant antigens and did not
   suffer from background reactivity. The final sensitivity and specificity
   of the G(L)-OVA ELISA were 96.75 and 95.6\%, respectively, results based
   on the analysis of 400 virus neutralisation positive and 400 virus
   neutralisation negative sera. It also detected EAV antibody (100\%
   efficiency) in seropositive shedding stallions and, in ponies infected
   experimentally with the UK93 isolate of EAV, the appearance of virus
   neutralising antibodies and G(L)-OVA ELISA-specific immunoglobulins
   coincided. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the debate on quality management, which has increasingly gained in
   importance in the social sector, too, the concept of the customer and
   the issue of social work being considered part of the services sector
   play a crucial role. In this - thus the author's central thesis - not
   enough attention is paid to the dangers inherent in a rash transfer of
   the customer concept common in the profit-oriented services sector onto
   the field of social services. The uncritical transfer of a management
   rhetoric and its accompanying concepts taking place in the course of the
   debate on quality threatens to blurr the divergent character of
   customer-supplier-structures in social work because the postulated
   services ideal neglects the system-inherent contradictions which emerge
   due to the double mandate and the double customer relation of social
   services. In order to better meet the complexitiy of the customer
   concept and to reach a higher degree of responsiveness in the concrete
   planning of social support, the author proposes to give greater
   attention to the aspects participation, complementarity, and flexibility
   as quality criteria of social work.}},

Abstract = {{1. Resection rates for cholangiocarcinoma (unrelated to primary

   2. Multimodality approaches involving various combinations of
   chemotherapy, irradiation, and surgery increasingly are being used to
   treat cholangiocarcinoma.
   3. The role of liver transplantation in the management of
   cholangiocarcinoma is limited by the perception that it is inappropriate
   to use scarce organs when 5-year survival rates are 25\%.
   4. Liver transplantation is an important intervention in patients with
   tumors that remain unresectable after chemotherapy. The role of liver
   transplantation in patients with extrahepatic disease that responds to
   chemotherapy is controversial. Careful timing of surgery is required to
   avoid secondary drug resistance.
   5. Liver transplantation has been successfully applied to a range of
   rare hepatic malignancies, but small numbers preclude strong

Abstract = {{Background: Curriculum planning is an essential process at any
   institution of learning. Currently, at Indiana University a 1-week
   required otorhinolaryngology clerkship is being considered for removal
   from the curriculum, and this exposure is planned for integration into
   other primary care clerkships. A data collection system for patient
   encounters was created to obtain objective quantitative data about ear;
   nose, and throat conditions in the family medicine clerkship. Methods: A
   total of 445 students filled out 56,151 patient encounter forms that
   contained the diagnoses, patient age, student comfort levels, and
   student responsibilities. Results: Of the 56,151 encounters, 22.9\%
   involved a condition involving an ear; nose, or throat (ENT) diagnosis,
   and the overall top-10 diagnoses reflect a typical family practice. Few
   students reported being given the opportunity to perform procedures.
   Conclusions: It appears that students are receiving sufficient practice
   in taking patient histories and performing initial patient physicals for
   ENT cases and that they see a sufficient number of ENT cases. However
   students had more limited opportunity to perform and/or assist with ENT
   procedures or to be involved with patient education and ENT counseling.
   The number of ENT cases in the third-year clerkship is sufficient, and
   the experience is mostly move than adequate. Our study indicates that
   ENT training is a significant part of the family medicine clerkship, and
   curriculum integration is possible, though concerns about procedural
   skills will need to be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorella virus DNA ligase is the smallest eukaryotic ATP-dependent
   ligase known; it has an intrinsic nick-sensing function and suffices for
   yeast cell growth. Here, we report the 2.0 Angstrom crystal structure of
   the covalent ligase-AMP reaction intermediate. The conformation of the
   adenosine nucleoside and contacts between the enzyme and the ribose
   sugar have undergone a significant change compared to complexes of T7
   ligase with ATP or mRNA capping enzyme with GTP. The conformational
   switch allows the 3' OH of AMP to coordinate directly the 5' PO4 of the
   nick. The structure explains why nick sensing is restricted to
   adenylated ligase and why the 5' phosphate is required for DNA binding.
   We identify a metal binding site on ligase-adenylate and propose a
   mechanism of nick recognition and catalysis supported by mutational
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Needle sharing contributes to the spread of the human immunodeficiency
   virus and other health concerns and remains a persistent problem among
   injection drug users. We determined whether needle sharing may be
   related to the discounting of the value of delayed outcomes. Outpatients
   in treatment for heroin dependence indicated preference for immediate
   versus delayed hypothetical monetary and heroin outcomes in a titration
   procedure that determined indifference points at various delays. The
   degree to which the delayed outcomes lost value was estimated with a
   nonlinear decay model. Participants who agreed to share a needle in a
   scenario (N = 15) discounted delayed money more steeply than did the
   nonsharing group (N = 17). Both groups discounted delayed heroin more
   steeply than delayed money. Persistent needle sharing may be related to
   the relative inability of delayed outcomes to impact current behavior.
   Training to mitigate the effect of delay on outcome value may offer
   reductions in needle sharing and drug abuse. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The incidence and clinical manifestations of disseminated intravascular
   coagulation (DIC) were examined in patients with a range of underlying
   disorders. Out of 1,882 patients suspected as having DIG, 204 cases were
   diagnosed as suffering from DIC and included in this study. The
   underlying disorders experienced by the patients were solid tumors
   (33.8\%), hematologic malignancies (12.7\%), aortic aneurysm (10.8\%),
   infections (6.4\%), post-operative complications (4.4\%), liver disease
   (2.9\%), obstetric disorders (2.5\%), and miscellaneous diseases
   (26.5\%). The incidence of DIC was 10.8\% out of all patients suspected
   of having DIG, and the etiologies were 10.9\% in solid tumors, 10.1\% in
   hematological malignancies, 20.4\% in aortic aneurysm, 12.7\% in
   infections, 15.5\% in post-operative complications, 15.8\% in liver
   disease, 3.7\% In obstetric disorders, and 9.8\% in miscellaneous
   diseases. The clinical manifestations of DIC patients were varying
   dependent on their etiologies. Most DIC patients with aortic aneurysm
   (95.5\%) and postoperative complications (88.9\%) did not reveal any
   clinical manifestations. Although all of the patients with obstetric
   disorders had bleeding, only 20.0\% of the patients had organ failure.
   In contrast, although only 15.4\% of the patients with Infections had
   bleeding, 76.9\% of these patients had organ failure. Bleeding was
   observed in 31.9-50.0\% of DIC patients with liver disease, hematologic
   malignancies, and solid tumors. Organ failure was observed in
   21.7-33.3\% of DIC patients with liver disease, hematological
   malignancies, and solid tumors. Analysis by measurement of plasma levels
   of antiplasmin and plasmin-antiplasmin complex suggested that excessive
   fibrinolysis might contribute to the development of bleeding in these
   DIC patients. Differences in plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin
   complex and cross-linked fibrin degradation products could not account
   for the differences in the incidence of organ failure in the patients.
   These findings suggest that the clinical manifestation of DIC varies and
   might not only be a reflection of microthrombus formation but also a
   reflection of the other underlying pathomechanisms. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {{The effects of rockfall volume on runout distance}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{109-124}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The main goal of this paper is to clarify the effects of rockfall volume
   on its fluidization. For this purpose, outdoor rockfall experiments were
   carried out to analyze runout distances and individual movements of
   rockfall blocks and numerical simulations were conducted for these
   experiments to learn more about the mechanism of rockfall fluidization.
   The rockfall experiments were conducted using an artificial slope on
   which granite slabs were surfaced and overlaid with cubiformed granite
   blocks. The size and number of blocks were varied in this series of
   experiments. Further, numerical simulations were carried out in which
   the coordinates of individual rockfall blocks were traced in
   three-dimensional space from rockfall initiation to final deposition. It
   became clear from the experiments and simulations that the runout
   distance had a positive correlation with the rockfall volume (number of
   rockfall blocks) and the runout distance of the gravity center of
   deposited rockfall mass had a negative correlation with the rockfall
   volume. To clarify the mechanism of these two phenomena, the positions
   of individual blocks from initial arrangements to final depositions were
   traced in the experimental and numerical simulations. This revealed that
   the relative positions of each block along the slope direction were not
   changed during rockfall movement. The reason for the block-sequence
   preservation was that front facing blocks in the initial cube
   arrangement accelerated and rear facing blocks decelerated along the
   slope by internal collision between blocks. Further, as the rockfall
   volume increased, the opportunities for impact among the rockfall blocks
   increased with the front facing blocks pushed farther. Whereas the
   gravity-center of the deposited rockfall mass had an inclination to
   travel shorter distances as rockfall blocks increased according to the
   increase of kinetic energy dispersed by the collision of blocks. (C)

Abstract = {{We sought to determine the mechanisms responsible for the reduced renal
   tissue injury by agonists of A(2A) adenosine receptors (A(2A)-ARs) in
   models of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. DWH-146e, a selective
   A(2A)-AR agonist, was administered subcutaneously to Sprague-Dawley rats
   and C57BL/6 mice via osmotic minipumps, and animals were subjected to
   I/R. I/R led to an increase in plasma creatinine and kidney neutrophil
   infiltration. Infusion of DWH-146e at 10 ng . kg(-1). min(-1) produced a
   70\% reduction in plasma creatinine as well as a decrease in neutrophil
   density in outer medulla and cortex and myeloperoxidase activity in the
   reperfused kidney. Myeloperoxidase activity in kidney correlated with
   the degree of renal injury. P-selectin and intercellular adhesion
   molecule 1 (ICAM-1) immunoreactivity were most prominent in endothelial
   cells of peritubular capillaries and interlobular arteries of cortex and
   outer and inner medulla of vehicle-treated mice whose kidneys were
   subjected to I/R. DWH-146e treatment led to a pronounced decrease in
   P-selectin- and ICAM-1-like immunoreactivity. These data are consistent
   with our hypothesis that A(2A)-AR agonists limit I/R injury due to an
   inhibitory effect on neutrophil adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{In the quiescent state, cattle-manure slurry stratifies into three
   discernible layers, namely a floating scum layer, a bottom sludge layer
   and a watery middle layer. The proportions of top (scum), middle and
   bottom (sludge) layers were approximately 20, 60 and 20\% respectively
   of the volume of the whole slurry. Particulate matter from the different
   stratified layers was characterised for particle size distribution and
   cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin composition. Total solids
   concentrations of top, middle and bottom layers were 12.7, 2.8 and 7.4\%
   respectively. Larger particles were found in the top layer compared with
   the bottom. The top layer contained the highest amounts of Neutral
   Detergent Fibre (NDF), Acid Detergent Fibre (ADF), cellulose and
   hemicellulose, but the lowest amount of Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN).
   The bottom layer contained the highest amounts of Acid Detergent Lignin
   (ADL) and TKN. With increase in particle size, there were increases in
   NDF, ADF, cellulose and hemicellulose, accompanied by decreases in ADL
   and TKN. Biochemical methane potential of the three layers was also
   measured. The top layer was found to produce the most methane with the
   middle layer producing the least. Biomethanation rate from the top layer
   was also the highest. Differences in biomethanation rates and
   biochemical methane potential were attributed to differences in chemical
   composition of the particulate matter. About 48\%, 23\% and 30\% of the
   total chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the top, middle and bottom layers
   respectively of the slurry was found to be degradable.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental rodent studies demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor
   II (IGF-II) promotes fetal growth, whereas the nonsignaling IGF-II
   receptor (IGF2R) is inhibitory; in humans their influence is as yet
   unclear. A soluble, circulating form of IGF2R inhibits IGF-II mediated
   DNA synthesis and may therefore restrain fetal growth. We measured cord
   blood levels of IGF-II, soluble IGF2R, insulin, IGF-I, IGF-binding
   protein-1 (IGFBP-1), and IGFBP-3 and examined their relationships to
   weight, length, head circumference, ponderal index, and placental weight
   at birth in 199 normal term singletons. IGF-II levels correlated with
   levels of IGF-I (r = 0.29; P < 0.0005), IGFBP-3 (r = 0.45; P < 0.0005),
   and soluble IGF2R (r = 0.20; P < 0.005). Insulin and IGF-I were
   positively related to all parameters of size at birth. IGF-II was weakly
   related to ponderal index (r = 0.18; P < 0.05) and placental weight (r =
   0.18; P < 0.05), and the molar ratio of IGF-II to IGF2R was also related
   to birth weight (r = 0.15; P < 0.05). Correlations between the IGFs and
   size at birth were stronger in nonprimiparous pregnancies; in these,
   IGF-I (r = 0.52; P < 0.0005), IGFBP-3 (r = 0.41; P < 0.0005), and the
   IGF-II to IGF2R ratio (r = 0.40; P < 0.0005) were most closely related
   to placental weight, together accounting for 39\% of its variance. We
   demonstrate for the first time relationships between circulating IGF-II
   and soluble IGF2R levels and size at birth, supporting their putative
   opposing roles in human fetal growth.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid prototyping using the binder jet method has recently been
   established and has already produced excellent results in industrial
   applications. The authors recently developed a technique for producing a
   full-scale model from computed tomographic (CT) data with the binder jet
   method as an approach to overcome the shortcomings of the laser
   lithography method, which is already widely used in medicine. They
   conducted a comparative investigation of full-scale models made with
   both techniques using a dry skull to determine the accuracy of the
   models. It was clearly demonstrated that the accuracy of the binder jet
   method was high enough to be used in craniomaxillofacial surgery because
   it was the same as the laser lithography method. This study employed
   data from the latest helical volume scan computed tomography device
   using a multidetector. The study showed that the new rapid prototyping
   technique was satisfactory in terms of speed, cost, installation
   environment, and accuracy of models, and that detailed shapes and
   structures can be reproduced well. Because this technique has many
   advantages over the laser lithography method, it should play a major
   role in craniomaxillofacial surgery and in other medical fields in
   combination with advances in CT devices. Although plaster is a more
   suitable fixation material when the emphasis is on the reproducibility
   of detailed structures, the binder jet method using starch is extremely
   useful for simulating operations and determining implant shapes because
   it allows for the prompt production of models.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the effect of methyl esters, acetyl groups, and
   neutral sugar side-chains on the gelation properties of sugar beet
   pectin with Ca(2+). Sugar beet pectin was treated in the presence of
   Ca(2+) with the enzymes pectin methyl esterase (PE), pectin acetyl
   esterase (PAE), rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterase (RGAE),
   arabinofuranosidase B (AF) and rhamnogalacturonase (RGase) in various
   combinations.
   Addition of RGAE plus PE or PAE plus PE to the pectin-Ca(2+) mixture
   significantly increased the release of acetyl groups and methyl esters,
   in comparison to the addition of only PE or PAE. This indicates that PE
   activity is hindered by the presence of acetyl groups both in the
   `smooth' and in the `hairy' regions. Also the PAE activity is hindered
   by the presence of methyl groups in the `smooth' regions. Treatment with
   PAE plus PE led to a stiffer gel, as determined by the storage modulus
   (G'), than treatment with PE alone, while RGAE plus PE did not improve
   the gel forming properties. Addition of only PAE to the pectin-Ca(2+)
   mixture did not result in gel formation. A lower stiffness of the gel
   was found when RGase combined with RGAE and PE were added to the
   pectin-Ca(2+) mixture, in comparison to treatment with PE alone.
   Addition of AF plus PE to the pectin-Ca(2+) mixture gave similar
   rheological effects as treatment with only PE.
   A fraction representing the `smooth' homogalacturonan regions, which was
   obtained after treatment of the beet pectin with RGase and subsequent
   size-exclusion chromatography, was also able to form a gel with Ca(2+)
   and PE. However, the gel formation was much slower, and the stiffness of
   the gel was lower than when the parental extract was used. Also with the
   modified pectin the treatment with PAE plus PE gave an increased
   stiffness of the gel in comparison to PE alone. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The metabolic profile test (Payne) characterises from the investigation
   of the blood of the 3-5\% of animals, whether the nutrition of the whole
   herd is sufficiant. In it the most important metabolic parameters are
   investigated (proteins, macroelements, blood plasma glucose and some
   other basic blood parameters). The aim was to determine the possibility
   of addition of the glycated protein parameters (glycated hemoglobin,
   Glib and serum/plasma fructosamine, SeFa) to the above mentioned ones.
   Blood samples of high yielding Holstein Friesian cows (n=32) were
   examined from two weeks before till six weeks after calving, in every
   two weeks (Table), Focusing on the parameters of the carbohydrate
   metabolism the basic values of Glib, SeFa, and blood plasma glucose and
   their changes in the critical state of the reproductional biology were
   described (Figure 1.), A close, significant retrospective correlation
   was found between GHb and the 4 weeks earlier, and between SeFa and the
   two weeks earlier measured blood plasma glucose concentration (r=0.95
   and 0.97, respectively) (Figure 2.). Thus, beside of the actual blood
   glucose level which is determined from the blood sample on the same day,
   SeFa and GHb determined at the same time give about the carbohydrate
   metabolism and energy supply for the previous 2 weeks and for the
   earlier 4 weeks, respectively a more accurate and more realistic
   information, than the concentration of the blood plasma glucose. (The
   latter one changes after the neurohormonal changes at every time). So,
   the suitable change of feeding regime can be done in time for the
   prevention of possible metabolic disorders (e.g, ketosis). It might be
   especially important in the case of the highly valuable, high yielding
   dairy cows (and similarly in some other species) to think about the
   possibility of adding the glycated parameters to the metabolic profile
   test.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid-stress Mindlin plate finite element and its sensitivity
   derivatives are presented. The element is triangular and has a simple
   nodal configuration with three corner nodes and C-o type nodal
   variables. The use of independent field assumptions for displacements
   and stresses removes the necessity for an in-plane shear correction
   factor. The element can effectively be used as the bending part of facet
   shell elements. Its simplicity and accuracy makes it ideal for
   large-scale analysis and design problems. The sensitivity derivatives
   are obtained by analytical and semi-analytical methods for the thickness
   and shape design variables, respectively. The well-known deficiency of
   the classical semi-analytical method in the shape design of flexural
   systems is alleviated by using a series approximation for the
   sensitivity derivatives and considering the higher order terms. The
   accuracy of the proposed formulations in computing displacements,
   stresses and sensitivity derivatives is verified by numerical examples.

Abstract = {{Our objective was to characterize the properties of an intravascular
   ultrasonographic contrast agent in examination of adnexal masses and to
   compare contrast agent properties between benign and malignant adnexal
   tumors. Fifty-eight consecutively examined women with suspected ovarian
   tumors were examined preoperatively by power Doppler ultrasonography,
   first without and then with contrast agent enhancement (Levovist).
   Fourteen women had ovarian cancer, 3 had borderline ovarian tumors, 18
   had benign ovarian neoplasms, and 23 had functional adnexal cystic
   masses or endometriomas. The effect of the contrast agent was evaluated
   visually and by using computerized power Doppler signal intensity
   measurements. In visual evaluation, the brightness of the power Doppler
   signal and the amount of recognizable vascular areas increased in each
   tumor contrast agent administration. The number of vessels in power
   Doppler ultrasonograms, both before and after contrast agent
   enhancement, was significantly higher in malignant than in benign
   adnexal masses, as also was the increase in the number of recognizable
   vessels after contrast agent administration. Contrast agent uptake time
   was significantly shorter in malignant than in benign tumors. No
   significant differences were found in the power Doppler signal
   intensities or their changes between benign and malignant tumors. In
   conclusion, use of sonographic contrast agent facilitates imaging of
   tumor vessels. For differentiation of benign and malignant tumors, the
   kinetic properties of the contrast agent, such as uptake and washout
   times, may have more potential than the use of the contrast agent in
   anatomic imaging of the tumor vessels.}},

   at the implant surface related to the exothermic setting reaction of
   autopolymerizing acrylic resins applied to an attached abutment was
   examined in vitro. Two brands of autopolymerizing acrylic resin, Duralay
   and GC Pattern Resin, were compared. Acrylic resin was applied to a
   titanium alloy abutment connected to a titanium alloy cylindric implant
   in varying controlled volumes, with both bulk application and brush
   paint-on techniques. The implant was embedded in an acrylic resin
   mandible in a 37 degreesC water bath. Temperature changes were recorded
   via embedded thermocouples at the cervical and apical of the implant
   surface. Analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to compare
   treatment groups. A mean maximum increase in temperature of 4 to 5
   degreesC was seen at the implant cervical for both materials, with a
   maximum temperature increase of 6 degreesC. No difference between
   Duralay and GC Pattern Resin was seen, except for bulk application to
   medium-sized copper bands at the implant cervical (P < .05). No
   difference between the bulk and brush techniques was seen for all

Abstract = {{SiC-SiCf ceramic matrix composites (CMC) are candidate structural
   material for fusion power reactor applications because of their
   favourable thermo-mechanical and low-activation properties. Among their
   different manufacturing techniques, present, the most employed ones are
   chemical vapour infiltration (CVI) and polymer infiltration and
   pyrolysis (PIP). These two techniques are based on the common principle
   of filling the porosity among the fibres with SIC resulting from
   precursor decomposition. CVI process deposits high purity crystalline
   SiC with good properties onto fibres whereas PIP leaves lower
   characteristic amorphous SiC with traces of oxygen between fibres. PIP,
   on the other hand, seems to be much more industrially effective than
   CVI. In the attempt to maximise the properties and reduce costs, some
   work has been done on the so called `hybrid techniques' in which CVI and
   PIP are both employed. The work performed by ENEA and FN S.p.A, consists
   of a series of combined CVI-PIP process cycles and the subsequent

Abstract = {{Apolipoprotein IV (apo A-IV) has been related to fat absorption and to
   the activation of some of the enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.
   Several polymorphic sites within the gene locus for apo A-IV have been
   detected. Previous studies have shown that the A-IV-2 isoform produces a
   different plasma lipid response after the consumption of diets with
   different fat and cholesterol content. The present study was designed to
   evaluate whether the apo A-IV 360His polymorphism could explain, at
   least in part, the interindividual variability observed during
   postprandial lipemia. Fifty-one healthy male volunteers (42 homozygous
   for the apo A-IV 360Gln allele (Gln/Gln) and nine carriers of the
   A-IV-360His allele), homozygous for the apo E3 allele, were subjected to
   a vitamin A-fat load test consisting of 1 g of fat/kg body weight and 60
   000 IU of vitamin A. Blood was drawn at time 0 and every hour for 11 h.
   Plasma cholesterol (C), triacylglycerol (TG), and C, TG, apo B-100, apo
   B-48, apo A-IV and retinyl palmitate (RP) were determined in lipoprotein
   fractions. Data of postprandial lipemia revealed that subjects with the
   apo A-IV 360His allele had significantly greater postprandial levels in
   small triacylglycerol rich lipoproteins (TRL)-C (P < 0.02), small TRL-TG
   (P < 0.01) and large TRL-TG (P < 0.05) than apo A-IV 360Gln/Gln
   subjects. In conclusion, the modifications observed in postprandial
   lipoprotein metabolism in subjects with the A-IV 360His allele could be
   involved in the different low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C responses
   observed in these subjects following a diet rich in cholesterol and
   saturated fats. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights

   of the branched alkanes. Part of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   PAH and alkyl PAH was also degraded. The very low biodegradability of

   temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and
   common and analogous points are elucidated. In relation to this, the

Abstract = {{Crystals of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta With optimal T-c=95 K have been
   underdoped using two different methods and the superconducting gaps have
   been obtained by tunneling. In some cases, three different tunneling
   geometries have been utilized: point contact, STM and break junctions.
   The first doping method involves control of the oxygen content by
   annealing in various partial pressures of oxygen. These crystals exhibit
   a narrow spread of gap values over a wide doping range from overdoped
   (T-c=56 K) to underdoped with T-c=70 K. However, for underdoped crystals
   with T-c midpoints in the range 25 K - 63 K, there is a dramatic
   increase in the spread of gap values which may signal the development of
   static phase separation of either chemical or electronic origin. To
   avoid possible chemical phase separation, we have explored another
   doping procedure which incorporates Dy substitution on the Ca site.
   These crystals exhibit a relatively narrow superconducting transition
   width and some preliminary tunneling spectra will be presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) error
   detection and correction technique for a highly inflectional Indian
   language, Bangla, the second-most popular language in India and
   fifth-most popular language in the world. The technique is based on
   morphological parsing where using two separate lexicons of root words
   and suffixes, the candidate root-suffix pairs of each input string, are
   detected, their grammatical agreement is tested and the root/suffix part
   in which the error has occurred is noted. The correction is made to the
   corresponding error part of the input string by means of a fast
   dictionary access technique. To do so, the information about the error
   patterns generated by the OCR system are examined, and some alternative
   strings are generated for an erroneous word. Among the alternative
   strings, those satisfying grammatical agreement in root and suffix are
   finally chosen as suggested words. In the list of suggested words
   generated by the system, the desired word is available in 84.22\% cases.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and the mechanical and tribological properties of
   polyamide 6 (PA6) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) polyblends with
   and without the compatibilizing agent maleic anhydride propylene were
   studied. Polyplending was carried out in a modular intermeshing
   co-rotating twin-screw extruder. The blended materials were injection
   molded to provide the test samples. Polyblends with 20, 40, 60, and 80\%
   polyamide 6 in high density polyethylene were obtained. The mechanical
   properties were studied in terms of the tensile strength, hardness and
   elongation-to-break. Friction and wear experiments were run under
   ambient condition in a pin-on-disk machine with the composite pin riding
   on the flat surface of a steel disk at a sliding speed of 1 mis and
   under a normal load 19.6 N. It was found that the tensile strength of
   polyblends increased when polyamide proportion was more than 20 wt.\%
   and hardness increased with any polyamide proportion. The coefficients
   of friction of all polyblends were lower than those of the polymers. The
   best polyblends for low coefficient of friction and high wear resistance
   were 60 wt.\% PA6-40 wt.\% HDPE and 80 wt.\% PA6-20 wt.\% HDPE. The wear
   behavior is explained in terms of the ability of the polyblends to form
   transfer film on the steel counterfaces. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Abstract = {{The melt-spun glassy Zr60-xNbxAl10Ni10Cu20 (x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20at\%)
   alloys were found to exhibit a large supercooled liquid region
   (DeltaT(x)) exceeding 42 K before crystallization. The largest DeltaT(x)
   far the glassy alloys containing Nb reaches as large as 82K for the
   Zr55Nb5Al10Ni10Cu20 alloy. The glass transition temperature (T-g)
   increases and the DeltaT(x) value decreases with increasing Nb content.
   The corrosion behavior of the Zr-(Nb)-Al-Ni-Cu glassy alloys was
   examined by mass toss (=weight loss) and electrochemical measurements.
   In 1N HCl solution at 298 K, the addition of Nh for replacing some
   portion of Zr is effective in improving the corrosion resistance of the
   investigated Zr-based glassy alloys. The corrosion rate significantly
   decreases with increasing Nb content. The pitting potential and open
   circuit potential rise with Nb content. In 3\%NaCl solution, the
   addition of Nh effectively increases the pitting: potentials of the
   glassy alloys. In 1N H2SO4 solution, the corrosion rates of the glassy
   alloys are 10(-4) similar to 10(-3) mm.y(-1) (1 mm.y(-1) = 0.317
   pm.s(-1)). They are spontaneously passivated and have a wide passive
   region with significantly low passive current density. The open circuit
   potential increases with an increase in Nb content.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is a
   unilateral analgesic technique that has been advocated in both acute and
   chronic thoracic and abdominal pain. Other blocks such as interpleural
   and epidural can be effectively used in pleuritic pain. This report
   illustrates that TPVB could also be effective fur this kind of pain.
   Methods: A 45-year-old man with acute pancreatitis was referred to the
   critical care unit 11 days after emergency admission with severe left
   pleural effusion and acute respiratory failure. His medical history
   revealed hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):
   in addition, he was a heavy drinker and smoker. A pleuritic pain that
   only slightly improved with nonopioid analgesics and opioids resulted in
   the patient's increasing inability to eliminate bronchial secretions. In
   an attempt to avoid endotracheal intubation. the pain unit recommended a
   continuous paravertebral block. The block was performed at T9 on the
   left side. An initial bolus of 15 mt bupivacaine 0.25\% was administered
   and a continuous infusion, initially at 5 mL/h. was increased up to 10
   mL/h to achieve the desired analgesic effect.
   Results: After the block the verbal analogue scale decreased from 9 to
   3. and this level of pain relief was maintained until the end of the
   treatment 48 hours after the block. The patient improved and was
   discharged to the ward without the need for endotracheal intubation.
   Conclusions: This case report supports the notion that, in practice, the
   paravertebral block could be an effective and safe alternative to relief
   of pleuritic pain.}},

Abstract = {{Defatted meat and bone meal (MBM) was prepared by the removal of
   extractable fat with isopropyl alcohol. Proteins in the defatted MBM
   were extracted with 0-4\% NaCl concentrations with 0.05\% CaCl2 or
   0.05\% MgCl2 at pH 5.5-6.6 for 1 h at 50 degreesC and precipitated at pH
   4.0-4.5. By using the salt extraction procedure, MBM protein concentrate
   (MBMPC) (32 g) was obtained from defatted MBM (100 g). Recovery of
   protein was dependent on the extraction temperature employed; recovery
   values ranged from 33.2 to 51.4\%. At 4\% NaCl concentration, MgCl2
   increased protein solubility by 30\%, compared to the control. The
   adhesiveness of MBMPC at various pH values ranging from 5.0 to 9.0 was
   investigated. At pH 6.0-8.0, adhesiveness of MBMPC showed the highest
   value (78.2 kg). The adhesiveness increased linearly as the MBMPC
   concentration increased up to 20\% with respect to temperature for MBMPC

Abstract = {{Background.-Histopathologic features of early recurrent hepatitis C
   after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) may be modified by
   immunosuppressive therapy or complicated by other conditions. Hepatitis
   C virus (HCV) RNA level usually increases after OLTx, but its
   correlation to histologic findings is not clear.
   Objective.-To evaluate the histologic findings of early recurrent
   hepatitis C in liver allografts and its correlation to serum HCV RNA
   level.
   Methods.-We studied 14 patients who underwent OLTx for chronic HCV
   infection. Thirty liver biopsy specimens and HCV RNA levels of 22
   corresponding plasma samples obtained during the first 6 months
   following OLTx were analyzed. The control group (9 patients, 25 biopsy
   specimens) was chosen at random from patients with chronic liver disease
   other than HCV who were undergoing OLTx, and all tested negative for HCV
   RNA by polymerase chain reaction after OLTx.
   Results.-Statistically significant pathological features of early
   recurrent HCV infection were the number of acidophilic bodies, piecemeal
   necrosis, lymphocyte predominance in the portal tracts, and fibrous
   septum. These findings and histologic activity index scores increased
   with time after OLTx. The HCV RNA levels determined by branched DNA
   assay showed no significant correlation with histologic features,
   However, patients with higher histologic activity index scores tended to
   have higher RNA levels.
   Conclusions.-Liver biopsy specimens are helpful for the diagnosis or
   confirmation of early recurrent hepatitis C in liver allografts, but
   serial biopsy specimens are sometimes required for definite diagnosis.
   The HCV RNA levels are usually higher in patients who display signs of
   more severe liver damage.}},

Abstract = {{Modern French political geography began as a response to Ratzel's
   Politische Geographie and then became an attempt to place ratzelian
   ideas into the context of French geographical thought. What then emerged
   was a political geography which was set firmly in opposition to German
   geopolitics. There were some geographers who felt that a more effective
   response could be made by developing an indigenous French geopolitics.
   This can be seen as being the origin of the alternative geopolitics
   which was favoured by some American geographers during and after World
   War II and which subsequently became an important underlying theme in
   the new geopolitics which arose in the 1970s. The concept of an
   alternative geopolitics has owed a great deal to the French school of
   geography and has it roots in the original response of Vidal de la
   Blache to Ratzel. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   is the best in reproducing the INS profile, this was calculated from the
   atomic displacement matrix of the pyridine molecule. DFT proved to be
   the most suitable option reproducing the above-mentioned spectrum, for
   both wave numbers and intensities. Secondly, in order to approximate the
   calculated spectrum to the observed one, the initial force constants
   matrix calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G{*}{*} level was symmetrized using
   a set of independent symmetry coordinates (C(2v)) All the diagonal and
   some off-diagonal force constants were fitted until the difference
   between observed and calculated spectra was minimized. Good agreement
   between both calculated and experimental INS spectra supports the

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to monitor feeding activity of gilthead sea
   bream (Sa) and red porgy (Pp) and to investigate the hereditary effects
   on feeding in their hybrids (female Sa X male Pp, female Pp X male Sa),
   obtained after artificial crosses. trill fish groups were held in 500-1
   tanks under ambient temperature (15-25 degrees C) and light conditions
   (daylength from 9 h 30 min to 14 h 48 min). Fish (initial body weight
   100-165 g) were fed by means of self-feeders, which were connected to a
   computer, recording fish feeding activity for a year. Results showed
   that there was a 24-h periodicity in all fish types over the experiment.
   Ln their daily feeding patterns, both parental species were diurnal: red
   porgies had a stable daily pattern over the experiment, while gilthead
   sea bream shifted their activity from a general daylight fluctuation in
   warm periods to an afternoon peak in cold periods. The Sa X Pp hybrids
   showed intermediate feeding patterns compared to their parents in warm
   periods and a pattern that was similar to the red porgy in cold periods,
   while the Pp X Sa hybrids had rather unchangeable daily feeding
   patterns, which were not related to the parental ones. The proportion of
   night feed demands increased in cold periods independent of fish group.
   The relationship between temperature and feed intake was
   species-dependent. Finally, this study indicated that feeding expression
   in hybrids was related to the combination of the parental genome,
   supporting our hypothesis for a hereditary influence on feeding activity
   in fish. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   general multifractal scaling form. This makes impossible its affiliation

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare the efficacy of fluorescence in situ hybridization
   (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in detecting the HER-2/neu
   alteration in human breast cancer.
   Patients and Methods: Unselected stage I, II, and III breast cancer
   patients (N = 900) were tested for HER-2/neu gene amplification by FISH
   in paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed archival material. Of these
   samples, 856 were tested for HER-2/neu overexpression by
   non-antigen-retrieval IHC with the polyclonal antibody R60, the
   sensitivity and specificity of which wets preliminarily compared with
   the United Stares Food and Drug Administration-approved HercepTest (Dako
   Corp, Carpinterb, CA). Patient survival wets analyzed in relation to the
   presence of the HER-2/neu alteration as determined by these two
   methodologies.
   Results: A total of 189 (21\%) of 900 patients were positive by FISH and
   147 (17.2\%) of 856 were positive by IHC. This discrepancy is consistent
   with expected loss of IHC sensitivity associated with tissue
   fixation/embedding. The HercepTest did not improve sensitivity and
   introduced false positives. Comparison of R60-based IHC with FISH
   demonstrates that patient survival is associated progressively to gene
   amplification level as determined by FISH, whereas for IHC an
   association is found only in the highest(3+) immunostaining group. Among
   FISH-negative tumors, 45 (6.6\%) of 678 were IHC-positive, with a
   survival probability similar to that of FISH-negarive/IHC-negative
   cases; FISH-positive/ IHC-negative patients have a survival probability
   similar to that of FISH-positive/IHC-positive cases.
   Conclusion: IHC does not consistently discriminate patients likely to
   have a poor prognosis, whereas FISH provides superior prognostic
   information in segregating high-risk from lower-risk beast cancers.
   HER-2/neu protein overexpression in the absence of gene amplification
   occurs infrequently in breast cancer, in which case, patient outcome is
   similar to that of patients without the alteration, (C) 2000 by American

Abstract = {{An industrial titanium dioxide process produces a gypsum byproduct rich
   in iron oxides (red gypsum). Dissolution of red gypsum when applied to
   soil may be affected by the presence of the oxides due to adsorption of
   sulfate. This may affect red gypsum's suitability as a sulfur source for
   crops compared with other forms of gypsum. In addition, the oxides could
   act as a sink for metal cations, again by adsorption. Adsorption
   behavior depends on the properties of the material. Characterization
   showed that the gypsum and iron oxide were present as discrete
   particles, and that these components had very large surface areas. The
   iron oxides were a mixture of crystalline and amorphous hydrated forms.
   They had a point of zero net charge (PZNC) of 6.5. The affinity of
   anions for adsorption on the iron oxide material was in the order:
   phosphate > sulfate > nitrate > chloride. Metal cation adsorption
   revealed an affinity order of Pb > Cu > Ni > Zn > Cd for the iron oxide
   material and Pb > Zn > Cd > Cu > Ni for red gypsum. In a soil column
   dissolution experiment, retention of SO42- by adsorption on the soil was
   not evident. Only a pelleted form of the red gypsum appeared to be
   effective at providing sulfate at a controlled rate. In contrast to
   sulfate, phosphate was strongly retained in the amended soil columns,
   while there was little retention of nitrate. Metal cation adsorption on
   the red gypsum suggested that it could be beneficial as an amendment in
   soils that have potentially toxic metals present.}},

   cold-acclimated and heat-acclimated rock pigeons (Columba livia). In
   general, the cutaneous evaporative cooling mechanism is not activated by
   appropriate stimuli in cold-acclimated pigeons in contrast to
   heat-acclimated pigeons. We studied with electron microscopy whether the
   differences in the function of the skin are reflected in the structure
   of the epidermal water barrier of these two extreme acclimation states.
   The epidermis of cold-acclimated pigeons is attenuated, and the
   underlying dermis lacks any intimate vascularization. Both the
   extracellular and the intracellular domains in the stratum corneum
   contain organized lamellar lipids. At the stratum transitivum-stratum
   corneum interface, multigranular body secretion is indicated by the
   highly convoluted cell membranes and membraneous sacculae enclosing the
   multigranular bodies. Alternatively, multigranular bodies retain in the
   corneocytes, and the lipoid material originated from them is reprocessed
   to broad lamellae. The keratohyalin (KH) granules are spotlike and
   oriented as cortical bands beneath the plasma membrane. In
   heat-acclimated pigeons, the epidermis displays modified patches side by
   side with basic structural type of epidermis. The modified areas are
   characterized by hypertrophy and abundance of dermal capillaries
   adjacent to the hypertrophied patch. No lamellar lipids are discerned in
   the dilated extracellular space. The structure of multigranular bodies
   is abnormal, and the numbers of lipid droplets in the outer viable
   epidermis and stratum corneum are decreased. The transitional cells
   contain stellate KH granules, which form a network throughout the cell.
   It is concluded that cold-acclimated pigeons have a lamellar,
   extracellular water barrier, the cutaneous water evaporation is
   minimized, and heat is stored in the body core. Acclimation to heat
   leads to formation of structurally heterogeneous skin. The structurally
   modified skin patches show disruption of the barrier-forming machinery
   in the multigranular bodies and marked reorganization of fibrillar
   proteins and electron-dense KH masses in the transitional layer. Thus
   water barrier adjustments in cold- and heat-acclimated pigeons manifest
   the dynamic function of avian skin as a thermoregulatory organ. J.

Abstract = {{The ruminal degradation kinetics of the dry matter (DM) and crude
   protein (CP) of citrus pulp, tomato pomace (dehy), soybean, sunflower,
   and oat hulls, and the apple pomace were evaluated by the In situ
   technique. Three rumen fistulated weathers were used. The citrus pulp
   undegradable fraction was low (0.34 and 1\% for the DM and CP,
   respectively), which resulted on the high effective degradation values
   (76.07 and 64.3\% for the DM and CP, respectively). The tomato pomace
   (dehy) soluble fraction was low, as far as the DM (12.96\%) and CP
   (14.85\%); were observed also a high lignin contents and acid detergent
   insoluble nitrogen; and the effective degradability was 34.9 and 41.72\%
   for the DM and CP respectively. The soybean hulls undegradable DM
   fraction was high (18.94\%), however, its DM degradation rate was high
   (0.095 h(-1)) and the effective degradations attained values of 53.59\%
   and 54.01\% for DM and CP, respectively. The main characteristic of the
   oat hulls was its high soluble protein fraction (72.24\%). The apple
   pomace DM and CP ruminal degradation profiles showed logistical behavior
   with long discrete lag times, being the parameters estimated by a
   specific model developed to fit them. Values of 72.95 and 54.82\% for
   the DM and CP ruminal degradations, respectively, were estimated for

Abstract = {{Recent studies with thymocytes have suggested a critical role for
   intracellular potassium in the regulation of apoptosis. In this study,
   we examined the pathways of K+ regulation during ovarian cell death. In
   initial studies, fluorographic analysis demonstrated a significant loss
   of K+ during apoptosis stimulated by doxorubicin in oocytes and trophic
   hormone deprivation in granulosa cells. In oocytes, suppression of
   potassium efflux by potassium-enriched medium prevented condensation,
   budding, and fragmentation, although it did not block DNA degradation,
   suggesting the existence of potassium-independent nucleases in oocytes.
   Culture of granulosa cells in potassium-enriched medium inhibited
   internucleosomal DNA cleavage, although high-molecular weight DNA
   cleavage was apparent, suggesting that the nuclease or nucleases
   responsible for generating 50-kilobase (kb) fragments in these cells is
   potassium independent. To address this directly, isolated granulosa cell
   nuclei were stimulated to autodigest their DNA, and internucleosomal,
   but not large-fragment, cleavage was completely blocked by 150 mM
   potassium. We next examined whether the proapoptotic caspases are
   targets for potassium regulation. In cell-free assays, processing of
   pro-interleukin-1 beta and proteolysis of cellular actin by recombinant
   caspase-1 and caspase-3, respectively, were suppressed by the presence
   of 150 mM potassium. Other monovalent ions (NaCl, LiCl) exerted a
   similar effect in these cell-free assays. Thus, in oocytes and granulosa
   cells, potassium efflux appears to occur early in the cell death program
   and may regulate a number of apoptotic events including caspase activity
   and internucleosomal DNA cleavage. However, there also exist novel
   potassium-independent pathways in both ovarian germ cells and somatic
   cells that signal certain apoptotic events, such as large-fragment DNA
   cleavage.}},

   velocity was increased in subjects with elevated blood pressure (right
   common carotid: 72.5 +/- 2.0 cm/s vs. 62.7 +/- 2.5 cm/s, left common
   carotid: 72.0 +/- 1.8 cm/s vs. 63.9 +/- 2.0 cm/s, p < 0.001). Peak blood
   velocity was significantly correlated with systolic blood pressures
   between 135 and 160 mmHg (r = 0.47 in right common carotid, 0.45 in left
   common carotid, n = 123, p < 0.001). No correlation was found between

Abstract = {{Background. Although the first reports of infection due to
   penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae in the United States
   were in children, these strains have circulated widely in recent years,
   with the prevalence increasing dramatically among the elderly. Regional
   surveillance of pneumococcal susceptibility profiles may assist
   clinicians in management decisions, increase awareness of this microbial
   threat, and target potential areas of intervention.
   Methods. As part of ongoing surveillance, we surveyed single-patient
   pneumococcal blood isolates in our 440-bed Staten Island community
   teaching hospital from June 1, 1996, through May 31, 1998.
   Results. Overall, of 47 single-patient isolates, 16 (35\%) were
   penicillin nonsusceptible. Of 35 isolates from adults, 15 (44\%) were
   nonsusceptible, compared with 1 of 12 (8\%) from children. Seven of the
   nonsusceptible isolates (44\%) were from persons greater than or equal
   to 65 years old and represented 47\% of the isolates from this age
   group.
   Conclusions. Community-acquires penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococcal
   bacteremia is not simply a pediatric problem, but also a threat to the
   elderly.}},

Abstract = {{A fusion reactor will be a fairly complex system consisting of many
   components. All the components are required to produce plasma and
   control it. Some of the components will be large, and for economic
   reasons, there will not be spares for all the components. It is
   therefore important to have a system whereby troubles are communicated,
   recorded and analyzed. Such a trouble report system has been in place at
   the DIII-D tokamak facility for many years. The purpose of the system is
   to easily facilitate communication between the people that discover
   problems and those that fix the problems. The trouble sheets are logged
   into a computer database that is used to characterize the kind of
   problems that the facility experiences, and determine which equipment,
   software, or human errors are causing significant downtime. The
   information is also used to evaluate whether sufficient maintenance is
   done to the equipment and to provide a basis for replacing it. The
   original system was based on paper forms. Before the end of its first
   year in operation, the system was changed to a web-based system. In the
   new system a trouble report is filled out using a web browser, and the
   information is emailed to the repair personnel and managers as soon as
   the form is submitted through the web. The study will discuss the
   problems experienced at the DIII-D facility, and how the information is

Abstract = {{Gravity-assist trajectories to Jupiter, launching between 1999 and 2031,
   are identified using patched-conic techniques. The classical
   trajectories, such as the Venus-Earth-Earth gravity assist, and many
   less conventional paths, such as Venus-Mars-Venus-Earth, are examined.
   Flight times of up to about seven years are considered. The
   DeltaV-optimized results confirm that Venus-Earth-Earth is the most
   effective gravity-assist trajectory type, with launch opportunities
   occurring almost every year and launch vis viva for ballistic
   trajectories as low as 9 km(2)/s(2). If the Earth is excluded as a flyby
   body, Venus-Venus-Venus gravity assists are typically the best option,
   with launch vis viva for ballistic trajectories as low as 30 km(2)/s(2),
   although in some years nonconventional paths are better, such as a
   ballistic Venus-Mars-Venus-Venus trajectory in 2012, with a launch vis
   viva of 16 km(2)/s(2). NonconventionaI paths, such as
   Venus-Mars-Venus-Earth with a 3.7-year flight-time trajectory in 2021,
   can occasionally decrease the time of flight significantly, at very
   minor DeltaV cost, when compared with the classical types.}},

Abstract = {{New rat models are being developed at an exponential rate, making
   improved methods to cryopreserve rat embryos extremely important.
   However, cryopreservation of rat embryos has proven to be difficult and
   expensive. In this study, a series of experiments was performed to
   characterize the fundamental cryobiology of rat fertilized 1-cell
   embryos (zygotes) and to investigate the effects of different
   cryoprotective agents (CPAs) and two different plunging temperatures
   (T-p) on post-thaw survival of embryos from three genetic backgrounds.
   In the initial experiments, information on the fundamental cryobiology
   of rat zygotes was determined, including 1) the hydraulic conductivity
   in the presence of CPAs (L-p), 2) the cryoprotectant permeability
   (P-CPA), 3) the reflection coefficient (sigma), and 4) the activation
   energies for these parameters. P-CPA values were determined for the
   CPAs, ethylene glycol (EC), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and propylene
   glycol (PG). Using this information, a cryopreservation method was
   developed and the cryosurvival and fetal development of Sprague-Dawley
   zygotes cryopreserved in either EC, DMSO, or pc and plunged at either
   -30 or -80 degreesC, were assessed. The highest fetal developmental
   rates were obtained using a T-p of -30 degreesC and EG (61.2\% +/-
   2.4\%), which was not different (P > 0.05) from nonfrozen control
   zygotes (54.6\% +/- 3.0\%).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify specific caretaker and utilization
   characteristics predictive of the use of the emergency departments (EDs)
   for nonurgent reasons. Each year more than 20 million children in the
   United States seek medical care in EDs. Between one third and one half
   of these visits are for nonurgent reasons.
   Design: A descriptive study conducted during a 6-month period.
   Setting: Two urban hospital EDs.
   Measure: A questionnaire was designed to elicit information about
   specific caretaker characteristics and their reasons for using the ED
   for their child's nonurgent medical care.
   Subjects: Two hundred caretakers and children brought to the ED for
   nonacute medical care. Caretakers in this study included mothers (82\%)
   with a mean age of 30 years, single caretakers (70\%), and unemployed
   caretakers (60\%). The average age of the children was 6.2 years.
   Results: Most caretakers (92\%) reported having a continuity physician
   for their children. Caretakers who reported being taken to the ED when
   they were children (P<.002) and those with Medicaid insurance (P<.001)
   were more likely to view the ED as the usual site of care. Being a
   single parent was a predictor for nonurgent visits (P<.05).
   Conclusions: Predicting which caretakers are at risk for using the ED
   for nonurgent care when their children are sick provides the primary
   care physician a means of identifying specific patients who may benefit
   from interventions designed to promote a more cost-effective approach to
   using medical resources.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Inherited predisposition to cancer is a complex issue, and risk
   assessment, counseling, and management are multidisciplinary tasks. An
   infrastructure is needed through which clinical services may be
   delivered and research activities conducted.
   Methods: The Swiss Institute for Applied Cancer Research (SIAK) Network
   for Cancer Predisposition Testing and Counseling was established in
   1999. The goals of the Network are to set common standards for clinical
   services, to coordinate research activities, to address psychosocial and
   ethical issues concerning genetic counseling and testing, and to
   translate the knowledge gained into medical practice.
   Results: An algorithm for genetic testing and counseling of the families
   studied by the SIAK Network centers has been established in a consensual
   process. Eight regional centers currently operate according to this
   algorithm. Furthermore, a proposal has been submitted for the setup of a
   Swiss databank for the characterization of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation
   patterns and the identification of potentially unique mutations in
   probands who seek genetic counseling and testing at the respective
   centers of the SIAK Network.
   Conclusion: Our coordinated effort will ensure state-of-the-art genetic
   testing and counseling services in Switzerland and will allow us to
   acquire knowledge for appropriate risk assessment and
   surveillance/prevention strategies for individuals with an inherited
   cancer predisposition. (C) 2000 by American Society of Clinical

Abstract = {{In the past decade, there have been dramatic changes in Mexico in public
   opinion and support for sexuality education. The growing recognition
   that young people are sexually active before marriage and need
   information in order to make responsible choices is the result of
   intensive health promotion efforts by public and private entities. This
   paper is about the work of a Mexican non-governmental organisation,
   IMIFAP, which has designed and evaluated sexuality education programmes
   for children from pre-school age through adolescence and for their
   parents, based on formative research. IMIFAP has also been advocating
   with others for the wider provision of sexuality and life skills
   education in schools,work that was rewarded in 1998 when the Ministry of
   Education announced its support for comprehensive sexuality education in
   the standard school curriculum. IMIFAP's strategies for formula ting,
   implementing and evaluating an integrated programme of sexuality
   education in a developing country and advocating for its inclusion in
   national curricula, could ser ve as a model which others can adapt.}},

Abstract = {{Label-free heterogeneous phase detection critically depends on the
   properties of the interfacial layer. We have obtained high-density
   monomolecular poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layers by solvent-free
   coupling of homo-bifunctional PEGs (2000 g/mol) at 75 degreesC to silica
   surfaces silanized with glycidyloxipropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPTS).
   Characterization by ellipsometry and contact angles revealed that PEG
   layers up to 3.4 ng/mm(2) with low roughness and flexibility were
   obtained. Specific and non-specific binding at these PEG surfaces was
   monitored by reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS). No
   significant non-specific adsorption upon incubation of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin
   was detectable (< 10 pg/mm(2)), and 150 pg/mm(2) upon incubation of 10\%
   calf serum, less than 10\% of the amount adsorbed to the sorely
   silanized surfaces. The terminal functional groups of the PEG layers
   were utilized to couple ligands and a protein. Specific protein
   interaction with these immobilized compounds was detected with
   saturation loadings in the range of protein monolayers (2-4 ng/mm(2)).
   The excellent functional properties, the high stability of the layers,
   the generic and practical coupling procedure and the versatility for
   immobilizing compounds of very different functionality make these PEG
   layers very attractive for application in label-free detection with
   silica or metal-oxide based transducers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Abstract = {{Background. Offspring of people with type 2 diabetes underestimate their
   risk of developing the disease and know little about primary prevention.
   However, education about risk might cause psychological harm. Aim, To
   examine cognitive and psychological effects of education about personal
   risk.
   Method. Patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from randomly
   selected general practices. One of their adult offspring was randomly
   selected and randomly allocated into one of three groups:
   1. Group 1: given an initial interview, education, and a final
   interview;
   2. Group 2: given an initial and final interview; and
   3. Group 3: given one interview only.
   Psychological outcomes were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and
   Depression Scale (HAD) and Positive Well-Being Scale (PWB) scores.
   Results, Sixty-nine per cent (105/152) of eligible offspring
   participated. Ninety-one per cent (96/152) completed the study.
   Comparing first and final interviews, in Group 1, significantly fewer
   responders at final interview (after education) thought that their risk
   of developing diabetes was `low' (65\% versus 41\%, P = 0.027), while in
   Group 2, there was no significant change in risk perception (P = 0.13).
   Significantly fewer people in the educated group (Group I, final
   interview) than in the control group (Group 3) thought their risk of
   developing diabetes was `low' (41\% versus 77\%, P = 0.002). Risk
   education did not affect total HAD scores or PWB scores significantly.
   Conclusion. Educating offspring of people with type 2 diabetes in this
   way about their risk of diabetes and possible preventive strategies
   increases their perception of personal risk but does not cause
   psychological harm.}},

Abstract = {{Gas hold-up is one of the most important parameters characterizing the
   hydrodynamics of bubble columns. A study is presented about the gas
   hold-up in gas-liquid slugging columns. Expansion of liquid columns is
   measured for a wide range of superficial velocities of bubbling gas, and
   the data are compared with available theory. The experiments were
   performed with liquids of different kinematic viscosities, in columns of
   22 mm, 32 mm and 52 mm internal diameters and the initial liquid heights
   were greater than 2.5 m.
   A discussion is presented based on the effects of the flow pattern in
   the wakes of the Taylor bubbles and on coalescence of bubbles. When the
   flow regimes in the liquid and in the wake are both turbulent or both
   laminar, the theory predicts the gas hold-up. When the flow in the wake
   is turbulent and in the main liquid is laminar, the experimental gas
   hold-up is higher than predictions. This disagreement is explained by
   the shape of the liquid velocity profile emerging from the wake and by
   the long length, between bubbles, needed to restore the laminar profile
   in the liquid.}},

Abstract = {{Videotapes, through vividly displayed clinical images and teaching
   interactions, an valuable tools for both learners and teachers. Visual
   images in combination with verbal instruction have been shown to
   significantly increase recall and retention. Many clinicians and medical
   teachers are aware of videotape resources, but have not had a chance to
   develop their use in medical education. In this paper, we discuss
   creative applications of videotapes in three major categories:
   presenting information, triggering discussion, and as a tool for direct
   self-observation and feedback. Videotapes may be valuable for presenting
   information in settings of didactic instruction; for triggering
   discussion during teaching workshops; and for self-observation of
   patient-doctor interactions and learner-teacher encounters, The article
   presents learner-centered approaches to review a videotaped clinical
   encounter in order to enhance value and comfort for the learner and
   teacher. Sources of tapes include on-site videotaping, published
   educational tapes and commercial tapes shown in accordance with fair use
   guidelines, examples of which are referenced. Videotapes add another
   dimension to traditional sources of physician education.}},

Abstract = {{Differentiation between Parkinson's disease (PD) and other
   neurodegenerative disorders with parkinsonian features, such as multiple
   system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and
   corticobasal degeneration (CBD), is difficult on clinical,grounds. We
   studied the pattern of dopaminergic degeneration in 18 patients with
   probable MSA, 8 patients with PSP, 4 patients with CBD, 48 patients with
   PD and a similar degree of disability, and 14 control subjects per
   forming single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 20 hours
   after injection of {[}I-123]beta -CIT. Overall striatal binding was
   significantly reduced in MSA (-51\% of normal mean), PSP (-60\%), CBD
   (-35\%), and PD (-58\%), without overlap with control values. Asymmetry
   of striatal beta -CIT binding was significantly increased in patients
   with CBD and PD, as compared with control subjects. Although asymmetry
   seemed to be less pronounced in MSA and PSP than in PD, this was not
   statistically significant. Putamen-caudate nucleus ratios in patients
   with PD, MSA, and PSP, but not with CBD, were significantly reduced, as
   compared with control subjects. In conclusion, {[}I-123]beta -CIT SPECT
   reliably enables the visualization of the presynaptic dopaminegic lesion
   in patients with MSA, PSP, and CBD. In most patients, however, it does
   nor seem to be possible to differentiate these disorders from PD with
   this method.}},

Abstract = {{The vibron model for anharmonic vibrations of simple polyatomic
   molecules has been modified by explicit inclusion of the bending energy
   in the vibron hamiltonian, and by incorporating vibrationally and
   rotationally dependent terms into the main parameters of the model.
   These modifications keep the simple form of the basic vibron energy
   expressions unchanged but make them far more flexible and capable of
   much higher precision than those of the pure algebraic vibron model,
   even one with all squares and binary products of the Casimir operators
   included. Applications of the modified equations to the vibrational
   levels and rovibrational energies of the linear molecules HCN, CO2, and
   some of their isotopomers show that this modified model yields precision
   of fitting which is better by one to two orders of magnitude than that
   provided by the strict algebraic model. This suggests that the modified
   vibron model can provide a simple but useful alternative to the much
   more elaborate global treatments of the rovibrational data. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Previous work has demonstrated that in the hippocampal CA1 region of
   Sprague-Dawley rats, there are ethanol-sensitive and ethanol-insensitive
   populations of GABAergic synapses on pyramidal neurons. The present
   experiments characterized the ethanol sensitivity of these pathways in
   lines of rats and mice genetically selected for sensitivity or
   insensitivity to the behavioral effects of ethanol. In ethanol-sensitive
   inbred long sleep mice, GABA(A) IPSCs induced by stimulation of proximal
   (probably somatic) synapses were enhanced by 80 mM ethanol, whereas the
   distal (i.e., dendritic) pathway was unaffected. Thus, the relative
   sensitivity of these pathways (proximal. distal) is the same in both
   Sprague-Dawley rats and in inbred long sleep mice. However, in the
   ethanol-insensitive inbred short sleep mice, neither proximal nor distal
   IPSCs were affected by 80 mM ethanol. The ethanol sensitivity of the
   proximal pathway was also examined in replicate lines of rats selected
   for either high ethanol sensitivity or low ethanol sensitivity. GABA(A)
   IPSCs in the high ethanol sensitivity lines were significantly enhanced
   by 80 mM ethanol, whereas IPSCs in the low ethanol sensitivity lines
   were unaffected. Thus, IPSCs evoked via the proximal pathway were
   enhanced by ethanol in all the sensitive mouse and rat lines, and
   unaffected in all the insensitive lines. These experiments demonstrate
   that GABA(A) synapses in brain differ in their sensitivity to
   enhancement by ethanol, and the sensitivity to such enhancement is under
   the control of genes that can be selected for using classical genetic
   selective breeding based on a behavioral phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Ralstonia eutropha H16 mediates the reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to
   nitrous oxide (N2O) with two isofunctional single component
   membrane-bound NO reductases (NorB1 and NorB2). This reaction is
   integrated into the denitrification pathway that involves the successive
   reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen. The norB1 gene is co-transcribed
   with norA1 from a sigma (54) (RpoN)-dependent promoter, located upstream
   of norA1. With the aid of norA1'-lacZ transcriptional fusions and the
   generation of regulatory mutants, it was shown that norB1 gene
   transcription requires a functional rpoN gene and the regulator NorR, a
   novel member of the NtrC family of response regulators. The regulator
   gene maps adjacent to norAB, is divergently transcribed and present in
   two copies on the megaplasmid pHG1 (norR1) and the chromosome (norR2).
   Transcription activation by NorR responds to the availability of NO. A
   nitrite reductase-deficient mutant that is incapable of producing NO
   endogenously, showed a 70\% decrease of norA1 expression. Addition of
   the NO-donating agent sodium nitroprusside caused induction of
   norA1'-lacZ transcription. Truncation of the N-terminal receiver domain
   of NorR1 interrupted the NO signal transduction and led to a
   constitutive expression of norA1'-lacZ. The results indicate that NorR
   controls the reductive conversion of NO in R. eutropha. This reaction is
   not strictly co-ordinated on the regulatory level with the other
   nitrogen oxide-reducing steps of the denitrification chain that are
   independent of NorR.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design: A masked, single-factor, posttest-only control group
   design.
   Objective: To explore the relationship between reported oral
   contraceptive use and peripheral joint laxity.
   Background: Studies have found an association between increased
   ligamentous laxity and changes in serum levels of hormones such as
   estrogen, progesterone, and relaxin. Two of these hormones, estrogen and
   progesterone, are present in most oral contraceptives. Oral
   contraceptive users, therefore, provide a population for studying the
   effects of these hormones on the degree of ligamentous laxity.
   Methods and Measures: Fifty-five women between the ages of 20 and 25
   years participated in this study. Thirty users of oral contraceptives
   were a test group and 25 nonusers of oral contraceptives were controls.
   The KT-1000 Arthrometer was used to measure passive anterior translation
   of the tibia in relation to the femur in both knees. Passive abduction
   and adduction of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the second
   digit of the nondominant hand and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint
   hyperextension of the fifth digit of the nondominant. hand were measured
   using a goniometer. A subjective measurement of passive second PIP joint
   motion was also assessed and a value of minimum, moderate, or maximum
   laxity was assigned. Independent sample t tests were performed to
   compare the measurements of the oral contraceptive user and nonuser
   groups for each joint. A chi-square test compared the subjective PIP
   joint data between the 2 groups.
   Results: No significant differences in laxity measurements at the knee
   or hand were found between the 2 groups. Average knee laxity varied
   between 5.7-7.9 mm of anterior displacement for both groups. Average PIP
   abduction and adduction varied between 6.5-6.7 degrees for both groups
   and DIP hyperextension was 28.6-29.9 degrees.
   Conclusions: Results of this study indicate that self-reported oral
   contraceptive use was not associated with peripheral joint laxity.}},

Abstract = {{Aim-To investigate the reproducibility and sensitivity of the Zeiss
   retinal vessel analyser, a new method for the online determination of
   retinal vessel diameters in healthy subjects.
   Methods-Two model drugs were administered, a peripheral vasoconstrictor
   (the a receptor agonist phenylephrine) and a peripheral vasodilator (the
   nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside) in stepwise increasing doses.
   Nine healthy young subjects were studied in a placebo controlled double
   masked three way crossover design. Subjects received intravenous
   infusions of either placebo or stepwise increasing doses of
   phenylephrine (0.5, 1, or 2 mug/kg/min) or sodium nitroprusside (0.5, 1,
   or 2 mug/kg/min). Retinal vessel diameters were measured with the new
   Zeiss retinal vessel analyser. Retinal leucocyte velocity, flow, and
   density were measured with the blue field entoptic technique. The
   reproducibility of measurements was assessed with coefficients of
   variation and intraclass correlation coefficients.
   Results-Placebo and phenylephrine did not influence retinal
   haemodynamics, although the a receptor antagonist significantly
   increased blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside induced a significant
   increase in retinal venous and arterial diameters (p<0.001 each),
   leucocyte density (p=0.001), and leucocyte flow (p=0.024) despite
   lowering blood pressure to a significant degree. For venous and arterial
   vessel size measurements short term coefficients of variation were 1.3\%
   and 2.6\% and intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.98 and 0.96,
   respectively. The sensitivity was between 3\% and 5\% for retinal veins
   and 5\% and 7\% for retinal arteries.
   Conclusions-These data indicate that the Zeiss retinal vessel analyser
   is an accurate system for the assessment of retinal diameters in healthy
   subjects. In addition, nitric oxide appears to have a strong influence
   on retinal vascular tone.}},

Abstract = {{The pine shout beetle, Tomicus piniperda (L.), is an exotic pest that
   is: regulated by federal quarantines in the United States and Canada.
   Mark-release-recapture experiments were performed with infested logs
   coated with fluorescent powder to determine if overwintering beetles in
   logs would leave a mill yard if infested logs were transported to
   sawmills in uninfested areas. Overwintering T. piniperda adults were
   marked with powder as they emerged in spring. Dispersal studies were
   conducted in four simulated mill yards and five operational sawmills to
   determine whether T. piniperda would colonize only the log pile in which
   they overwintered, fly to nearby log piles, or disperse beyond the mill
   yard. Each simulated mill yard was composed of 36 uninfested red pine
   logs, Pinus resinosa Air. (Pinaceae), and 12 alpha -pinene-baited funnel
   traps set up to 100 m from a central release pile of six uninfested red
   pine and nine infested logs of Scotch pine, Pinus sylvestris L. At the
   five operational sawmills, baited funnel traps were set up to 400 m
   outside of each mill yard. Overall, 482 T. piniperda galleries were
   found on the experimental logs recovered from the four simulated mill
   yards combined. Tomicus piniperda adults dispersed and attacked the most
   distant logs at 100 m from the release point in the simulated mill
   yards. Likewise, adults were captured in baited funnel traps at
   distances up to 230 m in simulated mill yards and 250 m around
   operational sawmills. Although numbers of recaptured T, piniperda were
   generally low, in all cases some adults dispersed outside the mill yards
   despite the presence of abundant suitable bleeding material. Therefore,
   logs containing overwintering adults pose a risk of spreading T.

Abstract = {{In this study, two lead-free solder alloys, namely 50 tin-50 bismuth
   (Sn-Bi) and 96.5 tin-3.5 silver (Sn-Ag), were studied for their use in
   surface mount solder joints, They have been considered as potential
   replacements for 63 tin-37 lead (Sn-Pb) solder. All joints were
   subjected to various cycles of thermal shock with temperature ranging
   from -25 to 125 degreesC. Shear tests were conducted on joints with and
   without thermal shock treatment. Another thermal shock cycle (-25 to 85
   degreesC) was carried out on Sn-Bi solder joints for comparison. Their
   performance against thermal shock was compared with eutectic Sn-Pb
   solder by evaluating their residual shear strength and studying their
   microstructural change.
   For the Sn-Ag solder a fine rod-like Ag3Sn intermetallic was formed in
   the solder matrix after the thermal shock. On the other hand, Bi-rich
   and Sn-rich phases appeared in the Sn-Ei solder after the -25 to 125
   degreesC thermal shock, Moreover, fine cracks were observed along the
   Bi-rich grain-like phase boundary. These were not observed in the Sn-Bi
   solder with the -25 to 85 degreesC thermal shock treatment.
   Voids and cracks were also observed in the joint of Sn-Bi solder alloy
   after 1000 thermal shock cycles. In addition, the thickness of
   intermetallic compound (IMC) of three solder alloys gradually grew with
   the number of thermal shock cycles, These defects reduced the strength
   of solder joint and led to thermal fatigue failure. In general, the
   shear strength is found to decrease with increasing number of thermal
   shock cycles, The Sn-Ag solder was better than the Sn-Bi solder in terms
   of residual thermal shock shear strength. Sn-Bi solder showed good
   properties when it was treated with the -25 to 85 degreesC thermal
   shock. It has a strong potential to replace Sn-Pb solder in low
   temperature applications such as consumer electronics. The Sn-Ag solder
   is suitable for high temperature applications.}},

Abstract = {{A new stability criterion that can be used to assess the standing
   condition of a subject from center of pressure (CoP) measurements is
   presented. This criterion can be applied, for example, to control a
   standing prosthesis, which should allow a paraplegic subject to stand
   up, sit down and stand safely without using hands for support.
   Experiments conducted with able-bodied subjects enabled us to establish
   a relationship between its stability and the subject's CoP position.
   Four CoP stability zones were identified: high preference, low
   preference, undesirable and unstable zones. The high preference zone is
   defined as the area where the CoP is found 99\% of the time during quiet
   standing. The area where the CoP is found during the remaining 1\% of
   the time is called the low preference zone. The undesirable zone is
   defined as the CoP area where the subject is forced to change posture in
   order to maintain balance, and the unstable zone is defined as the CoP
   area in which the subject is forced to step forward, backward or
   sideways to maintain stability. A general model of the proposed four
   stability zones was derived, which can be used to compute stability
   zones a priori for any subject and thus allows one to assess the
   subject's stability condition from the CoP measurements. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This study sought to delineate the impact of the rate pressure product
   on intraluminal Doppler velocity measurements and to determine the
   relation between poststenotic vasodilator reserve and percent luminal
   obstruction in coronary vessels. Twenty patients with single-vessel
   coronary disease were studied prior to coronary angioplasty and at
   follow-up 6 months later. Intracoronary velocity reserve after
   administration of adenosine was measured distal to the stenosis with a
   Doppler-tipped guide wire and was compared to quantitative coronary
   angiography and adenosine myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. The rate
   pressure product was confirmed as significant covariate (ANCOVA, p <
   0.005) of intracoronary Doppler reserve. When normalized to rate
   pressure product, poststenotic Doppler velocity reserve in stenosed
   arteries was significantly lower than in patent arteries as classified
   by quantitative coronary angiography (1.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.5, p <
   0.001) and perfusion scintigraphy (1.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.5, p <
   0.001). Normalized Doppler velocity reserve showed a nonlinear but
   highly significant relation to percent area stenosis {[}y = 3.0.(1 -
   exp{[}0.081 (x - 100)]), p < 0.001]. When normalized Doppler velocity
   reserve was less than 2.0, coronary disease was identified with 95\%
   specificity and 94\% sensitivity in comparison to perfusion
   scintigraphy. Thus, in coronary arteries poststenotic Doppler reserve
   and percent area stenosis show a significant nonlinear relation. Doppler
   velocity reserve when normalized to rate pressure product can be used to
   characterize the hemodynamic impact of coronary obstructions. Copyright

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this work was to determine the optimal imaging
   parameters far minimization of metallic susceptibility artifacts during
   gradient echo (GRE) imaging.
   Method: We performed GRE imaging of titanium screws in a nickel-doped
   agarose gel phantom, systematically varying several parameters to
   characterize and quantify susceptibility artifacts.
   Results: The greatest reduction in artifact size came from using a short
   TE; increasing the frequency matrix and decreasing the slice thickness
   also contributed substantially to reducing the artifact size. Whenever
   possible, implanted prostheses should be aligned with the main magnetic
   field to minimize artifact size. Parameters with negligible effect on
   artifact size included bandwidth, phase encode matrix, and field of
   view.
   Conclusion: Radiologists can easily adjust the above parameters in their
   imaging protocols to improve GRE image quality in patients with
   implanted metallic devices.}},

Title = {{Acute pancreatitis associated with administration of a nitric oxide

Journal = {{IN VIVO}},

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors have been
   investigated as potential cytotoxic agents to treat tumors lacking p53
   function. Furthermore, their ability to reduce tumor blood flow can be
   combined with drugs that are specifically designed to kill cells are
   hypoxic or to improve temperatures during local heat (hyperthermia)
   treatment of tumors. This paper reports the unexpected development of
   acute pancreatitis in two rumor-bearing pet dogs that were treated with
   the NOS inhibitor, N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) during
   administration of local hyperthermia. Methods: Prior to the use of
   L-NAME in tumor-bearing dogs, purpose-bred beagles were studied.
   Following induction of inhalation anesthesia, local hyperthermia was
   applied to either normal muscle (beagles) or tumors (tumor-bearing
   dogs). Once a thermal steady state was achieved, L-NAME was administered
   and temperature monitoring continued. Animals were observed after
   treatment for evidence of toxicity. Results: The beagles tolerated the
   treatment well, with no side effects noted either clinically or by
   routine CBC or blood chemistry analyses. In contrast, the first two
   tumor-bearing dogs accrued onto the phase I study developed acute
   pancreatitis in the immediate post-treatment period which necessitated
   hospitalization and intensive care. The trial was stopped. Both dogs had
   intercurrent risk factors which predisposed them to development of
   pancreatitis, although neither had a history of symptoms of pancreatitis
   at the time the hyperthermia + L-NAME treatment was given. Conclusions:
   We conclude that caution should be exercised when considering NOS
   inhibition for cancer treatment. Careful evaluation of history and
   health status as well as recognition of potential risk factors may be
   key in avoiding potentially fatal complications. The study demonstrates
   the value of performing potentially harmful treatments in tumor-bearing
   dogs prior to introduction into the human clinic.}},

Abstract = {{Active control of nonlinear aeroservoelastic (NL-ASE) systems is a key
   technology for future aircraft development, Because of the large number

   controller design. A design methodology based on an ASE system being
   governed by the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations is presented. The
   controller design procedure Involves shaping the Lagrangian to a desired
   form and providing channels to dissipate energy. We consider EL systems
   with arbitrary Lagrangians and give sufficient conditions for local
   asymptotic stability and passivity. Parameter-dependent controllers are
   developed for large-scale changes in operating conditions and
   transitions across bifurcations. A procedure to design stabilizing
   controllers that are themselves Lyapunov and structurally stable is also
   given. The techniques are applied to a nonlinear version of benchmark
   active control technology wind-tunnel model that exhibits a Hopf
   bifurcation leading to flutter. Numerical results showing local

Abstract = {{Surface modifications on polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) films following
   excimer UV lamp irradiation induced grafting were studied.
   Characteristics of the modifications depending on the conditions during
   the irradiation were analysed using contact-angle measurements, Xray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy(AFM),
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR). Depending on the conditions during the irradiation
   different surface modifications were obtained, which can generally be
   classified regarding the hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics of
   the resulting surface. It is shown that: not every substance that meets
   the general demands will be grafted on synthetic polymers using excimer
   UV radiation. Examples of agents that can simply be grafted onto polymer
   surfaces and those that undergo further crosslinking, building up thin
   films are listed. Agents used for grafting on polymers are
   1,5-hexadiene, perfluoro-4-methyl-pent-2-ene, polyethyleneglycol 200,

Abstract = {{Mixed glioneuronal neoplasms are relatively uncommon tumors in the
   central nervous system. Recently, an unusual glioneuronal tumor arising
   in adults marked histologically by neuropil-like islands was described.
   We present a similar case arising in a 23-year-old woman who presented
   with headaches and seizures and on imaging studies was noted to have a
   frontal-temporal lobe mass. The patient underwent partial resection of
   the tumor, which histologically resembled anaplastic astrocytoma, and
   received a course of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. increasing
   seizure frequency and expanding size on neuroimaging prompted a
   re-excision of the tumor. The second resection was marked by islands of
   tissue resembling gray matter with slightly atypical neuronal and glial
   cells situated in the white matter. These islands stained positively
   with synaptophysin and did not stain with glial fibrillary acid protein.
   Mild vascular proliferation and moderate nuclear pleomorphism also
   characterized the tumor. Areas of necrosis were not noted, A MIB-1
   labeling index of 18.1\% was noted. P53 immunoreactivity was observed in
   approximately 40\% of tumor cell nuclei, This lesion is felt to
   represent a clinically aggressive glioneuronal neoplasm with an unusual

Abstract = {{New thermoacidophilic organisms that were able to grow anaerobically on
   starch were isolated from the acidic hot springs of Kamchatka. Strain
   1904(T), isolated from a hot spring of the Moutnovski volcano, was
   characterized in detail. Its cells were regular or irregular cocci that
   were 1-2 mum in diameter, non-motile, and had a cell envelope consisting
   of one layer of subunits. The new organism was a hyperthermophile,
   growing in the temperature range 60-92 degreesC (with an optimum at 85
   degreesC), an acidophile, having the ph range for growth of 2.0-6.0
   (with an optimum at 3.8), and an obligate anaerobe. It fermented starch,
   forming acetate as the main growth product. Other growth substrates were
   yeast extract, beef extract and soya extract. Growth on yeast extract,
   beef extract and soya extract was stimulated by elemental sulfur, which
   was reduced to H2S. Acetate, arabinose, cellulose, formate, fructose,
   galactose, glucose, glycine, guar gum, lichenan, malate, maltose,
   methanol, pectin, pyruvate, propionate, xylan, xylose or a mixture of
   amino acids failed to support growth both in the presence and the
   absence of sulfur. When starch was used as the growth substrate, yeast
   extract (100 mg l(-1)) was required as a growth factor. The G+C content
   of the DNA was found to be 53.8 mol\%. Comparison of the complete 16S
   rDNA sequence with databases revealed that the new isolate belonged to
   the kingdom Crenarchaeota. It was not closely related to any described
   genera (showing sequence similarity below 90.8\%) and formed a separate
   branch of the Crenarchaeota. On the basis of physiological differences
   and rRNA sequence data, a new genus - Acidilobus - is proposed, the type
   species being Acidilobus aceticus strain 1904(T)(= DSM 11585(T)).}},

Abstract = {{The benefit of using retrieval systems in minimally-invasive surgery is
   to facilitate the removal of operative specimen, while minimising the

   functionality is achieved by combining it with a laparoscopic
   instrument: the resected tissue is wrapped in plastic foil, rather than
   being entrapped in a bag. During delivery through the abdominal wall,
   permanent traction is exerted on the specimen and thus obstruction in
   the port-site is avoided. The retrieval system has been tested for
   impermeability and proven to be safe and able to avoid spillage of

Journal = {{MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS JIM}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1435-1442}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Bulk amorphous (Mg(1-gamma)Al(gamma))(60)CU(30)Y(10) alloys were
   prepared using a relatively simple technique of rapid cooling of the
   melt in a copper wedge mould. The temperature vs, time was recorded
   during the cooling and solidification process of the melt and compared
   with a spacial and temporal numerical simulation of that process. It is
   concluded that good thermal contact is maintained between the amorphous
   part of the solidified sample and the mould, while a rather poor contact
   develops between the crystalline part of the sample and the mould,
   probably due to the appearance of a narrow gap at the crystal-mould
   interface during crystallisation. The maximum amorphous layer thickness
   decreases from similar to3 mm to zero when the Al content increases in
   the range from 0 to about y = 10\%. The evolution of the microstructure
   of the initially amorphous phase was examined by x-ray diffraction (XRD)
   and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for different alloy
   compositions and annealing temperatures. On annealing into the
   supercooled liquid state (441 K), specimens with no Al content remain
   basically amorphous while nanoparticles are formed and remain stable
   also at higher temperatures in specimens containing a few percent Al.
   The alloy with no Al crystallises apparently without the formation of
   nanoparticles. The critical cooling rate for the formation of an
   amorphous Mg(60)CU(30)Y(10) specimen was determined experimentally by a
   combination of DSC data and temperature vs, time measurements to be
   60-150 K/s, in agreement with estimates from the literature. The Vickers
   hardness (Hv) of the amorphous material for y = 2\% is higher (similar
   to 360 kg/mm(2)) than for y = 0 (similar to 290 kg/mm(2)). On
   crystallisation the hardness of the latter material increases to the 400
   kg/mm(2) level while the hardness of the former does not change.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increase in use of supplier evaluation, there is still very
   limited examination of the supplier evaluation process. Most of the
   discussion that is in the literature treats information about suppliers
   as factual, technical information without regard for the social and
   organizational biases involved in generating this information. This
   paper presents a framework for examining the process of supplier
   evaluation based on our research and observations. A framework for
   supplier evaluation is developed based on whether the supplier
   evaluation focuses on information from product- or process-based domains
   and whether the information acquisition mode used is direct or indirect.
   A critical examination of these four approaches to supplier evaluation
   is presented. In doing so, various advantages and limitations related to
   each approach are identified, Furthermore, the relationship between the
   evaluation approach and organizational realities are discussed. Finally,
   the need for an integrated mechanism within organizations to deal with
   supplier information is identified.}},

Abstract = {{X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (XLCSNB) is characterized
   by impaired scotopic Vision with associated ocular symptoms such as
   myopia, hyperopia, nystagmus and reduced visual acuity(1). Genetic
   mapping in families with XLCSNB revealed two different loci on the
   proximal short arm of the X chromosome(2). These two genetic subtypes
   can be distinguished on the basis of electroretinogram (ERG) responses
   and psychophysical testing as a complete (CSNB1) and an incomplete
   (CSNB2) form(3,4). The CSNB1 locus has been mapped to a 5-cM linkage
   interval in Xp11.4 (refs 2,5-7). Here we construct and analyse a contig
   between the markers DXS993 and DXS228, leading to the identification of
   a new gene mutated in CSNB1 patients. It is partially deleted in 3
   families and mutation analysis in a further 21 families detected another
   13 different mutations. This gene, designated NYX, encodes a protein of
   481 amino acids (nyctalopin) and is expressed at low levels in tissues
   including retina, brain, testis and muscle. The predicted polypeptide is
   a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored extracellular protein with
   11 typical and 2 cysteine-rich, leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). This motif
   is important for protein-protein interactions and members of the LRR
   superfamily are involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance(8-10).
   Future functional analysis of nyctalopin might therefore give insight
   into the fine-regulation of cell-cell contacts in the retina.}},

Abstract = {{Background: About half of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors
   experience secondary anoxic brain damage. Neurological outcome can be
   influenced by rehabilitative treatment approaches, but the nature and
   severity of persistent disabilities remain unclear. The aim of the study
   was to explore persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms, global function and
   life situation of these patients, and to evaluate quality of life in
   families. Methods: 25 months after inpatient rehabilitation, 12
   individuals (mean age = 51 years; ten M: two F) attended a
   cross-sectional interdisciplinary follow-up assessment with their
   carers. Function was investigated by clinical rating scales,
   neuropsychological standard tests, and clinical psychological
   inventories. Family members were asked about quality of life and
   satisfaction with social support. Results: All patients had deficits in
   at least one or more cognitive areas such as orientation, memory,
   alertness, and awareness. Three different clinical syndromes were
   observed: very severe intellectual and physical impairment, (two), mild
   to moderate dementia, (five), and amnesic syndrome, (five). Prevalence
   of multiple disabilities, was high. A striking discrepancy was found
   between self and proxy rating of disabilities (P < 0.01). Family members
   faced dramatically altered life situations after CA; 60\% of spouses
   suffered from psychosomatic problems, 50\% complained of lack of social
   support. Conclusion: Despite optimal in-hospital treatment, severe
   anoxic brain damage resulted in permanent cognitive decline, impaired
   awareness and self care ability. Families felt isolated, and more than
   half need more support to prevent burn out. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Reconstructed three-dimensional (3-D) echocardiography is an accurate

   However, it has limitations for clinical study due to the requirement of

   Real-time 3-D echocardiography has a major advantage of conveniently
   visualizing the entire cardiac anatomy in three dimensions and of
   potentially accurately quantifying LV volumes, ejection fractions, and
   myocardial mass in patients even in the presence of an LV aneurysm.
   Although the image quality of the current real-time 3-D
   echocardiographic methods is not optimal, its widespread clinical

   drug. Methods: In the present study, the in vitro antifungal
   susceptibilities of 36 C. dubliniensis clinical isolates and culture
   strains to current a nd new antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B
   (AMB), amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), amphotericin B colloidal
   dispersion (ABCD), 5-fluorocytosine (5FC), fluconazole (FLC),
   itraconazole (ITC), ketoconazole (KTC), liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB),
   liposomal nystatin (LNYT), LY303366 (LY), SCH56592 (SCH), and
   voriconazole (VRC), were determined according to the National Committee
   for Clinical Laboratory Standards M27-A broth microdilution method for
   yeasts. Results: Most isolates of C. dubliniensis were susceptible to
   both new and current antifungal drugs, with 75.9\% isolates susceptible
   to KTC, 86.2\% to FLC and to ITC, and similar to 100\% to the other
   antifungal agents tested. The cross-resistance phenotypes are detailed.
   Four isolates were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 64 mug/ml) to
   FLC. These 4 isolates were also resistant to KTC, and 3 of them were
   also resistant to ITC (MIC 11 mug/ml for both agents). However, these
   isolates were highly susceptible to 5FC and all polyene formulations
   (AMB, ABLC, ABCD, LAMB, and LNYT), triazole (SCH and VRC) and
   echinocandin (LY) antifungal agents. Conclusion: The new liposomal and
   lipidic formulations of AMB, LNYT, and the new triazoles and
   echinocandins may provide new alternatives to FLC for the treatment of
   infections by C. dubliniensis. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG. Baser.}},

Abstract = {{Spore germination of Culcita macrocarpa C. Presl and Woodwardia radicans
   (L.) Sm. from nine populations at the northern limit of their
   distribution, in the northwest Iberian Peninsula, was investigated. In a
   first experiment, population type and temperature (10, 15, 20, and 25
   degreesC) were both found to affect germination percentage and
   germination time significantly in both species. There were also
   significant interactions between the two factors with respect to the
   percentage germination of C macrocarpa and the germination time of W.
   radicans. In C. macrocarpa there was an outstanding increase in
   germination time at 15 degreesC and, above all, at 10 degreesC, whereas
   in W. radicans the most remarkable result was the existence of two
   populations with especially low germination percentages. In a second
   experiment, germination of 20 individuals from each population of W.
   radicans was compared with similar inter-population differentiation.
   Although its variability possibly has a genetic basis, these species are
   able to germinate successfully, and it seems probable that the season in
   which it occurs depends more on spore release than on thermal conditions
   in the populations. The effect of temperature on germination in both
   species does not explain their coastal distribution. Temperature is
   probably more important in limiting other stages of the life cycle.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{2702-2710}},

Abstract = {{Steady viscoelastic shear flows in curved geometries are susceptible to
   instabilities due to the radial force associated with elastic stresses
   along curved streamlines. Recent work has shown that the addition of
   steady or oscillatory shear flow in a transverse direction (orthogonal
   superposition) can suppress these instabilities. The present work
   instead investigates the effect of oscillatory parallel superposition,
   for the particular case of circular Couette flow. For flow of an
   Oldroyd-B fluid, the oscillation has a weak stabilizing effect if the
   oscillation amplitude is not too large. If on the other hand, the
   oscillation amplitude is such that the angular velocity of the moving
   cylinder changes sign over part of the cycle, the flow is destabilized.
   However, in the limit where the motion is purely oscillatory (i.e.,
   large amplitude oscillatory shear), the flow is stabilized relative to
   steady circular Couette flow with the same maximum shear rate. Finally,
   in the limit where curvature goes to zero-plane Couette flow-parallel
   superposition makes the already stable flow slightly more stable,
   increasing the decay rate of fluctuations in the range of parameters
   studied. Furthermore, two-dimensional disturbances are the most slowly
   decaying; we have extended Squire's theorem in this case to encompass an
   arbitrary time dependence. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Accumulated data indicate that current generation lentiviral vectors,
   which generally utilize an internal human cytomegalovirus (CMV)
   immediate early region enhancer-promoter to transcribe the gene of
   interest, are not yet optimized for efficient expression in human
   hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). As a first step toward this
   goal, we constructed self-inactivating derivatives of the HIV-l-based
   transfer vector pHR' containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein
   (GFP) gene as reporter and the Woodchuck hepatitis virus
   posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE). GFP expression was driven
   by a variety of strong viral and cellular promoters, including the
   murine stem cell virus (MSCV) long terminal repeat (LTR), a Gibbon ape
   leukemia virus (GALV) LTR, the human elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1
   alpha) promoter, the composite CAG promoter (consisting of the CMV
   immediate early enhancer and the chicken beta -actin promoter), and the
   human phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK) promoter. In contrast to results
   obtained in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and fibrosarcoma HT1080
   cells, in which the CMV promoter expressed GFP at the highest levels,
   significantly higher levels of GFP expression (3- to 5-fold) were
   achieved with the MSCV LTR, the EF1 alpha promoter, and the CAG promoter
   in the human HSPC line KG1 alpha. Removal of the WPRE indicated that it
   stimulated GFP expression from all of the vectors in KG1 alpha cells (up
   to 3-fold), although it only marginally improved the performance of the
   intron-containing EF1 alpha and CAG promoters (<1.5-fold stimulation).
   The vectors using the MSCV LTR, the GALV LTR, and the PGK promoter were
   the most efficient at transducing primary human CD34(+) cord blood
   progenitors under the conditions employed. High-level GFP expression in
   the NOD/SCID xenograft model was demonstrated with the pHR' derivative
   bearing the MSCV LTR. These new lentiviral vector backbones provide a
   basis for the rational design of improved delivery vehicles for human
   HSPC gene transfer applications.}},

Abstract = {{Topoisomerase I is an enzyme that is essential for maintaining the
   three-dimensional structure of DNA during the processes of
   transcription, translation and mitosis. With the introduction of new
   clinical agents that are effective in poisoning topoisomerase I, this
   enzyme has proved to be an attractive molecular target in the
   development of anticancer drugs. Several terbenzimidazoles have been
   identified as potent topoisomerase I poisons. Structure-activity data on
   various terbenzimidazoles have revealed that the presence of lipophilic
   substituents at the 5-position of various terbenzimidazoles correlates
   with enhanced cytotoxicity. While the effect of having substituents at
   both the 5- and 6-positions had not been evaluated, previous studies did
   indicate that the presence of a fused benzo-ring at the 5,6-position
   results in a significant decrease in topoisomerase I poisoning activity
   and cytotoxicity. In the present study we investigated whether
   substituents at both the 5- and 6-positions of Varied terbenzimidazoles
   would allow for retention of topo I poisoning activity. The 6-bromo,
   6-methoxy, or 6-phenyl derivatives of both 5-bromo- and
   5-phenylterbenzimidazole were synthesized and evaluated for topo I
   poisoning activity, as well as their cytotoxicity toward human
   lymphoblastoma cells. The data indicate that such derivatives do retain
   similar topo I poisoning activity and possess cytotoxicity equivalent to
   either 5-bromo- or 5-phenylterbenzimidazole. Significant enhancement in
   the topoisomerase I poisoning activity and cytotoxicity of
   5-phenylterbenzimidazole is observed when the 2''-position is
   substituted with either a chloro or trifluoromethyl substituent. The
   influence of such substituents on the biological activity of 5,
   6-dibromoterbenzimidazole (6a) was also explored. In the case of either
   2{''}-chloro-5,6-dibromoterbenzimidazole (6b) or
   2{''}-trifluoromethyl-5,6-dibromoterbenzimidazole (6c), topoisomerase I
   poisoning was not enhanced relative to 6a. While cytotoxicity toward
   RPMI 8402 was also not significantly affected, comparative studies
   performed against several solid human tumor cell lines did reveal a
   significant increase in cytotoxicity observed for 6c as compared to 6a.

Abstract = {{Past studies in nonclinical samples have found that suffocation fear,

   the earlier studies, the authors found that suffocation fear predicted

   However, highly precise measures of CO2 sensitivity. not included in
   earlier studies, did predict anxious challenge responding. These
   findings support the predictive value and possible etiological relevance
   of both specific psychological variables and physiological CO2
   sensitivity in panic vulnerability. Further work is still needed to

Abstract = {{There is a high incidence of asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and
   contact urticaria in workers of precious metal refineries. Symptoms are
   closely associated,vith sensitization to halogenated platinum compounds,
   as assessed by skin-prick test. The aim of the present study was to
   examine the molecular mechanisms involved by describing the T-cell
   receptor (TCR) repertoire distribution of peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells (PBMCs) without and after in vitro stimulation with sodium
   hexachloroplatinate.
   PBMCs of 17 sensitized subjects,vith work-related asthma and a positive
   skin-prick test result to sodium hexachloroplatinate and of 15
   nonexposed subjects were isolated and TCR expression determined by flow
   cytometry. Furthermore, the sodium hexachloroplatinate-mediated in vitro
   effects on the frequency of V beta -expressing T-cells, the
   proliferation response and the expression of cell surface molecules like
   CD71, CD25, CD95 and HLA-DR were studied.
   CD3-positive lymphocytes of platinum salt-sensitized workers had a
   significantly higher frequency of V alpha 2a+, V beta 11+ and V beta
   21.3+ T-cells than controls (p<0.01, p<0.01 and p<0.001 respectively),
   III vitro stimulation of PBMCs from platinum salt-sensitized as well as
   control subjects with sodium hexachloroplatinate increased the
   percentage of CD3-positive cells bearing specific TCRs, especially
   V<beta>5.3, V beta6.7, V beta 8a, V beta 20 and V beta 21.3. This effect
   was time- and dose-dependent.
   The present results indicate that the frequencies of V alpha 2a-, V beta
   11 and V beta 21.3-bearing blood T-cells and platinum salt-induced
   lymphocyte proliferation are strongly enhanced in subjects who suffer
   from asthma due to platinum salt. In addition, in vitro stimulation with
   sodium hexachloroplatinate modulates the frequencies of certain T-cell

Abstract = {{Electrospray mass spectrometry was employed as a tool in this first
   study on the molecular interaction between the alkali metal ions and
   antifungal lipopeptide iturin A, and some analogues. Cationisation by
   sodium and signal intensity of lipopeptide species depended on sodium
   concentration, but was independent of sample solvent, carrier solvent
   polarity and sample pH between 4 and 11. 8-Beta, a linear analogue of
   iturin A(2) (8-Beta; beta -aminotetradecanoyl-NYNQPNS), and its shorter
   linear lipopeptide analogues, associated either one or two alkali metal
   cations, while the N-->C cyclic peptides associated with only one
   cation. The chirality of the beta -NC14 residue had a limited influence
   on the cationisation. It was observed that 8-Beta contained at least
   four interaction sites for a cation of which two, the C-terminal
   carboxylate and the side-chain of tyrosine, can take part in ionic
   interaction with a cation. It is proposed that the remaining two
   interaction centres of alkali metal ions are within the two type II beta
   -turns found in conformation of natural iturin A. This was corroborated
   by the diminished capacity of the shorter peptides, in which one of the
   p-turns was eliminated to bind a second larger cation. All the
   lipopeptides showed the same order of alkali metal ion selectivity: Na+
   > K+ > Rb+. These results indicated a size limitation in the interaction
   cavity or cavities. The absence of, or observation of only low
   abundance, di-cationised complexes of cyclic peptides the indicated
   association of the cation in the interior of the peptide ring. It is
   thus hypothesised that alkali metal ions can bind in one of the two
   p-turns in the natural iturin A molecule. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   separation less than 1 mm between substrates the yield, i.e. percentage
   in moles of a soluble cadmium salt deposited as a thin film of CdS, can
   exceed 50\%. This behaviour is explained on the basis of the existence
   of a critical layer of solution near the substrate, within which the
   relevant ionic species have a higher probability of interacting with the
   thin-film layer than of contributing to precipitate formation. The
   critical layer depends on the solution composition and the temperature
   of the bath as well as the duration of deposition. An effective value
   for the critical layer thickness has been defined as half the substrate
   separation at which 90\% of the maximum film thickness for the
   particular bath composition. bath temperature and duration of deposition
   is obtained. In the case of CdS thin films studied as an example, the
   critical layer is found to extend from 0.5 to 2.5 mm from the substrate
   surface, depending on the deposition conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical modification of myoglobin and cutinase suspended in n-hexane by
   acyl chlorides and iodine was monitored by electrospray mass
   spectrometry. The general rate of modification was always much faster
   for protein adsorbed to supports (silica or polypropylene) than for
   lyophilized powders. Modification rates were slower for larger acyl
   chlorides, particularly with lyophilized powders. About 20\% of the
   protein molecules in lyophilized powders were modified much more quickly
   than the rest, a fraction consistent with those exposed on the surface
   of the solid. It appears that access to most of the molecules in
   lyophilized powders requires a very slow stage of solid-phase diffusion.
   This has been neglected in previous discussion of mass transfer
   limitation of lyophilized enzymes in organic media, and would not be
   revealed by the experimental evidence used to dismiss it. Studies of the
   effects of particle size and dilution with inactive protein are only
   sensitive to diffusion in liquid-filled pores, not through the solid
   phase. Slow solid-phase diffusion is not required for access to most
   support-adsorbed proteins, which is probably a major contributory factor
   to their enhanced catalytic efficiency in organic media. Hydration of
   lyophilized proteins accelerates chemical modification rates, as it does
   their catalytic activity. The main site of reaction of acyl chlorides in
   organic media is not amino groups (which are probably ion-paired), but
   is likely to be hydroxyl groups instead. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

   first centimeters of the jejunum, immediately after the duodeno-jejunal
   angle, extented on 15cm. A resection of the first 15cm of the jejunum
   was performed with duodeno-jejunal side-to-side manual anastomosis.
   Gram-stain and cultures of blood, peritoneal pus, and jejunal mucosa
   revealed a penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. Appropriate

   these effects. During particularly severe contractions, open-market

   the Taylor rule and targets a zero-inflation rate, there is a
   significant increase in the variability of output but not inflation.

   reduction in the detrimental effects of the zero bound.}},

Abstract = {{Protein expression of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) and the
   putative Golgi secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA) was examined in rat
   mammary tissue. As lactation started, PMCA protein expression increased
   dramatically, and this increased expression paralleled milk production.
   Mammary PMCA was primarily PMCA2b but was similar to 4,000 daltons
   larger than expected. RT-PCR showed that the primary mammary PMCA2b
   transcript was alternatively spliced, at splice site A, to include an
   additional 135 bp, resulting in the insertion of 45 amino acids. This
   splice form is designated 2bw. PMCA2bw is secreted into milk, associated
   with the milk fat globule membrane. Therefore, PMCA2bw is located on the
   apical membrane of the secretory cell. Smaller amounts of PMCA1b and 4b
   protein were found in mammary tissue. PMCA4b was the major PMCA
   expressed in developing tissue, and its level declined as lactation
   started. PMCA1b expression increased moderately during lactation. SPCA
   protein expression increased 1 wk before parturition and increased
   further as lactation proceeded. The abundance and cell location of
   PMCA2b suggest that it is important for macro-Ca2+ homeostasis in
   lactating tissue. The pattern of expression and abundance of SPCA
   suggest that it is a candidate for the Golgi Ca2+-ATPase.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the wide range of outcomes achieved by firms trying to
   implement Total Quality Management (TQM) and similar process improvement
   initiatives presents a challenge to management theory: A few firms reap
   sustained benefits from their programs, but most efforts fail and are
   abandoned. In this paper I study one dimension of this phenomenon: the
   role of impending layoffs in determining employee commitment to process
   improvement. Currently, the literature provides two opposing theories
   concerning the effect of job security on the ability of firms to
   implement change initiatives. The ``Drive Out Fear{''} school argues
   that firms must commit to job security, while the `'Drive In Fear''
   school emphasizes the positive role that insecurity plays in motivating
   change. In this study a contract theoretic model is developed to analyze
   the role of agency in process improvement. The main insight of the study
   is that there are two types of job security, internal and external, that
   have opposing impacts on the firm's ability to implement improvement
   initiatives. The distinction is useful in explaining the results of
   different case studies and can reconcile the two change theories.}},

   conditioned stimulus (CS). Experiment 1 found that over the course of
   conditioning the CS initially elevated responding relative to the
   baseline but then lost the power to do so. Transfer tests revealed that
   a CS-US association developed early and persisted despite the decline in
   magazine responding. Experiment 2 confirmed the persistence of CS-US
   associations and found them to be more substantial when a different US
   occurred during the CS than in its absence. In Experiment 3, when the
   situation was exposed to US-alone presentations prior to introducing the
   CS, there was little evidence that a subsequent random relation between
   the CS and US produced an association between them. These results agree
   with those of blocking and overshadowing experiments using discrete CSs
   and support an interpretation of the random procedure in terms of
   competition between the background and CS for conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND- New treatment modalities aimed to decrease both mortality
   and morbidity in patients with stroke are of the greatest necessity. The
   rationale for the use of glycerol in stroke is that brain edema is one
   of the most evident effects of ischemia and a common cause of death and
   morbidity.
   REVIEW SUMMARY- In this review, we describe the basic mechanisms leading
   to accumulation of brain edema in stroke, followed by a discussion of
   the pharmacology of glycerol and its properties on brain hemodynamics
   and metabolism in both normal and pathologic circumstances. We also
   discuss all of the available trials in the English literature of
   glycerol for acute stroke.
   CONCLUSIONS- Glycerol can be used safely to decrease the brain edema
   associated With ischemic stroke, However, its routine use has not been
   proven to significantly decrease morbidity or mortality in this setting.
   It is apparent that the beneficial effects of glycerol in brain ischemia
   cannot be explained solely on the basis of its hyperosmolar properties.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a rapid, immobilized probe-based assay for the
   detection of sequence variation in the hypervariable segment II (HVII)
   of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. Using a panel of 17
   sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probes immobilized on nylon
   membrane strips, we typed 689 individuals from four population groups.
   The genetic diversity value for each population was calculated from the
   frequency data, and the frequencies of distinct ``mitotypes{''} in each
   group were determined. We performed DNA sequence analysis of 129 samples
   to characterize the sequences associated with ``blanks{''} (absence of
   probe signals) and weak probe signals. Out of 689 samples, we observed
   five heteroplasmic samples (excluding the variable C-stretch beginning
   at position 303) using the immobilized SSO probe panel. The SSO probe
   strips were used for the analysis of shed hairs and bloodstains from
   several criminal cases in Sweden, one of which is described here. We
   conclude that this mtDNA typing system is useful for human
   identification and significantly decreases casework turnaround time.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Factors possibly predicting airway invasion of oesophageal
   cancer in the absence of frank oesophagotracheal fistulas have not been
   studied. Objectives:To identify possible predictors of airway invasion
   by oesophageal cancer that are readily accessible in the preoperative
   setting. Methods: We prospectively investigated 148 patients with newly
   diagnosed oesophageal cancer located at or above the level of the
   tracheal bifurcation and without any evidence of oesophago-respiratory
   fistulas or distant metastases. Demographic variables, respiratory
   parameters, results of bronchoscopy and other staging procedures
   (oesophagoscopy, swallow oesophagography, endosonography, CT and
   histology) and findings at surgery were compared between the patients
   with (n = 30) and without (n = 118) proven airway invasion and entered
   into a stepwise logistic regression model to evaluate their independent
   predictive roles. Results: Univariate analysis indicated that the
   incidence of airway invasion increased with the presence of suspect CT
   findings, the presence of respiratory symptoms, tumour length, T stage
   on endoscopic ultrasonography, and histopathologic grading of the
   primary cancer. A multivariate logistic regression model indicated that
   suspect CT findings (odds ratio, 4.4; 95\% confidence interval 1.7-11.1,
   p = 0.002) and maximal tumour length >8 cm (odds ratio, 3.7; 95\%
   confidence interval 1.4-9.6, p = 0.007) were associated independently
   with airway invasion. The accuracy of predicting airway invasion was
   82.5\% with both variables combined. Conclusions: The high incidence of
   airway involvement by oesophageal cancer and the difficulty to predict
   it accurately with clinical data or other staging procedures justifies
   the routine use of bronchoscopy in all patients with the tumour located
   at or above the lever of the tracheal bifurcation. A particular effort
   to objectively prove or exclude airway invasion should be made in
   patients with tumours longer than 8 cm and/or with CT findings
   suggesting airway invasion. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG. Basel.}},

Abstract = {{Helicobacter pylori is recognised as being an aetiological agent of
   chronic active gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and has been
   associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. The natural
   reservoir for H. pylori is unknown, although the oral cavity has been
   the focus of much attention in this respect. Given the histological
   similarities between gastric and oral ulceration, it seemed prudent to
   investigate a possible association between H, pylori and recurrent
   aphthous stomatitis (RAS). In this study, the potential involvement of
   H. pylori in the aetiology of RAS was investigated using the polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR). Biopsies from 28 RAS patients were analysed, in
   addition to 20 oral lichen planus (OLP) and 13 normal biopsies that were
   used as controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from biopsies, and
   confirmation of successful extraction of PCR-amplifiable DNA was
   achieved by carrying out PCR on each DNA sample with nested primers
   specific for the human beta-haemoglobin gene. PCR identification of H.
   pylori was carried out using a primer pair specific for the H. pylori
   16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Two rounds of PCR were carried out to
   amplify a 295-bp product, and the identity of amplified products was
   confirmed by DNA sequencing. H. pylori DNA was detected in 3 of 28
   (11\%) RAS samples but not in any of 20 OLP and 13 normal samples. These
   results do not support a definitive aetiological role for H. pylori in
   RAS, although the possibility that H. pylori may be involved in a small
   proportion of RAS cases cannot be excluded.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To examine whether socioeconomic status (SES) explains
   differences in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes between
   African-American and non-Hispanic white women and men.
   Design-Cross sectional study of diabetes prevalence, SES, and other risk
   factors ascertained by physical examination and interview.
   Setting-Interviews were conducted in subjects' homes; physical
   examinations were conducted in mobile examination centres.
   Participants-961 African-American women, 1641 non-Hispanic white women,
   839 African-American men and 1537 non-Hispanic white men, aged 40 to 74
   years, examined in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey (NHANES III), a representative sample of the
   non-institutionalised civilian population of the United States,
   1988-1994.
   Main results-Among women, African-American race/ethnicity was associated
   with an age adjusted odds ratio of 1.76 (95\% confidence intervals 1.21,
   2.57), which was reduced to 1.42 (95\% confidence intervals 0.95, 2.13)
   when poverty income ratio was controlled. Controlling for education or
   occupational status had minimal effects on this association. When other
   risk factors were controlled, race/ ethnicity was not significantly
   associated with type 2 diabetes prevalence. Among men, the age adjusted
   odds ratio associated with African-American race/ ethnicity was 1.43
   (95\% confidence intervals 1.03, 1.99). Controlling for SES variables
   only modestly affected the odds ratio for African/American
   race/ethnicity among men, while adjusting for other risk factors
   increased the race/ethnic differences.
   Conclusions-Economic disadvantage may explain much of the excess
   prevalence of type 2 diabetes among African-American women, but not
   among men.}},

Abstract = {{A method is proposed for speciation of phenyl-mercury (Ph-Hg) in waters
   based on the retention of analyte by a living Escherichia coli strain
   (K-15) grown in the aqueous sample solution containing glucose as a
   nutrient. In the general procedure, equilibrium between the analyte in
   the sample and the living bacterial cells is allowed to be established.
   However, a theoretical model of the retention process, based on a
   rate-determining step in reaching the adsorption equilibrium,
   illustrates the feasibility of quantifying the analyte before
   equilibrium is reached. The Ph-Hg-biomass is separated from the solution
   by centrifugation and the amount of organo-mercury retained is
   determined directly in the biomass slurry by cold vapour atomic
   absorption spectrometry (CVAAS). Speciation of Ph-Hg from matrices
   containing other mercury species (ethyl-mercury, methyl-mercury, Hg2+,
   Hg(I)) and the CVAAS determination of Ph-Hg can be carried out with
   relative standard deviations of 2.2-5.3\%. The detection limit for Ph-Hg
   under optimum conditions is 0.05 ng ml(-1). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper explores the process of ethical decision-making in
   counselling research and asks the question: after following ethical
   guidelines, reviewing ethical principles and consulting codes of
   practice, to what extent is our decision-making based on intuitive
   thinking? The paper begins by examining Kitchener's model of ethical
   justification and the ethical principles upon which it rests. Bond's
   approach to ethical problem-solving is also considered. The second part
   of the paper explores the sequential decision-making process suggested
   by Gellatt, upon which both the Kitchener and Bond models seem to rest,
   and compares this with Gellatt's later revision of his model. The
   process by which we arrive at an ethical decision is then explored in
   relation to these. The final part of the paper argues that we reach
   ethical decisions through intuition, informed by ethical principles,
   codes of practice and reference to the laws of society. In order to
   safeguard the well-being of our clients and/or research participants, we
   need to be aware of this and offer up our decision-making process to the
   scrutiny of peers and the public at large. Although much of the paper
   explores this process at a general level, research undertaken into
   children's perception of stress will be used as an example.}},

Abstract = {{The graph of neutrinoless double beta decay is applied to DESY HERA data
   and generalized to final states with any two charged leptons. Considered
   is the case in which one of the two escapes typical identification
   criteria and the case when a produced tau decays hadronically. Both
   possibilities give one isolated lepton with high transverse momentum,
   hadronic activity, and an imbalance in transverse momentum. We examine
   the kinematical properties of these events and compare them with the
   high p(T) isolated leptons reported by the H1 Collaboration. Their
   positive charged muon events can be explained by the ``double beta{''}
   process and we discuss the possibilities for the precise determination
   which original final state produced the single isolated lepton. To
   confirm our hypothesis one should search in the data for high
   pseudorapidity and/or low p(T) leptons or for additional separated jets.}},

Abstract = {{Leptin has recently been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of
   hepatic steatosis. Consequently, this study was designed to examine the
   direct effects of portal leptin on the intrahepatic lipid contents in
   the postabsorptive state. Rat livers (n = 6 per group) were perfused in
   a recirculating system and portally infused with leptin (0.5 nmol/L, 5
   nmol/L, and 25 nmol/L), insulin (10 nmol/L), leptin (5 nmol/L) plus
   insulin (10 nmol/L), glucagon (1 nmol/L), or vehicle (control).
   Intrahepatic contents of triglycerides, free cholesterol, cholesteryl
   esters, and free fatty acids were determined from the lipid extract of
   frozen livers by capillary gas chromatography. Short-term leptin
   infusion increased total triglycerides in a concentration-dependent (0.5
   nmol/L: 2.8 +/- 0.4 mg/g, 5 nmol/L: 7.0 +/- 0.5 mg/g, 25 nmol/L: 8.3 +/-
   1.0 mg/g) and time-dependent manner. Total triglycerides also rose
   during exposure to insulin plus leptin (7.2 +/- 0.6 mg/g) but fell
   during glucagon infusion (2.6 +/- 0.2 mg/g; control: 4.3 +/- 0.3 mg/g; P
   < .05). Leptin, insulin, and glucagon increased intrahepatic free
   cholesterol (P < .05). Free fatty acids were also higher during leptin
   exposure (0.5 nmol/L: 1.28 +/- 0.08 mg/g, 5 nmol/L: 0.47 +/- 0.01 mg/g,
   25 nmol/L: 0.48 +/- 0.04 mg/g, control: 0.38 +/- 0.03 mg/g; P < .05), In
   conclusion, hyperleptinemia increases hepatic triglyceride content and
   may therefore contribute to hepatic steatosis in hyperleptinemic obese
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{During development, a graded expression of ephrin A2 has been implicated
   in retinotectal map formation. Here we have examined ephrin A2
   expression during optic nerve regeneration in the mature goldfish. In
   the tecta of normal animals, a gradient of ephrin A2 expression is
   detected in cell bodies within the stratum fibrosum et griseum
   superficiale with more immunopositive cells caudally than rostrally. The
   gradient in the mature animal presumably reflects the plasticity
   associated with continued retinal and tectal neurogenesis, During optic
   nerve regeneration, expression throughout the tectum is increased by 1
   month as a strong rostrocaudal gradient. The gradient declines to normal
   by 3 months. The up-regulation of ephrin A2 during optic nerve
   regeneration is likely to be instrumental in reestablishing the

   concentration had already been normalized using bromocriptine in three
   patients. The variation in tumor volume was assessed in 82 patients
   since 8 had no residual tumor post-operatively and 17 had received
   radiotherapy: at least partial regression of the tumor was noted in 25
   (30.8 \%), including 16 (19.5 \%) with a more than 50 \% decrease in the
   remaining tumor. The mean time taken to observe the anti-tumoral effect
   was 16.8 +/- 3.1 months (3-78) using a mean dose of quinagolide of 255.4
   +/- 37.8 mug/d d (75-750). The following predictive indicators were
   identified concerning the efficacy of quinagolide: a pre-quinagolide
   prolactin level of < 300 ng/ml in the group of patients whose plasma
   prolactin concentration was normalized, and a mean decrease in prolactin
   of 619 ng/ml in the group of patients showing a reduction in tumor
   Volume treated with quinagolide for 3 months. Side effects (nausea,
   vomiting, hypotension) were generally mild and were observed in 51
   patients (47.6 \%). Only 11 (10.2 \%) of patients had to discontinue
   treatment because of adverse reactions.
   Conclusion : An anti-tumoral effect was noted in 30.8 \% of patients and
   occurred within an interval of less than 2 years in 80 \% of cases at a
   dose of 300 mug/d. Normalization of the plasma prolactin concentration
   was obtained in 44 \% of cases and occurred in less than one year in 80
   \% of patients at a dose of 300 mug/d. Quinagolide is a useful drug and
   from now on should be prescribed as first-line treatment for patients
   presenting with bromocriptine-resistant prolactinoma.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient T-cell activation requires two signals. The first signal,
   which confers specificity, is provided hy interaction of the T-cell
   receptor with peptides presented by MHC molecules, One of the second
   costimulatory signals is induced by binding of B7 proteins on the
   surface of antigen-presenting cells to CD28 on the T-cell surface.
   Expression of B7 molecules on tumor cells can result in the activation
   of tumor specific T lymphocytes and induce protective antitumor
   immunity. However, at present such gene-therapeutic approaches are
   limited by the inability to selectively target B7 gene expression to
   cancer cells, As an alternative approach we exploited recombinant
   antibody fragments to localize a costimulatory B7 molecule to the
   surface of tumor cells. We constructed chimeric proteins that contain in
   a single polypeptide chain a portion of human B7-2 (CD86) genetically
   fused to single-chain (sc) Fv antibody domains specific for the
   tumor-associated antigens epidermal growth factor receptor and the
   closely related ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase, A small recombinant
   fragment of human CD86 was characterized that corresponds to amino acid
   residues 1-111 (CD86(111)) of the mature protein. CD86(111) produced in
   the yeast Pichia pastoris and CD86(111) expressed in bacteria was
   functionally active and displayed specific binding to B7 counter
   receptors, Bacterially expressed CD86(111)-scFv fusion proteins
   specifically localized to the respective target antigens on the surface
   of tumor cells and markedly enhanced the proliferation of primary T
   cells when bound to immobilized tumor antigen.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing the conditions for effective intergroup peacemaking is a
   formidable task in severe ethnic conflicts. Conflict resolution
   practitioners argue that a critical first step is developing
   preconditions which convince competing groups that there are opponents
   to whom it is worth talking, that it is possible to create structural
   changes conducive to a stable peace, and that an agreement is possible
   which can meet each side's basic concerns and needs. This article
   compares six theories of practice of ethnic conflict resolution:
   community relations, principled negotiation; human needs;
   psychoanalytically rooted identity; intercultural miscommunications and
   conflict transformation, examining how each understands ethnic conflict;
   the goals it articulates; the effects of good practice on participants
   in interventions; the mechanisms by which the project achieves its
   impact; and the dynamics of transfer affecting the course of a wider
   conflict. It is argued that clearer articulation of these assumptions
   will improve both theory and practice in the search for settlements to
   severe ethnic conflict.}},

Abstract = {{The early stages of lentivirus infection of dendritic cells have been
   studied in an in vivo model. Maedi-visna virus (MVV) is a natural
   pathogen of sheep with a tropism for macrophages, but the infection of
   dendritic cells has not been proven, largely because of the difficulties
   of definitively distinguishing the two cell types. Afferent lymphatic
   dendritic cells from sheep have been phenotypically characterized and
   separated from macrophages, Dendritic cells purified from experimentally
   infected sheep have been demonstrated not only to carry infectious MW
   but also to be hosts of the virus themselves. The results of the in vivo
   infection experiments are supported by infections of purified afferent
   lymph dendritic cells in vitro, in which late reverse transcriptase
   products are demonstrated by PCR, The significance of the infection of
   afferent lymph dendritic cells is discussed in relation to the initial

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that in Nicotiana sylzsylvestris cytoplasmic
   male-sterile (CMS) mutants where the mtDNA lacks the nad7 gene coding
   fur a subunit of respiratory Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase,
   EC 1.6.5.3), glycine (Gly) oxidation was lower than in the wild type and
   insensitive to rotenone, suggesting Complex I dysfunction. In contrast,
   the oxidation rate of exogenous NADII and the capacity of the
   cyanide-resistant respiration (AOX) were enhanced. Here we rep report
   that , in contrast to Gly, the rate of malate oxidation was not
   affected, but proceeded totally in a rotenone-insensitive pathway,
   strongly suggesting that survival of CMS plants depends on the
   activation of internal and external alternative NAD(P) H dehydrogenases
   and that Gly decarboxylase activity depends on Complex I functioning. A
   similar defect in Complex I activity and Gly oxidation was found in the
   NMS1 nuclear mutant, defective in the processing of the nad4 transcript,
   but alternative NAD(P) H dehydrogenases were less activated. In CMS and
   NMS1, the fraction of the AOX pathway was increased, as compared to wild
   type, associated with higher amounts of aox transcripts, AOX protein,
   and plant resistance to cyanide. Non-phosphorylating respiratory enzymes
   maintained normal in vivo respiration levels in both mutants, but
   photosynthesis was decreased, in correlation with lower leaf
   conductance, emphasizing mitochondrial control on photosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{The eutrophication of lakes causes serious problems, such as water-bloom
   consisting of the harmful blue-green algae. To prevent an unusual degree
   of growth of phytoplankton, various restoration methods have been tried.
   ``Biomanipulation{''}: which uses zooplankton to prey on the
   phytoplankton, is a promising method because it can, In principle,
   create a desirable ecosystem. However, there are many equivocal points
   in the long-term stability of a newly developed ecosystem after
   biomanipulations. The fate prediction of a water ecosystem using a lake
   mathematical model is thus essential for implementing biomanipulations.
   There remain, however, many uncertain points in the dynamic parameters
   of the lake models, especially the parameters concerned with zooplankton
   and fish. In this study, we established a lake mathematical model based
   on the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus flows among the biotic and
   abiotic substances in a water ecosystem. In this model, two types of
   phytoplankton (non blue-green algae and blue-green algae), three types
   of zooplankton (rotatoria. cladocera and copepoda), planktivorous fish
   (crucian carp), detritus and dissolved matters were considered. The
   dynamic parameters were estimated with a set membership estimation
   algorithm using random scanning based on mesocosm experiments, which can
   provide more rigid data than actual lake observations can. The model
   calculations showed good agreement with the observation data for both
   the non-filamentous blue-green algae dominant case and the filamentous
   blue-green algae dominant case. Using this model, we calculated the
   long-term stability of the effects of biomanipulations in a hypothetical
   lake. The calculation results clarified the blue-green algal species
   specificity in the longterm effects of biomanipulations. In the
   non-filamentous blue-green algal dominant case, the Long-term stable
   suppression of algal growth was predicted under a certain threshold fish
   biomass, while in the filamentous blue-green algal dominant case, the
   suppression was not sustainable even in a no-fish-coexisting series.
   Model simulation is very important to the design of biomanipulations,
   and the model proposed in this study is suitable for this purpose. (C)

Abstract = {{Diazepam, a drug of high intrinsic clearance, was studied in the in situ
   rat liver dually perfused with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing human
   serum albumin (HSA; 0-1\%) and unlabeled diazepam (1 mg/l) under
   constant hepatic arterial (3 ml/min) and portal venous (PV; 12 ml/min)
   flow rates. Events after a unit impulse (using {[}C-14] diazepam) and at
   steady state (using unlabeled diazepam) were evaluated. In the absence
   of HSA the fractional effluent recovery (F) after hepatic arterial
   infusion (0.046 +/- 0.013) was about twice that after PV infusion (0.019
   +/- 0.006). With HSA present, regardless of input route, F increased as
   unbound diazepam fraction in perfusate decreased (e.g., for PV, F = 0.58
   +/- 0.05 and 0.69 +/- 0.02 for unbound diazepam fraction values of 0.18
   +/- 0.01 and 0.037 +/- 0.01 at 0.25\% and 1\% HSA). The effluent {[}14C]
   diazepam profile was also dependent upon HSA. On decreasing HSA from 1
   to 0.25\% the early sharp peak (at 12-20 s) was replaced by a flatter
   unimodal profile with a later peak (at 60-80 s). Comparison of estimated
   effective permeability-surface area product to perfusate flow ratios
   (4.4 for 1\% HSA and 21 for 0.25\% HSA) indicated a shift from a
   perfusion rate-limited uptake with 0.25\% HSA to one intermediate
   between permeability and perfusion at 1\% HSA. Recognizing that orally
   absorbed drug enters the liver only via PV and i.v. drug via both
   vascular routes, this study emphasizes the difference in hepatic
   extraction of compounds depending on route of input, and the role that
   alteration in perfusate binding has on hepatic drug disposition.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidation-reduction reactions influence the subsurface mobility of a
   wide variety of toxic contaminants. In the work reported here, we
   develop a new model for coupled transport and oxidation-reduction, and
   we test the model against published data on the movement of CoEDTA

   beta -MnO2-coated sand. The model solves equations for the
   advective-dispersive transport of three aqueous species: Co(II)EDTA,
   Co(III)EDTA, and dissolved oxygen. These transport equations are linked
   with nonlinear kinetics expressions that describe (1) oxidation of
   Co(II)EDTA to Co(III)EDTA by beta -MnO2, (2) inhibition of Co(II)EDTA
   oxidation due to precipitation of Mn2O3, an insoluble reaction product
   that occludes the beta -MnO2 surface, and (3) regeneration of the
   redox-reactive beta -MnO2 surface through oxidation of the Mn2O3
   precipitate by dissolved oxygen. Comparison of experimental and
   calculated results demonstrates that the model describes the response of
   the coupled hydrological and geochemical processes to changes in flow
   rate, influent concentrations of Co(II)EDTA, and beta -MnO2 surface

Abstract = {{Yb4As3 exhibits very anisotropic magnetic properties, while its dynamic
   form factor of the inelastic excitation spectra at very low temperatures
   are well described by an almost-isotropic one-dimensional Heisenberg
   model, which is supplemented by the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction. To
   clarify the origin of this feature, the crystalline field effects in the
   inelastic neutron scattering and the magnetic susceptibility data of
   Yb4As3 are analyzed to separate out the contribution of the lowest
   Kramers-doublet state from those of the crystalline field excited
   states. The isotropic excitation mode is ascribed to the former state.
   The excitation spectra specified by the magnetic polarization directions
   are also calculated to give additional information of the crystalline
   field states. It is also pointed out that the magnetization parallel to
   the c-axis is induced for the magnetic field; which is applied
   perpendicular to the c-axis in the c-plane. Its magnitude is
   proportional to the cube of the field strength. The internal field can
   have different values on the two Yb3+ sites which are connected by the
   glide operation. It is shown that the magnetization can give us detailed
   information of the local C-3 symmetry) around the Yb3+ site.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method of enhancing the capture rate of 0.1-mum level
   defects by pattern-matching inspectors is studied from the viewpoint of
   image variances. By our method, defect inspection engineers can obtain
   quantitative information for enhancing the capture rate of 0.1-mum level
   defects on both actual devices and test element groups (TEGs). The
   inspection sensitivities were experimentally evaluated by using the
   detection rate of the defects on an actual device and on the TEG. The
   image noise and the defect signal of the captured charge-coupled device
   (CCD) images of the same defect were quantitatively analyzed. The
   observed image noise and the defect signal obey a normal distribution.
   The capture rate calculated by our model, based on normal distribution,
   almost agrees with the experimental data. Next, we propose a new
   criterion called the ``practical capture rate{''} by uniting the capture
   rate and the false count. The threshold value optimized from the
   viewpoint of the practical capture rate agrees with empirical thresholds
   value set by our defect inspection engineers. Finally, as an example of
   capture rate enhancement, a unique TEG called TWICE (TEG with image
   contrast enhancing) for photoresist inspection is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to establish the temporal-spatial
   relationship between muscle activity and the smash stroke of skilled
   badminton players and to assess performance accuracy using the ellipse
   of constant distance. We recorded the surface electromyographic (EMG)
   activity of selected superficial muscles of the stroking arm and
   shoulder - flexor carpi ulnalis, extensor carpi radialis, triceps
   brachii (lateral head), biceps brachii and trapezius (upper) - during
   the badminton smash. In the first part of the study, we examined the
   characteristics of muscle function and performance accuracy of skilled
   and unskilled individuals during the badminton smash. Five well-trained
   badminton players and five students with no experience of badminton were
   asked to smash a shuttle as hard as they could towards a vertical square
   target 4 m away, repeating the stroke 30 times. In general, the skilled
   players showed a more constant time from peak electromyographic
   amplitude to impact. Immediately after impact, the electromyographic
   activity of the triceps brachii and - flexor carpi radialis of the
   skilled players decreased; in the unskilled participants, however, it
   continued until well after impact. The area of the ellipse of constant
   distance and the off-target distance, which were used as indices of
   performance accuracy, were smaller for the skilled than for the
   unskilled participants. In the second part of the study, one skilled and
   one unskilled participant performed 100 trials a day for 6 days. The
   time from peak electromyographic amplitude to impact in the extensor
   carpi radialis and - flexor carpi ulnalis was more variable in the
   unskilled than in the skilled participant even after 6 days of practice,
   but the proximal muscles of the unskilled participant had a similar
   pattern of activity to that of the skilled player. Thus, controlling the
   distal muscles appears to be important for achieving accurate
   performance of the smash in badminton.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of low-turnover lesions in patients undergoing peritoneal
   dialysis (PD) is high. Our aims are to evaluate the prevalence of
   adynamic bone disease (ABD) in PD patients, analyze risk factors, and
   define the association of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels
   measured under different plasma calcium concentrations with this lesion.
   Fifty-seven patients were studied by bone biopsy (BB). ABD was found in
   63.2\%, and 36.8\% showed high-turnover bone disease (HTBD). Patients
   with HTBD had a lower prevalence of diabetes, younger age, lower
   accumulated oral calcium salt intake, and greater calcitriol doses,
   serum osteocalcin level, and ultrafiltration than patients with ABD,
   Both mean baseline PTH levels from the previous year and PTH level at
   time of BE were greater in patients with HTBD than those with ABD (357
   +/- 267 pg/mL versus 89 +/- 67 pg/mL; 390 +/- 337 pg/mL versus 88 +/- 78
   pg/mL, respectively; P < 0.05). However, the magnitude of the increase
   from baseline serum PTH levels in response to hypocalcemia was greater
   in patients with ABD than in those with HTBD (166.4\% +/- 134\% versus
   83.5\% +/- 73.6\%; P < 0.05). We found that PTH levels less than 150
   pg/mL in patients with ABD showed a sensitivity of 91.6\%, specificity
   of 95.2\%, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 97\%, In the HTBD
   group, PTH levels greater than 450 pg/mL had a specificity and PPV of
   100\%. Our data confirm that ABD is the most prevalent lesion in PD
   patients, and PTH secretion capacity is maintained in these patients.
   The definitive diagnosis and management strategies for many patients
   requires a BE, especially when HTBD is unlikely. (C) 2000 by the

Abstract = {{Background: Overtriage is a problem for all trauma systems, including
   the Greek emergency system. In this study we examined the performance of
   the primary care emergency system in the treatment of patients with
   simple thoracic injuries, in the area of a Level I hospital. Our aim was
   to form organizational proposals and treatment and referral guidelines
   in an effort to improve the system's performance.
   Methods: We reviewed the notes of 488 patients with a thoracic injury as
   their main complaint, seen and immediately discharged from the A + E
   department of a Level I hospital.
   Results: Falls and road traffic accidents were the most common
   mechanisms of injury. The majority of the injuries were rib fractures or
   rib cage contusions. Many patients sought medical advice several days
   after the injury. Fifteen patients required conservative treatment for
   orthopaedic injuries. Clinical examination, X-rays and abdominal
   ultrasound were the most useful tests.
   Conclusions: Detailed clinical examination, time from injury and a chest
   X-ray usually identifies the patients who can safely be treated in
   primary health care facilities. Simple radiology services (X-ray and US)
   and training of general practitioners in basic emergency care principals
   in primary care health centres would reduce the number of referred
   patients with simple thoracic injuries. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The Retarding Potential Analyzer (RPA) is the standard instrument for in
   situ measurement of ion temperature and other ionospheric parameters.
   The fraction of incoming ions rejected by a RPA produces perturbations
   that reach well ahead of a thin Debye sheath, a feature common to all
   collisionless, hypersonic flows past ion-rejecting bodies. This
   phenomenon is here found to result in a correction to Whipple's
   classical law for the current characteristic of an ideal RPA (sheath
   thin; inverse ram ion Mach number M-1, and ram angle of RPA aperture
   theta, small or moderately small). The current correction increases with
   the temperature ratio T-e/T-i, and ranges from a 15\%-30\% reduction at
   M theta =0 to a 15\%-30\% increase at M theta =2, for typical values of
   M, T-e/T-i and transparency of aperture grid. Linear analysis of the
   perturbed plasma beyond the sheath rests on the fact that a Maxwellian
   undisturbed ion distribution is Vlasov-stable against
   quasineutral-ionacoustic waves. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a processing flow to extract aerosol
   characteristics on a global scale from polarization and directionality
   of Earth reflectance (POLDER) level 1 data. POLDER provides radiance and
   polarization in the visible and near-infrared regions. Our procedure is
   composed of two phases; one is a data reduction process from the POLDER
   level 1 to the global scale, and the other is the aerosol retrieval
   process. The retrieval algorithm is achieved in practice using a look-up
   table which is compiled based on multiple scattering simulations in an
   atmosphere-sea surface system. Monthly global distribution maps showing
   the Angstrom exponent and the optical thickness of aerosols were
   obtained in November 1996 and in January and April 1997. From these
   aerosol maps, it can be seen that: (1) the aerosol distribution derived
   from POLDER radiance and polarization data coincides with the radiance
   data obtained independently from OCTS, (2) atmospheric aerosols exhibit
   certain intrinsic feature on a global and on a seasonal scale. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Background: Young children are generally not able to consistently and
   reliably perform tests of airway function, and normative values are not
   available, Reliable and valid measures of parental reporting of asthma
   symptoms and functioning are needed to determine the efficacy of asthma
   interventions.
   Objective: A pediatric asthma caregiver diary was developed and
   validated for use in interventional asthma studies.
   Methods: A 3-week prospective study of 125 caregiver parents and their
   children, aged 2 to 5 years, with persistent asthma was conducted, At
   baseline, children were classified as either stable (no change to
   anti-inflammatory therapy) or unstable (anti-inflammatory therapy added
   or increased).
   Results: A symptom scale and day without asthma symptoms (DWAS) were
   defined from pediatric asthma caregiver diary questions. The scale and
   DWAS statistically differentiated between the stable and unstable groups
   at week 1 and detected change between the 2 groups (P <.01). On average,
   caregivers reported low symptom scores. However, the frequency of DWAS
   was only 43\% of days in the stable group and 22\% in the unstable
   group.
   Conclusion: The pediatric asthma caregiver diary scale and DWAS have
   acceptable measurement characteristics for use in clinical trials of
   children with asthma symptoms. The DWAS indicates an opportunity for
   improvement in asthma control in this population.}},

   be used to model any kind of resistivity array.
   Specializing the general solution to full- or half-space models
   possessing exponential dependence, I find terms I interpret as primary
   and secondary contributions. Analytic expressions for the secondary
   electrical field revealed an error in the Stoyer and Wait solution for a
   half-space.
   To test the derived n-layer solution based on recursion formulas, I
   modeled resistivity logs for both homogeneous layers and intercalated
   homogeneous and heterogeneous layers. Curves from the theory reproduced
   asymmetries and ripples observed in real resistivity logs.}},

Abstract = {{For three spider crabs (Tiarinia cornigera, Micippa platipes and
   Pugettia quadridens quadridens), patterns of algal utilization for
   decorating were compared with the dynamics of algae on an intertidal
   rocky shore reef where the crabs co-occurred. T. cornigera and P.
   quadridens quadridens were most abundant from autumn to spring when the
   dominant algae (Boodlea coacta, Sargassum hemiphyllum, S. thunbergii and
   Corallina pilulifera) occurred in high coverage, while M. platipes was
   most abundant from spring to autumn. Monthly change of algae used for
   decorating was not correlated with algae growing in the crab habitat for
   T. cornigera, but for M. platipes, it was positively correlated for two
   algal species, and for P. quadridens quadridens, negatively correlated
   for one algal species. Each species of the spider crabs used some algal
   species preferentially for decoration. Decorating preference experiments
   conducted in the laboratory showed that M. platipes and P. quadridens
   quadridens exhibited similar preference to their algal utilization in
   the field, whereas for T. cornigera, algal preference in the experiment
   differed from utilization in the field. Comparisons between materials
   used for decoration and gut contents revealed that T. cornigera and M.
   platipes used algal species differently for decorating and feeding,
   while P. quadridens quadridens used the same algal species for both
   decorating and feeding. Different tactics for camouflage are discussed
   in terms of algal utilizations by the three majid species.}},

Abstract = {{Van der Waals (vdW) complexes of a series of alkylbenzenes (benzene,
   toluene, ethylbenzene, and n-propylbenzene) formed with Ar in supersonic
   jets have been studied with two-color zero-kinetic-energy (ZEKE)
   electron spectroscopy combined with a PFI (pulsed field ionization)
   method. The shifts in adiabatic ionization energies (I-a) due to complex
   formation have been determined as -128 and -112 cm(-1) for
   ethylbenzene-Ar and n-propylbenzene-Ar, respectively, with respect to
   the bare molecules. These shifts have been reproduced qualitatively in
   terms of atom-atom Lennard-Jones (LJ) potentials incorporating
   charge-charge-induced-dipole interactions. Some low-frequency ZEKE bands
   due to vdW Vibrations have been observed for benzene-Ar for the first
   time. However, no vdW vibrational structures appear in ZEKE electron
   spectra both for ethylbenzene-Ar and n-propylbenzene-Ar. The absence of
   vdW vibrational structure in the spectra may be probably due to a steric
   hindrance between Ar and the alkyl group. This has been supported also
   by the present LJ potential calculations. Furthermore, for toluene-Ar,
   it has been found that upon ionization the relative position of Ar is
   shifted along the direction of the C-C(H-3) bond. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study we examined the behaviour and role of an intra-acrosomal
   antigenic molecule, acrin 3, during mouse fertilisation in vitro by
   assessing the effect of its pertinent monoclonal antibody mMC101.
   Experiments were designed to assess the effect of mMC101 on sperm-zona
   pellucida binding, the acrosome reaction, zona pellucida penetration,
   sperm-egg fusion, and fertilisation in vitro. mMC101 did not affect
   sperm motility or primary and secondary binding to the zona pellucida,
   but significantly inhibited fertilisation of zona-pellucida-intact
   oocytes in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of mMC101 at 100
   mug/ml concentration in TYH medium, none of the oocytes developed to
   pronuclear stage by 5 h after co-incubation of the gametes, but the
   pronucleus formation rate recovered to some extent (45.3\%) after 8 h,
   indicating a delay of early embryonic development. mMC101 also delayed
   and significantly suppressed zona pellucida penetration by sperm. Acrin
   3 dispersed and did not remain on completely acrosome-reacted sperm.
   Although mMC101 did not influence the zona-pellucida-induced acrosome
   reaction, it significantly inhibited fertilisation when acrosome-reacted
   sperm in the presence of mMC101 inseminated zona-pellucida-free oocytes.
   However, fertilisation remained unaffected when acrosome-reacted sperm
   in the absence of mMC101 inseminated zona-pellucida-free oocytes even in
   its presence. Thus, acrin 3 appears to facilitate zona pellucida
   penetration and is also likely to be involved in sperm-oocyte fusion by
   modifying the sperm plasma membrane during the acrosome reaction.}},

   California San Diego, CA, USA) following the procedure of crushing
   on-line with an 8 minute single step; data for the Cook-Austral islands
   are taken from the literature. The He-3/He-4 value distribution shows an
   intrinsic dispersion s between 1.1 and 1.4 times RA (RA= He-3/He-4 in
   Air = 1.39 x 10(-6)) and appears sensibly uniform over the area
   explored, clearly independent from the variation of age (0 to 20 My)
   along the dorsal of the island chains. The difference appearing between
   the mean value obtained or the Society (R/RA = 6.3 +/- 1) and the
   Cook-Austral (R/RA = 7.3 +/- 1.4) is not appreciable within the
   ``natural{''} dispersion. The values obtained are substantially lower

Title = {{Preliminary toxicological studies of selected water-soluble

Abstract = {{The objective of this preliminary investigation of a number of
   water-soluble carrier-bound platinum(II) complexes for potential use in
   cancer chemotherapy was to assess the toxicological behavior of
   representative platinum coordination compounds anchored to, or
   incorporated into, polymeric carriers via polymer-attached amine
   ligands, The conjugates included linear polyaspartamides (1-4, 6, 7),
   each composed of a major fraction of subunits featuring
   side-chain-attached tertiary amino groups as water-solubilizing
   entities, and a minor fraction of subunits comprising the anchored
   platinum complexes, again as side-chain components. Whereas in 1-4 the
   platinum atom was polymer-bound through a single amino group, both 6 and
   7 contained polymer-attached cis-diamine-chelating ligands coordinating
   to the metal center, Also included in this study was a linear
   polyamidoamine (5), which contained a poly(ethylene oxide) segment in
   the backbone in addition to intrachain ethylenediamine segments acting
   as cis-diamine chelating ligands for coordination to the platinum
   center. The compounds were injected as aqueous (phosphate-buffered
   saline) solutions into the tail veins of CD-1 mice (four to eight mice
   per conjugate), and the maximally tolerated dose was determined for each
   compound. For polyaspartamides 1-4 the dose levels ranged from about 25
   mg Pt (kg body weight(-1)) (in conjugate 4) to 500 mg Pt kg(-1) (in
   compound 1), the latter conjugate proving some 100-fold less toxic than
   cisplatin (3-4 mg Pt kg(-1)), which was included in this study for
   comparison. Low toxicity (tolerated dose 160 mg Pt kg(-1)) was also
   observed for the intrachain cis-diamineplatinum complex polymer (5), The
   polyaspartamide conjugates 6 and 7, on the other hand, both
   characterized by a cis-diamineplatinum complex system in the side chain,
   were toxic even below the dose level of 20-25 mg Pt kg(-1). The
   preliminary findings of this study, while providing a basis for more
   extensive and broad-based toxicological studies, will serve to direct
   and optimize structural conjugate designs in forthcoming synthetic
   programs. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   Customary beam shaping techniques are identified as a special case of a

   makes use of the field quantities amplitude and phase and therefore it
   is a wave-optical design approach. The flexibility of the technique is
   demonstrated by various examples. Parameters like conversion efficiency,

   number of transmission functions necessary for the implementation of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new technique for computing the exact overall
   duration of a project, when task durations have independent
   distributions. A project is represented as an Activity-on-Are (AoA)
   graph, where a task begins as soon as all its predecessor tasks have
   finished. Task durations use a probability density function (p.d.f.)
   which combines Piecewise polynomial segments and Dirac delta functions,
   defined over a finite interval. A semi-analytical procedure is proposed
   to compute the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) directly by
   integrating a linear transformation of the p.d.f. of the task durations.
   Graph reduction techniques by Hopcroft and Tarjan and by Valdes allow
   the problem to be broken into a series of smaller subproblems. improving
   computational efficiency. Examples are presented to illustrate the

Abstract = {{Objective: Oxygen is frequently administered to women during labor if

   maternal oxygen administration on the fetus with near infrared laser
   spectroscopy (NIRS).
   Methods: 24 patients with normal fetal sonography findings and heart
   rate pattern were enrolled. After the onset of labor the laser optodes
   for NIRS were applied to record HbO(2) and HbR as parameters of blood
   oxygen saturation and cytochrome aa(3) as an indicator of tissue
   oxygenation.
   Results: Administration of oxygen to the mother was associated with a
   significant increase of the oxygenation index in the blood and increased
   tissue oxygenation.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that administration of oxygen to the
   mother during labor can improve the oxygen supply to the fetus.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete far-infrared (FIR) sources of M 31 are identified in the ISO
   175 mum map and characterized via their FIR colours, luminosities and
   masses in order to reveal the nature of these knots. With our spatial
   resolution of 300 pc at M 31's distance, the FIR knots arc:clearly seen
   as extended objects with a mean size of about 800 pc. Since this appears
   too large for a single dust cloud, the knots might represent several
   clouds in chance projection or giant cloud complexes.
   The 175 mum data point provides crucial information in addition to the
   IRAS 60 and 100 mum data: At least two lambda (-2) modified Planckian
   curves with temperatures of about 40 K and 15-21 K are necessary to fit
   the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the knots. Though they show
   a continuous range of temperatures, we distinguish between three types
   of knots - cold, medium, warm - in order to recognize trends.
   Comparisons with radio and optical tracers show that - statistically -
   the cold knots can be identified well with CO and HI radio sources and
   thus might represent mainly molecular cloud complexes. The warm knots
   coincide with known H II regions and supernova remnants. The medium
   knots might contain a balanced mixture of molecular clouds and HII
   regions. The cold knots have a considerable luminosity and their
   discovery raises the question of hidden star formation.
   Though the optically dark dust lanes in M 31 generally match the FIR
   ring, surprisingly we do not find a convincing coincidence of our knots
   with individual dark clouds, which might therefore show mainly
   foreground dust features.
   The ratio of FIR luminosity to dust mass, Llnl, is used to measure the
   energy content of the dust. It can originate from both the interstellar
   radiation held and still embedded stars recently formed. The knots have
   a clear L/M excess over the rest of M31, providing evidence that they
   are powered by star formation in addition to the interstellar radiation
   field. Furthermore, the L/M ratio of the warm knots is comparable to
   that of Galactic Hn regions like M 42 or NGC 2024, while that of the
   cold knots still reaches values like in the average Orion complex. Thus
   both the warm and even the cold knots are interpreted as containing
   large cloud complexes with considerable ongoing star formation.}},

Abstract = {{The constant modulus (CM) criterion has become popular in the design of
   blind linear estimators of sub-Gaussian independent and identically
   distributed (i.i.d.) processes transmitted through unknown linear
   channels in the presence of unknown additive interference. In this
   paper, me present an upper bound for the conditionally unbiased
   mean-squared error (USME) of CM-minimizing estimators that depends only
   on the source kurtoses and the UMSE of Wiener estimators. Further
   analysis reveals that the extra UMSE of CM estimators can be
   upper-bounded by approximately the square of the Wiener (i.e., minimum)
   UMSE. Since our results hold for vector-valued finite-impulse
   response/infinite-impulse response (FIR/IIR) linear channels,
   vector-valued FIR/IIR estimators with a possibly constrained number of
   adjustable parameters, and multiple interferers with arbitrary
   distribution, they confirm the longstanding conjecture regarding the
   general mean-square error (MSE) robustness of CM estimators.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin secretion is under multifactorial control by glucose and
   neurohumoral factors like acetylcholine (ACH), which activate the
   Ca2+/phospholipase C signaling pathway. All insulin secretagogues
   elevate cytosolic free Ca2+ ({[}Ca2+](i)) that is central to the
   stimulation of insulin secretion. The actions of ACH on {[}Ca2+](i) are
   glucose dependent but the metabolic steps involved are only partly
   understood. Here we have characterized the metabolic steps by which
   glucose exerts its synergistic effects on AGH-linked Ca2+-signals.
   {[}Ca2+](i) was measured in single fura-a loaded beta -cells. The ACH
   analog carbachol (3 muM) caused rise in {[}Ca2+]i that was strongly
   dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration ranging from 0-10
   mM. Iodoacetate, which blocks glycolysis, thereby preventing the
   generation of NADH and ATP from glucose metabolism, and rotenone or
   antimycin, which inhibit complex 1 and 2 of the mitochondrial
   respiratory chain, respectively, inhibited in glucose (6 mM) the
   carbachol-induced Ca2+ signal to a similar extent as glucose
   deprivation. This demonstrates that glucose metabolism and generation of
   ATP through oxidative phosphorylation of energy rich substrates like
   NADH and FADH(2) are required for carbachol-induced Ca2+ signals. While
   sodium arsenate, which prevents net glycolytic production of ATP without
   inhibiting glycolysis, had no significant effect on the
   carbachol-induced Ca2+ signal, the mitochondrial pyruvate transport
   inhibitor alpha -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and the Krebs cycle inhibitor
   monofluoroacetate strongly suppressed the rise in {[}Ca2+](i) elicited
   by carbachol. While pyruvate was ineffective, methyl pyruvate, a
   membrane-permeant pyruvate analog, and alpha -ketoisocaproate in
   combination with glutamine, which are both substrates for mitochondrial
   ATP production, could restore the carbachol-induced Ca2+ signal in
   glucose-free medium. These data demonstrate for the first time that
   Krebs cycle metabolism of glucose and ATP formation through oxidative
   phosphorylation is critical for the glucose dependency of ACH-linked
   Ca2+-signals in mouse beta -cells, and they suggest that mitochondrial
   metabolism plays a key role in the interactive regulation of beta -cells
   by neurohumoral factors activating the Ca2+/phospholipase C signaling
   pathway.}},

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Bioactivity of phosphopeptides yielded after tryptic hydrolysis of
   casein (CPP) was reported more than 50 years ago when CPP were found to
   improve calcium balance in rachitic newborns. Several investigations
   have been carried out to study the effects of CPP mainly on calcium
   metabolism but also on other minerals like iron and zinc. Most of the
   experiments were in vitro studies or short-term experiments like the
   effects of CPP after single meals or their effect on mineral
   disappearance from intestinal everted sac or ligated loop.
   investigations on calcium balance were also mainly short term, i.e. 3-4
   weeks, and mainly done in rats. A few experiments have been carried out
   in minipigs, an animal model that is closer to the human than the rat.
   Studies in human were rare and short term. To date a variety of other
   peptides have been isolated after enzymatic hydrolysis, and some have
   been investigated for bioactivity, with equivocal findings. Bioactivity
   of phosphopeptides seemed to be more obvious when investigations were
   done in vitro or short term. Results were less clear in metabolic
   balance studies, especially under physiological conditions. The
   composition of the basal diet, i.e. content of calcium and phytate, or
   the protein source had a significant impact on the effect of
   phosphopeptides. It was concluded that phosphopeptides revealed positive
   effects on mineral solubility and absorbability, and bone mineralisation
   under certain experimental conditions. Accordingly they could have a
   beneficial effect on bone health for some groups of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Fra1 is an immediate-early gene encoding a member of the AP-1
   transcription factor family, which has diverse roles in development and
   oncogenesis. To determine the function of Fra1 in mouse development, the
   gene was inactivated by gene targeting. Foetuses lacking Fra1 were
   severely growth retarded and died between E10.0 and E10.5, owing to
   defects in extra-embryonic tissues. The placental labyrinth layer, where
   X-gal staining revealed expression of Fra1, was reduced in size and
   largely avascular, owing to a marked decrease in the number of vascular
   endothelial cells, as shown by the lack of Flk1 expression, In contrast,
   the spongiotrophoblast layer was unaffected and expressed the marker
   genes 4311 (Tpbp) and Flt1. Furthermore, mutant foetuses exhibited
   yolk-sac defects that may contribute to their growth retardation and
   lethality. Importantly, when the placental defect was rescued by
   injection of Fra1(-/-) ES cells into tetraploid wild-type blastocysts,
   Fra1(-/-) pups were obtained that were no longer growth retarded and
   survived up to 2 days after birth without apparent phenotypic defects.
   These data indicate that a defect in the extra-embryonic compartment is
   causal to the observed lethality, and suggest that Fra1 plays a crucial
   role in establishing normal vascularisation of the placenta.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-With the advent of time-dependent thrombolytic
   therapy for ischemic stroke, it has become increasingly important for
   stroke patients to arrive at the hospital quickly. This study
   investigates the association between the use of emergency medical
   services (EMS) and delay time among individuals with stroke symptoms and
   examines the predictors of EMS use.
   Methods-The Second Delay in Accessing Stroke Healthcare Study (DASH II)
   was a prospective study of 617 individuals arriving at emergency
   departments in Denver, Cole, Chapel Hill, NC, and Greenville, SC, with
   stroke symptoms.
   Results-EMS use was associated with decreased prehospital and
   in-hospital delay. Those who used EMS had a median prehospital delay
   time of 2.85 hours compared with 4.03 hours for those who did not use
   EMS (P = 0.002). Older individuals were more likely to use EMS (odds
   ratio EOR] 1.21 for each 5-year increase, 95\% CI 1.14 to 1.29), as were
   individuals who expressed a high sense of urgency about their symptoms
   (OR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.09 to 2.62). Knowledge of stroke symptoms was not
   associated with increased EMS use (OR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.40 to 0.98).
   Patients were more likely to use EMS if someone other than the patient
   first identified that there was a problem (OR 2.35, 95\% CI 1.61 to
   3.44).
   Conclusions-Interventions aimed at increasing EMS use among stroke
   patients need to stress the urgency of stroke symptoms and the
   importance of calling 911 and need to be broad-based, encompassing not
   only those at high risk for stroke but also their friends and family.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To investigate the use of a simple DNA isolation technique for
   application in epidemiologic studies. To analyze systematically the
   potential impact of lag time between blood drawing and DNA isolation and
   the condition of storage of blood samples on the quantity and quality of
   isolated DNA in large-scale epidemiologic studies.
   METHODS: A modified single tube DNA isolation technique was used. DNA
   was isolated from samples collected from six participants and processed
   in triplicate: a) without delay after blood drawing; b) after blood
   cells were stored at 4 degreesC for 7 days; c) after blood cells were
   stored at -70 degreesC for 7 days; and d) after storage for 7 days at
   -70 degreesC with addition of lysis/digestion buffer. Polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analysis were performed to analyze the
   quality of the isolated DNA.
   RESULTS: The average amount of DNA isolated ranged from 27.0 to 71.1
   mug/4.5 mi whole blood. Storage at 4 degreesC yielded, on the average,
   20\% less DNA than the samples processed without delay or after storage
   at -70 degreesC, although this difference was not statistically
   significant (p = 0.63). All four conditions studied allowed isolation of
   highly pure DNA suitable for genetic analyses by Southern blot analysis
   and polymerase chain reaction.
   CONLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that storage for 7 days and at
   different temperatures allows isolation of high quality DNA. Using the
   described technique, storage of up to 7 days permits processing of large
   numbers of samples (50-70) in a single day, allowing for a reliable and
   cost efficient way of processing in various settings. Further studies
   are needed to investigate the influence of long-term storage of
   biological specimens on DNA isolation and quality. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Title = {{Role of motor cortex in coordinating multi-joint movements: Is it time

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{923-933}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Reaching movements to spatial targets require motor patterns at the
   shoulder to be coordinated carefully with those at the elbow to smoothly
   move the hand through space. While the motor cortex is involved in this
   volitional task, considerable debate remains about how this cortical
   region participates in planning and controlling movement. This article
   reviews two opposing interpretations of motor cortical function during
   multi-joint movements. On the one hand, studies performed predominantly
   on single-joint movement generally support the notion that motor
   cortical activity is intimately involved in generating motor patterns at
   a given joint. In contrast, studies on reaching demonstrate correlations
   between motor cortical activity and features of movement related to the
   hand, suggesting that the motor cortex may be involved in more global
   features of the task. Although this latter paradigm involves a
   multi-joint motor task in which neural activity is correlated with
   features of movement related to the hand, this neural activity is also
   correlated to other movement variables. Therefore it is difficult to
   assess if and how the motor cortex contributes to the coordination of
   motor patterns at different joints. In particular, present paradigms
   cannot assess whether motor cortical activity contributes to the control
   of one joint or multiple joints during whole-arm tasks. The final point
   discussed in this article is the development of a new experimental
   device (KINARM) that can both monitor and manipulate the mechanics of
   the shoulder and elbow independently during multi-joint motor tasks. It
   is hoped that this new device will provide a new approach for examining
   how the motor cortex is involved in motor coordination.}},

Abstract = {{A new heat-driven chemical heat pump was proposed using
   isobutylene/water/t-butyl alcohol reaction system. It provides a low

   condenser, exothermic reactor, and endothermic reactor. The cold thermal
   energy was generated at the evaporator. The near was released from the
   condenser and the exothermic reactor at ambient temperature. The
   endothermic reactor absorbed energy from the low temperature heat
   source. A rectifying column was also located at the exit of the
   endothermic reactor to concentrate isobutylene in the evaporator.
   Moreover two heat exchangers were added to the system to reduce the heat
   input. The system analyses including equilibrium calculations, heat and
   mass balances indicated that optima of the reflux ratio and the
   endothermic reactor temperature existed where the maximum of the
   coefficient of performance (COP) was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{To describe genetic variability and population diversity in domesticated
   populations of American bison (Bison bison), aurochs (Bison, bonasus),
   and gray Ukrainian cattle (Bos taurus) different variants of DNA
   fingerprinting technique (utilizing the M13 phage DNA, (TTAGGG)(4)
   synthetic oligonucleotide, and three arbitrary primers as hybridization
   probes) were used. Several parameters characterizing polymorphism and
   genetic diversity levels in each population (species) were evaluated on
   the basis of the profiles obtained. Dendrograms of genetic similarities
   between individual animals were constructed. Genetic variability of
   minisatellite and telomeric markers observed in the gray Ukrainian
   cattle flock was higher than that in aurochs and bisons. Comparison of
   the intrapopulation similarity (S) and gene diversity (H) indices along
   with the analysis of dusters in the dendrograms showed that the
   relatedness between the aurochs individuals was much higher than between
   the individual animals in the bison and gray Ukrainian cattle flocks.
   Furthermore, the gray Ukrainian cattle flock was represented by more
   distant relatives than the bison hock. It is suggested that reduced
   genetic variability and the appearance of deviant genotype observed in
   the two bison lines under selection, resulted from close inbreeding and
   the founder effect. The diagnostic value and efficacy of utilization of
   different molecular markers for estimation of genetic diversity and
   relatedness in domesticated animal populations is discussed.}},

Title = {{Mutational analysis suggests that activation of the yeast pheromone
   response mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway involves
   conformational changes in the Ste5 scaffold protein}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ste5 is essential for pheromone response and binds components of a
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade: Ste11 (MEKK), Ste7
   (MEK), and Fus3 (MAPK). Pheromone stimulation releases G beta gamma
   (Ste4-Ste18), which recruits Ste5 and Ste20 (p21-activated kinase) to
   the plasma membrane, activating the MAPK cascade. A RING-H2 domain in
   Ste5 (residues 177-229) negatively regulates Ste5 function and mediates
   its interaction with G beta gamma. Ste5(C177A C180A), carrying a mutated
   RING-H2 domain, cannot complement a ste5 Delta mutation, yet supports
   mating even in ste4 Delta ste5 Delta cells when artificially dimerized
   by fusion to glutathione S-transferase (GST). In contrast, wild-type
   Ste5 fused to GST permits mating of ste5 Delta cells, but does not allow
   mating of ste4 Delta ste5 Delta cells. This differential behavior
   provided the basis of a genetic selection for STE5 gain-of-function
   mutations. MATa ste4 Delta ste5 Delta cells expressing Ste5-GST were
   mutagenized chemically and plasmids conferring the capacity to mate were
   selected. Three independent single-substitution mutations were isolated.
   These constitutive STE5 alleles induce cell cycle arrest,
   transcriptional activation, and morphological changes normally triggered
   by pheromone, even when G beta gamma is absent. The first, Ste5(C226Y),
   alters the seventh conserved position in the RING-H2 motif, confirming
   that perturbation of this domain constitutively activates Ste5 function.
   The second, Ste5(P44L), lies upstream of a basic segment, whereas the
   third, Ste5(S770K), is situated within an acidic segment in a region
   that contacts Ste7. None of the mutations increased the affinity of Ste5
   for Ste11, Ste7: or Fus3. However, the positions of these
   novel-activating mutations suggested that, in normal Ste5, the N
   terminus may interact with the C terminus. Indeed, in vitro,
   GST-Ste5(1-518) was able to associate specifically with radiolabeled
   Ste5(520-917). Furthermore, both the P44L and S770K mutations enhanced
   binding of full-length Ste5 to GST-Ste5(1-518), whereas they did not
   affect Ste5 dimerization. Thus, binding of G beta gamma to the RING-H2
   domain may induce a conformational change that promotes association of
   the N- and C-terminal ends of Ste5, stimulating activation of the MAPK
   cascade by optimizing orientation of the bound kinases and/or by
   increasing their accessibility to Ste20-dependent phosphorylation (or
   both). In accord with this model, the novel Ste5 mutants copurified with
   Ste7 and Fus3 in their activated state and their activation required
   Ste20.}},

Abstract = {{The methods devised for male contraception are meager. The authors
   review the various nonhormonal methods applied for contraception
   including vas deferens interference and heat. The former comprises the
   no-scalpel vasectomy, percutaneous vasal injection, the ``Shug{''}
   method, and the argon laser vasal photocoagulation. Heat methods used
   wet heat, and artificial cryptorchidism was created by testicular
   suspension. The testicle was suspended in the superficial inguinal pouch
   close to the scrotal neck using 2 methods: stitch and ball. Two recently
   developed methods for male contraception-polyester-induced azoospermia
   and prolactin injection-are described. The azoospermic effect of the
   polyester sling seems to be due to (1) creation of an electrostatic
   field across the intrascrotal structures, and (2) disordered
   thermoregulation. Prolactin administration as a contraceptive method is
   efficient and safe and has the potential to be developed as a male
   contraceptive. The methods, especially testicular suspension and
   polyester suspensors, are simple and easily applicable and were well
   accepted by the subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Adult dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have been shown to express a wide range
   of voltage-gated sodium channel alpha -subunits. However, of the
   auxiliary subunits, beta1 is expressed preferentially in only large- and
   medium-diameter neurons of the DRG while beta2 is absent in all DRG
   cells. In view of this, we have compared the distribution of beta1 in
   rat DRG and spinal cord with a novel, recently cloned beta1-like
   subunit, beta3. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated high levels
   of beta3 mRNA in small-diameter c-fibres, while beta1 mRNA was virtually
   absent in these cell types but was expressed in 100\% of large-diameter
   neurons. In the spinal cord, beta3 transcript was present specifically
   in layers I/II (substantia gelatinosa) and layer X, while beta1 mRNA was
   expressed in all laminae throughout the grey matter. Since the pattern
   of beta3 expression in DRG appears to correlate with the TTX-resistant
   voltage-gated sodium channel subunit PN3, we co-expressed the two
   subunits in Xenopus oocytes. In this system, beta3 caused a 5-mV
   hyperpolarizing shift in the threshold of activation of PN3, and a
   threefold increase in the peak current amplitude when compared with PN3
   expressed alone. On the basis of these results, we examined the
   expression of beta -subunits in the chronic constriction injury model of
   neuropathic pain. Results revealed a significant increase in beta3 mRNA
   expression in small-diameter sensory neurons of the ipsilateral DRG.
   These results show that beta3 is the dominant auxiliary sodium channel
   subunit in small-diameter neurons of the rat DRG and that it is
   significantly upregulated in a model of neuropathic pain.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Elevation of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after
   radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer is considered a surrogate
   marker of therapeutic failure. The most likely explanation for early PSA
   failure is considered to be due to local recurrent disease, provided the
   patient had a nondetectable PSA level after radical prostatectomy.
   Others have recently suggested that benign prostatic glands located on
   the surgical margins may often lead to detectable PSA levels. We
   examined the frequency of benign prostatic glands at the surgical
   margins of radical prostatectomy specimens and the factors associated
   with this finding.
   Methods. One hundred nineteen consecutive radical prostatectomies were
   performed by two experienced oncologic surgeons. Whole-mount sectioning
   of the prostatectomy specimens was performed at 3-mm intervals.
   Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine which
   clinical and pathologic factors were associated with benign glands on
   inked surgical margins,
   Results. Of the 119 cases, 13 (11\%) had benign glands on the inked
   surgical margins. Four of these 13 had tumor on the inked margins. The
   remaining 9 cases (8\%) were organ confined (pT2), with negative
   surgical margins. Benign glands were most often seen to involve the apex
   focally (7 of 9 cases). On bivariate and multivariate analyses, a high
   Gleason score and prostate gland volume were significantly associated
   with finding benign glands on the surgical margins. Only 2 of 86
   patients with follow-up had PSA recurrence at 59 and 67 days and neither
   had benign glands on the inked surgical margins.
   Conclusions. The presence of benign prostatic glands identified on inked
   surgical margins was an infrequent occurrence in this consecutive series
   of 119 whole-mount prostatectomy specimens. When benign glands were
   identified, they most often consisted of 1 to 3 glands at the apex
   margin. These findings suggest that benign glands on surgical margins
   are an unusual cause of postoperative detectable PSA, UROLOGY 56:

Title = {{Surgical management of substernal goiter}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We describe the clinical results and complications associated
   with differ ent surgical approaches to the treatment of substernal
   goiter.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 56 patients
   treated for substernal goiter from 1983 through 1999. Eight had
   undergone previous thyroidectomy. Posterior mediastinal goiter was
   diagnosed in eight patients, hyperthyroidism in seven, acute
   respiratory: failure in three, and superior vena cava syndrome in two.
   All but one of the patients underwent thyroidectomy.
   Results: Thyroid scan revealed that 88\% of patients had substernal
   goiter. A cervical incision alone was used in 46 of 55 patients. Nine
   patients underwent thyroidectomy via a thoracic approach. Both lobes
   were resected in 16 patients. Two deaths occurred: one patient suffered
   a stroke and another patient developed pneumonia after surgery. The most
   frequent complication was recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, followed by
   removal of a normal parathyroid gland and pneumonia. Multinodular goiter
   occurred in 52 patients. Resected goiter with occult malignancy was
   found in three patients, two, of whom underwent lobectomy only. These
   three patients had survived at 5, 7, and 11 years postoperatively,
   respectively. All patients with tracheal lumen narrowing showed a normal
   sized tracheal lumen 2 to 3 months postoperatively.
   Conclusion: Our data indicate that the presence of a substernal goiter
   should be considered an indication for resection based on risk of acute
   respiratory distress, risk of malignancy, and lower surgical morbidity.
   Most secondary substernal goiters can be simply resected through
   cervical incision and curation.}},

Abstract = {{A conductivity measurement system using a small ion-free-solution
   perfusion chamber has been developed to monitor single-sweat-gland

   window. Single sweat pores were visualized by the starch/iodine method
   and the chamber was attached onto a single sweat pore using a magnifying
   lens affixed at the window. Silver electrodes were installed inside the
   chamber, and, hy perfusing ion-free solution through the chamber at a
   constant how rate, the conductivity of the solution was measured at the
   inlet and the outlet of the chamber Continuous SSGA was monitored at the
   palm, finger tip and chest skin surface when the subjects were seated in
   a resting position and under stresses such as hand grasping with a
   dynamometer and performing mental arithmetic. Different types of
   response were observed from different sweat pores. The response time of

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Soil organic matter (SOM) turnover is more rapid in tropical than in
   temperate soils. One possible reason is a limited ability of tropical
   soils to stabilize SOM. To test this, we measured C turnover resulting
   from 12 years' cultivation of a forest soil with sorghum {[}Sorghum
   bicolor (L.) Moench]. Carbon-id natural abundance (delta C-13)
   signatures of forest- and sorghum-derived C were used to quantify C
   losses and gains in organo-mineral fractions separated by particle size,
   and further by density (for sands and silts) and magnetic susceptibility
   (for clays). Nearly 50\% of original C was in the silt-sized fraction,
   mostly in microaggregates of intermediate density; 30\% was held by
   clays, particularly those of intermediate magnetic susceptibility; and
   20\% was of sand-size, low-density, often recognizable plant residues.
   The delta C-13 values in the forest soil showed the more humified SOM to
   be associated with finer, denser,:md less magnetic fractions. After
   cultivation, total C content was 28\% lower, with 59\% of this reduction
   in the silts, 28\% in the sand, and 19\% in the clays. Loss of
   forest-derived C amounted to 45\%. The sand fraction lost 54\% of its
   forest C, the silts 45\% (mostly from intermediate density fractions),
   and the clays 23\% (mostly from intermediate magnetic fractions). Gains
   in sorghum-derived C amounted to 32\% of C in the sand fraction, 12\% in
   the silts (relatively evenly distributed among densities) and 13\% in
   the clays (mostly in the nonmagnetic fraction). Thus, losses of forest C
   and gains of sorghum C occurred in different organo-mineral fractions,
   indicating that there were no unique active fractions corresponding with
   the concept of C pools with defined turnover characteristics used in
   models of organic matter turnover.}},

Journal = {{TUMOR BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{It has been observed that the progressive ascitic growth of a
   transplantable T cell lymphoma of spontaneous origin, designated as
   Dalton's lymphoma (DL), induces inhibition of various immune responses
   and is associated with an involution of the thymus accompanied by a
   massive depletion of the cortical region and alteration in the
   distribution of thymocytes, with a decrease in CD4+CD8+, CD4+CD8- and
   CD4-CD8+ thymocytes. Morphological evaluation of thymocytes from
   DL-bearing mice revealed that with the progression of DL, a majority of
   thymocytes exhibited morphological features characteristic of apoptotic
   cell death, which included contracted cell bodies, condensed, uniformly
   circumscribed and densely stained chromatin, and membrane-bound
   apoptotic bodies containing one or more nuclear fragments. Quantitative
   and qualitative analysis of the DNA extracted from the thymocytes of
   DL-bearing mice revealed DNA fragmentation that increased concomitantly
   with the progression of DL and showed an oligonucleosomal DNA ladder
   pattern upon agarose gel electrophoresis, a hallmark of apoptotic cell
   death. Attempts to identify apoptotic factor(s) showed that the serum of
   DL-bearing mice contained certain soluble factor(s) that augmented the
   induction of apoptotis in thymocytes in a time- and dose-dependent
   manner. Although DL cells or their products, such as DL-cell-conditioned
   medium or DL-cell-free ascitic fluid, could also induce apoptosis of
   thymocytes in vitro, the magnitude of the same was consistently lower
   than that induced by the serum of DL-bearing mice. Further, elucidation
   of the mechanism of apoptosis induction in thymocytes with respect to
   the involvement of apoptosis-related genes revealed that the death
   pathway followed an interleukin-l P-converting-enzyme-dependent,
   Fas-mediated apoptotic cascade, with a concomitant increase in the
   protein products of the bax, bad, p53, fas and fasL genes and cleavage
   of the 23-kD N-terminal fragment of Bcl-2 that exhibited Bax-like death
   effector properties. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

Abstract = {{Species composition and turnover that have occurred in a series of
   permanent sample plots established during the 1930s and 1940s in
   Budongo, a semi-deciduous Ugandan forest, are reported. The plots were
   established as part of a sequence first used to describe forest
   succession, five of which have been maintained and which were last
   measured in 1992-1993. One plot (plot 7) provides 53 y of data from
   old-growth pristine forest. Plot 15 was established in wooded grassland
   at the forest edge and is now closed high forest. Evaluation of the
   remaining three plots is complicated by silvicultural interventions
   carried out in the 1950s. Forty species have been added since the first
   evaluations and a total of 188 tree species (over 80\% of Budongo's
   forest tree flora, and including two exotics) has now been recorded from
   within the plots. The pattern of shade-tolerance in the original plot
   series conforms to patterns expected for succession with an increasing
   proportion of shade-tolerant species with development, and large stems
   appearing to `lag behind' smaller stems in this respect. The time series
   data are less consistent, and while plot 7 increased in the proportion
   of shade-tolerant stems through time, the proportion of shade-tolerant
   species actually declines. Stem-turnover (the mean of mortality and
   recruitment) slowed with implied successional stage. Most species have a
   higher recruitment than mortality rate and stem numbers have thus
   increased in all plots. This is most pronounced in the putatively `early
   successional' plot. Stem size structure has changed within the plots,
   with an increased proportion of smaller stems. Species show different
   rates of turnover and these vary from plot to plot and period to period.
   In plot 7, the overall mortality rate decreased with initial stem size.
   Estimates imply that some tree species may easily live longer than 500 y
   after reaching 10 cm DBH, and that 1000 y is possible. The importance of
   large trees in determining forest dynamics is illustrated by the finding
   that death of only seven stems in plot 7 contributed over 60\% of net
   basal area losses recorded over the 53-y observation period. Many of the
   observed patterns were not predicted and could only have been found by
   long-term studies.}},

Abstract = {{A general ID model of composite delaminated beams with shear deformation
   effect is derived for buckling behavior. The constitutive models of
   composite laminated beams are derived from the classical 2D laminate
   theory. The present cylindrical bending models can be used-with much
   greater accuracy than their well-known plane-strain and plane-stress
   counterparts-as upper and lower bounds toward one of which the behavior
   tends, depending on the width-to-length ratio. The analysis is based on
   the first-order Timoshenko-Mindlin kinematic approach. The differential
   equations are solved with the aid of a specially developed, very
   efficient interlaced finite-difference scheme eliminating the ``shear
   locking{''} phenomenon. A parametric study of the shear deformation
   effect associated with various constitutive models is carried out for
   angle-ply delaminated laminate. It was found that the most significant
   difference between the models is associated with the mix of local and
   global modes.}},

Abstract = {{There has been very little research focusing on the role of the social
   worker in a specialist palliative care service. A qualitative research
   methodology was used which sought to capture the essence of that role,
   as perceived by those carrying it out, rather than simply to approach it
   as a series of tasks. A specialist palliative care social worker was
   asked to describe her role in selected cases that she had worked with.
   The interviews were taped and transcribed. The data were then analysed
   for themes using the techniques of constant comparative analysis. The
   themes were grouped into six categories and a conceptual framework
   developed. This was then validated with four other experienced social
   workers. Integrating categories in the framework were knowing and
   working with limits and values and valuing. The four other categories, a
   family focus, being a team member, managing the environment and managing
   anxiety related to the everyday activities of the social worker. The
   results are discussed in relation to social work in other specialties
   and in relation to other professional roles in specialist palliative
   care. Further research is needed to add the perspective of the social
   worker's client to understanding of the role.}},

Abstract = {{CO2 release and water loss patterns of Incisitermes minor (Hagen)
   pseudergates were investigated using now-through respirometry
   techniques. Four hours of real-time CO2 release and water loss data were
   recorded for pseudergates of I. minor at 20-40 degreesC. Cyclic release,
   but not traditional DGC, was the CO2 release pattern observed in these
   pseudergates. Variability of (V) over dot CO2, expressed as coefficient
   of variability (CV) was used to estimate the level of cycling in each
   recording. CV decreased exponentially with temperature. Mean (V) over
   dot CO2 values ranged from 0.24 +/- 0.07 ml CO2 g(-1) h(-1) at 25
   degreesC to 0.89 +/- 0.16 ml CO2 g(-1) h(-1) at 35 degreesC. (V) over
   dot CO2 increased significantly (P = 0.014) with temperature, but was
   not influenced (P = 0.063) by body mass. Q(10) for (V) over dot CO2 over
   the range of 20-40 degreesC was 1.75 for I. minor pseudergates. Water
   loss cycled coincidently with CO2 release. Water loss rates ranged from
   5.22 +/- 1.97 mg H2O lost g(-1) h(-1) at 20 degreesC to 17.96 +/- 2.55
   mg H2O lost g(-1) h(-1) at 40 degreesC. Q(10) for water loss over the

   respiratory water loss represented from 9.23\% at 20 degreesC to 4.72\%

Abstract = {{A survey on the changes of chemical and biological parameters in the
   continental shelf of the south East China Sea, northwest of Taiwan was
   conducted shortly after the passage of tropical cyclone Herb in the
   summer, 1996. A transect with four sampling stations was visited twice
   to explore temporal and spatial variability. Data collected from the
   same transect in the summer of 1994 and 1997 indicated that the study
   area was a typical oligotrophic system with lack of typhoon disturbance.
   The results showed that after the cyclone event, all the values of the
   measured chemical and biological parameters were much greater than those
   derived from normal summer periods. The depth (40 m) integrated values
   of chlorophyll-a, nitrate and particulate organic nitrogen
   concentrations increased 18, 169 and 73\%, respectively. More
   significantly, primary production, particulate organic carbon
   concentrations and bacterial production as well as biomass increased at
   least two-fold. Wind mixing, re-suspension and terrestrial runoff which
   resulted from cyclone passage probably were the three major processes
   resulting in these phenomena, although their relative importance could
   not be distinguished clearly in this study. The magnitude of the
   enhancement of measured parameters varied with time and space,
   suggesting that the: study area was at a highly unsteady status after
   the passage of the typhoon. This study demonstrated that the shelf
   ecosystem became more productive after the cyclone event, but more
   research is required to explore the fate of these newly formed organic
   substances. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A suite of scalable molecular-dynamics (MD) algorithms has been
   developed for materials simulations. The linear scaling MD algorithms
   encompass a wide spectrum of physical reality: (i) classical MD based on
   a many-body interatomic potential model; (ii) environment-dependent,
   variable-charge MD: (iii) quantum mechanical MD based on the
   tight-binding method; and (iv) self-consistent quantum MD based on the
   density functional theory. Benchmark tests on 1024 Gray T3E processors
   including 1.02-billion-atom many-body and 22 500-atom density functional
   MD simulations demonstrate that these algorithms are highly scalable. A
   design-space diagram spanning seven decades of system size and
   computational time is constructed for materials scientists to design an
   optimal MD simulation incorporating maximal physical realism within a
   given computational budget. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A total of 244 plants from two species, Lythrum salicaria and Epilobium

   rate, net assimilation rate, specific leaf area, biomass partitioning to
   leaves, roots, structural tissues (i.e. stems, petioles and
   inflorescences) and tissue density were obtained from intensive harvests
   three or four times per day. The shade treatment caused an immediate
   decrease in relative growth rate and net assimilation rate. Within hours
   the specific leaf area of the shaded plants increased and leaf tissue
   density decreased, thus partially offsetting the decrease in relative
   growth rate. Biomass partitioning was not affected.}},

Abstract = {{On calcining clay and limestone up to 1000 degreesC some physicochemical
   reactions occur leading to change of the nature of Clay minerals and
   giving pozzolanic and cementitious properties for burnt clay. The
   dehydration of clay gives the metakaolin as an amorphous mixture of
   Al2O3 and SiO2. The limestone is dissociated and calcium silicate as
   well as aluminosilicate such as gehlenite and anorthite are formed. The
   aim of this article is to investigate the hydration characteristics of
   fired clay limestone. Three mixes having the composition 50/50, 60/40
   and 70/30 are calcined from 700 degreesC up to 1000 degreesC for 4 hours
   and suspended hydrated up to 90 days. The kinetics of hydration were
   measured from the free and combined water contents as well as the
   hydration products by XRD analysis. The results revealed that the free
   lime contents are sharply decreased up to 28 days and slightly decreased
   up to 90 days for the samples fired at 800 degreesC. Also, the combined
   water increases with firing temperature as well as limestone content.
   The XRD patterns of the fired 60/40 mix show that the gehlenite hydrate
   as well as CSH increases with firing temperature up to 900 degreesC. The
   CSH increases and the Ca(OH)(2) is completely consumed with curing time
   up to 90 days. Finally we can conclude that, mix II 60:40 clay/limestone
   fired at 800 degreesC for 4 hours gives reasonable hydration
   characteristics, which can be used as building material.}},

Abstract = {{The activation energy of diffusion-controlled dislocation climb of
   face-centred cubic metals and some intermetallic compounds can be traced
   back to G(c)a(0)(3), the product of an appropriate shear modulus G(c)
   and the third power of the lattice constant a(0). This can be done by
   using a relationship connecting the climb energy with the Debye
   temperature, and by adopting a simple but precise law between Debye
   temperature and the elastic constants. A similar procedure can be
   performed for elemental and compound semiconductors, but the dependence
   of the climb energy on the Debye temperature and, consequently, on the
   elastic constants is different from that of the metal systems. In this
   case the climb energy turns out to be proportional to G(c)a(0). Since
   for the semiconductors the activation energies of dislocation climb and
   glide are known to be correlated, such a relationship can be also
   applied to dislocation glide in these covalently bound materials. The
   latter results are discussed in terms of the kink mechanism and of the

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{946-957}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The magma degassing associated with a volcanic process can occur during
   both the magma ascent through a conduit toward the surface, followed by
   eruption, and its long-term existence in a chamber beneath a volcano. In
   the first case, the degassing can reach catastrophic rates leading to
   disastrous consequences., in the second case, volatiles can be released
   for a long time, moving through cracks toward the surface at nearly
   magmatic temperatures. The currently existing models are based on the
   assumption that magma chambers beneath volcanoes should have the form of
   a bottle, i.e., a main chamber extends upward as a rather narrow
   vertical channel, and the pressure decrease accompanying the ascent in
   this channel favors its degassing. The degassed and cooled magma sinks
   into the main chamber. However, the assumption of a long-lived narrow
   molten channel is not valid for all volcanoes. This paper presents a
   somewhat different possible model of gradual degassing in the magma
   chamber, which is associated with compositional convection in the
   chamber itself and does not require the existence of a vertical channel.
   If the chamber is sufficiently close to the surface and an appropriate
   amount of cracks are present in the overlying layer (including the
   solidified conduit through which the previous eruption occurred), the
   pressure at the chamber boundary can be sufficiently small, and
   degassing can occur in the chamber itself. This effect is modeled by a
   fixed pressure (smaller than its lithostatic values) at the top of the
   chamber, taken as a boundary condition. The magma degassing in the
   chamber with convective mixing of the melt and bubbles is calculated.
   Models with different initial depth distributions of concentrations of
   water dissolved in the melt and with different compositions of magma
   layers are considered. The two-phase convective flow velocities are
   found. The method of markers is used for solving the transport equations
   of the fluid phase and melt. The evolution of the melt degassing and
   mixing is calculated for the models considered. The evolution of
   convective flow velocities, as well as vertical and lateral
   distributions of concentrations of the gaseous phase and dissolved water
   in the chamber, is calculated. it is shown that the dormant fumarole
   regime of volcanoes is possible in a chamber of an arbitrary shape
   without assuming the existence of a narrow vertical channel above the
   chamber.}},

   better understanding about the contamination of two gulf regions in
   Black Sea. As objects of the study, a collection of marine sediment
   samples from Varna and Bourgas ``hot spots{''} gulf areas are used. In
   the present case the use of cluster and PCA make it possible to separate
   three zones of the marine environment with different levels of pollution
   by interpretation of the sediment analysis (Bourgas gulf, Varna gulf and
   lake buffer zone). Further, the extraction of four latent factors offers
   a specific interpretation of the possible pollution sources and
   separates natural from anthropogenic factors, the latter originating
   from contamination by chemical, oil refinery and steel-work enterprises.
   Finally, the PLSs modeling gives a better opportunity in predicting
   contaminant concentration on tracer (or tracers) element as compared to
   the one-dimensional approach of the baseline models. The results of the
   study are important not only in local aspect as they allow quick
   response in finding solutions and decision making but also in broader
   sense as a useful environmetrical methodology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Radiation exposures to individuals in space can greatly exceed natural
   radiation exposure on Earth and possibly normal occupational radiation
   exposures as well. Consequently, procedures limiting exposures would be
   necessary. Limitations were proposed by the Radiobiological Advisory
   Panel of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council in
   1970. This panel recommended short-term limits to avoid deterministic
   effects and a single career limit (of 4 Sv) based on a doubling of the
   cancer risk in men aged 35 to 55. Later, when risk estimates for cancer
   had increased and were recognized to be age and sex dependent, the NCRP,
   in Report No. 98 in 1989, recommended a range of career limits based on
   age and sex from 1 to 4 Sv. NCRP is again in the process of revising
   recommendations for astronaut exposure, partly because risk estimates
   have increased further and partly to recognize trends in limiting
   radiation exposure occupationally on the ground. The result of these
   considerations is likely to be similar short-term limits for
   deterministic effects but modified career limits.}},

Abstract = {{Bean golden mosaic (BGM) resistance within any one bean (Phaseolus
   vulgaris L.) race is inadequate. Pyramiding genes from different races
   would increase resistance and reduce pesticide use. Our objectives were
   to: (i) pyramid and compare BGM resistance of genotypes from intraracial
   versus interracial populations, (ii) verify pyramided resistance by
   means of molecular markers, and (iii) combine BGM resistance with
   resistance to other diseases. One intraracial (GV 10625) and four
   interracial (DC 10622, GV 10624 GV 10626, and GV 10627) populations were
   developed at CIAT. Plants within each F-1-derived F-2 (F-1:2) were
   advanced in bulk. The F-3 was grown in the field under common bacterial
   blight {[}CBB, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli (Smith)
   Dye] and angular leaf spot {[}ALS, caused by Phaeoisariopsis griseola
   (Sacc) Ferraris] pressure. Single plant selections were made in the F-3
   and F-4. Plants within F-4:5 were harvested in bulk to screen fur ALS,
   bean common mosaic (BCM), BGM, and CBB. The 39 selected genotypes, 12
   parents, and six checks were again evaluated for the four diseases.
   Seventeen genotypes, parents, and checks also were screened for the RAPD
   marker OR2(530) linked with bgm-1 gene and the SCAR marker SW12(700)
   linked with a QTL controlling BGM resistance. Selected genotypes
   differed in their BGM reaction. None of the genotypes from the
   intraracial population were resistant to BGM. Five genotypes with the
   highest resistance were obtained front GV 10626 and GV 10627. DC 10622
   and GV 10624 produced genotypes with intermediate resistance. Three
   genotypes from DC 10622 and four from GV 10627 possessed OR2(530) marker
   linked with resistance derived from `Garrapato' and SW12(700) marker
   linked with resistance derived from `Porrillo Sintetico'. All genotypes
   possessed the I gene for BCM and were intermediate to ALS. Five also
   were intermediate for CBB. Combined use of interracial populations,
   disease screening, and molecular markers should he emphasized for
   resistance breeding.}},

Abstract = {{High temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer a clean,
   pollution-free technology to electrochemically generate electricity at
   high efficiencies. These fuel cells provide many advantages over
   traditional energy conversion systems including high efficiency,
   reliability, modularity, fuel adaptability, and very low levels of NOx
   and SOx emissions. Furthermore, because of their high temperature of
   operation (similar to 1000 degreesC), natural gas fuel can be reformed
   within the cell stack eliminating the need for an expensive, external
   reformer. Also, pressurized SOFCs can be successfully used as
   replacements for combustors in gas turbines; such hybrid SOFC-gas
   turbine power systems are expected to reach efficiencies over 70\%. This
   paper reviews the materials and fabrication methods used for the
   different cell components, and discusses the performance of cells
   fabricated using these materials; it also discusses the materials and
   processing studies that are under investigation to reduce the cell cost.
   Finally, the paper summarizes the recently built power generation
   systems that employed state-of-the-art SOFCs. A new design SOFC that
   combines the seal-less feature of tubular cells and a flattened air
   electrode with integral ribs is also described; this new design has a
   shortened current path and hence lower cell resistance and higher power
   output than tubular cells. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science BN.}},

Abstract = {{Diclofenac is a commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug in

   aim of this study was to investigate the placental transfer of

   gestation were given two doses of diclofenac before the procedure.
   Corresponding samples of maternal serum? amniotic fluid, coelomic fluid
   and fetal tissue were analysed by high-performance liquid

   with a concentration similar to that found in maternal venous samples.
   However, diclofenac was detectable in only 56.7 and 23.3\% of the
   coelomic and amniotic fluid samples respectively, and the highest
   concentration attained was 80 and 5\% of the maternal concentration
   respectively. In summary, me confirmed that diclofenac crosses the human

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The main aim of the present study was to estimate total alcohol-related
   mortality in Sweden. For natural deaths, a metaanalysis carried out in
   Australia was updated to the end of March 1998, and pooled estimates of
   the relative risks were calculated for different diseases based on data
   from scientific studies that have been published in the international
   literature. The proportion of current alcohol drinkers from recent
   Swedish surveys, and the pooled relative risk estimates were used to
   estimate disease-specific alcohol-attributable fractions. Natural deaths
   `caused' or `prevented' by alcohol were estimated for the period
   1992-1996. For unnatural deaths, all cases from 1992 through 1996 in
   Sweden were analysed (n = 23 132). Alcohol was regarded to attribute to
   the death: if the deceased was a `known alcoholic'; if the underlying or
   contributing cause of death was alcohol-related; if the deceased had an
   alcohol-related inpatient diagnosis during a 3-year period prior to
   death; if the case tested positive for blood alcohol. Person years of
   life lost/gained (<70 years) due to alcohol were also assessed. The
   assumptions underlying the attributable risk methods used to analyse
   alcohol-related mortality due to natural causes need to be borne in mind
   when interpreting the results on natural deaths. Moreover, the
   preventive effect of alcohol on coronary heart disease and stroke is
   still controversial. The findings of alcohol-related mortality due to
   unnatural causes were much more reliable. About 3.5\% of deaths were
   attributed to alcohol; alcohol involvement was more than twice as common
   in deaths of males (4.8\%) than in those of females (2.0\%). About
   one-quarter of the deaths in those aged below 50 years were attributed
   to alcohol. In those (<less than or equal to>69 years, alcohol had a net
   harmful effect in that it `caused' more deaths than it `prevented'; 7\%
   of deaths were in net `caused'. More person years of life were in net
   lost than were saved by alcohol, suggesting that alcohol has a negative
   effect oil premature mortality. We conclude that alcohol accounted for
   about 3.5\% of deaths in all ages, and 25\% of deaths in those aged
   below 50 years, and about 10\% of person years of life lost in Sweden.
   The balance of harm and benefit does not weigh in favour of making a
   recommendation to the public to drink in order to prevent death.}},

   effect on PMN deformability, When cytokines at concentrations with no
   effect on deformability were combined they increased PMN rigidity, The

   elements consistent with the experimental DC data and to identify
   structural parameters that require further refinement, which could prove
   important for the success of DC-based structure calculations. This

Abstract = {{Topical treatment of skin metastases with a cytotoxic agent is
   attractive for its easy self-administration and absence of major

   cell membrane phospholipids and can he administered topically. Twenty
   breast cancer patients with progression of skin metastases were treated
   with a 6\% solution of miltefosine, which was topically administered
   once daily during the first week and twice daily thereafter. Sixteen out
   of 20 patients also had metastatic disease at other sites. Concomitant
   systemic treatment when ongoing for at least 2 months prior to study
   entry was permitted, and consisted of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy
   in seven and nine patients, respectively. Prior palliative cytotoxic and
   hormonal therapy had been administered to 11 and 19 patients,
   respectively. No grade 3 and 4 toxicity occurred. Miltefosine therapy
   was discontinued in two patients due to nausea and in one patient due to
   skin toxicity. Grade 1 and 2 adverse skin reactions, and nausea and
   vomiting were seen in 11 and two patients, respectively. In 18 patients
   evaluable for response, four partial responses were noted (response rate
   22\%), while seven patients had stable disease. Three partial responses
   were observed in patients in whom the skin lesions were smaller than 1.5
   cm(2). Median duration of respons was 2.5 months and median time to
   progression for all patients was 1.9 months. In this study topically
   applied miltefosine for metastatic skin lesions of breast cancer showed

Abstract = {{gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring metabolite of
   GABA that has been postulated to exert ubiquitous neuropharmacological
   effects through GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R)-mediated mechanisms. The
   alternative hypothesis that GHB acts via a GHB-specific, G
   protein-coupled presynaptic receptor that is different from the GABA(B)R
   was tested. The effect of GHB on regional and subcellular brain adenylyl
   cyclase in adult and developing rats was determined and compared with
   that of the GABA(B)R agonist (-)-baclofen. Also, using guanosine
   5'-O-(3-{[}S-35]thiotriphosphate) ({[}S-35]GTP gamma S) binding and
   low-K-m GTPase activity as markers the effects of GHB and (-)-baclofen
   on G protein activity in the brain were determined. Neither GHB nor
   baclofen had an effect on basal cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. GHB
   significantly decreased forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels by 40-50\% in
   cortex and hippocampus but not thalamus or cerebellum, whereas
   (-)-baclofen had an effect throughout the brain. The effect of GHB on
   adenylyl cyclase was observed in presynaptic and not postsynaptic
   subcellular tissue preparations, but the effect of baclofen was observed
   in both subcellular preparations. The GHB-induced alteration in
   forskolin-induced cAMP formation was blocked by a specific GHB
   antagonist but not a specific GABA(B)R antagonist. The
   (-)-baclofen-induuce alteration in forskolin-induced cAMP formation was
   blocked by a specific GABA(B)R antagonist but not a specific GHB
   antagonist. The negative coupling of GHB to adenylyl cyclase appeared at
   postnatal day 21, a developmental time point that is concordant with the
   developmental appearance of {[}H-3]GHB binding in cerebral cortex, but
   the effects of (-)-baclofen were present by postnatal day 14. GHB and
   baclofen both stimulated {[}S-35]GTP gamma S binding and low-K-m GTPase
   activity by 40-50\%. The GHB-induced effect was blocked by GHB
   antagonists but not by GABA(B)R antagonists and was seen only in cortex
   and hippocampus. The (-)-baclofen-induced effect was blocked by GABA(B)R
   antagonists but not by GHB antagonists and was observed throughout the
   brain. These data support the hypothesis that GHB induces a G
   protein-mediated decrease in adenylyl cyclase via a GHB-specific G
   protein-coupled presynaptic receptor that is different from the
   GABA(B)R.}},

   investigate whether a rise in prolactin during laying is involved in the
   regulation of clutch size and incubation onset in a species with
   hatching asynchrony, we measured plasma concentrations of immunoreactive
   prolactin (ir-prolactin) in laying American kestrels, Falco sparverius,
   and quantified clutch size and incubation behavior. In a separate study,
   we administered one of three concentrations of ovine prolactin
   (o-prolactin) via osmotic pumps implanted in females when egg 2 of a
   clutch was laid. ir-Prolactin concentrations during laying were higher
   in small than in large clutches and increased in parallel with the
   development of incubation behavior. o-Prolactin treatment enhanced
   incubation behavior, but did not affect clutch size, possibly because
   the manipulation was performed after clutch size had already been
   determined. Consistent with studies on domesticated species that show
   synchronous hatching, our results indicate that rising prolactin during
   laying enhances the expression of incubation behavior in a species that
   shows hatching asynchrony. Further studies are necessary to determine
   whether the relationship between prolactin and clutch size in the
   American kestrel is one of causation or of mere association. (C) 2000

Title = {{Differences in HDL-cholesterol : apoA-I plus apoA-II ratio and apoE
   phenotype with albuminuric status in Type I diabetic patients}},
Journal = {{DIABETOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1353-1359}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis. To examine whether the HDL-cholesterol:apoA-I + apoA-II
   ratio and the epsilon2 allele are related to albuminuria at baseline and
   whether they are risk factors for progression of albuminuria in a cohort
   study of patients with Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.
   Methods. At baseline, the study cohort comprised 617 patients, aged
   15-60 years, from seven European diabetic centres of the EURODIAB study.
   Albumin excretion rate, measured in a central laboratory, was
   categorised as normoalbuminuria at 20 mug/min or less, microalbuminuria
   between 20 and 200 mug/min or macroalbuminuria at 200 mug/min or over.
   Of the 250 patients who were normoalbuminuric at baseline and had
   follow-up albuminuria measurements, 34 patients were defined as early
   progressors.
   Results. At baseline, the mean HDL-cholesterol:apoA-I + apoA-II ratio
   was lower in macroalbuminuric patients (0.79, 95\% CI:0.74-0.83)
   compared with normoalbuminuric (0.88, 95\% CI:0.87-0.90) patients (p =
   0.0002, adjusted for age and sex). At follow-up, 34 patients who
   progressed from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria
   also had a slightly lower baseline ratio (0.85, 95\% CI:0.80-0.89) than
   those 216 who remained normoalbuminuric (0.89, 95\% CI:0.87-0.92)
   (adjusted p = 0.08). Neither of these relations were independent of
   LDL-cholesterol or fasting triglyceride. There was no association of the
   epsilon2 allele with albuminuria either at baseline (OR = 1.4, 95\%
   CI:0.7-2.8) or with progression of albuminuria (OR = 0.4, 95\%
   CI:0.1-3.5).
   Conclusion/interpretation. There is an inverse relation of
   HDL-cholesterol:apoA-I + apoA-II ratio with albuminuria at baseline.
   This lower ratio in microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric patients could
   contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated
   with nephropathy. There is weak evidence that HDL-composition is a risk
   factor for progression of albuminuria and no association of the epsilon2
   allele with diabetic nephropathy.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This article addresses the potential impact of the revised
   standards for race and ethnicity on data from the 2000 census and public
   health data sources, policies, and programs.
   Method's. The authors examine the relationship between race/ethnicity
   and health in selected measures, identify the factors that influence
   race/ethnicity identification, consider past experience in
   race/ethnicity reporting, and explore the challenges in understanding
   and managing the effects of new racial/ethnic categories in various data
   sets.
   Results. The multiple-race group seems to compose only a small
   percentage of the US population and may have little impact on data for
   single-race,groups. Actual effects will vary according to a number of
   factors, including the size, composition, and geographic distribution of
   the group.
   Conclusions. More research is needed to support a thorough understanding
   of the reporting of multirace data and the development of techniques for
   analyzing these data. Given the importance of understanding the
   relationship between race/ethnicity and health, the ability to produce
   useful, comparable, and meaningful data is essential.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in amphibian populations, and amphibians with gross
   malformations, have prompted concern regarding the biological status of
   many anuran species. A survey of bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, and green
   frogs, Rana clamitans, conducted in central and southern New Hampshire
   showed malformed frogs at 81\% of the sites sampled (13 of 16 sites).
   Brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and the synthesis of
   androgens and estradiol, hormones essential to reproductive processes,
   were measured from limb-malformed and normal (no limb malformation)
   frogs. Normal frogs had significantly higher concentrations (nearly
   3-fold) of in vitro produced androgens and of brain GnRH than malformed
   frogs. Because most malformations are thought to occur during
   development, we propose that environmental factors or
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals that may cause developmental
   abnormalities also act during early development to ultimately cause
   abnormally reduced GnRH and androgen production in adult frogs. The
   consequences of reduced GnRH and androgens on anuran reproductive
   behavior and population dynamics are unknown but certainly may be
   profound and warrant further research. gonadotropin-releasing hormone.}},

Abstract = {{We retrospectively assessed seventy-four consecutive patients with AML
   over 65 years of ape (median 71: range 65-88) treated with an
   individualized approach in two specialized cancer centers. Patients were
   managed according to their performance status (PS) and associated
   diseases in both institutions. The proportion of patients with poor PS
   (3-4) was higher in center 1 (37\%) than in center 2 (10\%) and in
   center 1 palliative treatment was given more frequently (16/32 patients)
   than in center 2 (7/42 patients). Fifty-one patients received intensive
   combination chemotherapy including an anthracycline and ara-C or VP16 (2
   patients) and 36 patients received a second intensive course as
   reinduction or as consolidation treatment after complete remission.
   Patients not eligible for myelosuppressive chemotherapy were treated
   with palliative measures (23 patients). With intensive chemotherapy,
   complete remission (CR) was achieved in 29 of 51 patients (57\%), after
   first (20 patients) or second course (9 patients) and the rate of deaths
   during induction was 14\% (7 patients). The CR rate was lower for
   patients with performance status greater than or equal to 2 (48\%) as
   compared to patients with performance status less than or equal to 1
   (78\%) and for patients with secondary AML (46\%) as compared to
   patients with dr novo AML (60\%).
   Median survival was 9. 1 months for patients receiving intensive
   treatment and 1.2 months for patients receiving palliative treatment
   (P=0.001). In the Cox model fur overall survival, treatment with
   curative intent was associated with longer survival (hazard ratio: 0.33,
   95\% confidence interval: 0.18-0.58) and poor performance status (PS
   greater than or equal to 2) was associated with reduced survival (hazard
   ratio: 3.29, 95\% confidence interval: 1.75-6.17). Overall 2-years and
   5-years survival were 20\% and 11\% for the patients treated
   intensively. From this study it appears that an individualized approach
   of treatment with intensive chemotherapy for selected patients offers a
   substantial CR rate and an improvement in survival. This analysis also
   suggests that differences in outcome between single institutions can be
   explained mainly by referral and selection biases.}},

Abstract = {{Background and and Objectives. Leukemia relapse occurring in donor cells
   after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been
   reported in rare cases. Cytogenetic analysis and molecular probing of
   variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) have been used to confirm this
   unusual event in the few cases so far reported in the literature. The
   aim of this study was to demonstrate that extensive molecular
   characterization of leukemic cells at diagnosis and relapse may be
   necessary to many technical pitfalls possibly leading to an erroneous
   diagnosis of leukemia relapse in donor cells after allogeneic
   transplantation.
   Design and Methods. We report the case of a 49-year-old man who received
   an allogeneic transplantation from his HLA-identical sister because of
   BCR-ABL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), After having achieved
   complete hematologic and molecular remission, two years later an overt
   leukemia relapse occurred with cytogenetic findings suggesting a
   leukemia relapse in donor cells. The donor or patient origin of leukemic
   cells at relapse was further investigated by fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH) karyotyping, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) analysis of BCR-ABL chimeric transcripts, PCR
   amplification of several VNTRs and the Y chromosome-specific DYS14
   sequence and finally by amplification, cloning and sequencing of the
   CDRIII region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene.
   Results. At the time of relapse, conventional and FISH karyotyping
   revealed the presence of a Phl+ chromosome and a female karyotype in all
   the 25 metaphases analyzed and FOR amplification of the Y
   chromosome-specific DYS14 sequence was negative. Moreover, the molecular
   evaluation of hematopietic chimerism performed by the NZ-22 VNTR allowed
   us to demonstrate that at the time of relapse a consistent proportion of
   hematopoietic cells was of donor origin. However, the molecular cloning
   and sequencing of the CDRIII region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain
   (IgH) gene rearrangement in leukemic blasts at diagnosis and relapse
   demonstrated their identity thus formally proving the patient origin of
   both leukemic clones.
   Interpretation and Conclusions. While the simplest interpretation of the
   apparent female karyotype at relapse is the consequence of a loss of the
   Y chromosome which in leukemic blasts took place along with duplication
   of an X-chromosome, this case strongly emphasizes the need for accurate
   and extensive molecular characterization to prove the donor origin of a
   leukemia relapse after allogeneic transplantation. (C) 2000 Ferrata

Abstract = {{The early and reliable diagnosis of allograft rejection is a difficult
   task and the assessment of cytokine expression in the grafts can he a
   helpful parameter. We have compared competitive reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with intracellular
   cytokine staining by flow cytometry as tools to measure cytokine
   expression in rejecting and nonrejecting murine cardiac allografts. Both
   techniques gave comparable results for cytokine expression in rejecting
   allografts and syngeneic controls. Grafts from mice pretreated with
   anti-CD4 antibody and donor-specific blood transfusion showed a marked
   reduction in cytokine expression, as assessed by competitive RT-PCR,
   even though a cellular infiltrate was present in the graft. In contrast,
   the cytokine production measured by intracellular cytokine staining of
   the isolated graft-infiltrating cells was high and exceeded even that of
   the rejecting allografts. We conclude that intracellular cytokine
   staining of graft-infiltrating leukocytes by flow cytometry does not
   necessarily reflect accurately the cytokine milieu in the graft. This
   technique might therefore have a limited clinical application in
   contrast to competitive RT-PCR for the differentiation between graft
   acceptance and graft rejection.}},

Abstract = {{In sequenced genomes, protein coding regions with unassigned function
   constitute between 10 and 50\% of all open reading frames. Often key
   enzymes cannot be identified using sequence homology searches. For
   example, despite the fact that methanogens have an apparently functional
   gluconeogenesis pathway, standard tools have been unable to identify a
   fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) gene in the sequenced Methanoccocus
   jannaschii genome. Using a combination of functional and structural
   tools, we have shown that the protein product of the M. jannaschii gene
   MJ0109, which had been tentatively annotated as an inositol
   monophosphatase (IMPase), has both IMPase and FBPase activities.
   Moreover, several gene products annotated as IMPases from different
   thermophilic organisms also possess FBPase activity Thus, we have found
   the FBPase that was `missing' in thermophiles and shown that it also
   functions as an IMPase.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Prior reports have pointed to an adverse effect of sexual
   assault on subsequent health, particularly depression and obesity, in
   women. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is an
   association between self-reported sexual assault history and objective
   parameters of physical health in a sample of older men and women.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of white, middle to upper
   middle class, older (median age 75 years) men (N = 533) and women (N =
   826) within a defined community setting. Sex-specific, age-adjusted
   risks were calculated for 11 common chronic medical conditions (10 for
   each sex: coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis,
   obesity, asthma, migraine, thyroid disease, and arthritis in all
   subjects; breast cancer in women; and prostate cancer in men) and
   confirmed by physical or laboratory examination or review of medical
   records. Results: Sexual assault was reported by 5.4\% of men and 12.7\%
   of women; repeated exposure was reported by 10.3 and 21.9\% of sexually
   assaulted men and women, respectively. In women, a history of sexual
   assault was associated with an increased risk of 2 of 10 conditions:
   arthritis (OR = 1.76, 95\% CI = 1.13-2.76) and breast cancer (OR = 2.21,
   95\% CI = 1.12-4.33). A ``dose-response{''} effect was observed:
   Multiple episodes of sexual assault carried a two- to three-fold
   increased risk of these diseases compared with a single episode, in men,
   the only statistically significant association was between sexual
   assault and thyroid disease (OR = 4.68, 95\% CI = 1.08-20.3).
   Conclusions: These data partially replicate findings from other studies
   of adverse effects of sexual trauma on health, although the specific
   diseases are different. Causal mechanisms cannot be inferred from these
   data. Studies in other cohorts are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric
   disorder (PMDD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders, 4th edition, recognizes the fact that some women have
   extremely distressing emotional and behavioural symptoms premenstrually.
   PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which
   presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood
   changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual
   magnification of physical or psychological symptoms of a concurrent
   psychiatric or medical disorder. As many as 75\% of women with regular
   menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to
   epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3\% to
   8\% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but
   the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than
   hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical
   events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The
   serotonergic system is in a close reciprocal relation with the gonadal
   hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for
   interventions. Thus, beyond conservative treatment options such as
   lifestyle and stress management, other non-antidepressant treatments, or
   the more extreme intervneitons that eliminate ovulation altogether,
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are emerging as the most
   effective treatment option. Results from several randomized,
   placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated
   that SSRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More
   recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent
   (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SSRIs is equally effective
   in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a
   disorder that is itself intermittent.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying coronal mass ejection (CME) precursors in the solar corona
   would be an important step in space weather forecasting, as well as a
   vital key to understanding the physics of CMEs. Twisted magnetic field
   structures are suspected of being the source of at least some CMEs.
   These features can appear sigmoid (S or inverse-S) shaped in soft X-ray
   (SXR) images. We review recent observations of these structures and
   their relation to CMEs, using S,YR data from the Soft X-ray Telescope
   (SXT) on the Yohkoh satellite, and EUV data from the EUV Imaging
   Telescope (EIT) on the SOHO satellite. These observations indicate that
   the pre-eruption sigmoid patterns are more prominent in SXRs than in EW,
   and that sigmoid precursors are present in over 50\% of CMEs. These
   findings are important for CME research, and may potentially be a major
   component to space weather forecasting. So far, however, the studies
   have been subject to restrictions that will have to be relaxed before
   sigmoid morphology can be used as a reliable predictive tool. Moreover,
   some CMEs do not display a SXR sigmoid structure prior to eruption, and
   some others show no prominent SXR signature of any kind before or during
   eruption. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes three novel microwave techniques that show promise
   for being useful in treating diseases of the prostate. They are:
   microwave urethroplasty for providing immediate symptomatic relief of
   urinary obstructions caused by benign prostatic hyperthrophy-this
   technique uses microwave balloon catheters for producing biological
   stems in the urethra. Initial results obtained in an Federal Drug
   Administration approved Phase I clinical trial are highly encouraging,
   hyperthermia produced in the prostate by dual microwave balloon
   catheters-when combined with external beam radiation or implanted
   radioactive seeds, this technique has the potential of improving local
   recurrence rates of prostate cancer over the rates that are obtained
   when only radiation treatments are given, and microwave poration
   therapy-a therapy that, when combined with either systemic or locally
   administered chemotherapy, has been shown to be effective in shrinking
   implanted prostatic tumors in rats. The potential clinical advantages of
   microwave poration/chemotherapy over electrochemotherapy using dc pulses
   for treating cancers are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background. A significant proportion of older adults in The Netherlands
   does not regularly participate in leisure-time physical activity. The
   Groningen Active Living Model (GALM) was developed to change this
   situation for the better. In this article the first results with respect
   to the validation of the model are presented.
   Methods. We obtained cross-sectional data from a sample of 392 potential
   participants. Scores on the potentially causal variables (self-efficacy,
   social, support, perceived fitness, and enjoyment) and the stages of
   change give a first indication of the potential validity of the GALM
   behavioral change model.
   Results. Seventeen percent of the subjects could be categorized as in
   the precontemplation stage, 42\% in the contemplation/preparation stage,
   and 39\% in the action/maintenance stage. Data with respect to stages of
   change were missing for 2\% of the subjects. Scores on all potentially
   causal variables rose significantly from the precontemplation to the
   action/maintenance stage. Discriminant analysis resulted in a canonical
   correlation of 0.58 between the precontemplation and the
   contemplation/preparation stages and 0.59 between the
   contemplation/preparation and action/maintenance stages; respectively,
   82.6 and 78.3\% of the subjects had been classified correctly.
   Conclusions. The results found in this study support our hypothesis, as
   described in the conceptual theory of the GALM behavioral change model.
   For a more comprehensive validation of the model's action theory and
   conceptual theory, follow-up measurements are required. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The plasmin-mediated lysis of fibrin present in a wound, or in chronic
   inflammatory disease, results in the release of fibrin degradation
   products. One of the two major products is fibrin fragment E, which has
   been shown to stimulate cell proliferation in many cell types including
   endothelium, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells, and to be angiogenic
   in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) system. The activity of
   fibrin fragment E is dependent on N-terminus thrombin action. Antibodies
   against fibrin E, which block the cell proliferative activity, were used
   to locate the active site. Phage epitope display libraries were used to
   identify the sequence of a peptide, which resembles a region of the N
   terminus structure. The equivalent synthetic peptide (WTM110) has
   optimal stimulatory properties at equimolar concentrations to the parent
   molecule. Such peptide information has therapeutic potential for both
   stimulating and suppressing angiogenesis and cell proliferation. (C)

Abstract = {{The flow around laminar airfoils is computed using a Navier-Stokes
   method coupled to a transition prediction method based on the e(N)
   approach. Applying point transition at the predicted transition location
   produces a strong viscous/inviscid interaction region that prevents the
   coupled system from converging, whereas the introduction of transitional
   flow regions resolves that problem. The emphasis is not placed on the
   development of new transitional flow models but primarily on producing
   convergence, applying modified, available models. A comprehensive
   computational study is performed in a strong adverse and zero pressure
   gradient airfoil flow region, as the transitional lengths differ
   considerably for the different models. A conventional model, which is
   applicable in flow regions where transition is predicted well upstream
   of laminar separation, is proposed, together with a special transitional
   length model for flows where the boundary layer stays laminar up to
   separation. The flows over the DoAL3 and the NLF(1)-0416 laminar
   airfoils are investigated. The coupled Navier-Stokes and eN methods are
   shown to produce converged results. Furthermore, the values far lift and
   drag are in excellent agreement with the free transition measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear interactions between obesity and genetic risk factors are
   thought to determine susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, We used genetic
   obesity as a tool to uncover latent differences in diabetes
   susceptibility between two mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and BTBR.
   Although both BTBR and B6 lean mice are euglycemic and glucose tolerant,
   lean BTBR x B6 F1 male mice are profoundly insulin resistant, We
   hypothesized that the genetic determinants of the insulin resistance
   syndrome might also predispose genetically obese mice to severe
   diabetes. Introgressing the ob allele into BTBR revealed large
   differences in diabetes susceptibility between the strain backgrounds.
   In a population of F2-ob/ob mice segregating for BTBR and B6 alleles, we
   observed large variation in pancreatic compensation for the underlying
   insulin resistance, me also detected two loci that substantially modify
   diabetes severity, and a third locus that strongly links to fasting
   plasma insulin levels, Amplification of the genetic signal from these
   latent diabetes susceptibility alleles in F2-ob/ob mice permitted
   discovery of an interaction between the two loci that substantially
   increased the risk of severe type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Increased Na+-H+ exchange activity has been demonstrated in various
   pathological states using the rate constant of platelet swelling (k(s)).
   This indirect measure of exchange activity could, however, be influenced
   by conditions that alter platelet distensibility independent of Na+-H+
   exchange activity. To determine the validity of k(s), the change in
   light transmission and hence k(s), was measured at 24 degrees and 37
   degreesC (temperatures associated with alterations in membrane
   fluidity), and compared with the rate constant (k(Na)) for the increase
   in cytoplasmic sodium ion concentration ({[}Na+](i)) and the rate
   constant of Na+-influx (k(phi Na)) under the same conditions. Both k(s)
   and k(Na) were dependent on Na+-H+ exchange; the rate constants differed
   in the order k(s) < k(<phi>Na) < k(Na) (P<0.01). Neither k(Na) or k(phi
   Na) changed with temperature, whereas k(s) was significantly lower at 24
   degrees than at 37 degreesC (7.49 +/- 0.31x10(-3) s(-1) versus 9.96 +/-
   0.42x10(-3) s(-1), P<0.0001). While both k(s) and k(Na) are dependent on
   Na+-H+ exchange, k(s) may underestimate the activity of the exchanger
   and may in part, be influenced by membrane fluidity. This could be
   important in interpreting data where k(s) has been measured in different
   groups of subjects.}},

Abstract = {{It is useful to state propagation laws for a self-focusing laser beam or
   a soliton in group-theoretical form to be called Lie-optical form for
   being able to predict self-focusing dynamics conveniently and amongst
   other things, the geometrical phase. It is shown that the propagation of
   the gaussian laser beam is governed by a rotation group in a
   non-absorbing medium and by the Lorentz group in an absorbing medium if
   the additional symmetry of paraxial propagation is imposed on the laser
   beam. This latter symmetry, however, needs care in its implementation
   because the electromagnetic wave of the laser sees a different
   refractive index profile than the laboratory observer in this
   approximation. It is explained how to estimate this non-Taylor paraxial
   power series approximation. The group theoretical laws so-stated are
   used to predict the geometrical or Berry phase of the laser beam by a
   technique developed by one of us elsewhere. The group-theoretical
   Lie-optic (or ABCD) laws are also useful in predicting the laser
   behavior in a more complex optical arrangement like in a laser cavity
   etc. The nonlinear dynamical consequences of these laws for long
   distance (or time) predictions are also dealt with. Ergodic dynamics of
   an ensemble of laser beams on the torus during absorptionless
   self-focusing is discussed in this context. From the point of view of
   new-physics concepts, we introduce a stroboscopic invariant torus and a
   stroboscopic generating function in classical mechanics that is useful
   for long-distance predictions of absorptionless self-focusing.}},

Journal = {{GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{230-237}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. The aim of this study was to elucidate the expression and
   the correlation of two cell cycle regulators, cdk4 and its inhibitor
   p16, in a series of benign, borderline, and malignant ovarian tumors and
   to evaluate whether their alterations correlate with clinicopathologial
   parameters and patients' prognosis in epithelial ovarian carcinomas.
   Methods. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-cdk4 and anti-p16
   antibodies was carried out for 103 paraffin sections of ovarian tumors,
   and Western blot analysis and cdk4 activity assay were performed in 26
   fresh ovarian tumor samples.
   Results. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that 60.61 and
   69.70\% of benign, 69.57 and 56.52\% of borderline, and 74.47 and
   40.43\% of malignant tumors expressed cdk4 and p16, respectively,
   demonstrating increased cdk4 and decreased p16 expression in ovarian
   carcinomas. A significant inverse relationship between cdk4 and p16
   expression was found. The loss of p16 expression was more correlated
   with G(2) and G(3) tumors in contrast with G(1) tumors. No significant
   correlation was observed between cdk4 expression and clinicopathological
   parameters. Neither cdk4 nor p16 expression has significant effects on
   overall survival by the Kaplan-Meier method. When the combined
   phenotypes of the two proteins were analyzed, patients with
   cdk4-positive/p16-negative expression had a reduced overall survival
   than other phenotypes of cdk4/p16.
   Conclusions. These data suggest that inverse expression of cdk4 and p16
   may be involved in the development and progression of epithelial ovarian
   carcinomas. The combined phenotypes of cdk4 and p16 proteins could
   provide a useful prognostic indicator for patients with epithelial
   ovarian carcinoma. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic lead exposure may impair

   carried out to investigate the effects of lead exposure on non-NMDA
   (alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid, AMPA/
   kainate) receptors of rat hippocampus. Ca2+-permeable AMPA/kainate
   receptors in organotypic slice cultures were evaluated by using cobalt
   uptake, a histochemical method that identifies cells expressing
   Ca2+-permeable non-NMDA receptors. Ten mM L-glutamate-induced cobalt
   accumulation was enriched in area CA1, area CA3 and in dentate gyrus,
   which was totally blocked by 100 muM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid
   (AP5) and 100 muM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX). Three
   hundred muM NMDA-induced cobalt accumulation was in area CA1, area
   dentate gyrus and was blocked by AP5 or CNQX. One hundred muM AMPA had
   effects in area CA1, area CA3 and in dentate gyrus, which were blocked
   by CNQX, not by AP5. Furthermore, cobalt accumulations induced by NMDA
   and AMPA in the lead-exposed rats decreased significantly than those in
   the controls. The results indicate that AMPA receptors enriched in area
   CA1, area CA3, area dentate gyrus and kainate receptors enriched in area

Abstract = {{Purpose: We evaluated the efficiency of early endoscopic realignment as
   primary therapy for bulbar urethral disruption after straddle injury.
   Materials and Methods: From 1990 to 1999 we treated 16 men who had
   bulbar urethral disruption with endoscopic realignment. Followup
   included uroflowmetry and urethroscopy at 39 to 85 months.
   Results: All 16 cases were successfully treated at a single session
   without intraoperative or postoperative complications. Only 2 patients
   required intermittent self-dilation once weekly and all were potent
   during followup.
   Conclusions: The results of this minimally invasive procedure are
   comparable to those of open surgery. It may be performed on an
   outpatient basis using only local anesthesia. Our results imply that
   this cost-effective therapy should be done as the initial step in most
   patients with bulbar urethral disruption.}},

Abstract = {{Echolocation signals were recorded from big brown bats, Eptesicus
   fuscus, flying in the field and the laboratory. In open field areas the
   interpulse intervals (IPI) of search signals were either around 134 ms
   or twice that value, 270 ms. At long IPI's the signals were of long
   duration (14 to 18-20 ms), narrow bandwidth, and low frequency, sweeping
   down to a minimum frequency (F-min,) of 22-25 kHz. At short IPI's the
   signals were shorter (6-13 ms), of higher frequency, and broader
   bandwidth. Tn wooded areas only short (6-11 ms) relatively broadband
   search signals were emitted at a higher rate (avg. IPI = 122 ms) with
   higher F-min (27-30 kHz). In the laboratory the IPI was even shorter (88
   ms), the duration was 3-5 ms, and the F-min 30-35 kHz, resembling
   approach phase signals of field recordings. Excluding terminal phase
   signals, all signals from all areas showed a negative correlation
   between signal duration and F-min,, i.e., the shorter the signal, the
   higher was F-min. This correlation was reversed in the terminal phase of
   insect capture sequences, where F-min, decreased with decreasing signal
   duration. Overall, the signals recorded in the field were longer, with
   longer IPI's and greater variability in bandwidth than signals recorded
   in the laboratory. (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{Pentoxifylline (PTX) has been demonstrated to improve graft survival in
   renal transplant recipients undergoing post graft complications. As
   activated monocytes are possible initiators of vascular damage through
   tissue factor (TF) expression, we evaluated the monocyte TF expression
   and endothelium activation markers in 140 consecutive patients receiving
   cadaveric kidney grafts, randomized in a double-blind study comparing
   PTX versus placebo. Monocyte TF expression and plasma von Willebrand
   factor, tissue plasminogen activator, thrombomodulin and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were determined before transplantation
   and each month after. Additional samplings were realized in case of
   acute rejection. TF and TNF-alpha expression were significantly modified
   after graft. In patients with complications, PTX prevented the:increase
   of TF expression at month one, and after rejection episodes. Endothelium
   activation markers were significantly modified after graft and in
   patients with complications but PTX had no significant effect on their
   plasma levels. These results suggest that the protective effect of PTX
   on graft survival could be related to the prevention of monocyte TF
   upregulation associated with complications.}},

Abstract = {{SM/J and A/J inbred strain of mice have different characteristics in

   recombinant inbred strains derived from SM/J and A/J mice was performed.
   Concerning tau, two regions on chromosomes (Chrs) 7 and 18 surpassed the
   genome-wide suggestive level. As for psi, one suggestive QTL was
   detected on Chr 7. The QTLs which affect daily activity counts under
   light-dark cycles and constant darkness were mapped to the same
   chromosomal regions on Chrs 1 and 17, respectively. The provisional QTLs

Abstract = {{The cDNAs encoding two dimeric hemoglobins, Hbs I and II, of the
   deep-sea clam Calyptogena soyoae were amplified by PCR and the complete
   nucleotide sequences determined. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequences
   agreed completely with those determined chemically. Many of the
   molluscan intracellular globin genes have a characteristic
   four-exon/three-intron structure, with the preceding and two
   conventional introns conserved widely in animal globin genes. In this
   work we have determined the exon/intron organization of two hemoglobin
   genes of the deep-sea clam C, soyoae. Surprisingly, this gene has no
   preceding intron but instead contains an additional intron in the
   A-helix (A3.1), together with the two conventional introns (B12.2 and
   G6.3). This observation suggests that the preceding intron has been lost
   and the insertion of intron in A-helix occurred in the genes of
   Calyptogena. Alternatively, the sliding of intron from preceding to
   A-helix might have occurred. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Measurement of refractive index and trace element analysis by ICP-MS
   were applied to the forensic discrimination of bottle glass samples from
   different origins. Refractive index was calculated from the matching
   temperature at which glass fragments became invisible in the silicone
   oil. Sample solution for ICP-MS was prepared by dissolving approximately
   10 mg of glass fragments into a mixture of 0.5 mi of KF and 0.5 mi of
   HClO4 and heating for 2 h using a microwave oven, followed by dilution
   to 25 mi after 2 mi of HNO3 was added. Thirteen elements (Co, Cu, Zn,
   Rb, Sr, Zr, Ag, Sn, Sb, Ba, La, Ce and Pb) were found to be useful for
   the discrimination of bottle glasses. These elements in NIST SRM 612
   (Trace Elements in Glass) could be determined with an RSD less than
   3.2\%, except for Sn and Pb. The proposed method was applied to 16
   bottle glass samples. Of 120 pairs among 16 bottle samples, 13 pairs
   were indistinguishable by RI only. Combination of trace element analysis
   by ICP-MS and refractive index measurement made it possible to

   because plant damage, rather than outright death, coupled with difficult
   conditions for material acquisition and small available material pools,
   eventually makes accretion of biomass untenable. The location where this
   balance is achieved varies with climate, but catastrophic events and
   human activities make correlation with climate tenuous and future

   species in many geographic locations at and below the treeline are

Abstract = {{Stalk-eyed flies have eyes placed laterally away from the head on
   elongated peduncles. The elongation of eye span may increase the
   energetic cost of flight, reduce flight performance via aerodynamic
   effects or via increased load, or necessitate compensatory changes in
   other body dimensions. Body mass and body dimensions were measured to
   test the hypothesis that elongation of eye span is correlated with
   increased head mass in two closely related species of stalk-eyed flies.
   Cyrtodiopsis whitei is sexually dimorphic, with the eye span of larger
   males exceeding body length. Cyrtodiopsis quinqueguttata is sexually
   monomorphic with eye span substantially less than body length. Although
   eye span was significantly longer in C. whitei, head mass did not differ
   between species after accounting for differences in body mass. C. whitei
   males had longer wings, heavier thoraxes, and lighter abdomens in
   relation to body mass than did female C. whitei or C. quinqueguttata of
   either sex. Three-dimensional tracking of flight paths showed that path
   velocity and the horizontal component of velocity did not differ
   according to species or sex, but the long-eyed C. whitei males showed
   reduced overall aerial performance by flying at shallower ascent angles
   and reduced vertical velocity. Although increased mass loading does not
   occur in C. whitei males, increased drag, aerodynamic effects from the
   wake of the eye stalks, and constrained visual processing are possible
   mechanisms which could cause their reduced performance.}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The platelet storage lesion is characterized metabolically
   by a pH decrease associated with lactic acid generation; a change in
   platelet morphology from discoid to spherical, a diminished response to
   in vitro challenge tests, such as the hypotonic shock response (HSR) and
   extent of shape change (ESC); increased surface P-selectin expression;
   and decreased in vivo recovery and survival. Altering storage conditions
   to improve these measures could allow for extension of the duration of
   in vitro storage.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: ABO-identical paired platelet concentrates
   were pooled and then equally divided into two plastic bags. Either
   L-carnitine (LC) or an equal volume of saline (control) was added to one
   container of each pair. Platelets were stored at 20 to 24 degreesC for 5
   to 10 days or at 1 to 6 degreesC for 5 days at various concentrations of
   LC between 0.1 and 15 mM. At the end of storage, pH, glucose
   consumption, lactate generation, HSR, ESC, and surface P-selectin
   expression were measured. In different experiments, paired platelet
   concentrates were spiked with a Staphylococcus epidermidis suspension in
   the presence and absence of L-carnitine dt a concentration of 5 mM.
   RESULTS: At 20 to 24 degreesC and concentrations of LC between 0.1 and 5
   mM there was evidence of better pH preservation, less glucose
   consumption, and less lactate generation. Only with storage beyond 5
   days was a difference: present in either surface P-selectin expression
   or HSR. An L-carnitine concentration of 5 mM appeared optimal.
   L-carnitine did not enhance the growth of bacteria after 7 to 8 days of
   storage.
   CONCLUSION: LC at 5 mM may improve the quality of platelet concentrates
   that are stored beyond 5 days. There was no indication that LC at this
   concentration would promote bacterial growth. It may be a useful
   additive to platelet preservation.}},

   has taught us is discussed. This includes discussion of classifying and
   distinguishing conformance problems and treatments, attributes of good
   candidate wells and well patterns for gel conformance-control
   treatments, requirements that must be met in candidate wells and well
   patterns in order to achieve success, gel treatment elements that must

Abstract = {{lThe Sherman-type Zn-Pb-Ag dolomite deposits in central Colorado are
   hosted in dolostones of the Early Mississippian Leadville Formation.
   Paleomagnetic analysis, using progressive alternating field and thermal
   demagnetization and isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition
   methods, was performed on specimens from samples at 37 sites in the
   Sherman-type Continental Chief, Peerless, Ruby, Sacramento, and Sherman
   deposits, in their host rocks, in the 72 Ma Pando Porphyry sill(s) and
   in the similar to 40 Ma Leadville-type Black Cloud massive sulfide
   deposit. Paleomagnetic fold, contact, and breccia tests were performed
   to test for the antiquity of the magnetizations. The results are
   interpreted to indicate that the Leadville carbonates were regionally
   dolomitized at similar to 308 +/- 6 (1 sigma) Ma in the Early
   Pennsylvanian and that the Sherman-type deposits were emplaced at
   similar to 272 +/- 18 (1 sigma) Ma during the Early Permian after
   northeast-trending block faulting, karstification, and similar to4 +/- 1
   km of sedimentary burial, possibly as the result of subsurface
   gravity-driven fluid flow related to the Ouachita-Marathon orogen.
   Following late Ouachita-Marathon or earliest Laramide (Late Cretaceous)
   folding, the remanence in the Sherman-type deposits and the Leadville
   dolostone rocks within the contact alteration zone of the 72 Ma Pando
   Porphyry sill(s) was reset to acquire a Late Cretaceous normal
   characteristic remanent magnetization. Thereafter the Black Cloud
   Leadville-type massive sulfide deposit was magnetized in the Eocene to
   acquire a reversed polarity characteristic remanent magnetization that
   nas not found in the Sherman-type deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Tumor necrosis factor is associated with various local and
   systemic inflammatory sequelae following snakebite. Xanthine oxidase is
   a principal mediator of remote tissue injury (e.g., lungs, heart,
   liver).
   Objective: To investigate in a snakebite-like animal model the as yet
   unexplored role of TNF and XO in mediating organ damage following
   snakebite.
   Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intra-muscularly with a
   non-lethal 500 mug/kg dose of Vipera aspis venom (n=10) or saline
   (n=10). Blood pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored,
   TNF-alpha was measured in the blood, and total XO + xanthine
   dehydrogenase activity was assessed in various tissues. Lung histology
   and permeability indices were analyzed.
   Results: Venom injection caused a significant (P<0.05) reduction in both
   heart rate and invasive arterial pressure. The blood circulating TNF
   levels were significantly higher in the intoxicated group (P<0.05 vs.
   saline group), with changes seen at 30 minutes from intoxication in both
   groups. Total XO + XDH activity in the kidney, lung and liver of the
   venom-injected group was significantly (P<0.05) higher than in the
   saline group, while the activity in the heart was similar.
   Conclusions: The mediation of remote organ and hemodynamic changes
   following intramuscular injection of a non-lethal dose of Vipera aspis
   venom can be attributed partly to TNF and partly to XO. More research is
   needed to better understand the role of either compound and the time
   frame of their activity before specific antagonists can be introduced
   for snakebite management.}},

   1s(4) resonance state and the 1s(5) metastable state were measured in a
   unit discharge cell of an ac-type plasma display panel by a laser
   absorption technique combined with an optical microscope. The measured
   density of Xe(1s(5)) has two large peaks on both the temporal anode and
   cathode sides. The peak at the anode has a narrower spatial distribution
   while the peak at the cathode is distributed over the electrode area. In
   its temporal behavior, the anode peak rises slightly faster than the
   peak at the cathode and decays faster at the beginning of afterglow, but
   both peaks tend to have the same decay rate in the later period. The
   behavior of Xe(1s(4)) shows similar features, but the decay rate is much
   larger, corresponding to the effective lifetime of imprisoned resonance
   radiation. The maximum densities of Xe(1s(5)) and Xe(1s(4)) are 5x10(13)
   and 2x10(13) cm(-3), respectively. Emission from Xe(2p) atoms was also
   observed, and this nearly followed the current wave form. With these

Abstract = {{The origin and mechanism of the differentiation and proliferation of
   Merkel cells are enigmatic. A preliminary study in our laboratory showed
   that Merkel cells in the rat palatine mucosa emerge after birth. This is
   in contrast to the case of similar cells in the skin that differentiate
   during the embryonic period prior to the establishment of peripheral
   nerve innervation. We studied immunohistochemically the developmental
   timings of Merkel cells and peripheral nerves in the rat palatine mucosa
   using antibodies to cytokeratins 18 and 20, PGP 9.5, and CORP using
   developing palates of prenatal and postnatal rats. We also studied the
   potency of mitosis in Merkel cells by immunohistochemistry using
   antibodies for a cell proliferation marker Ki67 and cyclin D-kinase
   inhibitors p16, p21 and p27. It was shown that Merkel cells in the rat
   palatine mucosa differentiate postnatally, after the development of
   peripheral nerve fiber terminals was almost established. The emergence
   and increase in number of Merkel cells progressed in an
   anterior-ro-posterior wave. Newly appearing Merkel cells were usually
   negative for anti-cytokeratin 20 antibody but gained affinity for the
   antibody with progress of maturation. All Merkel cells in the palatine
   mucosa were negative for anti-Ki67 antibody but positive for anti-p27
   antibody. These results indicate that Merkel cells in the rat palatine
   mucosa are not responsible for the development of peripheral nerve fiber
   terminals and that these cells differentiate in situ from
   intraepithelial stem cells.}},

   expression in 66 patients with colorectal carcinoma was
   immunohistochemically assessed using the anti-TS antibody. TS
   expression, TS activity clinicopathological characteristics and survival
   were evaluated and the correlation among them was studied Results: The
   cases studied included 53 patients with low grade positive/negative and
   13 patients with high grade positive TS expression. TS levels were
   8.69+/-10.01pmol/g and 14.82+/-11.38 pmol/g, respectively. There was not
   correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and TS
   expression. Considering TS expression, the 5-year survival rate was
   significantly better for the 75.5\% of the patients with low grade
   positive/negative TS than for the 38.5\% of the patients with high grade

Abstract = {{An enzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), was adsorbed in the manner of
   the single immersion method on the silica mesoporous materials FSM-16,
   MCM-41, and SBA-15 with various pore diameters from 27 to 92 Angstrom,
   and their enzymatic activities in an organic solvent and the thermal
   stabilities were studied. FSM-16 and MCM-41 showed a larger amount of
   adsorption of HRP than SBA-15 or silica gel when the pore sizes were
   larger than the 50 Angstrom. The increased enzyme adsorption capacity
   may be due to the surface characteristics of FSM-16 and MCM-41, which
   would be consistent with the observed larger adsorption capacity of
   cationic pigment compared with anionic pigment for these materials. The
   immobilized HRP on FSM-16 and MCM-41 with pore diameter 50 Angstrom
   showed the highest enzymatic activity in an organic toluene and thermal
   stability in aqueous solution at the temperature of 70 degreesC. The
   immobilized enzymes on the other mesoporous materials including large or
   small pore sized FSM-16 showed lower enzymatic activity in an organic
   solvent and thermal stability. Both surface character and size matching
   between pore sizes and the molecular diameters of HRP were important in
   achieving high enzymatic activity in organic solvent and high thermal

Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis: Laser surgery of the inferior turbinates has
   become a popular surgical treatment for patients with allergic rhinitis,
   particularly for those who have persistent nasal obstruction and do not
   respond well to pharmacological therapy. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the effects of the laser surgery on local cytokine gene
   expression at the mucosal surface in relation to the improvement of
   nasal symptoms. Study Design: A prospective analysis of 25 patients with
   allergic rhinitis caused by the house dust mite who underwent laser
   surgery twice with a I-month interval on an outpatient basis. Fifteen
   healthy volunteers served as normal control subjects. Methods:
   Improvement of the nasal symptoms was evaluated on a graded scale. Nasal
   mucosal cells were obtained by brushing hom the inferior turbinate at
   each visit. The expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding
   granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin
   (IL)-6, IL-8, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed
   and secreted), and eotaxin was semiquantitatively analyzed by reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Two months
   after treatment, the nasal symptom scores significantly decreased from
   baseline. The decrease was most apparent in nasal obstruction. RT-PCR
   analysis revealed that a significant decrease in IL-8 and RANTES
   expression (P < .001 and P = .012, respectively) was observed after
   successive laser treatment, and the reduction in these cytokines was
   significantly correlated. On the other hand, mRNA expression of GM-CSF,
   IL-6, and eotaxin remained unchanged, Conclusions: This study provided
   evidence that the expression of local inflammatory cytokines can be
   attenuated in part by CO2 laser treatment, which may be closely related
   to the clinical effectiveness of this procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation of all 19 chlorophenol (CP) isomers was investigated in a

   kinetics and all possible CP degradation pathways were estimated. The
   rate constants ranged between 0.46 x 10(-3) and 0.161 day(-1). CPs were
   transformed via dechlorination. The chlorine atom at the ortho-position
   was the most easily dechlorinated, whereas dechlorination rate at the
   para-position was lowest. The overall pathways of CP transformation were
   much less diverse than that we previously found for contaminated
   sediment. The Dolfing hypothesis of microbial selection of the most
   thermodynamically favorable pathways was not applicable for CP

Abstract = {{The 14-3-3 proteins are associated with proto-oncogene and oncogene
   products. Here, we generated NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing the beta
   isoform of the 14-3-3 proteins (14-3-3 beta) to examine the function of
   this isoform in cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation.
   Overexpression of 14-3-3 beta in NIH 3T3 cells stimulated cell growth
   and supported anchorage-independent growth in soft agar medium and tumor
   formation in nude mice. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of 14-3-3
   beta -mediated NIH 3T3 transformation, we examined the activity of
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) after serum stimulation.
   Overexpression of 14-3-3 beta augmented MAPK activity after serum
   stimulation, and MAPK activity correlated well with the amount of 14-3-3
   beta expression. The colony-forming ability of NIH 3T3 cells
   overexpressing 14-3-3 beta in soft agar medium was efficiently abolished
   by exogenous expression of a dominant-negative mutant of MEK1 and 14-3-3
   beta physically interacted with Raf-1 in these cells. These findings
   indicate that 14-3-3 beta has oncogenic potential, mainly through
   enhancement of Raf-1 activation and resultant augmentation of signaling

Abstract = {{Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine
   disorder characterized by obesity, hyperandrogenism, and insulin
   resistance. An adverse lipid profile has also been observed in
   PCOS-affected women, suggesting that these individuals may be at
   increased risk for coronary heart disease at a young age. The objective
   of the present study was to evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis among
   women with PCOS and age-matched control subjects. A total of 125 white
   PCOS cases and 142 controls, aged greater than or equal to 30 years were
   recruited. Collection of baseline sociodemographic data, reproductive
   hormone levels, and cardiovascular risk factors was conducted from 1992
   to 1994. During follow-up (1996 to 1999), these women underwent B-mode
   ultrasonography of the carotid arteries for the evaluation of
   carotid:intima-media wall thickness (IMT) and the prevalence of plaque.
   A significant difference was observed in the distribution of carotid
   plaque among PCOS cases compared with controls: 7.2\% (9 of 125) of PCOS
   cases had a plaque index of greater than or equal to3 compared with
   0.7\% (1 of 142) of similarly aged controls (P = 0.05). Overall and in
   the group aged 30 to 44 years, no difference was noted in mean carotid
   IMT between PCOS cases and controls. Among women aged greater than or
   equal to 45 years, PCOS cases had significantly greater mean IMT than
   did control women (0.78 +/- 0.03 versus 0.70 +/- 0.01 mm, P = 0.005).
   This difference remained significant after adjustment for age and BMI (P
   < 0.05). These results suggest that (I) lifelong: exposure to an adverse
   cardiovascular risk profile in women with PCOS may lead to premature
   atherosclerosis, and (2) the PCOS-IMT association is explained in part
   by weight and fat distribution and associated risk factors. There may be
   an independent effect of PCOS unexplained by the above variables that is
   related to the hormonal dysregulation of this condition.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present ambient monitoring data from Houston, TX along
   with results from environmental chamber stud ies to suggest that
   molecular chlorine (Cl-2), a photolytic source of chlorine atoms (Cl-.),
   may contribute significantly to ozone (O-3) formation in some urban
   environments. The ambient data were collected during an ozone episode in
   August 1993 that involved an alkane-rich hydrocarbon plume passing over
   anthropogenic sources of Cl-2. Two unusual observations were made about
   the plume a few hours after it had passed over the Cl-2 sources: (1) a
   rapid loss of alkanes and (2) a large increase in ozone concentration.
   Neither of these observations could be explained with models employing
   hydroxyl radical (OH.) chemistry (OH. are generally accepted to control
   oxidative chemistry in the daytime troposphere). Environmental chamber
   experiments were performed to determine whether the addition of Cl-2 to
   a mixture of air, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) representative
   of conditions in the Houston area would yield similar results. The
   results of these chamber experiments indicated that Cl-2 enhances O-3
   production when alkanes dominate the hydrocarbon mixture, with a
   possible enhancement in ozone production of between 5 and 10 mol of
   ozone produced per mol of Cl-2.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-We estimated the incidence of first-ever cerebral
   infarction in regard to its subtypes and analyzed their risk factors
   separately in a community-based prospective cohort study in Japan.
   Methods-Stroke-free subjects (n = 1621) aged greater than or equal to 40
   years were followed up for 32 years from 1961. During this period, 298
   cerebral infarctions occurred and were divided into 167 lacunar, 62
   atherothrombotic, 56 cardioembolic, and 13 undetermined subtypes of
   infarction on the basis of clinical information including brain imaging
   and autopsy findings.
   Results-The age-adjusted incidence of lacunar infarction (3.8 per 1000
   person-years for men and 2.0 for women) was higher than, that of
   atherothrombotic infarction (1.2, 0.7) and cardioembolic infarction
   (1.3, 0.5) in both sexes. Time-dependent Cox's proportional hazard
   analysis revealed systolic blood pressure as well as age to be
   independent risk factors for all subtypes of cerebral infarction except
   for cardioembolic infarction in men. Additionally, ST depression on EGG,
   glucose intolerance, and smoking in men and left ventricular hypertrophy
   on ECG and body mass index in women remained significant risk factors
   for lacunar infarction. ST depression was also significantly related to
   events of atherothrombotic infarction in women. The risk of atrial
   fibrillation for cardioembolic infarction was outstandingly high in both
   sexes, and left ventricular hypertrophy and lower total cholesterol were
   additional risk factors for cardioembolic infarction in women.
   Conclusions-In this Japanese population, lacunar infarction was the most
   common subtype of cerebral infarction and had a greater variety of risk
   factors, including not only hypertension but also ECG abnormalities,
   diabetes, obesity, and smoking, than did atherothrombotic infarction or
   cardioembolic infarction.}},

   even though penetration depth measurements have shown a good correlation
   between superfluid density and superconducting transition temperature in
   the underdoped-to-optimally-doped part of the phase diagram. Optical
   measurements, which permit independent determination of the total
   doping-induced spectral weight and the superfluid density, show that in
   optimally doped materials only about 20\% of the doping-induced spectral
   weight joins the superfluid. The rest remains in finite-frequency,
   midinfrared absorption. In underdoped materials, the superfluid fraction
   is even smaller. This result implies extremely strong coupling for these

Abstract = {{In this paper, the implications of replacing traditional modes of small

   using the case study of an undergraduate final year module. An
   interpretivist research framework is used to consider the pedagogic and
   technological implications. In this paper two distinct `voices' are
   presented. The first belongs to the virtual seminars tutor as the
   `direct' participant observer reflecting on the teaching and learning
   outcomes for staff and students. The second belongs to the `indirect'
   observer, presenting his evaluation at various stages of the process. We
   conclude that virtual seminars cannot completely substitute for other
   forms of small group teaching, but they do facilitate and promote
   certain skills and processes that are a valuable learning experience for
   students.}},

Title = {{Retention of mutant alpha(1)-antitrypsin Z in endoplasmic reticulum is

Abstract = {{Although there is evidence for specific subcellular morphological
   alterations in response to accumulation of misfolded proteins in the
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER), it is not clear whether these morphological
   changes are stereotypical or if they depend on the specific misfolded
   protein retained. This issue may be particularly important for mutant
   secretory protein alpha (1)-antitrypsin (alpha (1)AT) Z because
   retention of this mutant protein in the ER can cause severe target organ
   injury, the chronic hepatitis/hepatocellular carcinoma associated with
   alpha (1)AT deficiency. Here we examined the morphological changes that
   occur in human fibroblasts engineered for expression and ER retention of
   mutant alpha (1)ATZ and in human liver from three alpha (1)AT-deficient
   patients. In addition to marked expansion and dilatation of ER, there
   was an intense autophagic response. Mutant alpha (1)ATZ molecules were
   detected in autophagosomes by immune electron microscopy, and
   intracellular degradation of alpha (1)ATZ was partially reduced by
   chemical inhibitors of autophagy. In contrast to mutant CFTR Delta F508,
   expression of mutant alpha (1)ATZ in heterologous cells did not result
   in the formation of aggresomes. These results show that ER retention of
   mutant alpha 1ATZ is associated with a marked autophagic response and
   raise the possibility that autophagy represents a mechanism by which
   liver of alpha (1)AT-deficient patients attempts to protect itself from
   injury and carcinogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{My time in the mental health system began a little over 20 years ago,
   when I was seven. Over the past eight years I have been fighting for,
   demanding that, respect and ethics play a part in psychology and all
   that fails under it. I realized that for all the reasons that have been
   given, for ail the excuses that have been made, for a long time I acted
   as little more than an apologist for a system that refused to change. I
   learned that it is impossible to make any great systemic changes without
   the change being wanted-no matter how warranted it is. A system may
   desperately need to be overhauled, gutted out, and rebuilt. However,
   inside of that system are the people who work for it, who need the
   consistency that they have become used to. Psychology, to me. is a
   self-perpetuating institution. It creates the laws and then defines who
   breaks them. I am no longer an apologist for the mental health system.
   Candidly, I have not yet learned how to put a pretty bow on atl of my
   views, which are a direct result of my voluntary and involuntary time in
   the system, both personally and professionally. Ail I know is that it
   has to be about choice. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{To study the usefulness of calretinin as an immunohistochemistry marker
   in the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma (CM) and the origin of myxoma cells,
   eve examined 24 CMs and 9 fetal hearts with immunohistochemical methods
   on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. We compared 24 CMs with 10
   mural thrombi, 6 jaw myxomas, and 2 papillary fibroelastomas. Calretinin
   expression was identified in 100\% of CMs and was negative in all cases
   of mural thrombi, jaw myxoma, and papillary fibroelastoma. Calretinin
   expression by the neoplastic cells in CM was strong and diffuse and had
   a cytoplasmic and a nuclear pattern. Calretinin expression in fetal
   hearts was found in autonomic ganglia cells in the subepicardial tissue
   of the atria and atrial appendages, along the interatrial ann
   atrioventricular sulci, and in the atrial septum. Results clearly
   indicate that calretinin can be used as a marker for the diagnosis of CM
   and that it is a powerful tool for the differential diagnosis, most
   importantly with mural myxoid thrombi. Furthermore, the positive
   expression of calretinin by the autonomic neurons in the fetal heart and
   CM supports the concept that myxoma cells may originate from endocardial

Abstract = {{An understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation of renal
   lesions is necessary for the development of strategies aiming to delay
   the progression of chronic renal failure. The generation of transgenic
   mice in the past 20 years has contributed significantly to the study of
   this phenomenon. Overexpression and/or inactivation of single factors in
   renal tissue demonstrated that molecules such as growth factors,
   proto-oncogenes, and renin-angiotensin system elements play major roles
   in renal deterioration. Several mouse models of renal injury have been
   developed in the past 10 yr. Transgenic mice that exhibit a normal
   phenotype under physiologic conditions allow analysis of the roles of
   single factors in the progression of chronic renal failure when renal
   injury models are used. Using this strategy, it was demonstrated that
   vascular adaptation, which is a process that involves the
   endothelin/nitric oxide balance, is essential for the survival of mice
   after nephron reduction and that the epidermal growth factor/activator
   protein-1/Bcl-2 pathway is involved in the development of renal lesions
   after renal injury, possibly via adjustment of the
   proliferation/apoptosis balance. Moreover, it was demonstrated that
   selective inhibition of epidermal growth factor signaling in the kidney
   successfully prevents the progression of chronic renal failure. These
   results indicate the power of transgenesis for elucidation of the
   pathogenesis of renal disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The authors surveyed religious congregations in New York
   State to document the extent to which HIV/AIDS-related education and
   prevention services were being offered; to identify barriers to offering
   services: and to assess respondents' willingness to meet with HIV/AIDS
   service providers in their communities.
   Methods. In October 1997, a questionnaire was mailed to ail
   congregations in New York State. Due to an initially poor response rate,
   follow-up telephone interviews were made to a random sample of
   non-respondents, Survey responses were weighted to represent ail
   congregations across New York State.
   Results. Just 16.7\% of congregations provided or facilitated
   HIV/AIDS-related prevention services. Respondents cited both attitudinal
   and resource-related reasons for not offering services, There was a
   striking discordance between respondents' perceptions of the need for
   HIV/AIDS prevention services in their communities and an objective
   measure of need created by the Health Department, Approximately half of
   survey respondents expressed willingness to meet with HIV/AIDS service
   providers.
   Conclusion. Follow-up efforts to increase the number of religious
   congregations providing, facilitating, or offering referrals to
   HIV/AIDS-related education and prevention services are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents in detail the experimental and numerical
   investigations on tubular joints that are stiffened internally with
   three annular rings in order to study their behaviors and evaluate their
   strengths under axial brace compression loading. The nominal chord and
   brace diameters of the tested T and Y-joints were 324 and 219 mm and
   their thicknesses were 12 and 8 mm, respectively. The tested joints are
   approximately quarter-size when compared to the largest joints in the
   platforms built in a shallow water depth of 80 m in the Bombay High
   field. Some of the joints were actually fabricated by a leading offshore
   agency that is directly involved in the fabrication of prototype
   structures. Bending of the chord as a whole was observed to be the
   predominant mode of deformation of the internally ring-stiffened joints
   in contrast to ovaling and punching shear of the unstiffened joints.
   Strengths of the internally ring-stiffened joints were found to be
   almost twice that of unstiffened joints of the same dimensions. A
   tri-linear stress-strain model that takes into account the
   strain-hardening characteristics of the material was developed to assess
   the strength of the internally ring-stiffened joints. Finite element
   analysis (FEA) was performed to predict the bending deflection of the
   internally ring-stiffened joints under axial brace compression loading.
   This FEA used NISA II software package and was based on the tri-linear
   model proposed in this study.}},

   while an even more complex vortex system is evidenced in the case of
   slanted-roof square street canyons. In agreement with measurement data,
   high pollutant concentration levels are predicted either on the leeward
   or the windward side of the street canyon, depending on the geometrical
   details of the surrounding buildings.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Chronic pelvic pain is a health problem that affects many
   reproductive-age women. During reproduction the dilemma is even more
   challenging. The growing uterus often exacerbates pain, and treatment is
   limited by the effect on the fetus. A multispecialty approach and
   alternative medicine are often effective. Recently, the FDA announced
   the use of acupuncture and acupressure as officially recognized
   modalities for treatment of chronic pain in oncology patients.
   CASE: Chronic pelvic pain in a 23 year-old primigravida at 27 weeks'
   gestation was incapacitating on narcotics. After organic causes were
   ruled out, acupuncture was employed successfully. Outpatient management
   for the duration of the pregnancy included acupuncture and narcotics for
   breakthrough pain while maintaining activities of daily living.
   Spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications at 38 5/7 weeks
   produced a 3,305-g female infant. The pain resolved immediately
   following delivery.
   CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the benefit of combined allopathic
   with alternative forms of medicine. With the use of acupuncture,
   narcotic use was limited in this gravida while adding to her quality of
   life by allowing her to maintain normal activityz.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Carboplatin dosing in adults with cancer is based on renal
   function. The purpose of the current study was to validate a previously
   developed pediatric carboplatin-dosing formula.
   Patients and Methods: Thirty-eight pediatric patients were randomized to
   receive a carboplatin dose calculated according to surface area or a
   renal function-based dosing formula. On the next course of therapy, the
   alternative dosing method was used for each patient. Carboplatin
   pharmacokinetics (based on free plasma platinum concentrations) were
   measured after both courses.
   Results: The mean observed areas under the carboplatin
   concentration-versus-time curve (AUCs) after renal function- and surface
   area-based dosing were 98\% and 95\% of the target AUCs, respectively.
   The variation in the observed AUC was significantly less after renal
   function- based dosing (F test, P = .02), such that 74\% of courses had
   an observed AUC within +/- 20\% of the target value, versus 49\% for
   courses after dosing according to surface area, Only one of 22 courses
   at the center with the most experience with renal function based dosing
   was associated with an AUC outside +/- 20\% of the target value, versus
   nine of 22 courses after surface area-based dosing in the same center.
   There wets a relationship (r(2) = .71) between carboplatin AUC and
   thrombocytapenia in 10 neurablastoma patients treated with a combination
   of carboplatin, vincristine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide,
   Conclusion: Renal function-bared carboplatin dosing in children results
   in more consistent drug exposure than surface area-based drug
   administration. (C) 2000 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of 1p losses in primary carcinomas, local recurrences and

Journal = {{NEOPLASIA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{514-522}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses of colorectal adenomas and
   carcinomas have shown that loss of the distal part of chromosome arm 1p
   is common, particularly in tumors of the left colon. Because the
   importance of 1p loss in colorectal cancer metastases is unknown, we
   compared the frequency, exact site and extent of 1p deletions in primary
   carcinomas (n=28), local recurrences (n=19) and metastases (n=33) from
   67 colorectal cancer patients using 14 markers in an allelic imbalance
   study. Loss of 1p was found in 50\% of the primary carcinomas, 33\% of
   the local recurrences, and 64\% of the metastases, revealing a
   significant difference between the local recurrences and the metastases
   (P=.04), The smallest region of 1p deletion overlap (SRO) defined
   separately for each group of lesions had the region between markers
   D1S2647 and D1S2644, at 1p35-36, in common. The genes PLA2G2A
   (1p35.1-36) and TP73 (1p36.3) were shown to lie outside this
   consistently lost region, suggesting that neither of them are targets
   for the 1p loss. In the second part of the study, microdissected primary
   carcinomas and distant metastases from the same colorectal cancer
   patients (n=18) were analyzed, and the same 1p genotype was found in the
   majority of patients (12/18, 67\%), The finding that primary carcinoma
   cells with metastatic ability usually contain 1p deletions, and that
   some cases lacking 1p alterations in the primary tumor acquire such
   changes during growth of a metastatic lesion, supports the notion that
   1p loss may be important both early and late in colorectal
   carcinogenesis, with the apparent exception of local recurrences.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate whether there are cerebellar vermis
   abnormalities in schizophrenia. Design: Prospective imaging study with
   proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS). Setting: Schizophrenia
   clinic at a large urban hospital. Patients and controls: Twelve
   right-handed male patients with schizophrenia, and 12 control subjects
   with no psychiatric history. interventions: MRS data were acquired from
   a 2.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm volume of interest that included the entire
   cerebellar vermis. Outcome measures: Spectral peak arising from
   N-acetylaspartate (NAA), phosphocreatine/creatine (Cr) and choline
   (Cho). Results: There were no significant differences between the
   patients with schizophrenia and the controls in cerebellar vermis ratios
   of NAA to Cr (p = 0.71) or Cho to Cr (p = 0.50). Conclusions: This study
   does not support earlier structural studies that found abnormalities of
   the cerebellar vermis in schizophrenia, although it does support
   reported neurochemical studies. It does not rule out cerebellar
   involvement in schizophrenia through mechanisms such as aberrant
   circuitry. Larger in vivo structural/neurochemical and functional

Abstract = {{The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signal transduction pathway
   that is activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the ER
   transmembrane receptor, Ire1p, transmits the signal to the nucleus
   culminating in the transcriptional activation of genes encoding an
   adaptive response. Yeast Ire1p requires both protein kinase and
   site-specific endoribonuclease (RNase) activities to signal the UPR. In
   mammalian cells, two homologs, Ire1 alpha and Ire1 beta, are implicated
   in signaling the UPR. To elucidate the RNase requirement for mammalian
   Ire1 function, we have identified five amino acid residues within IRE1
   alpha that are essential for RNase activity but not kinase activity.
   These mutants were used to demonstrate that the RNase activity is
   required for UPR activation by IRE1 alpha and IRE1 beta. In addition,
   the data support that IRE1 RNase is activated by dimerization-induced
   hans-autophosphorylation and requires a homodimer of catalytically
   functional RNase domains. Finally, the RNase activity of wild-type IRE1
   alpha down-regulates hIre1 alpha mRNA expression by a novel mechanism
   involving cis-mediated IRE1 alpha -dependent cleavage at three specific
   sites within the 5' end of Ire1 alpha mRNA.}},

Abstract = {{Differential equations in the cylindrical coordinate system have been
   solved to calculate vibration mode of a curved, clamped, piezoelectric
   multilayer film. Type I has two clamps at straight ends with uniform
   film curvature, and Type II has the same two clamps with nonuniform
   curvature in which the radii are different for the central region and
   for side regions. The solutions include a uniform displacement term,
   flexural waves with sinusoidal terms, and a hyperbolic cosine term. By
   numerical computations, the vibration modes and frequency response of
   displacement are shown, as are various transducer performances.
   Mechanical losses of the layer materials were taken as complex Young's
   moduli with Q values assumed to be constant with frequency. Numerical
   calculations for 28-mum PVDF with 25-mum polyester enforcement have
   shown that 1) the resonance frequency is not necessarily proportional to
   the inverse of curvature radius as classical theory describes, and,
   furthermore, resonance diminishes for a certain range of radii, forming
   a stop band; 2) a back air cavity thinner than 150 mum significantly
   increases the resonance frequency; 3) Type II generates much higher
   output pressure than Type I; 4) receiver sensitivities for Type I and
   Type II are not much different; and 5) the effect of radiation impedance
   is small leading to similar to7\% output reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In response to intense national pressure to improve care of
   the dying, efforts have been made to determine problems or barriers to
   optimal care. However, prior research is limited by such factors as
   setting, focus, and sampling.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to
   optimal care of a population-based representative sample of decedents
   across a full range of settings in which death occurred.
   Methods: Families were contacted 2 to 5 months after decedents' deaths
   by using data on their death certificates. Over a 14-month period,
   telephone interviews were conducted with 475 family informants who had
   been involved in caring for the patient in the last month of life.
   interviews were standardized by use of a 58-item structured
   questionnaire.
   Results: Data show a high frequency of advance planning (68\%) and a
   high level of respect by clinicians for patient-family preferences about
   end-of-life location and treatment decisions. Family satisfaction with
   care was generally high, even though pain was a problem in one third of
   the sample of decedents.
   Conclusions: Barriers to optimal care of the dying remain, despite a
   generally positive overall profile; barriers include level of pain and
   management of pain, as well as some dissatisfaction with physician
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus (FK) is widely performed to
   assist adjustments of drug dosage but may be an inadequate surrogate of
   the immunosuppression induced. The aim of this investigation was to
   develop an alternative method for measuring FK-related immunosuppressive
   activity in blood samples from liver transplant recipients. A pentamer
   formation assay (PFA) was devised based on the attachment of the 12 kDa
   FK-binding protein (FKBP12) to microtitre plates in the presence of
   calcineurin, calmodulin. Ca++ and FK. Pentamer formation could be
   detected at FK concentrations greater than or equal to 0.2 mug/l by
   optimising assay conditions, particularly by including Ca++ (0.5 mM)
   only during the formation of the pentameric complex. Three methods
   (blood lysis, proteolytic digestion and use of commercial solutions used
   in a microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) technique) were
   incompatible with PFA measurements after extracting immunosuppressive
   FK-related material from patients' blood samples. However, therapeutic
   amounts of FK-related material could be quantified by the PFA assay
   after extraction of blood samples with methanol. There was a moderate
   correlation (r = 0.689) of FK equivalents assayed by PFA with results
   using MEIA in 56 blood samples from 14 liver graft recipients, but no
   obvious relationship of results to variables reflecting their clinical

Abstract = {{The Jem-1 (JEM-1, HGMW-approved symbol BLZF1) gene mapping to human
   chromosome 1q24 codes for a ubiquitously expressed 3-kb mRNA, translated
   in a 45-kDa nuclear protein. Recent studies have shown a deficient
   expression of this gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However,
   treatment with retinoids was able to upregulate JEM-1 mRNA in maturing
   NB4 leukemia cells. Here, we report the characterization of the
   structural organization of JEM-1. By hybridization screening of a human
   genomic library derived from blood mononuclear cells, five overlapping
   genomic DNA clones were isolated. These clones extend over 34 kb of the
   human genome and comprise the complete JEM-1 gene and a 4-kb 5'flanking
   region. Determination of the exon-intron structure of Jem-1 revealed
   seven exons whose junctions with introns exhibited typical splice
   sequences. A shorter transcript (Jem-1s, 1.3 kb) generated by exon 3
   extension and polyadenylation was identified. Its translation generated
   a 23-kDa protein that exhibited a cytoplasmic localization. 5'RACE-PCR
   identified a major transcription start site (TSS) located at 403 nt
   upstream of the ATG, Computer analysis of the 1.8-kb 5'flanking region
   showed that it lacks a TATA box, Inr motifs or DPE motifs, but it
   contains a typical CCAAT box located 95 bp upstream of the TSS.
   Sequencing also revealed potential cia-acting elements for multiple
   transcription regulators including Sp1, GATA, C/EBP, AP-1, and Pu1, No
   retinoic acid receptor elements or retinoic X receptor elements were
   detected. This 1.8-kb DNA sequence showed a strong constitutive promoter
   activity determined by a luciferase-reporter gene assay in transiently
   transfected HeLa cells. Retinoids further increased luciferase
   expression 2.7-fold. We demonstrated that the 1-kb distal sequence
   contains yet unidentified elements reducing constitutive transcription.
   Thus, the maximal constitutive promoter activity was assigned to a -432
   + 101 region overlapping the TSS, These data support the idea of a
   constitutive expression of JEM-1, but a negative regulation in APL
   released by retinoids, (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic and transport properties of two series of sputtered
   {[}N80Co20(L)/Fe(t(Fe))](N) multilayers (MLs) with different Fe layer
   thickness of t(Fe) = 0.1 and 2nm, and varying L were studied and
   compared with each other. An enhanced anisotropic magnetoresistance
   (AMR) peak around L = 10nm was observed for annealed films with t(Fe) =
   0.1nm. The position of the enhanced AMR peak is the same as that of
   transversal MR peak for the deposited MLs with t(Fe) = 2nm. For the
   as-deposited films with impurity Fe layers, when L becomes lower than
   the electron mean free path of Ni80Co20 alloy, the zero-field
   resistivity rho increases with decreasing L and the increase of rho will
   exceed that of AMR (Delta rho). The L dependence of rho can be described
   by Fuchs-Sondheimer theory. The coercivity H-c of the as-deposited films
   with t(Fe) = 0.1nm increases rapidly with increasing L for L < 15nm and
   is almost saturated for L > 15nm. The dependence of H-c on L may be
   related to the interface structure of MLs, which is indicated by a big
   drop of H-c in the annealed films. Our experimental data show that the
   interface scattering in MLs may increase AMR; the magnetic alloy
   interfacial layers in MLs may change the domain structure and enhance
   transverse MR and AMR.}},

Abstract = {{This research is one of the few in search of the answer as to how
   employees perceive their work environment after bankruptcy In a company
   which was taken over by a new owner after bankruptcy proceedings, a
   research was conducted in which 119 employees participated, i.e. the
   whole accessible population of employees. The results indicate a great
   deal of dissatisfaction with different aspects of the work. The
   employees are less satisfied with their salaries, employment stability,
   while they are somewhat more content with human interrelationships. The
   socio-demographic features of the employees do not have any influence on
   the satisfaction or dissatisfaction expressed regarding these aspects of
   work. The feeling of helplessness in contributing to the success of the
   company with one's own work is widely spread, and almost half the
   employees are thinking of leaving the company of their own accord. The
   employees' opinions on the fundamental causes of bankruptcy are
   concentrated around two points: on the one hand apostrophized is the
   incompetence of the old management reflected in the faulty business
   policy and inferior work organization, and on the other private
   interests, theft and ``fraud{''} are stressed as the causes of
   bankruptcy resulting in a deliberate business breakdown in the
   pretransitional period of one of the largest Croatian companies in the
   printing industry.}},

Abstract = {{The International Headache Society (IHS) classification divides chronic

   onset (CCHU) and chronic CH evolved from episodic (CCHE). The purpose of
   our study was to point out any similarities and differences between the
   two chronic CH subtypes and to determine whether or not they can be
   considered as two separate clinical entities. We reviewed data about 31
   CCHE patients and 38 CCHU patients referred to the Parma Headache Centre
   between 1975 and 1999. Clinically, CCHE patients exhibited statistically
   significant differences from CCHU patients, i.e. earlier CH onset and
   duration of attacks varying more frequently between 120 and 180 min.
   From the point of view of lifestyle, heavy alcohol and coffee drinkers
   prevailed among CCHU patients, while CCHE patients were more frequently
   heavy smokers. Based on clinical features, it seems reasonable to
   suppose that chronic CH may occur as two distinct entities.}},

   analysis using the general linear model combined with the stepwise
   technique was used to relate the surface hydrophobicity index of soluble

   explained part of the variability of swelling index, extensibility, and
   work of deformation (dough strength) measured with the alveograph, and
   part of the farinograph water absorption variability, but showed no

Abstract = {{The practical value of high-resolution ultrasound (transducer frequency
   of 20 MHz) in the study of the lacrimal canaliculi has been proven, It
   can also be used in the clinical diagnosis of chronic canaliculitis, If
   the classic symptoms are absent, the clinical diagnosis is often
   inaccurate, and treatment is insufficient. Representative images of
   normal cases and of chronic canaliculitis illustrate the potential of
   high-resolution ultrasound. In our patient, 20-MHz scanner images
   revealed pathological findings which were invisible during slitlamp
   examination, Ultrasonic images of chronic canaliculitis showed ectasia
   of the canaliculus and sulfur grains. High-resolution ultrasonic
   examination of the lacrimal drainage system demonstrated that the 20-MHz
   scanner used was able to show concrements (sulfur grains), measuring 1-2
   mm in diameter, Such more reflective structures (like sulfur grains) are
   a pathognomonic sign of chronic canaliculitis, Our report confirms the
   efficiency of 20-MHz sonography in the diagnosis of canaliculitis

Abstract = {{Contact chemoreceptors (basiconic sensilla) located on the ovipositor
   and genital segments of the locust serve to control the chemical
   features of the substrate before and during oviposition. They occur
   dispersed and also crowded in fields between mechanosensory
   exteroceptors sensitive to touch or wind (trichoid and filiform
   sensilla). The central nervous projections of the four chemosensory and
   one mechanosensory neurons from single basiconic sensilla were stained
   selectively, focusing on receptors on the ovipositor valves, which
   usually contact the substrate during the pre-oviposition probing
   movements. All axons and neurites from one contact chemoreceptor usually
   stay close together in most of their projections. Segregation occurs
   mainly when single axons terminate in one neuromere while the others
   proceed to a different neuromere or ganglion. For projections from one
   chemoreceptor, there is evidence neither for functional segregation of
   mechanosensory from chemosensory afferent terminals nor for specific
   segregation between different chemosensory afferents. The projections
   from sensilla of dorsal cuticle tend to project rather uniformly along
   the midline of the terminal ganglion. Comparative staining of touch- and
   wind-sensitive hair receptor neurons shows mostly central projections,
   similar to those of neighbouring contact: chemoreceptors. From the
   typical intersegmental projections of most primary afferents and from
   the lack of segregation into glomerular structures, we conclude that
   integration of chemosensory information from the genital segments is
   distributed in the terminal and the 7th abdominal ganglion.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are increasingly diagnosed in patients
   undergoing allogeneic BMT, We have previously shown that the addition of
   metronidazole to ciprofloxacin for gastrointestinal bacterial
   decontamination significantly reduces the incidence of grades II-IV
   aGVHD by reduction of the anaerobic intestinal bacterial flora, Here, we
   found that the combined use of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and
   fluconazole as antifungal prophylaxis increased intestinal yeast
   colonization when compared to ciprofloxacin and fluconazole alone (P <
   0.01), Based on the EORTC criteria, a total of 18 out of 134 study
   patients developed IFI: seven of 68 (10\%) patients who received
   metronidazole compared to 11 of the 66 (17\%) patients decontaminated
   without metronidazole developed IFI (log-rank P = 0.36), Lethal IFI
   occurred in two of seven patients receiving metronidazole and in four of
   11 patients without anaerobic decontamination, In conclusion, bacterial
   intestinal decontamination using metronidazole as an antibiotic with
   activity against most anaerobic intestinal bacteria significantly
   increases the intestinal yeast burden without influencing the incidence
   of IFI in patients undergoing allogeneic BMT.}},

Abstract = {{The cardiac response to exercise is complex and involves changes in
   heart rate, contractility, preload and afterload. In intact, apparently
   normal, patients the relaxed left atrium is less compliant than the left
   ventricle, thus facilitating passive transfer of blood between the two
   chambers during diastole. It is speculated that left atrial passive
   properties may be strongly influenced by the pericardium and surrounding
   tissues and that minor changes in left atrial pressure should have a
   considerable effect on the pattern of blood flow entering the left
   atrium from pulmonary veins. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that each
   of the functions of the left atrium may change during exercise.
   Augmented left atrial booster function during exercise is considered to
   be an important mechanism compensating for impaired early diastolic
   filling, thus optimizing cardiac performance. This increase is due to
   the combined effects of increased left atrial preload and presumably of
   increased sympathetic stimulation. Hence, left atrium size and systolic
   dysfunction are predictors of decreased exercise capacity and are
   associated with increased neurohormonal response.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic basis for shoot wilting and root ammonium uptake under
   chilling temperatures was examined in an interspecific backcross (BC1)
   population derived from Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv T5 and wild
   Lycopersicon hirsutum f. typicum accession LA1778. The chilling
   sensitivity of shoot wilting and ammonium uptake was evaluated in four
   replicated cuttings from each of 196 BC1 plants. Wilting was evaluated
   at two different times: 2 hours (wilting 2 h) and 6 hours (wilting 6 h
   recovery) after root exposure to 4 degreesC. The BC1 plants were
   genotyped with 89 polymorphic RFLP markers, and composite interval
   mapping was used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Three QTLs,
   one each on chromosomes 5, 6 and 9, were detected for wilting 2 h. The
   presence of a L. hirsutum (H) allele at the QTL on chromosomes 5 and 9
   decreased wilting, while the H allele at the QTL on chromosome 6
   increased wilting. To analyze plant recovery from wilting at 6 h,
   subsets of the BC1 population were selected, based on phenotype and
   genotype, because not all plants wilted at 2 h. The phenotype subset
   (wilting 6 h-PS) included plants that wilted to a greater degree at 2 h,
   and the genotype subsets included plants carrying specific allelic
   compositions at the QTL for wilting 2 h on chromosomes 5 (wilting 6
   h-GS-ch5), 6 (wilting 6 h-GS-ch6), and 9 (wilting 6 h-GS-ch9). On
   chromosome 6, a QTL was located that was associated with three subsets
   (wilting 6 h-PS, wilting 6 h-GS-ch5 and wilting 6 h-GS-ch9), while on
   chromosome 7 a QTL was detected with two subsets (wilting 6 h-PS and
   wilting 6 h-GS-ch5). Three additional QTLs were detected within a single
   subset: chromosome 1 (wilting 6 h-GS-ch6), chromosome II (wilting 6
   h-GS-ch5) and chromosome 12 (wilting 6 h-GS-ch9). The presence of the H
   allele at the QTL on chromosomes 7 and 12 had a positive effect,
   enhancing recovery from wilting, while the H allele at the other QTL had
   a negative effect. Three traits were used to evaluate the chilling
   sensitivity of root ammonium uptake: ammonium uptake before a chilling
   episode, ammonium uptake after the chilling episode, and the relative
   inhibition of uptake (difference in uptake rates before and after
   chilling divided by the rate before chilling). One QTL was detected on
   chromosome 3 for the rate before chilling and one on chromosome 6 for
   the relative inhibition of ammonium uptake. Our results demonstrate that
   shoot wilting and ammonium uptake under chilling are controlled by
   multiple QTLs.}},

Abstract = {{Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), is a key enzyme in the central nervous
   system (CNS) that synthesizes the inhibitory neurotransmitter
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from glutamate, Our previous phylogenetic
   studies on the evolution of this enzyme indicates that there are at
   least two distinct forms: GAD65 and GAD67. They are the products of
   separate genes and probably derive from a common ancestral GAD gene
   following gene duplication prior to the emergence of the teleosts more
   than 200 Myr ago. Furthermore, a third GAD-like molecule, GAD3,
   discovered in the armed grenadier, Coryphaenoides (Nematonurus) armatus,
   is equally divergent from both GAD65 and GAD67. Specimens of C. (N,)
   armatus were collected by trawl at a depth of 4,000 m in the Porcupine
   Seabight (Northeastern Atlantic), and brains dissected and frozen for
   RNA extraction. All three GAD forms are found in the cerebellum,
   telencephalon and hypothalamus. Semiquantitative PCR analysis showed
   that males and females have similar levels of expression of GAD67 and
   GAD3 in the tissues studied. Independent of the sex examined, the levels
   of expression of GAD65 and GAD67 in the cerebellum were approximately
   half that in the telencephalon. GAD3 levels were approximately 30\%
   higher in the cerebellum than in either the telencephalon or
   hypothalamus. In contrast to GAD67 and GADS, hypothalamic expression of
   GAD65 mRNA is 1.8 times higher (p < 0.05) in males than in females.
   These data indicate that the expression of GAD65, a key enzyme for the
   synthesis of GABA is sexually dimorphic in females and males of C, (N.)

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Although the glucocorticoid prednisone is the standard
   therapy for autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss, what this hormone
   does in the ear to restore hearing is not known. MRL/MpJ-Fas(1pr)
   autoimmune mice consistently have shown only stria vascularis disease,
   implying that abnormal ion balances in the endolymph underlie cochlear
   dysfunction. Previously we have shown that hearing loss in these mice is
   reversed with prednisolone treatment. This, coupled with the complete
   lack of cochlear inflammation, suggests that the restoration of hearing
   with prednisolone is due to its sodium transport function and not to its
   anti-inflammatory or immune suppression effects. Therefore the
   hypothesis of this study was that the mineralocorticoid aldosterone,
   which only increases sodium transport, would be as effective as
   prednisolone in reversing autoimmune hearing loss. Study Design:
   MRL/MpJ-Fas(1pr) autoimmune mice were treated with either prednisolone
   or aldosterone to compare steroid effects on auditory brainstem response
   (ABR) thresholds and stria morphology, Methods: After baseline ABR
   audiometry, autoimmune mice were given prednisolone (5 mg/kg per day),
   aldosterone (15 mug/kg per day), or water in their drinking bottles.
   After 2 months of treatment the ABR thresholds were remeasured, and ears
   collected for histological examination. Results: The untreated controls
   showed continued elevation of ABR thresholds and edematous stria,
   However, thresholds in most steroid mice were improved or unchanged and
   their stria morphology improved, particularly with aldosterone
   treatment. Conclusions Restoration of hearing with steroid treatment is
   due to increased sodium transport to re-establish cochlear ionic
   balances. Aldosterone therapy may offer advantages over prednisone for
   long-term management of not only autoimmune hearing loss, but also other
   forms of nonimmune-related deafness for which steroids are currently
   prescribed.}},

Abstract = {{The rates of oxygen uptake of the marine polychaete Nereis pelagica and
   the bivalve Arctica islandica depend on the availability of ambient
   oxygen. This is manifest both at the tissue level and in isolated
   mitochondria studied between oxygen tensions (Po-2) of 6.3 and 47.6 kPa
   (47-357 mmHg), Oxyconformity was found in both Baltic Sea (Kiel Eight)
   and cold-adapted White Sea populations of the two species. However,
   mitochondria isolated from White Sea specimens of N, pelagica and A.
   islandica showed a two- to threefold higher aerobic capacity than
   mitochondria prepared from Baltic Sea specimens. We tested whether
   mitochondrial oxyconformity can be explained by an additional electron
   pathway that is directly controlled by Po,. Mitochondrial respiration of
   both invertebrate species was inhibited by cyanide (KCN) and by
   salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), The overall rate of mitochondrial oxygen
   consumption increased at high Po,. Phosphorylation efficiency (ADP/O
   ratio) decreased at elevated Po-2 (27.5-47.6 kPa, 206-357 mmHg),
   regardless of whether malate or succinate was used as a substrate. In
   contrast to the invertebrate mitochondria studied, mitochondria isolated
   from bovine heart, as an oxyregulating control species, did not show an
   elevated rate of oxygen uptake at high Po, in any respiratory state,
   with the exception of state 2 malate respiration. In addition, rates of
   ATP formation, respiratory control ratios (RCR) and ADP/O ratios
   remained virtually unchanged or even tended to decreased. In conclusion,
   the comparison between mitochondria from oxyregulating and oxyconforming
   organisms supports the existence of an alternative oxidase in addition
   to the classical cytochrome c oxidase. In accordance with models
   discussed previously, oxidative phosphorylation does not explain the
   rate of mitochondrial oxygen consumption during progressive activation
   of the alternative electron transport system. We discuss the alternative
   system, thought to be adaptive in confined, usually hypoxic
   environments, where excess oxygen can be eliminated and oxygen levels
   can be kept low by an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption,
   thereby minimizing the risk of oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{Records from Dairy Records Management Systems in Raleigh were used to
   estimate effects of bovine somatotropin (bST) treatment and to predict
   breeding values for milk production traits. The data comprised 5245
   test-day records of bST-treated cows and 126,223 test-day records of
   untreated cows in first lactation for milk, fat, and protein yields.
   Fixed effects of bST treatment were estimated from test-day animal
   models with herd-test-date as another fixed factor. Percentage increases
   due to bST treatment ranged from 7 to 8\% for test-day milk, fat, and
   protein yields. Random regression coefficients for additive genetic and
   permanent environmental effects were included in the model. To assess
   the potential for bias in genetic evaluations when some and not all cows
   are treated with bST, breeding values predicted by the test-day model
   with and without effects of bST treatment were compared for cows and
   sires. Correlations between breeding values predicted from models with
   and without effects of bST treatment were 0.99. However, relatively
   large bias was found for individual animals. This result suggests that
   bias in genetic evaluation caused by ignoring bST treatment may be
   significant.}},

Abstract = {{We present results from an experimental study of the decoherence and

   experimentally simulate three types of reservoirs: a high-temperature
   amplitude reservoir, a zero-temperature amplitude reservoir, and a
   high-temperature phase reservoir. Interaction with these environments
   causes the ion's motional state to decay or heat, and in the case of
   superposition states, to lose coherence. We report measurements of the
   decoherence of superpositions of coherent states and two-Fock-state
   superpositions into these reservoirs, as well as the decay and heating
   of Fock states. We confirm the theoretically well-known scaling laws
   that predict that the decoherence rate of superposition states scales
   with the square of the ``size{''}' of the state.}},

Abstract = {{An underlying assumption of data assimilation models is that the
   radiative transfer model used by them can simulate observed radiances
   with zero bias and small error. For practical reasons a fast
   parameterized radiative transfer model is used instead of a highly
   accurate line-by-line model. These fast models usually replace the
   spectral integration of the product of the transmittance and the Planck
   function with a monochromatic equivalent, namely, the product of a
   spectrally averaged transmittance and a spectrally averaged Planck
   function. The error of using this equivalent form is commonly assumed to
   be negligible. However, this error is not necessarily negligible and
   introduces a systematic height-dependent bias to the assimilation
   scheme. Although the bias could be corrected by a separate bias
   correction scheme, it is more effective to correct its source, the fast
   radiative transfer model. I examine the magnitude of error when the
   monochromatic-equivalent approach is used and demonstrate how a fast
   parameterized radiative model with Planck-weighted mean transmittances
   can effectively reduce if not eliminate these errors at source. I focus
   on channel 12 of the High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder onboard
   the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-14 satellite
   that, among all the channels of this instrument, displays the largest
   error. (C) 2000 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 030.5620,

   conventional immunohistochemistry with a peroxidase-linked antibody, and
   neural architecture is by reduced silver staining. This makes visible in
   histological sections the same GFP- labeled cells seen with confocal
   microscopy, but with the especial advantage that neuropil structures are
   also revealed at the level of individual cells and neuron processes. Not
   only does this allow the physical relationships among intracellularly
   labeled neurons to be determined by reference to specific features in
   the neuropil but it also enables a function to be ascribed provisionally
   to particular regions of neuropil. These methods have particular utility

Abstract = {{An increased expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has been observed in
   various cancels including gastric cancer: Although specific COX-2
   inhibitors have a chemopreventive effect on colon cancer; their
   molecular mechanisms remain unclear To clarify these mechanisms, we
   investigated the effects of JTE-522, a newly developed COX-2-specific
   inhibitor, on gastric cancer cell lines (MKN28 and MKN45). The baseline
   levels of COX-2 expression were higher, in MKN45 than in MKN28. JTE-522
   obviously suppressed the levels of COX-2 mRNA, COX-2 protein and PGE(2)
   at a dose of 250 muM in both cancer cells. Apoptosis was induced at 24
   hows after a treatment with JTE-522 (250 muM) in both cancer cells. To
   determine the mechanisms of apoptosis induction by JTE-522, the rime
   course of the cell cycle and the apoptosis-related protein levels were
   examined An increase in the G1 phase and a decrease in the S phase were
   observed prior to apoptosis. Moreover an increase of c-myc protein and a
   decrease of bcl-2 protein were observed in both cells treated with
   JTE-522. These findings suggested that JTE-522 could induce apoptosis by
   blocking the cell cycle, enhancing c-myc expression and diminishing
   bcl-2 expression. JTE-522 also suppressed proliferation activity in both
   cell lines. These effects of JTE-522 were more dramatic in MKN45 than in
   MKN28. Since JTE-522 strongly suppresses cell growth by inducing
   apoptosis in gastric cancel cell lines, it may therefore serve as a
   chemopreventive agent.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Although several clinical applications of transpedicular
   screw fixation in the cervical spine have been documented recently, few
   anatomic studies concerning the cervical pedicle are available. This
   study was designed to evaluate the anatomy and adjacent neural
   relationships of the middle and lower cervical pedicle (C3-C7). The main
   objective is to provide accurate information for transpedicular screw
   fixation in the cervical region and to minimize complications by
   providing a three-dimensional orientation.
   METHODS: Twenty cadavers were used to observe the cervical pedicle and
   its relationships, After removal of the posterior bony elements,
   including spinous processes, laminae, lateral masses, and inferior and
   superior facets, the isthmus of the pedicle was exposed. Pedicle width,
   pedicle height, interpedicular distance, pedicle-inferior nerve root
   distance, pedicle-superior nerve root distance, pedicle-dural sac
   distance, medial pedicle-dural sac distance, mean angle of the pedicle,
   root exit angle, and nerve root diameter were measured.
   RESULTS: The results indicate that there was no distance between the
   pedicle and the superior nerve root and between the pedicle and the
   dural sac in 16 specimens, whereas there was a slight distance in the
   lower cervical region in the 4 other specimens. The mean distance
   between the pedicle and the inferior nerve root for all specimens ranged
   from 1.0 to 2.5 mm. The mean distance between the medial pedicle and the
   dural sac increased consistently from 2.4 to 3.1 mm. At C3-C7, the mean
   pedicle height ranged from 5.2 to 8.5 mm, and the mean pedicle width
   ranged from 3.7 to 6.5 mm. Interpedicular distance ranged from 21.2 to
   23.2 mm. The mean root exit angle ranged from 69 to 104 degrees, with
   the largest angle at C3 and the smallest at C6. The mean angle of the
   pedicle ranged from 38 to 48 degrees. The nerve root diameter increased
   consistently from 2.7 mm at C3 to 3.8 mm at C6 and then decreased to 3.7
   mm at the C7 level. Differences in measurements were considered
   statistically significant at levels ranging from P < 0.05 to P < 0.01.
   CONCLUSION: This study indicates that improper placement of the pedicle
   screw medially and superiorly in the middle and lower cervical spine
   should be avoided and that the anatomic variations between individuals
   should be established by measurement.}},

   were noted in cardiac index or ST segment analysis. The times to

   that represents samples of a wheat cultivar accurately. In the training
   stage, produced discriminant functions for bread and durum wheat
   cultivars yielded nearly 99\% and 98\% accuracy in the classification,
   respectively. When the same discriminant functions were used in the test
   stage, recognition of unknown samples was nearly 82\% for durum wheat
   cultivars and it was about 81\% for bread wheat cultivars. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{It is proposed to use a mixing rule for the estimation of conductivity,
   sigma in `conductor-insulator' composites (M-A) and composite solid
   electrolytes (MX-A). The mixing rule in its classical form sigma (alpha)
   = (1 - f) . sigma (alpha)(M) + f . sigma (alpha)(A) (where f is the
   volume fraction of A; sigma (M,A) are conductivity of the phases hi and
   A; - 1 < <alpha> < 1) is applicable only for some specific morphology of
   the composite. This equation may be generalized by introducing the
   dependence <alpha>(f) = alpha1 . (1 - f) + alpha2 . f in order to take
   variation of the morphology with f into account. For MX-A systems the
   general mixing rule has the form sigma (alpha (f)) = (1 - f - f(S)) .
   sigma (alpha (f))(MX) + f(s) .sigma (alpha (f))(S) + f . sigma (alpha
   (f))(A), where f(S) is the volume fraction of high-conducting interface
   regions estimated in terms of the brick-wall model; a, is the
   conductivity via the interface. The general mixing rules are rather
   simple, convenient, agree with effective medium models, qualitatively
   describe percolation effects and satisfactorily represent the
   experimental data in many composites. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The aetiology of lichen planus is unknown, but it is often connected
   with infections. In recent Sears peptic ulcer disease has also been
   closely linked with an infections agent, Helicobacter pylori. A
   case-control study was conducted in 78 patients with lichen planus to
   find out a previous history of peptic ulcer disease, using a
   questionnaire and a medical record review. Patients were also asked
   about family history in first- and second-degree relatives. Fifty-seven
   patients with other skin diseases were interviewed as controls. The
   prevalence of H, pylori infection in patients with lichen planus was
   compared to that of 39 patients with other skin diseases and to the
   overall prevalence rates of H, pylori infection in Finland, Our findings
   are consistent with an approximately three-fold increased risk of peptic
   ulcer in patients with chronic/repeating lichen planus, when compared to
   the control patients (p = 0.04) and also to the overall peptic ulcer
   prevalence rates in Finland, Forty-one percent of the patients with
   chronic/repeating lichen planus had a first- or second-degree family
   member with a peptic ulcer, while the corresponding rate in the control
   group was only 12\% (p=0.003). The prevalence of H, pylori infection in
   patients with chronic/repeating lichen planus and transient lichen
   planus was not significantly different from that in patients with other

   stop-and-chop nucleotomy techniques of phacoemulsification.
   Setting: Dr. Rajendra Prasad Center for Ophthalmic Sciences, New Delhi,
   India.
   Methods: Forty eyes of 40 patients with immature senile cataract were
   included in the study. Twenty eyes each were randomly assigned to have
   phaco-chop (Group I)or stop-and-chop (Group 2) nucleotomy during
   phacoemulsification. The main parameters were corneal endothelial count,
   effective phaco time, volume of infusion fluid used, central corneal
   pachymetry, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and intraoperative
   complications during nucleotomy. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1,
   4, and 12 weeks.
   Results: The mean effective phaco time was 27 seconds +/- 18 (SD) in
   Group 1 and 28 +/- 18 seconds in Group 2. The mean corneal endothelial
   cell loss was 6.89\% and 7.17\%, respectively, at the end of 12 weeks.
   The difference between groups was not significant. An anterior capsule
   tear occurred in 3 eyes in Group 1 and 1 eye in Group 2. All eyes
   achieved a BCVA of 20/20 at the end of 4 weeks. There were no
   significant between-group differences in any intraoperative or
   postoperative parameter.
   Conclusion: The phaco-chop and the stop-and-chop nucleotomy techniques
   were equally efficacious for nuclear management during

Abstract = {{In vitro and in vivo skin absorption of the pesticide propoxur
   (2-isopropoxyphenyl N-methyl carbamate, commercially Baygon(TM) and
   Unden(TM); log Po/w 1.56, MW 209.2) was investigated. In vivo studies
   were performed in rats and human volunteers, applying the test compound
   to the dorsal skin and the volar aspect of the forearm, respectively. In
   vitro experiments were carried out in static diffusion cells using
   viable full-thickness skin membranes (rat and human), non-viable
   epidermal membranes (rat and human) and a perfused-pig-ear model.
   Percutaneous penetration of propoxur in human volunteers was measured by
   analysis of its metabolite (2-isopropoxyphenol) in blood and urine; in
   all other studies radiolabeled propoxur ({[}ring-U-C-14]propoxur) was
   used. In order to allow for direct comparison, experimental conditions
   were standardized with respect to dose (150 mug propoxur per cm(2)),
   vehicle (60\% aqueous ethanol) and exposure time (4 h). In human
   volunteers, it was found that approximately 6\% of the applied dose was
   excreted via the urine after 24 h, while the potential absorbed dose
   (amount applied minus amount washed off) was 23 mug/cm(2). In rats these
   values were 21\% and 88 mug/cm(2), respectively. Data obtained in vitro
   were almost always higher than those obtained in human volunteers. The
   most accurate in vitro prediction of the human in vivo percutaneous
   absorption of propoxur was obtained on the basis of the potential
   absorbed dose. The absorbed dose and the maximal flux in viable
   full-thickness skin membranes correlated reasonably well with the human
   in vivo situation (maximal overestimation by a factor of 3). Epidermal
   membranes overestimated the human in vivo data up to a factor of 8, but
   the species-differences observed in vivo were reflected correctly in
   this model. The data generated in the perfused-pig-ear model were
   generally intermediate between viable skin membranes and epidermal
   membranes.}},

Abstract = {{A bilayer resist. system, consisting of hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) as
   negative tone electron (e)-beam resist top coat and hard baked novolak
   resist as bottom coat, has been investigated for its ability to yield
   high aspect ratio nanoscale structures. For comparison, single layer HSQ
   (hard mask) has been investigated for its resolution, contrast, and
   process latitude. In single layer HSQ, dense lines and spaces (1:1) have
   been resolved down to 20 nm and single lines have been obtained with
   widths less than 15 nm. Processing conditions which result in higher
   contrasts in HSQ also result in higher horizontal contrasts, i.e., in
   poorer process latitudes; this effect has previously been observed for
   other negative tone e-beam resists as well. In the bilayer combination,
   HSQ allows nanoscale structures with an aspect ratio exceeding 15 to be
   etched in hard baked novolak resist. Single lines with 800 nm height and
   40 nm width, semidense lines and spaces (1:2) with 155 nm height and 25
   nm width, and dense lines and spaces (1:1) with 130 nm height and 40 nm
   width have been patterned in this bilayer system. Both the single layer
   HSQ and the HSQ/novolak bilayer system appear to be suitable as a-beam
   resists for research on nanoscale gates in complementary
   metaloxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and other devices. (C) 2000 American

Abstract = {{Background: Associations between different types of depression with
   clinical characteristics and putative vulnerability factors from several
   domains (health, disability, personality, familial psychopathology) were
   studied in a sample of elderly subjects, in order to find arguments that
   support or discard the notion of discontinuity in correlates of
   depression. Methods: Subjects were 183 depressed elderly persons from
   the general population, general practitioners and mental health care
   outpatient clinics, and a random elderly control group (n =74).
   Depression was subdivided into symptomatic (n = 45), DSM-IV minor (n =
   73), and DSM-IV major (n = 65) depression. The groups were compared with
   respect to a variety of variables from different domains. Results: Most
   variables showed a marked difference between the control group and the
   depressive groups, and smaller or no differences between depressive
   subtypes. Limitations: The data were collected cross-sectionally.
   Conclusions: With a few notable exceptions, all subtypes of depression
   were significantly different from the control group, while differences
   between depressive subtypes were generally smaller. Depressive subtypes
   showed no discontinuum with respect to the associated variables. Similar
   associations in different subtypes of depression may indicate common
   vulnerability factors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Plants respond to pathogen attack by induction of various defence
   responses, including the biosynthesis of protective secondary
   metabolites. In Catharanthus roseus, the elicitor-induced expression of
   the terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthetic gene Strictosidine synthase
   (Str) is mediated via the plant stress hormone jasmonate. In the
   promoters of several defence-related genes, cis-acting elements have
   been identified that are important for transcriptional regulation upon
   stress signals. Here we show that an upstream region in the Str promoter
   confers responsiveness to partially purified yeast elicitor and
   jasmonate. Yeast one-hybrid screening with this element as a bait
   identified a MYB-like protein, which shows high homology to parsley box
   P-binding factor-1 (PcBPF-1). In vitro analyses showed that the Str
   promoter fragment contained a novel binding site for BPF-1-like proteins
   with higher binding affinity than the previously described box P.
   CrBPF-1 mRNA accumulated rapidly in elicitor-treated C. roseus
   suspension cells, whereas no induction was observed with jasmonate.
   Inhibitor studies indicated that CrBPF-1 plays a role in an
   elicitor-responsive but jasmonate-independent signal transduction
   pathway, acting downstream of protein phosphorylation and calcium
   influx.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this pilot study was to examine the usefulness of the Dutch
   version of the Arthritis impact Measurement Scales 2 (D-AIMS2)ln
   assessing the health status of Dutch individuals with haemophilia.
   Sixty-eight individuals with mild, moderate, and severe haemophilia
   attending our clinic for their annual check-up participated. They first
   completed the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). The
   D-AIMS2 was filled in afterwards at home. With the COPM, individuals
   rated their specific problematic activities of daily life (ADL), as well
   as the severity and importance of each problem. The D-AIMS2. is a
   comprehensive, self-administered questionnaire that evaluates functional
   health status. Fifty-seven individuals completed and returned the
   D-AIMS2. Reliability analysis demonstrated good internal consistency for
   the scales (Cronbach's alpha =0.76-1.00), as well as for the components
   (alpha = 0.80-0.88), except for the component `social interaction'
   (alpha = 0.44). Criterion validity of the D-AIMS2 was assessed by
   comparison with COPM outcomes; 80\% of the problematic ADLs were
   included in the questionnaire, 20\% were missing. Correlations between
   the D-AIMS2 components `physical health' and `symptoms' with predicted
   scores of those individuals by a highly experienced physiotherapist
   (r=0.63 and 0.53, respectively) substantiated its concurrent validity.
   Based on these results we concluded that the D-AIMS2, with minor
   adjustments, can be an appropriate tool for assessing the health status
   of Dutch haemophilia patients.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured absolute line intensities in the nu (2) fundamental
   band at 1238 cm(-1) of both isotopomers of hypochlorous acid. HOCl. To
   obtain the partial pressure of the species in the sample mixture,
   unavailable through direct measurement since HOCl exists only in
   equilibrium with H2O and Cl2O and may decay by secondary reactions, we
   relied on known absolute line intensities in the pure rotational
   far-infrared (FIR) spectrum determined from Stark effect measurements.
   We have thus recorded simultaneously the FIR pure rotation spectrum of
   HOCl using a Bruker IFS120HR interferometer and the spectrum of a few
   vibration-rotation lines in the infrared (IR) nu (2) band using a
   tunable diode laser spectrometer. The absolute intensities of these IR
   lines thus determined allowed us to ``calibrate{''} the intensities of
   vibration-rotation lines in the whole nu (2) band, measured previously
   using Fourier transform spectroscopy. The treatment of the data took
   into account the blackbody emission contribution in the FIR and the
   evolution of the HOCl amount during the recording of the spectra. The
   latter was found to be almost constant over hours after conditioning of
   the cell. The square of the nu (2) band vibrational transition dipole
   moment was determined to be 0.013947(23) D-2 and 0.013870(51) D-2 for
   (HOCl)-Cl-35 and (HOCl)-Cl-37, respectively, that is, 29 to 73\% lower
   than previous measurements. A linear Herman-Wallis factor was also
   determined for both isotopomers. Finally, the line intensities were
   least-squares fitted using a model that takes into account a weak
   resonance between the (010) and (002) levels. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon contents and distribution have been measured in glass inclusions
   in olivines of CV3 carbonaceous chondrites by using the C-12(d,p) C-13
   nuclear reaction. All olivines from the four studied meteorites had low
   carbon contents (<70 ppm). Conversely, glasses of glass inclusions in
   the same olivines had highly variable carbon contents, all above 100
   ppm. Glass inclusions in olivines from meteorites of the oxidized group
   (Allende, Kaba, and Bah) had carbon contents that varied from 100 to
   about 2000 ppm, whereas those from the reduced group member Vigarano
   were surprisingly poor in C (averaging 300 ppm). These relative
   abundances of carbon in these glasses of reduced and oxidized CV3
   meteorites are in contrast to the abundances of interstellar SiC in
   these meteorites. This indicates that glass inclusions in olivines could
   have behaved, with respect to carbon, as closed systems that have
   escaped elemental exchange processes. The carbon content of the glasses
   is, therefore, likely to be primary and reflect the physico-chemical
   conditions during the formation of the host olivine and glass
   inclusions. The redox conditions prevailing during secondary processing
   of the olivines (e.g., metasomatic Fe-Mg exchange, Ca-Na exchange)
   appear not to have influenced the carbon distribution. Carbon could have
   been trapped initially as a refractory carbon species (e.g., carbide) by
   clear glass inclusions. Despite the fact that the nature of neither the
   primary nor that of the secondary C species was established, the
   commonly heterogeneous distribution of C in glass inclusions in olivines
   suggests entrapment of a solid C-bearing precursor. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {{ACTH production in Cushing's disease is characterized by a markedly
   elevated rate of basal (nonpulsatile) secretion, an increased mass of
   ACTH released per burst and an unremarkable pulse frequency. In
   addition, the ACTH secretory process and that of GH and PRL exhibit
   profoundly disordered patterns. Whether some or all of these
   disturbances can be reversed or normalized by transsphenoidal
   microadenomectomy remains unknown. We therefore investigated the
   detailed dynamics of ACTH, GH, and PRL in eight patients (aged 38.9 +/-
   4.2 yr) with pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease who were in longterm
   (8.2 +/- 1.7 yr) clinical remission following transsphenoidal surgery
   and eight controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index. To this
   end, blood was sampled at 10-min intervals for 24 h for the later assay
   of ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL. Secretory activity was quantitated by
   deconvolution methods, and the pattern orderliness (regularity) of
   hormone release was determined by the approximate entropy (ApEn)
   statistic. The joint synchrony of ACTH and cortisol secretion was
   monitored by the cognate bivariate statistic, cross-ApEn. Diurnal
   properties of the hormonal release were appraised by cosinor analysis.
   Based on deconvolution analysis, postsurgical patients exhibited a
   normal frequency, half-life, duration, and mass of ACTH and cortisol
   secretory bursts. Accordingly, the 24-h production rates of both ACTH
   (2.5 +/- 0.7 mug/L in patients vs. 2.9 +/- 0.7 mug/L in controls; P =
   0.755) and cortisol (49 +/- 11 mu mol/L in patients vs. 73 +/- 15 mu
   mol/L in controls; P = 0.217) were normal also. The acrophase of the
   diurnal rhythm of ACTH (patients, 0817 h +/- 37 min; controls, 0850 h
   +/- 38 min; P = 0.629) and cortisol (patients, 1000 h +/- 24 min;
   controls, 0855 h +/- 30 min; P = 0.175) was also restored by surgery.
   ApEn values of ACTH (patients, 1.168 +/- 0.090; controls, 0.864 +/-
   0.122;P = 0.133) and cross-ApEn of ACTH-cortisol (patients, 1.396 +/-
   0.087; controls, 1.170 +/- 0.076; P = 0.140) secretion were both normal
   in this cohort, denoting restoration of the secretory process
   regularity. Cortisol ApEn was slightly higher in patients (patients,
   1.034 +/- 0.084; controls, 0.831 +/- 0.038; P = 0.048). Both GH and PRL
   time series manifested full reconstitution of pulsatile, 24-h rhythmic,
   and entropic properties. In summary, clinically successful
   transsphenoidal microadenomectomy in adults with Cushing's disease can
   fully normalize virtually all quantitative features of regulated ACTH,
   cortisol, GH, and PRL secretion. Further studies will be needed to
   establish the consistency of these findings in larger cohorts of adults
   with Cushing's disease and in children with this disorder and to
   delineate the significance, if any, of a residual, minimally detectable
   disruption of orderly cortisol secretion in this patient population.}},

   homology to the human U3-55k protein, Epitope-tagged Rrp9p specifically
   precipitates Us snoRNA, but Rrp9p is not required for the stable
   accumulation of this snoRNA, Genetic depletion of Rrp9p inhibits the
   early cleavages of the primary pre-rRNA transcript at A(0), A(1), and
   A(2) and, consequently, production of 18S, but not 25S and 5.8S, rRNA,
   The hU3-55k protein can partially complement a yeast rrp9 null mutant,
   indicating that the function of this protein has been conserved.
   Immunoprecipitation of extracts from cells that coexpress epitope-tagged

   hepatocyte cultures. Treatment with silymarin (0.1 and 0.25 mM)
   significantly reduced the activity of CYP3A4 enzyme (by 50 and 100\%,

   testosterone and the activity of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl
   transferase (UGT1A6/9) (by 65 and 100\%, respectively) as measured by
   the formation of 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide. Silymarin (0.5 mM)
   also significantly decreased mitochondrial respiration as determined by
   MTT reduction in human hepatocytes. These observations point to the
   potential of silymarin to impair hepatic metabolism of certain

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the effect of surfactant alone and with other
   medications delivered intranasally as a metered dose inhaler (MDI)
   aerosol on the resolution of experimentally induced otitis media with
   effusion (OME). Background: Eustachian tube dysfunction is a primary
   factor in the pathogenesis of OME, Intranasal surfactant via MDI has
   been shown in this laboratory to reduce passive opening pressure of the
   eustachian tube in normal gerbils and mice. Study Design: OME was
   developed in 35 gerbils by transtympanic injection of 10 mug
   lipopolysaccharide from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pretreatment
   otomicroscopy and tympanometry were performed to exclude pre-existing
   middle ear disease, and postinfection evaluations were performed on
   alternate days for a period of 30 days. Five animals received no
   treatment (control group); four were treated with propellant only
   (placebo); seven received surfactant alone; eight received surfactant
   and betamethasone; and six received surfactant with phenylephrine, All
   medications were sprayed intranasally as an aerosolized MDI and
   administered daily from postinfection day 2 onward. Results: OME
   resolved after 16.0 +/- 0.44 days (mean +/- SD) in controls. There was
   no difference seen in the placebo or the surfactant with phenylephrine
   groups. Treatment with surfactant yielded resolution in 10.57 +/- 0.37
   days; this was reduced to 8.57 +/- 0.37 days with surfactant plus
   betamethasone. These differences are statistically significant. There
   was no recurrence of OME in any group, Conclusion: This study
   demonstrates that using an aerosolized MDI surfactant with and without
   betamethasone decreases the duration of OME in this in vivo gerbil
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Wavelength-division multiplexing has emerged as an important physical
   layer technology. Optical transmission provides a physical layer capable
   of carrying bits at the speed of the order of a gigabit per second.
   Optical burst switching is proposed to overcome the shortcomings of
   conventional WDM deployment, such as lack of fine bandwidth granularity
   in wavelength routing and electronic speed bottlenecks in SONET/SDH. In
   this article, we describe an architecture for IP network over the OBS
   WDM transmission core. The use of MPLS-type technique for forwarding
   data bursts and the inclusion of a medium access control layer between
   the optical (WDM) and IP layers are the key ingredients of the proposed
   architecture. In particular, the architecture is based on provisioning
   MPLS paths, also called label switched paths, of desired quality of
   service through the OBS WDM transmission core. The MAC layer performs
   various OBS-specific functions, such as burst assembly, burst
   scheduling, and offset setting/traffic shaping While burst assembly and
   burst scheduling are relatively straightforward, we point out that the
   offset setting strategy has significant impact on the performance of IP
   network operating over OBS WDM core. We describe a shaping scheme to set
   the offset, an important system parameter for OBS, between the
   successive data bursts of a given data stream (label switched path) and
   their associated control packets. This scheme results in robust
   operation of the network and also facilitates traffic engineering.
   Guidelines are provided for implementing various IP QoS mechanisms in
   the optical backbone using OBS.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the catalytic and electrochemical characteristics of
   La(0.8)Sr(0.2)Cr(0.97)V(0.03)O(3) (LSCV). Catalytic properties of LSCV
   for the methane steam reforming have been carried out at 800 degreesC.
   This oxide exhibits a low activity. The most important fact is that no
   carbon deposit was detected. We have investigated electrochemical
   behaviour of a LSCV-YSZ composite (YSZ: yttria stabilised zirconia) in
   H(2)-H(2)O and in CH(4)-H(2)O atmosphere by impedance spectroscopy.
   Impedance diagrams are composed of two contributions at high-frequency
   (HF, typically 100 Hz) and at medium-frequency (MF, typically 1 Hz). At
   800 degreesC, the normalised value of the MF resistance is only
   three-times higher than that obtained with an optimised Ni-YSZ cermet.
   In fact, the large difference comes from the HF resistance which is
   lower for the Ni-YSZ cermet by a factor of 20. This could be explained
   by the microstructure of the interface of the LSCV-YSZ composite layer
   and the electrolyte pellet which has to be improved. In CH(4)-H(2)O, an
   additional semicircle at low-frequency (noted as LF, typically 0.1 Hz)
   is observed. This LF contribution might be associated with the catalytic
   rate of the steam reforming of methane reaction. Ruthenium, as a steam
   reforming catalyst, was added to the LSCV-YSZ electrode. At 800
   degreesC, in pure methane mixed with 5\% of steam, this anode material
   shows similar results to those observed in H(2)-H(2)O without ruthenium.
   Moreover, electrochemical behaviour was stable with time and no carbon
   deposit was detected after 100 h of operation. These results
   demonstrated that the gradual methane reforming can be implemented. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose. - Cryptococcus is an opportunistic infection that affects
   immunodepressed patients and is a classical complication of AIDS-stage
   HIV infection. The aim of this study was to investigate Cryptococcus
   neoformans infections in patients with hematological malignancies.
   Methods. - Six cases have been described of cryptococcosis detected in
   Nantes, France over the past 10 years in patients with hematological
   malignancies.
   Results. - This infection has been found particularly in the context of
   lymphoproliferative disorders (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenstrom
   macroglobulinemia, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), and
   also following cytotoxic therapy. In four cases, the patients were
   treated with fludarabine, which rapidly caused long-duration marked
   lymphocytopenia, notably in CD4 cells. Cell-mediated immunity plays a
   major role in systemic defense against C. neoformans. It therefore seems
   that fludarabine favors the spread of cryptococcal infections.
   Conclusion. - In the context of lymphoproliferative syndromes treated
   with cytotoxic drugs, in particular fludarabine, it appears important to
   fake into account the possible presence of cryptococcal infection in the
   presence of respiratory, neurological or cutaneous disorders, so that a
   correct diagnosis can be made and the appropriate treatment
   administered. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.}},

Abstract = {{The composition (\% relative abundance) of the benthic diatom community
   was studied in the littoral zone (0-5 m) of the NW and E coasts of the
   brackish, non-tidal Gulf of Riga, in the Baltic Sea. The samples were
   collected concomitantly with measurements of sediment primary
   productivity and chlorophyll a during three cruises, representing three
   seasons (autumn, spring, summer). At all depths, the living diatom
   community was dominated by epipsammic species, the most abundant taxa
   being Martyana atomus, a species of Fragilariaceae and Achnanthes
   delicatula. The community was characterized by a stable composition and
   a high species diversity throughout the study period (Shannon-Weaver,
   mean H' = 4.4). Principal Component Analyses (PCA), together with
   Redundancy Analysis (RDA) based on 129 taxa, revealed both spatial (site
   and depth) and seasonal differences in the diatom communities. However,
   these differences were mainly caused by the varying proportions of taxa
   common in both sampling areas in ail three seasons, rather than by
   actual major taxonomic changes in the species present in communities.
   The distribution of the typical epipsammic species along the depth
   gradient was not uni-directional. The dominance of attached life forms,
   and the absence of a well-developed epipelic community, reflects the
   physically dynamic substratum, particularly in the eastern part of the
   Gulf. As a result, primary productivity is kept rather low, decreasing
   rapidly with depth due to frequent turbidity of the water column.}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: Pleural tuberculosis (TB) is a diagnostic challenge
   because of its nonspecific clinical presentation and paucibacillary
   nature. The inefficiency of conventional laboratory methods and the
   reliance on pleural biopsy have motivated the evaluation of alternative
   diagnostic strategies. We have evaluated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   directed to the IS6110 sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the
   determination of adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity, and measurement of
   interferon (IFN)-gamma levels in pleural fluid in the diagnosis of
   pleural TB.
   Patients: ADA activity, IFN-gamma levels, and PCR were evaluated in 140
   cases of pleural effusion, 42 with confirmed pleural TB, 19 with
   probable pleural TB, 70 with a nontuberculous etiology, and 9 having an
   undetermined etiology.
   Results: ADA activity, IFN-gamma levels, and PCR were 88\%, 85.7\%, and
   73.8\% sensitive, respectively, and 85.7\%, 97.1\%, and 90\% specific,
   respectively, for pleural TB that had been confirmed by either culture
   or pleural biopsy specimens. The combination of PCR, IFN-gamma
   measurement, and ADA activity determination allowed the selective
   increase of sensitivity and specificity for probable and confirmed cases
   compared to individual methods. Positive and negative predictive values
   for these individual or combined methods were maintained over a wide
   range of prevalence of pleural TB in the patient population presenting
   with pleural effusions. Fever and younger age were associated with
   tuberculous pleural effusion (p < 0.0001), while blood in sputum and
   older age were associated with malignant etiology (p < 0.008).
   Conclusions: These clinical variables together with the use of ADA
   activity determination, PCR, and measurement of IFN-gamma levels provide
   the basis for the rapid and efficient diagnosis of pleural TB in
   different clinical settings.}},

Abstract = {{Stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct seems to be a key event for the
   development of congenital hydrocephalus. The causes of such a stenosis
   are not well known. Overholser et al, in 1954 (Anat Rec 120:917-933)
   proposed the hypothesis that a dysfunction of the subcommissural organ
   (SCO) leads to aqueductal stenosis and congenital hydrocephalus. The SCO
   is a brain gland, located at the entrance of the cerebral aqueduct, that
   secretes glycoproteins into the cerebrospinal fluid that, upon release,
   assemble into a fibrous structure known as Reissner's fiber (RF). By the
   permanent addition of new molecules to its rostral end, RF grows and
   extends along the aqueduct, fourth ventricle, and central canal of the
   spinal cord. The immunological blockage of the SCO-RF complex has been
   used to test Overholser's hypothesis. The following was the sequence of
   events occurring in pregnant rats that had been immunized with RF
   glycoproteins: the mother produced anti-RF antibodies and transferred
   them to the fetus through the placenta and to the pup through the milk,
   and the antibodies reached the brain of the fetus and pup and blocked
   the SCO-RF complex. This resulted in a permanent absence of RF that was
   followed by stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct, and then by the
   appearance of hydrocephalus. The latter was patent until the end of the
   6-month observation period. The chronic hydrocephalic state appeared, in
   turn, to induce new alterations of the SCO. It is concluded that a
   selective immunological knock out of the SCO-RF complex leads to
   hydrocephalus.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the consequences of monochromatic pupil apodisation in a
   filtergraph based on Fabry-Perot etalons in a telecentric mount, an
   effect which was discovered by Beckers (1998a). The pupil apodisation
   gives rise to systematic changes of the point spread function in tho
   presence of strong spectral gradients, like in the wings of a Fraunhofer
   line. These changes are likely to produce spurious velocity signals in
   Dopplergrams generated from high spatial resolution filtergrams of the
   solar surface. We include in our analysis for the first time the effects
   of optical phase changes on pupil apodisation which has the tendency to
   enhance velocity errors.
   We study the resolution and the velocity errors for the three-etalon
   filtergraph TESOS (Kentischer et al. 1998) at the Vacuum Tower Telescope
   on Tenerife. Peak to valley velocity errors for solar structure with
   sizes of 2 arcsec and less and a contrast of 15\% amount to less than 50
   m/s for the low resolution mode and to less than 10 m/s for the high
   resolution mode of TESOS ill the worst case. We conclude that the
   performance of TESOS is not severely compromised by pupil apodisation.}},

Abstract = {{The spherical tokamak (ST) has a very low aspect ratio, typically below
   similar to1.8, which allows operation at high beta. The ST also offers
   stability at high elongation which permits operation at high bootstrap
   current fraction leaving only a modest external current drive
   requirement. Results from START indicate the ST has resilience to
   disruptions and low halo currents when disruptions are triggered. In
   order to explore these potential advantages, a conceptual design of a
   steady-state ST power plant is being developed for which the
   thermodynamic, neutronic and mechanical design of the plant have been
   iterated, together with the plasma parameters, to give a consistent
   design. The baseline design uses water cooled copper for the centre rod
   and return limbs of the toroidal held (TF) coils with minimal steel
   shielding around the rod giving a simple coil design. A helium cooled
   ceramic pebble bed blanket with beryllium multiplier is used to generate
   the required tritium and achieve a high thermal efficiency. (C) 2000

   indicates that the majority (greater than or equal to 75\%) of the
   atmospheric column was located in the stratosphere. After a rapid
   increase within the first two hours after sunset the measured NO3 VCDs
   only slowly increase during the rest of the night. The NO3 VCDs (less

Abstract = {{The patch exploitation strategy of females of the insect parasitoid
   Trichogramma brassicae was studied on patches containing different
   proportions of hosts that were previously attacked by conspecific
   females. On average, T. brassicae females spent more time on patches of
   higher quality, and all patches were reduced to the same level of
   profitability before being left. This appeared to be in accordance to
   the optimal predictions of the Charnov Marginal Value Theorem. The
   proximate leaving mechanisms involved were analyzed by means of a Cox
   proportional hazards model. Each oviposition in a healthy host appeared
   to have an incremental influence on the patch residence time, whereas
   each rejection of a healthy host or of a host that was previously
   attacked by the same female (i.e., self-superparasitism) had a
   decremental effect. These patch leaving mechanisms did not change
   according to the quality of the patch the females were exploiting. A
   Monte Carlo simulation was developed around the results of the Cox
   regression model. The results suggest that this set of patch leaving
   rules seems to provide the females with a sufficient way to reach the
   predictions of the Charnov model. Among the different mechanisms
   involved, the incremental effect associated with each oviposition in a
   healthy host appeared to play the most important role. The relationship
   between the proximate mechanistic rules adopted by the females and the
   ultimate prediction of the Charnov model is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Three experiments (N = 68), using Wynn's procedure, tested 5-month-old
   infants' looking time reactions to correct and incorrect results of
   simple addition and subtraction transformations. The aim was to
   investigate both the robustness and the parameters of infants'
   arithmetic competence. Experiments 1 and 2 (N = 44) were replications of
   Wynn's first two experiments in which infants were shown addition (1 + 1
   = 1 or 2) and subtraction (2 - 1 = 1 or 2) requiring imprecise
   calculation. Experiment 3 (N = 24) was a subtraction counterpart (3 - 1
   = 1 or 2) to Wynn's third experiment requiring precise calculation of
   addition (1 + 1 = 2 or 3). Unlike Wynn, we found no systematic evidence
   of either imprecise or precise adding and subtracting in young infants.
   Our results, together with the mix of both positive and negative
   findings from other studies of infant arithmetic, suggest that infants'
   reactions to displays of adding and subtracting are variable and,
   therefore, that infants' numerical competencies are not robust. This
   conclusion is consistent with previous findings indicating that simple
   adding and subtracting develops gradually and continuously throughout
   infancy and early childhood.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{3-23}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The present study investigated electrocortical and cardiovascular
   reactivity during positive and negative emotion, and examined the
   relation of asymmetric frontal lobe activation to cardiovascular
   responses. Participants were 30 healthy, right-handed university
   students (mean age, 23.9; 60\% female; 76\% Caucasian).
   Electroencephalographic (EEG), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR)
   responses were assessed while subjects engaged in laboratory tasks
   (personally-relevant recall tasks and film clips) designed to elicit
   happiness or anger. Happiness-inducing tasks evoked more prominent left
   than right frontal EEG activation, and greater left frontal EEG
   activation than anger-inducing tasks. However, anger-inducing tasks
   were, on average, associated with comparable left and right frontal EEG
   activation. Irrespective of emotional valence, cardiovascular activation
   was more pronounced during personally-relevant recall tasks than during
   the viewing of film clips.
   During anger recall, both greater left frontal EEG response (r = - 0.46,
   P < 0.02) and greater right frontal EEG response (r = - 0.45, P < 0.02)
   were correlated significantly with increased HR reactivity during the
   task. In addition, a right lateralized frontal EEG response during
   anger-inducing tasks was associated with greater concomitant systolic BP
   (P < 0.03) and diastolic BP (P < 0.008) reactivity. Exploratory analyses
   also indicated that men who displayed a left lateralized frontal EEG
   response during happiness-inducing tasks showed the greatest concomitant
   systolic BP and HR reactivity (P's < 0.03). These findings suggest that
   asymmetric frontal EEG responses to emotional arousal may elicit
   different patterns of cardiovascular reactivity in healthy adults. (C)

Abstract = {{We describe new methods of denoising images that combine wavelet
   shrinkage with properties related to the statistics of quad-trees of
   wavelet transform values for natural images. They are called
   tree-adapted wavelet shrinkage (TAWS) methods. The shift-averaged
   version of TAWS produces denoisings that are comparable to state of the
   art denoising methods, such as cycle-spin thresholding and the
   cycle-spin version of the hidden Markov tree method. The nonshift
   averaged version of TAWS is superior to the classic wavelet shrinkage
   method, and fits naturally into a signal compression algorithm. These
   TAWS methods bear some relation to the recently proposed hidden Markov
   tree methods, but are deterministic rather than probabilistic. They may
   prove useful in settings where speed is critical and/or signal
   compression is required. (C) 2000 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{We sought to determine how the results of available randomized
   controlled trials of intravenous unfractionated heparin (UH) and
   low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) apply to unselected patients with
   unstable angina pectoris (UAP). Although UH is widely used in addition
   to aspirin for treatment of UAP, the evidence is weak for a net benefit
   over aspirin alone. LMWH preparations may confer a net benefit over UH
   for the treatment of UAP in clinical trials. It is not clear, however,
   how trial results are generalized to unselected patients with UAP, Using
   criteria from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Unstable
   Angina Clinical Practice Guideline, we identified 277 consecutive
   patients with primary UAP, Exclusion criteria were applied from 6 trials
   of UH in addition to aspirin and 5 trials of LMWH in addition to aspirin
   for the treatment of UAP. Clinical outcomes were compared among
   ineligible and eligible patients for trial enrollment. Patients meeting
   exclusion criteria were older and had more extensive coexisting medical
   illness than eligible patients for trial enrollment. Thirty-eight
   percent to 42\% of our study population met greater than or equal to1
   exclusion criteria for each of the 6 trials of UH, and 14\% to 46\% met
   greater than or equal to1 exclusion criteria for each of the 5 LMWH
   trials. The I-year all-cause death rate was higher in UH ineligible
   patients compared with UH eligible patients (16\% vs 4\%, p = 0.003) and
   in LMWH ineligible patients compared with LMWH eligible patients (16\%
   vs 7\%, p = 0.005). Thus, clinical trials of UH and LMWH may have
   limited generalizability to unselected patients with UAP, many of whom
   have characteristics that would exclude them from trial enrollment and
   put them at risk for adverse outcomes. (C)2000 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Tomato ringspot nepovirus RNA-1-encoded polyprotein (P1) contains the
   domains for the putative NTP-binding protein, VPS, BC-like protease and
   a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in its C-terminal region, The
   N-terminal region of P1, with a coding capacity for a protein (or a
   precursor) of 67 kDa, has not been characterized. Using partial cDNA
   clones, it is shown that the 3C-like protease can process the N-terminal
   region of P1 at a novel cleavage site in vitro, allowing the release of
   two proteins, X1 (located at the N terminus of pi) and X2 (located
   immediately upstream of the NTB domain). P1 precursors in which the
   protease was inactive or absent were not cleaved by exogenously added
   protease, suggesting that pi processing was predominantly in cis,
   Results from site-directed mutagenesis of putative cleavage sites
   suggest that dipeptides Q(423)/G and Q(620)/G are the X1-X2 and X2-NTB
   cleavage sites, respectively, The putative X1 protein contains a
   previously identified alanine-rich sequence which is present in
   nepoviruses but not in the related comoviruses. The putative X2 protein
   contains a region with similarity to the comovirus 32 kDa protease
   co-factor (the only mature protein released from the N terminus of
   comovirus pi polyproteins) and to the corresponding region of other
   nepovirus P1 polyproteins, These results raise the possibility that the
   presence of two distinct protein domains in the N-terminal part of the
   P1 polyprotein may be a common feature of nepoviruse.}},

Title = {{Hybrid algorithm for estimating true motion fields}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid algorithm is proposed for true motion field estimation. This
   algorithm consists of three steps: block-based initial motion
   estimation, image segmentation, and wrong-motion-vector detection and
   correction based on objects. The hierarchical block-matching algorithms
   are improved for the initial motion estimation. The improved algorithm
   uses an adaptive technique to propagate motion vectors between
   hierarchical levels. It produces accurate motion field everywhere,
   except in the areas of motion occlusion. In order to correct wrong
   motion vectors in the areas of motion occlusion, the current image is
   segmented into objects and an object-based method is proposed to process
   the estimated motion fields. With the object-based method, wrong-motion
   vectors are detected by approximating the estimated motion field in each
   object with a motion model, and are corrected using an object-adaptive
   interpolator. Experimental results show that the improved hierarchical
   block-matching algorithm outperforms the conventional hierarchical
   block-matching algorithms. The proposed algorithm results in dense
   motion fields that are smooth within every object, discontinuous between
   objects of different motion, and very close to the true motion fields,

Abstract = {{An outbreak of acute respiratory disease in Hendra, a suburb of
   Brisbane, Australia, in September 1994 resulted in the deaths of 14
   racing horses and a horse trainer. The causative agent was a new member
   of the family Paramyxoviridae, The virus was originally called Equine
   morbillivirus but was renamed Hendra virus (HeV) when molecular
   characterization highlighted differences between it and members of the
   genus Morbillivirus, Less than 5 years later, the closely related Nipah
   virus (NiV) emerged in Malaysia, spread rapidly through the pig
   population, and caused the deaths of over 100 people. We report the
   characterization of the HeV L gene and protein, the genome termini, and
   gene boundary sequences, thus completing the HeV genome sequence. In the
   highly conserved region of the L protein, the HeV sequence GDNE differs
   from the GDNQ found in almost all other nonsegmented negative-strand
   (NNS) RNA viruses. HeV has an absolutely conserved intergenic
   trinucleotide sequence, 3'-GAA-5', and highly conserved transcription
   initiation and termination sequences similar to those of respiroviruses
   and morbilliviruses, The large genome size (18,234 nucleotides), the
   unique complementary genome terminal sequences of HeV, and the limited
   homology with other members of the Paramyxoviridae suggest that HeV,
   together with NiV, should be classified in a new genus in this family.
   The large genome of HeV also fills a gap in the spectrum of genome sizes
   observed with NNS RNA virus genomes, As such, it provides a further
   piece in the puzzle of NNS RNA virus evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Segmental duplications on rice (Oryza sativa L.) chromosomes 8, 9, 11,
   and 12, were studied by examining the distributions of sequences
   resolved by 13 probes detecting multiple copies of DNA sequences. Four
   of the hybridization bands detected by a repetitive sequence probe,
   rTRS, were mapped to the ends of all the four chromosomes. Two or three
   of the bands detected by each of the other 12 probes were also mapped to
   different chromosomes. The bands detected by the same probe usually
   occurred in similar locations of different chromosomes. Loci detected by
   different DNA probes were often similarly arranged on different
   chromosomes. Chromosomes 8 and 9 showed colinearity of marker loci
   arrangement indicating a possible common origin. A segment on chromosome
   9 was also very similar to the previously reported duplicated fragments
   on the ends of chromosomes ii and 12 which were also detected in this
   study, indicating a likely common origin. Moreover, the various degrees
   of distributional similarity of the segments suggest a complex
   relationship among the chromosomes in the evolution of the rice genome.
   These results support the proposition that chromosome duplication and
   diversification may be a mechanism for the origin and evolution of the
   chromosomes in the rice genome.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to provide further understanding of physiologic and

   silica, asbestos, and coal dusts. Questionnaires and pulmonary functions
   tests were given to 220 silica, 277 asbestos, and 511 coal workers from
   three different industries in China. Posteroanterior chest radiographs
   were classified as stages 0, I, II, and III according to degree of
   parenchymal fibrosis. Significantly poorer pulmonary function and a
   higher prevalence of dyspnea and chronic cough were observed in workers
   with pneumoconiosis than those without, irrespective of dust type
   Workers with stages II and III silicosis herd worse pulmonary function
   and more common symptoms relative to workers with equivalent coal
   workers' pneumoconiosis or asbestosis. After adjusting for relevant
   confounders, reductions in the spirometric parameters and single breath
   diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) and the occurrence of
   respiratory symptoms were associated with increasing stage of silicosis,
   whereas lower DLco and the occurrence of symptoms were associated with
   increasing stage of asbestosis and coal workers' pneumoconiosis. The
   study suggests that despite the differences in degree and pattern due to
   exposure to different fibrogenic dusts, respiratory impairments of all
   of the workers are associated with the presence and progression of
   parenchymal fibrosis and smoking.}},

Abstract = {{The on-line preconcentration performance characteristics of a
   commercially available iminodiacetate resin (Toyopearl AF-Chelate 650M)
   were investigated. The method was optimized for several parameters,
   including buffer pH, rinsing of matrix salts from the resin, elution
   acid type and strength, and the nebulizer gas flow rate. An ammonium
   chloride buffer with a pH of 8.80 was mixed with the sample on-line
   prior to loading. This pH was found to be optimal for Mn, Cu, Cd and Pb,
   whereas a pH of greater than or equal to9.2 was optimal for Ni analysis.
   Column rinse experiments showed that both buffer and water reduce Na
   concentrations to <100<mu>M in the rinse solution within 3 min. It was
   also determined that using 1M HNO3 acid for column elution yielded
   higher intensities for Mn, Ni, Cu and Pb, while 1 M HCl yielded higher
   count rates for Cd. The change from the optimization solution, with a
   0.2\% HNO3 acid concentration, to the 10\% elution acid required a
   reduction in the nebulizer gas flow rate of 0.05 l min(-1) in order to
   obtain reduced blank intensity ratios. Calibrations performed using
   standard solutions (1 ml) with concentrations ranging from 0 to 10pg
   ml(-1) (ppt) resulted in regression coefficients of 0.990-0.998. Method
   detection limits of 1.1, 0.08, 0.47, 0.06 and 0.16 pg ml(-1) for Mn, Ni,
   Cu, Cd and Pb, respectively, were obtained. Accuracy was demonstrated by
   results from runs of the certified standard reference materials (SRMs),

   Design: Double-blind placebo-controlled prospective study design.
   Setting: An obstetrics/gynecological office specializing in infertility
   in an academic environment.
   Patient(s): Premenstrual women with laparoscopically diagnosed
   endometriosis who required GnRH agonist therapy for treatment and did
   not have significant depressive or premenstrual mood symptoms at
   baseline.
   Intervention(s): Participants were randomly assigned to either the
   sertraline treatment group or to the placebo group for the 3-month
   duration of the GnRH agonist therapy.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): The 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for
   Depression (HRSD), which is an instrument designed to assess depressive
   symptomatology.
   Result(s): A Hotellings T-2 test for repeated measure analysis indicated
   a statistically significant (P<.05) between-group difference across time

Abstract = {{An investigation of the effects of humidity and salt crystallisation on
   medieval masonry has been undertaken at the parish church of Walpole St
   Andrew, Norfolk? with the intention of establishing a relationship
   between changes in environmental conditions and levels of stone decay.
   Masonry within the church has been contaminated with sodium chloride
   salts, which are undergoing cycles of crystallisation/dissolution in
   response to fluctuations in relative humidity corresponding to the
   equilibrium relative humidity of the salt. The effects of these cycles
   have been determined by a combination of gravimetric analysis, ion
   chromatography, and qualitative assessment of deposited material.
   Appropriate remedial action, based on a combination of desalination
   techniques and environmental control, is put forward for discussion. (C)

   persisted after control for health insurance and socioeconomic status.
   Control for language ability, however, eliminated differences between

Abstract = {{A hallmark of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated carcinogenesis is
   the integration of the viral DNA into the cellular genome, usually
   accompanied by the loss of expression of the viral E2 gene. E2 binds to
   and represses the viral promoter directing expression of the E6 and E7
   oncogenes. The re-introduction and expression of exogenous E2 in
   HPV-positive cancer cells results in cellular growth arrest, while
   growth in the context of exogenous E2 can be restored through the
   expression of exogenous E6 and E7, Here we examine the individual
   contributions of the viral E6 and E7 genes to this phenotype, E6 alone
   displays moderate activity, whereas both E7 and adenovirus E1A display
   high activity in reversing E2-mediated cellular growth suppression.
   Using defined mutants of E7 and EIA, we show that an intact
   retinoblastoma interaction domain is required for this function. In
   addition, we show that the E2-mediated growth arrest of HPV-positive
   cells results in cellular senescence, and implicate the cyclin/cdk
   inhibitor p21(CIP) as a downstream E2 effector in this phenotype.}},

Journal = {{PLANTA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{211}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{846-854}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{During photomorphogenesis in higher plants, a coordinated increase
   occurs in the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents. The carotenoid level
   is tinder phytochrome control, as reflected by the light regulation of
   the mRNA level of phytoene synthase (PSY), the first enzyme in the
   carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. We investigated PSY protein levels,
   enzymatic activity and topological localization during
   photomorphogenesis. The results revealed that PSY protein levels and
   enzymatic activity increase during de-etiolation and that the enzyme is
   localized at thylakoid membranes in mature chloroplasts. However, under
   certain light conditions (e.g., far-rid light) the increases in PSY mRNA
   and protein levels are not accompanied by an increase in enzymatic
   activity. Under those conditions, PSY is localized in the prolamellar
   body fraction in a mostly enzymatically inactive form. Subsequent
   illumination of dark-gl-own and/or in far-red light grown seedlings with
   white light causes the decay of these structures and a topological
   relocalization of PSY to developing thylakoids which results in its
   enzymatic activation. This light-dependent mechanism of enzymatic
   activation of PSY in carotenoid biosynthesis shares common features with
   the regulation of the NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, the
   first light-regulated enzyme in chlorophyll biosynthesis. The mechanism
   of regulation described here may contribute to ensuring a spatially and
   temporally coordinated increase in both carotenoid and chlorophyll
   contents.}},

Abstract = {{Plants acclimate to changes in light quantity by altering leaf-cell
   development and the accumulation of chloroplast components, such that
   light absorption is favoured under limiting illumination, and light
   utilisation under non-limiting conditions. Previous evidence suggests an
   involvement of a high-light photosynthetic redox signal in the
   down-regulation of the accumulation of the light-harvesting complexes of
   photosystem II (Lhcb) and the expression of the Lhcb genes, and of a
   blue-light signal in the control of leaf development and in the increase
   in photosynthetic capacity, as affected by the accumulation of
   ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). We examined
   the internal anatomy of leaves, the ultrastructure of chloroplasts and
   accumulation of light-hal vesting complexes and Rubisco in wild-type
   Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. and in mutants in each of the three
   known blue-light photoreceptors, cryptochrome 1, cryptochrome 2 and
   phototropin, as well as a mutant in both cryptochromes. Our results
   indicate an extensive capacity of the Arabidopsis mesophyll cells to
   adapt to high light fluence rate with an increase in palisade
   elongation. Under high light, chloroplasts showed increased starch
   accumulation and reductions in the amount of granal thylakoids per
   chloroplast, in the proportion of chlorophyll b relative to chlorophyll
   a, and in the accumulation of the major Lhcb polypeptides. The responses
   were similar for all four mutants, with respect to their wild types. The
   results are consistent with either a complete redundancy in function
   between cryptochromes and phototropin, or their absence of involvement
   in the light-quantity responses tested. We observed minimal effects of
   light quantity on Rubisco accumulation over the range of fluence rates
   used, and conclude that elongation of palisade mesophyll cells and
   accumulation of Rubisco are controlled separately. This indicates that
   light acclimation must be the result of a number of individual
   elementary responses. Quantitative differences in the acclimatory
   responses were observed between the Landsberg erecta and Columbia
   wild-type ecotypes used.}},

Abstract = {{The personal exposure of children aged 9 - 11 years to particulate
   matter (PM10 and PM2.5) was carried out between January and September
   1997 in the London Borough of Barnet. Personal sampling along with home,
   garden and classroom microenvironmental monitoring was completed for all
   ten children. Each child was monitored for five days during winter,
   spring and summer. All children completed daily time activity diaries to
   provide information on any potential activities that could influence
   their exposure to particulate matter. Each evening a household activity
   questionnaire was also completed by the parents. Personal Environmental
   Monitors were used to sample personal exposure to PM10 and PM2.5.
   Harvard Impactors were used for the microenvironmental sampling of both
   size fractions. The children's mean personal exposure concentrations for
   PM10 during winter, spring and summer were 72, 54 and 35 mug/m(3)
   respectively and for PM2.5 22, 17 and 18 mug/m(3) respectively. In order
   to determine the potential sources of particulate matter, analysis of
   the Teflon filters has been undertaken. The physical characteristics of
   the particles have been identified using Scanning Electron Microscopy.
   The relationships between personal exposure concentrations and the
   different microenvironments will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Psychiatrists place great weight on impaired insight in
   schizophrenia, generally attributing it to pathological mental
   processes. However, denial of illness may be based on attitudes common
   in patients' social and cultural groups. Moreover, even where denial of
   illness has a pathological element, it may be affected by the social
   context. In this paper, we predicted that denial of illness would be
   associated with social distance between clinician and patient, and
   reduced by access to `normalizing' social interaction. Method: One
   hundred and fifty patients with schizophrenia in the London arm of the
   European Schizophrenia cohort were assessed using the `Awareness of
   Illness' (AI) subscale of David's Assessment of Insight. Clinical and
   social attributes were related to AI. Results: There was little evidence
   for our social distance hypotheses: there was little variation in AI by
   social class, ethnicity, membership of a drug taking culture or the
   presence of strongly held religious beliefs. However, there were strong
   relations between AI and the size of primary group, consistent with our
   normalizing hypothesis. Conclusions: The normalizing function of social
   support is in line with modern psychological models of delusion
   formation. Longitudinal data will eventually be available from the
   current study that will assist in establishing the causal direction of
   this association.}},

Abstract = {{Direct observations of pollinator visits to orchids are often difficult

   system where seed set is typically pollinator-limited. This lack of

   orchid-pollinator relationships and especially the degree of
   pollinator-specificity. Here we describe a molecular approach to the
   study of orchid-pollinator relationships based on the analysis of DNA
   recovered from pollinaria found on insects. The insects were collected
   from nectar-rich plants flowering near natural orchid populations, or
   taken from museum collections. Sequence analysis of the nuclear
   ribosomal ITS region allowed the identification of the orchid species or
   species-group from which the pollinaria originated. Four out of eight
   orchid-pollinator relationships established with this approach have not
   been reported previously, which highlights the value of molecular tools

Abstract = {{Reproduction in birds requires the input of time and energy during
   discrete breeding phases leading to investment trade-offs between laying
   date, clutch size, body mass, and incubation constancy. We investigated
   costs during incubation by experimentally enlarging 25 clutches of
   white-tailed ptarmigan Lagopus leucurus. The experiment was conducted in
   2 years, one with harsh weather that forced a natural delay in
   reproduction. When forced to delay egg-laying, females began incubation
   with poorer bed; condition and foraged more during incubation. Rates of
   mass loss during incubation were not affected by clutch enlargement, and
   did not differ between harsh and benign years; however, females that
   were heavier at the start of incubation lost more mass than lighter
   females. Clutch-enlarged females had reduced nest attendance compared to
   control birds in both years and incubation periods increased by up to 2
   days relative to controls. In the harsh year, there was a trend for
   clutch-enlarged females to have lower nest success, but there was no
   effect on overwinter survival. Different behavioral responses by females
   in the 2 years showed that incubation costs may depend on other factors
   such as female quality, food supply, or weather conditions. Incubation
   is a dynamic period during which birds may adjust energy balances by
   varying body condition and food intake.}},

   mapping of TEL-AML1 from an additional 11 patients and, using Monte
   Carlo statistical methods, have analyzed the intronic distribution of
   the 24 TEL-AML1 fusion junctions sequenced to date. Compared to a null
   hypothesis of random breakpoint allocation within TEL intron 5 and AML1
   introns 1 and 2, significant microclustering was evident on both TEL and
   AML1. In contrast to previous reports, the two strongest microclusters
   on TEL were 3' to an unstable repeat region. AML1 demonstrated four
   highly significant microclusters, two Of which were proximal to exons.
   We note the necessity of sequencing multiple breakpoints before the
   description of putative microcluster regions. TEL-AML1 breakpoints may
   be distributed into microclusters because of specific DNA sequence or
   chromatin features in susceptible cells. We also report on additional
   features of breakpoints, including a complex t(12;3;21) in one patient
   and an inverted sequence in another. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Data from a hydrographic section carried out in January-March 1994
   offshore from the eastern coast of South America from 50S to 10N, are
   used to quantify the full-depth exchanges of water between the western
   boundary currents and the ocean interior. In the upper and intermediate
   layers, the westward transport associated with the southern branch of
   the South Equatorial Current was 49 Sv at the time of the cruise. The
   transports of the central and northern branches in the upper 200 m were
   17 Sv and 12 Sv, respectively. After subtraction of the parts that
   recirculate in the subtropical, subequatorial, and equatorial domains,
   the fraction of the South Equatorial Current that effectively
   contributes to the warm water export to the North Atlantic is estimated
   at 18 Sv. The poleward boundary of the current southern branch is at 31S
   through the whole thickness of the subtropical gyre, but the latitude of
   the northern boundary varies from 7 degrees 30'S at the surface to 27S
   at 1400 m depth. The estimated latitude of its bifurcation into the
   Brazil Current and North Brazil Undercurrent also varies downward from
   about 14S at the surface to 28S at a depth of 600 m.
   In the North Atlantic Deep Water, eastward flows exceeding 10 Sv are
   observed at 3 degrees -4 degrees of latitude in both hemispheres, at
   10S, and at 34S-30S. Between 4S and 17S, a net westward flow with an
   estimated transport of 19 Sv reinforces the southward deep western
   boundary current. Cyclonic circulations of Antarctic Bottom Water along
   the western boundaries of the Argentine and Brazil basins have
   amplitudes of 15 Sv and 13 Sv, respectively, exceeding those of the
   interbasin exchanges. The net alongshore transport of this water mass
   between the hydrographic section and the continental slope reverses to a
   southward direction from 13S to 27S, probably in relation with an
   eastward shift of the equatorward near-bottom boundary current at these
   latitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Phase III trials from registration files of cardiovascular drugs were
   analyzed to study the inclusion of patients with concomitant morbidity
   and medication. For this purpose, 15 drugs were selected which were
   registered in the Netherlands during the period 1985-1994 for the
   indications hypertension, angina pectoris, hypercholesterolemia, or
   myocardial infarction. The results show that preregistration trials are
   performed in populations which present with comorbidity and
   comedication. Cardiovascular, endocrine, and metabolic diseases were the
   most prevalent coexisting diseases. Large variation was found between
   registration files in the reporting of data and in patterns of
   comorbidity. Differences in mean comorbidity and comedication per
   patient were found between trials performed in different regions. The
   impact of various definitions of patient selection criteria on the
   actual inclusion of patients with coexisting morbidity was analyzed.
   Differences in definitions resulted in different levels of inclusion.
   Also, trials were found to include patients when this was not allowed
   and vice versa. The results are discussed in relation to the question of
   whether the generalizability of preregistration trials can be enhanced
   by further utilization of data from these heterogeneous populations. The
   issue to study is variability between safety and efficacy in patient
   groups with different patterns of comorbidity and comedication. In order
   to allow registration authorities to consider patterns of comorbidity
   and comedication during the evaluation of registration files,
   development of guidelines for uniform reporting of data in
   preregistration trials is recommended. Drug Dev. Res. 51:159-168, 2000.

Abstract = {{The role of renin-angiotensin system polymorphisms as risk factors for
   coronary heart disease (CHD) is controversial. This study investigated
   their role in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
   (FH). Polymorphism frequencies for angiotensin-I- converting enzyme
   insertion/deletion (ACE I/D), angiotensinogen M235T, and angiotensin-II

   and 72 patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia, of whom 26.7\% and
   41.6\%, respectively, had established CHD. None of the polymorphisms
   were associated with risk of CHD in patients with polygenic

Abstract = {{soilless container media have almost no capacity to retain PO4 or K. The
   nutrient retention of two calcined clays, attapulgite and arcillite, and
   brick chips, precharged with PO4 and K, was investigated. These could
   serve as an alternative slow-release fertilizer when incorporated into a
   soilless medium as a component of the mix. Sorption curves were
   developed at 25 degreesC for attapulgite of two particle sizes (0.8 to
   1.6 mm and 1.6 to 3.2 mm), arcillite (1.1 to 3.2 mm), screened pieces of
   brick (1.0 to 3.6 mm), and a medium of 7 sphagnum peat : 3 perlite (v/v)
   using solutions of KH2PO4 (P at 0 to 20,000 mg(.)L(-1)), Curves
   indicated that PO4 and K sorption were similar for both particle sizes
   of attapulgite, so only the larger size {[}1.6 to 3.2 mm (8 to 16 mesh)]
   was used in greenhouse studies. Materials were evaluated in greenhouse
   studies by growing `Sunny Mandalay' chrysanthemum {[}Dendranthema
   xgrandiflora Kitam, (syn, Chrysanthemum xmorifolium Ramat.)]. The
   precharged materials were tested at 10\%, 20\%, and 30\% by volume of a
   peat : perlite root medium. Phosphate, K, and pH were determined on
   unaltered medium solutions collected throughout the cropping cycle and
   foliar analyses were determined on tissue collected at midcrop and end
   of the crop. Data indicated that precharged calcined clays retained and
   released PO4, and to some degree K, over time. Precharged clays did not
   provide K at levels which met plant needs during the latter half of the
   cropping cycle, but it was released and used at appreciable levels
   during the first month of crop production. Growth of plants receiving
   PO4 solely from precharged attapulgite and arcillite at 20 \% of the
   medium volume was not significantly different from that of a commercial
   control when the leaching fraction was maintained at 0.2, However,
   release of PO4 from the brick chips was not enough to match plant
   demand. Phosphate lost through leaching from the precharged clays was
   reduced by about two-thirds compared to control plants fertilized with P
   at 46.5 mg(.)L(-1) from water-soluble fertilizer at each watering.}},

   induces a strong spin-orbit coupling such that triplet state emission

   Throughout the series we find the S-1-T-1 (singlet-triplet) energy
   splitting to be independent of the spacer R, such that the T-1 state is
   always 0.7 +/-0.1 eV below the S-1 state. With decreasing optical gap,

Abstract = {{Alumina coatings, 60-mum thick (HV10g 647 +/- 144 kg mm(-2)), were
   deposited using a novel sol-gel technique on 6061 Al. The samples were
   subjected to dry sliding wear tests against hard bearing steel balls
   (SAE 52100 steel) and softer mild steel pins (AISI 1018 steel) at
   different sliding speeds and contact loads. Wear at low contact loads
   and sliding speeds was characterized by steel oxide (Fe2O3) transfer to
   the coating. Coating rupture arose at a critical transition boundary of
   sliding contact loads and speeds which were approximately twice as high
   for mild steel as against the harder bearing steel. The coated alloy was
   also subjected to abrasive wear against SiC abrasives of increasing
   coarseness. Coating wear rates approached those of the substrate alloy
   as the indentation depth increased. A similar reduction in coating
   hardness was observed for Vickers diamond pyramid indentations at
   greater depths. When abrasion indentation depths were greater than
   similar to 20\% of the coating thickness, a rapid degradation in wear
   resistance arose and the same effect was seen for scratch test
   indentation depths. The use of normalizing parameters for sliding wear,
   hardness, abrasive wear and indentation depth were found to be useful in
   interpreting coating wear performance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

   is based on immigrant Generational Status-Canadian (GS-C). The data were
   analyzed according to both the race/ethnicity and GS-C schemes. Results
   indicated that GS-C differentiated meaningful significant differences on

Abstract = {{Fluoxetine HCl was prepared by seven different synthetic routes, all
   previously reported. The major impurities in each route were identified
   by GC/MS, HPLC/MS, and gradient HPLC analysis. Impurities were
   classified as being derived from impurities in 4-chlorobenzotrifluoride,
   those arising during the SNAr reaction of this compound and
   3-methylamino-1-phenylpropanol, and those arising during the synthesis
   of this alcohol. Fifteen impurities belonging to the latter two
   categories were identified, and their structures were confirmed by
   synthesis of authentic material for most of the compounds. It was found
   that a variety of analytical tools was needed for complete
   characterization of the impurity profile of fluoxetine HCl and that
   purification of the intermediate and recrystallization of the drug
   itself are highly effective in minimizing the levels of the impurities.}},

   Methods: This retrospective study on 398 couples analyzed

   and quality of retrieved oocytes, as well as pregnancy outcome according
   to three groups of BMI values: BMI < 20, 20 <less than or equal to> BMI
   < 25 and BMI <greater than or equal to> 25 kg/ml.
   Results: The prevalence of underweight and overweight women was 21.8\%

   hormone-luteinizing hormone increased significantly according to BMI.
   Art increase in the mean number of consummated gonadotropin ampoules

Abstract = {{Objective: Angioaccess for hemodialysis in an extremity with
   disadvantaged venous outflow has reduced long-term patency. We
   hypothesized that arteriovenous bridge graft patency could be improved
   in patients with disadvantaged venous outflow by preoperative venous
   duplex mapping.
   Methods: The charts of 114 patients who underwent 115 prosthetic
   arteriovenous bridge grafts were reviewed. Disadvantaged venous outflow
   was defined on the basis of any combination of prior arteriovenous
   bridge graft, multiple venipunctures, and clinical examination. Patients
   were grouped according to the presence or absence of disadvantaged
   venous outflow. Three groups were analyzed: those with normal venous
   outflow who had an initial arteriovenous bridge graft (NML), those with
   disadvantaged venous outflow who had only a clinical examination before
   redo arteriovenous bridge graft (REDO/DVO), and those with disadvantaged
   venous outflow who underwent preoperative duplex scanning venous
   evaluation (MAP/DVO). Life table primary and secondary 12-month patency
   rates were compared by means of log-rank analysis.
   Results: Life table analysis yielded 6-month primary patency rates of
   65.9\% +/- 5.7\%, 66.4\% +/- 7.3\%, and 43.8\% +/- 10.9\% for NML,
   MAP/DVO, and REDO/DVO, respestively. The secondary patency rates at 6
   months for NML (91.9\% +/- 3.4\%) and MAP/DVO (91.1\% +/- 4.9\%) were
   statistically equivalent, and both were significantly better than the
   patency for REDO/DVO (75.0\% +/- 10.0\%; P = .004 and P = .04,
   respectively). This trend persisted beyond 12 months.
   Conclusion: Preoperative evaluation of venous anatomy in patients with
   disadvantaged venous outflow results in an arteriovenous bridge graft
   patency comparable to that seen in patients undergoing initial
   arteriovenous bridge grafts. Vein mapping improves arteriovenous bridge
   graft durability in the patient with disadvantaged venous outflow by
   allowing the surgeon to select venous return that is in direct
   continuity with the central venous system.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have been made on transport rates and separation of propionic
   over acetic acid by the solution-diffusion type pertraction in a
   multimembrane hybrid system (MHS). The membrane system has been composed
   of two hydrophilic, strongly basic or acidic, polymer membranes
   separated by a hydrophobic bulk liquid membrane. Separation of propionic
   and acetic acids from their aqueous solutions (0.1-0.8 M) or real
   fermentation broth has been studied. Experimentally observed mass
   transfer coefficients (k) range from 3.5 x 10(-6) to 1.5 x 10(-5) cms
   with the higher values for propionic acid. In the case of fermented
   broth the fluxes were found to depend on its pH and the pretreatment of
   the feed. The selectivity SELAAPA evaluated as the ratio of propionic
   and acetic acid fluxes can attain values ranging from 3.5 to 5.5. The
   overall transport mechanism is consistent with a solution-diffusion
   mechanism typical for liquid membranes operating without a carrier. The
   fluxes and selectivity of the membrane system in respect to acetic and
   propionic acid have been found to depend on the viscosity of liquid
   membrane phase and solubility parameters characterizing both acids and
   solvents. A model based on fundamental physicochemical properties of the
   permeants and solvents (diffusion coefficients, solubility parameters
   and molar volumes) has been elaborated, and experimentally verified. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important complication in
   blunt trauma patients. At our Level I trauma center, we had a deep
   venous thrombosis (DVT) rate of 3.2\% from 1993 to 1997 despite an
   aggressive VTE prophylaxis program. During this time period, we placed
   vena caval filters (VCF) for both traditional and prophylactic
   indications. This project was developed to establish a VCF registry for
   trauma patients to determine the long-term complications of VCF
   placement.
   Methods: A letter was sent to all trauma patients who had a VCF placed
   from 1993 through 1997, Patients were asked to return for a history and
   physical examination to detect signs and symptoms related to VTE, a
   duplex ultrasound of the inferior vena cava, and a plain abdominal
   radiograph to determine filter migration,
   Results: There were 191 VCFs inserted in our trauma population from 1993
   to 1997, There were 105 patients (75 male and 30 female) available for
   evaluation, with a mean follow-up of 28.9 months, Forty-one VCFs were
   placed in patients with DVT or pulmonary embolism, and 64 were placed in
   patients for prophylactic indications as per the guidelines developed by
   the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma. There were no
   clinically identifiable complications related to insertion of the VCF,
   There were no pulmonary embolisms detected after VCF insertion. In
   follow-up, only one filter (0.95\%) migrated, and this was minimal (1 cm
   cephalad), One (0.95\%) vena cava was occluded, based on duplex
   ultrasonography, and 11 patients (10.4\%) had signs or symptoms of leg
   swelling after hospital discharge. Twenty eight (44\%) of the 64
   patients with prophylactic VCFs developed a DVT after filter placement.
   Conclusion: VCFs placed in trauma patients have acceptable short- and
   longterm complication rates. Consideration should be given to
   prophylactic VCF placement in patients at high risk for VTE, Randomized
   controlled trials are needed to evaluate whether VCF insertion increases
   the risk for subsequent DVT.}},

Abstract = {{Feedstuffs for pet birds should not only be assessed by their chemical
   composition, but also by the hygienic status. On the occasion the pet
   owner has different opportunities to detect hygienic lacks. Either
   opening a new packet differences are recognized between actual and
   earlier rank or the new rank leads to problems (i.e. a reduced feed
   intake). This situation requires a quick reaction (complaint of the
   bought feedstuff) and so the feed should be assessed by the owner or
   veterinarian at the face or send to a specialized laboratory.
   In general a possible spoilage leads to different changes of the
   concerned feedstuffs, that should be offered restricted (i.e. feeding as
   soon as possible) or not at all (due to detrimental effects on health or
   performance of the birds).
   The hygiene quality of feedstuffs is characterized by load
   microorganisms (bacteria, moulds, yeasts), contamination by toxins
   (formed by moulds and bacteria) and pests (insects, mites).}},

   concentration was 4.9 ng/ml before TURP and was subsequently reduced to
   0.6 ng/ml after 48 months. There was a steady decrease of the PSA
   concentration during the observation period. In contrast in patients who
   subsequently developed a CaP, the median PSA concentration before TURP
   was 6.8 ng/ml and was reduced to only 2.2 ng/ml after 48 months. PSA
   levels started to rise before CaP was diagnosed. Conclusion: After a
   TURP with a benign histopathologic specimer)PSA levels decrease steadily
   to values below 2 ng/ml. In case these patients demonstrate a rising PSA
   in the follow-up after partial prostatectomy, a CaP should be ruled out.}},

Title = {{Intrathecal cyclooxygenase inhibitor administration attenuates morphine
   antinociceptive tolerance in rats}},

Abstract = {{Several lines of evidence suggest that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
   (NMDA) and nitric oxide (NO) systems are involved in morphine tolerance.
   Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors may also play a role in morphine
   tolerance by interacting with both systems. In the present study, we
   examined the effects of the COX inhibitors
   N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl) methanesulphonamide (NS-398, selective
   COX2 inhibitor) and indomethacin (non-selective COX inhibitor) on the
   development of antinociceptive tolerance of morphine in a rat spinal
   model. The antinociceptive effect was determined by the tail-flick test.
   Tolerance was induced by injection of morphine 50 mug intrathecally
   (i.t.) twice daily for 5 days. The effects of NS-398 and indomethacin on
   morphine antinociceptive tolerance were examined after administering
   these drugs i.t. 10 min before each morphine injection. Neither NS-398
   nor indomethacin alone produced an antinociception effect at doses up to
   40 mug. NS-398 and indomethacin did not enhance the antinociceptive
   effect of morphine in naive and morphine-tolerant rats. However, they
   shifted the morphine antinociceptive dose-response curve to the left
   when coadministered with morphine during tolerance induction, and
   reduced the increase in the ED50 of morphine (dose producing 50\% of the
   maximum response) three- to four-fold. Collectively, these findings and
   previous studies suggest that COX may be involved in the development of
   morphine tolerance without directly enhancing its antinociceptive
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{The phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit contains a
   methyl ester on its C-terminus, which in mammalian cells is added by a
   specific carboxyl methyltransferase and removed by a specific carboxyl
   methylesterase. We have identified genes in yeast that show significant
   homology to human carboxyl methyltransferase and methylesterase.
   Extracts of wild-type yeast cells contain carboxyl methyltransferase
   activity, while extracts of strains deleted for one of the
   methyltransferase genes, PPM1, lack all activity. Mutation of PPM1
   partially disrupts the PP2A holoenzyme in vivo and ppm1 mutations
   exhibit synthetic lethality with mutations in genes encoding the B or B'
   regulatory subunit. Inactivation of PPM1 or overexpression of PPE1, the
   yeast gene homologous to bovine methylesterase, yields phenotypes
   similar to those observed after inactivation of either regulatory
   subunit. These phenotypes can be reversed by overexpression of the B
   regulatory subunit. These results demonstrate that Ppm1 is the sole PP2A
   methyltransferase in yeast and that its activity is required for the
   integrity of the PP2A holoenzyme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a new hierarchical evolutionary algorithm that
   combines binary encoding and Boating-point encoding to automatically
   select the beam directions and determine the weights of the selected
   beams. With traditional optimization methods the beam directions are
   fixed a priori by the operator in recognition of the fact that computer
   selection of beam directions is a difficult problem. In this
   investigation, we used a hybrid-encoding scheme. The binary encoding
   part of each chromosome was used to select the beam directions, and its
   corresponding floating-point encoding part of the same chromosome was
   used to determine the weights of those selected beams. Before beginning
   the optimization process, we set a constraint on the number of the beam
   directions we wanted in the final solution. We present three examples to
   verify this method. These examples differ with each other in tumor
   sites, problem sizes, and optimization parameters. Three-dimensional
   optimization results and statistical data showed that this method is
   feasible. We think this method can be easily extended to solve more
   complex target problems (such as nonconvex target problems). (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A novel implementation of x-ray shadow microscopy or x-ray absorption
   microscopy for analytical purposes has been developed. When using a
   microfocus x-ray source (with an energy lower than 30 keV) for x-ray
   shadow microscopy, i.e. microradiography or microtomography, the
   measured intensities are directly related to the spectral feature of the
   incident x-ray beam. In this paper, we describe in a theoretical way the
   problem of quantitation without the use of any x-ray spectrometer, and
   we present an experimental application on standard specimens (binary and
   ternary sample). We show that only the spectral distribution of the
   x-ray source used and the spectral response of the imaging sensor are
   needed to solve the question of quantification. The accuracy of the
   method, and, more particularly, the potential improvements of the
   current method are discussed at length. Academic users may obtain the

Abstract = {{The research studied the concentration variation of peroxynitrite anion
   (O=N-O-O-) released from cultured neonatal myocardial cells induced by

   the injury. For this purpose, amperometry peroxynitrite
   ultramicrosensors (UMS) were fabricated and constructed by
   electropolymerizing inorganic macromolecular film of
   tetraaminophthalocyanine manganese(II) and coating chemically with
   poly(4-vinylpyridine). Under optimum conditions, the UMS showed high
   selectivity and sensitivity to peroxynitrite determination with a
   calculated detection limit of 1.8 x 10(-8) mol/L (S/N of 3). The
   detection of peroxynitrite was based on electrocatalytic reduction of
   peroxynitrite. The mechanism of catalysis was also discussed. The UMS
   should be promising for in vivo measurement of peroxynitrite without
   interference or fouling. Peroxynitrite released from myocardial cells
   both in the ischemic period and in the reperfusion period was measured
   directly. This approach may lead to important information for myocardial

Abstract = {{Plasmon energies near a cubic-ZrO2 (c-ZrO2)/alpha-Al2O3 interface were
   studied by electron energy loss spectroscopy using a field-emission
   transmission electron microscope. The plasmon energies measured by
   scanning an electron probe of 1 nm in diameter across the interface
   showed that, approaching the interface, the plasmon energy of c-ZrO2
   increases from 23.9 to 24.3 eV and that of alpha-Al2O3 decreases from
   24.3 to 23.4 eV. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy revealed that
   fluctuation of the chemical composition across the interface is small
   (less than or equal to 5\%) and causes only a slight change in the
   plasmon energies (less than or equal to 0.16 eV). We conclude that the
   large energy changes (up to 0.9 eV) are mainly caused by lattice
   distortion. Using the Drude model, it was found that, 3 nm from the
   interface, the unit cell volume of c-ZrO2 decreases by 3\% and that of
   alpha-Al2O3 increases by 6\% compared with the volumes at 50 nm. The
   presence of lattice distortion near the interface was also confirmed by
   the convergent-beam electron diffraction method. The results show that
   plasmon loss is useful to evaluate lattice distortion. (C) 2000 American

Abstract = {{PROBLEM: Our previous study indicated that meconium-stained amniotic
   fluid (turbid AF) possessed a potent chemotactic activity for
   leukocytes, which may be dependent on interleukin-8. It is not known,
   however, whether meconium itself possesses this chemotactic activity.
   METHOD OF STUDY: Meconium samples were collected from mature neonates
   with and without turbid AF. A 5\% meconium suspension in phosphate
   buffered saline was prepared and measured for its chemotactic activity
   for leukocytes using the blind well chamber technique. Concentrations of
   IL-8, TNF alpha and IL-1 beta were also measured with ELISA.
   RESULTS: The number of leukocytes that migrated to the meconium
   suspension (35 +/- 27) was comparable with that of the clear AF (31 +/-
   37), but was significantly lower than that of the turbid AF (184 +/- 62,
   P < 0.0001). The meconium suspension contained much lower levels of
   IL-8, TNF<alpha> and IL-1 beta than the turbid AF.
   CONCLUSIONS: Meconium itself exhibits a lower chemotactic activity for
   polymorphonuclear leukocytes than turbid AF in vitro. The leukocyte
   chemotactic activity of turbid AF does not originate from meconium
   itself.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of genistein and daidzein on protein synthesis in
   osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro was investigated to determine a
   cellular mechanism by which the isoflavones stimulate bone formation.
   Cells were cultured for 48 h in alpha -minimal essential medium
   containing either vehicle, genistein (10(-7)-10(-5) M) or daidzein
   (10(-7)-10(-5) M). The 5,500 g supernatant of cell homogenate was used
   for assay of protein synthesis with {[}H-3]leucine incorporation in
   vitro. The culture with genistein or daidzein caused a significant
   elevation of protein synthesis in the cell homogenate. The effect of
   genistein (10(-5) M) or daidzein (10(-5) M) in elevating protein
   synthesis was significantly prevented, when cells were cultured for 48 h
   in a medium containing either actinomycin D (10(-7) M) or cycloheximide
   (10(-6) M) in the absence or presence of isoflavones. Moreover, when
   genistein (10(-7)-10(-5) M) or daidzein (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) was added
   to the reaction mixture containing the cell homogenate obtained from
   osteoblastic cells cultured without isoflavone, protein synthesis was
   significantly raised. This increase was markedly blocked by the addition
   of cycloheximide (10(-7) M). In addition, {[}H-3]leucyl-tRNA synthetase
   activity in the cytosol of osteoblastic cells was significantly
   increased by the addition of genistein (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) or daidzein
   (10(-5) M) into the enzyme reaction mixture. The present study
   demonstrates that genistein or daidzein can stimulate protein synthesis
   in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. The isoflavones may have a stimulatory
   effect on osteoblastic bone formation due to increasing protein
   synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{We radiographically evaluated the response of primary lesions to
   chemotherapy in 101 patients with inoperable advanced gastric cancer.
   The median survival time in the 50 responders (49.5\%) was 379 days, as
   compared with only 210 days in the 51 non-responders (50.1\%) (p<0.001).
   Morphologic changes of the gastric mucosa were assessed endoscopically.
   Among the changes observed, we focused on regenerative mucosa and its
   relation to response and survival. Regenerative mucosa was seen in 56
   (55\%) of the 101 patients. The regenerative mucosa was examined
   endoscopically and classified into four patterns: flat, radial, granular
   and cobble-stone. Biopsy specimens were taken from the regenerative
   mucosa and examined histopathologically. The response to chemotherapy
   was found to be closely associated with the incidence of regenerative
   mucosa. In particular, a flat or radial pattern significantly correlated
   with a positive response to treatment (p=0.004) and was associated with
   significantly longer survival than granular or cobblestone pattern or no
   regenerative mucosa (p<0.001). Flat or radial pattern was also
   associated with low tumor-positive rate of biopsy specimens. We conclude
   that endoscopic evaluation of regenerative mucosa in patients with
   inoperable advanced gastric cancer who receive chemotherapy can provide
   useful information in the assessment of response and prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of A-site compound substitution on the
   structures and propel ties of Ca-0.8 (MCe)(0.1)Bi4Ti4O15 (M denotes Li,
   Na and K) ceramics. The samples were prepared by the conventional
   ceramic technique. Sintering characteristics of
   Ca-0.8(MCe)(0.1)Bi4Ti4O15 and CaBi4Ti4O15 ceramics were discussed. X-ray
   powder diffraction patterns of the three modified CBT-based compounds
   show a single phase of bismuth oxide layer type structure with nz = 4.
   The hysteresis loops of polarization versus electric field of the four
   compounds were also measured. A-site compound substitution improves the
   piezoelectric properties and the high-temperature resistivity of these
   materials. A-site (LiCe) and (KCe) substitution not only improves the
   Curie temperature but also decreases the temperature coefficient of
   dielectric constant (T K epsilon). Among the three modified ceramics,
   only the Curie temperature of Ca-0.8(NaCe)(0.1)Bi4Ti4O15 is lower than
   that of CaBi4Ti4O15; however, its T K epsilon is the lowest. As a
   result, all the three modified CBT-based ceramics were found to be
   excellent high-temperature piezoelectric materials.}},

Abstract = {{Passive acoustic emission (AE) methods are becoming useful tools for
   integrity assessment of structures, monitoring of industrial processes
   and machines, and materials characterization. Unfortunately there are no
   measurement standards for estimating the absolute strength of the AE
   sources. The lack of standardization makes it very difficult to compare
   the results obtained in different laboratories or on different
   structures, and to obtain meaningful repeatability of measurements.
   Therefore, current methods only give a qualitative rather than
   quantitative indication of the change of state of structure or process.
   This communication outlines a way of calibrating AE transducer systems
   in situ using a pulsed-laser-generated thermoelastic AE energy source or
   a bouncing-ball-generated elastic impact AE energy source. The methods
   presented here should enable traceable measurement standards to be
   established for AE.}},

Abstract = {{Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is an effective
   modulation technique for high-rate and high-speed transmission over
   frequency selective fading channels. However, OFDM systems can be
   extremely sensitive and vulnerable to synchronization errors. In this
   paper, we present a scheme for performing timing recovery that includes
   symbol synchronization and sampling clock synchronization in OFDM
   systems. The scheme is based on pilot subcarriers, In the scheme, we use
   a path time delay estimation method to improve the accuracy of the
   correlation-based symbol synchronization methods, and use a delay-locked
   loop (DLL) to do the sampling clock synchronization. It is shown that by
   using this scheme, the mean square values of the symbol timing
   estimation error can be decreased by several orders of magnitude
   compared to the common correlation methods in both the AWGN and
   multipath fading channels. In addition, the scheme can track the symbol
   timing drift caused by the sampling clock frequency offsets.}},

Abstract = {{The class Steiner minimal tree problem is an extension of the standard
   Steiner minimal tree problem in graphs, motivated by the problem of wire
   routing in the area of physical design of very large scale integration
   (VLSI). This problem is NP-hard, even if there are no Steiner nodes and
   the graph is a tree; moreover, there exists no polynomial time
   approximation algorithm with a constant bound on the relative error
   under the hypothesis that P not equal NP {[}16]. Hence, fast and good
   heuristic algorithms are needed in practice. In this paper, we present
   an integer programming formulation of the problem. Using Lagrangean
   relaxation and subgradient optimization, we derive a lower bound. In
   order to test the lower bound, we present a procedure for generating
   test problems for the class Steiner minimal tree problem that have known
   optimal solutions. The computational experiments for the test problems
   demonstrate that the lower bound is very tight and differs from the
   optimal solutions by only a few percent on average for sparse graphs.}},

Abstract = {{Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis
   characterized by increased serum IgA and IgA-dominant immune complex
   deposition in lesions. The involvement of IgA implies a probable role
   for TGF-beta, a major factor in IgA production, in the pathogenesis of
   HSP. Among IgA antibodies, serum IgA anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL)
   have been found in many diseases, including vasculitis. In addition to
   the clinical presentations and laboratory parameters, we further
   investigated the roles of IgA aCL and TGF-beta in childhood HSP.
   Twenty-six Chinese children with the diagnosis of HSP were enrolled.
   Blood samples from these patients were collected at both acute and
   convalescent stages. Intracellular staining of lymphocytes was performed
   to enumerate type 1 (interferon-gamma-secreting), type 2
   (IL-4-secreting), and type 3 (TGF-beta -secreting) helper T cells. Serum
   levels of TGF-beta were detected by ELISA. Serum IgA aCL of 21 of 26
   patients at the acute stage, 11 of them at the convalescent stage, were
   measured by ELISA. The data showed that IgA aCL serum levels were
   significantly elevated in patients compared with healthy controls (P <
   0.001), and those patients at the convalescent stage (P < 0.001). In
   addition, TGF-beta -secreting T cells were significantly elevated during
   the acute stage, and decreased at the convalescent stage. Although more
   studies are needed, the high prevalence of IgA aCL and increased
   TGF-beta -secreting T cells in children with acute HSP revealed some
   points which should permit a better understanding of the pathogenesis of

Abstract = {{Specimens of the mesoparasitic barnacle, Anelasma, were found attached
   to several host deep-sea squaloid sharks, Centroscyllium fabricii from
   off Greenland, Etmopterus princeps from the Canary Islands, and
   Etmopterus unicolor and Etmopterus granulosus from Three Kings Ridge and
   Louisville Ridge near New Zealand. One to three parasites were partially
   embedded in each host shark in the head, mouth, bases of 1st and 2nd
   dorsal fins, pectoral and pelvic fins, caudal fin, abdomen or claspers.
   Testes and claspers of parasitized mature-sized males were less
   developed than those of non-parasitized mature males. The ova of
   parasitized females of mature size were small and whitish-yellow
   compared to the large yellow ova of non-parasitized mature females. The
   number of mature ova in a parasitized specimen was lower than expected
   in relation to a non-parasitized individual of the same size. Attachment
   of parasitic barnacles appeared to retard the development of
   reproductive organs of host sharks.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether adverse effects in a premature neonate
   could be attributed to nefazodone exposure via breast milk.
   CASE SUMMARY: The breast-fed white infant (female, 2.1 kg, 36 weeks
   corrected gestational age) of a 35-year-old woman (60 kg) taking
   nefazodone 300 mg/d was admitted to the hospital because she was drowsy,
   lethargic, unable to maintain normal body temperature, and was feeding
   poorly. A diagnosis of exposure to nefazodone via breast milk was
   considered only after other more likely diagnosis had been excluded.
   After breast feeding was discontinued, the infant's symptoms resolved
   slowly over a period of 72 hours. The maternal plasma and milk
   concentration-time profiles for nefazodone and its metabolites,
   triazoledione, HO-nefazodone, and m-chlorphenylpiperazine, were
   quantified by HPLC. The calculated infant dose for nefazodone and its
   active metabolites (as nefazodone equivalents) via the milk was only
   0.45\% of the weight-adjusted maternal nefazadone daily dose.
   DISCUSSION: Our data suggest a putative association between maternal
   nefazodone ingestion and adverse effects in a premature breast-fed
   neonate. The measured amount of drug exposure would normally be
   considered safe in a full-term infant. However, there was a temporal
   relationship between resolution of adverse effects in the infant and
   cessation of breastfeeding.
   CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of individualizing the
   risk-benefit analysis for exposure to antidepressants in breast milk,
   especially when dealing with premature neonates.}},

Abstract = {{The pyrolysis reaction kinetics of saturates and the effect of

   resins and asphaltenes using the SARA technique. The samples were
   characterized by elemental analysis and proton NMR. The pyrolysis
   reactions were carried out at 400, 450 and 500 degrees C for reaction
   times ranging from 30 to 300 min in batch tubing reactors. Saturates,
   coke and asphaltenes product fractions were recovered by using a solvent
   extraction sequence. The variations of products yields were used to
   calculate the reaction rate constants and the activation energies for
   neat saturates and saturates-asphaltenes mixture pyrolysis. The
   reactivity of saturates was strongly affected by the presence of
   asphaltenes in the reaction environment. Experimental results provided
   insight into heavy oil pyrolysis reaction kinetics and coke formation.

Abstract = {{Hypothesis: Dedifferentiation of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
   may influence telomerase activation and Ki-67 expression.
   Design: Laboratory study using human HCC specimens.
   Setting: University hospital.
   Patients: Twelve patients with HCC with specific morphologic patterns
   (nodule-in-nodule {[}n=4] or confluent multinodular {[}n=8] type) and
   histological heterogeneity and who had undergone curative hepatectomy
   were studied. Of these, 8 patients had 2 different histological grades
   of HCC cells distributed at various nodules but within the same tumor; 3
   patients, 3 different histological grades; and 1 patient, all 4
   different histological grades.
   Intervention: Tissue samples were retrieved from each nodule of the
   tumor and not mixed with one another. A total of 42 cancerous tissues
   from different distinctive nodules of the 12 patients were taken for
   telomerase and Ki-67 study, and corresponding noncancerous counterparts
   (n=12) served as healthy control samples, Telomerase activity was
   assayed by the telomerase repeat amplification protocol. Expression of
   messenger RNA (mRNA) by the human telomerase catalytic subunit human
   telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) was determined using reverse
   transcription polymerase chain reaction. The relative telomerase
   activity and hTERT mRNA in each tissue sample was quantified using
   densitometry and expressed as a percentage of the standardized HeLa cell
   line. Immunostaining with anti-Ki-67 antibody was used to detect Ki-67
   and was expressed as Ki-67 labeling index.
   Main Outcome Measures: Telomerase activity, hTERT mRNA, and Ki-67
   labeling index stratified by different histological gradings in each
   patient was analyzed. The correlations between telomerase activity and
   hTERT mRNA and between telomerase activity and expression of Ki-67 were
   plotted.
   Results: Telomerase activity increased from more to less differentiated
   foci of I-ICC cells in each case (generalized linear model, P<.001).
   Mean +/- SD expression of hTERT mRNA in 43 cancerous tissue samples,
   even those 4 with negative telomerase activity, was distinguishable from
   that of the noncancerous controls (0.84+/-0.23 vs 0.41+/-0.11; t test,
   P=.008). Telomerase activity was correlated to hTERT mRNA expression
   (Pearson correlation, r(2)=0.56; P<.001). The Ki-67 labeling index
   increased from more to less differentiated foci of I-ICC in each case
   (generalized linear model, P<.001). Expression of Ki-67 correlated with
   telomerase activity within differently graded areas within individual
   tumors (Pearson correlation, r(2)=0.38; P<.001).
   Conclusion: Using the model of human WCC with histological
   heterogeneity, we determined that dedifferentiation of human I-ICC
   induces telomerase activation and Ki-67 expression.}},

Abstract = {{In deriving automatic numerical optimization algorithms for aerodynamic

   and a suitable set of design parameters. The unknown airfoil/blade
   profiles are usually chosen to be the design parameters. However, there
   are certain advantages in using the pressure/velocity distribution as
   the design variable in some applications; the optimized distribution can
   be used in a three-dimensional inverse design method to generate the
   actual profile shape. In this paper this approach will be addressed. Two
   methods are used to parameterize the circulation distribution for
   compressor blades. The Dawes code is used to calculate the viscous
   effect. An automatic optimization algorithm is developed, and two
   objective functions defined by the entropy loss or the aerodynamic
   blockage are examined.}},

   of Drosphila and vertebrate Musashi proteins. We isolated a msi-1 mutant
   and found males with this mutation to have a mating defect. C. elegans
   male mating behaviour includes a distinct series of steps: response to
   contact, backing, turning, vulva location, spicule insertion, and sperm
   transfer. msi-l is required for the turning and vulva location steps.
   Like other Musashi family members, MSI-1 is expressed specifically in
   neural cells, including male-specific neurones required for turning and
   vulva location. However, msi-1 was not expressed in proliferating neural
   progenitors in C. elegans, unlike the Musashi family genes in other
   systems.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that msi-l is expressed specifically in
   postmitotic neurones in C. elegans. msi-1 is required for full
   development of male mating behaviour, possibly through regulation of
   msi-1 expressing neurones.}},

Abstract = {{The pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism is
   attributed to increased calcium release from bone, increased calcium
   reabsorption in renal distal tubules, and increased intestinal calcium
   absorption. However, it remains unclear which factor is the main
   process. We encountered a 56-year-old woman with myasthenia gravis, in
   whom hypercalcemia and elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level
   were observed. Diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was made.
   Treatment with methylprednisolone for myasthenia gravis was associated
   with a marked decrease in both biochemical markers of bone formation and
   resorption without any changes in endogenous cAMP and serum levels of
   calcium, PTH, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 {[}1,25-(OH)(2)D-3]. These
   findings suggest that the possible pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in
   primary hyperparathyroidism may be attributed to the increased calcium
   reabsorption in the kidney and the increased intestinal calcium
   absorption as a result of stimulated production of 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 in
   the kidney. It thus follows that the renal tubular effect rather than
   the skeletal effect of the PTH excess may play a pivotal role in the
   development of hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism.}},

Abstract = {{It has been reported that the imbalance of anticholinergic and
   antidopaminergic activity of each neuroleptic drug correlates with the
   capacity to produce neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia (NAD) and the
   major focus of NAD is thought to be the striatum. Anticholinergic drugs
   are highly effective on NAD, but they are partially effective on
   neuroleptic-induced tardive dystonia and their effect on idiopathic
   dystonia is disappointing. Recently, it has been reported that the
   unilateral microinjection of sigma (sigma) ligands into the red nucleus
   induces torticollis of rats. This animal model appears to be a model of
   dystonia, but it is not clear whether it is suitable for NAD in man. To
   clarify this issue, we investigated the effect of an anticholinergic
   drug, biperiden hydrochlorate (BH), on this animal model. This study
   revealed that BH dose-dependently ameliorated dystonia of rats induced
   by two sigma ligands, whether each sigma ligand had dopaminergic
   affinity or not. This animal model of dystonia appears to be a model of
   NAD in man from the viewpoint of treatment-response. The results also
   suggest that not only dopaminergic and cholinergic systems but also
   sigma system, and not only the striatum but also the red nucleus, may
   play an important role in the pathophysiology of NAD. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{High-frequency stratigraphic sequences that comprise the Desert Member
   of the Blackhawk Formation, the Lower Castlegate Sandstone, and the Buck
   Tongue in the Green River area of Utah display changes in sequence
   architecture from marine deposits to marginal marine deposits to an
   entirely nonmarine section. Facies and sequence architecture differ
   above and below the regionally extensive Castlegate sequence boundary,
   which separates two low-frequency (10(6)-year cyclicity) sequences.
   Below this surface, high-frequency sequences are identified and
   interpreted as comprising the highstand systems tract of the
   low-frequency Blackhawk sequence. Each high-frequency sequence has a
   local incised valley system on top of the wave-dominated delta, and
   coastal plain to shallow marine deposits are preserved. Above the
   Castlegate sequence boundary, in contrast, a regionally extensive sheet
   sandstone of fluvial to estuarine origin with laterally continuous
   internal erosional surfaces occurs. These deposits above the Castlegate
   sequence boundary are interpreted as the late lowstand to early
   transgressive systems tracts of the low-frequency Castlegate sequence.
   The base-level changes that generated both the low- and high-frequency
   sequences are attributed to crustal response to fluctuations in
   compressive intraplate stress on two different time scales. The
   low-frequency stratigraphic sequences are attributed to changes in the
   long-term regional subsidence rate and regional tilting of foreland
   basin fill. High-frequency sequences probably reflect the response of
   anisotropic basement to tectonism. Sequence architecture changes rapidly
   across the faulted margin of the underlying Paleozoic Paradox Basin. The
   high-frequency sequences are deeply eroded and stack above the Paradox
   Basin, but display less relief and become conformable updip. These
   features indicate that the area above the Paradox Basin was more prone
   to vertical structural movements during formation of the Blackhawk-Lower
   Castlegate succession. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Patients with chronic ulcerative colitis who undergo
   proctocolectomy and are found intraoperatively to harbor histologic
   signs suggesting Crohn's disease have indeterminate colitis;
   nonetheless, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is usually performed. The aim
   of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of ileal pouch-anal
   anastomosis in patients with indeterminate colitis compared with a
   cohort of patients with chronic ulcerative colitis. METHOD: Review of an
   ileal pouch-anal anastomosis registry identified 1,437 patients with
   chronic ulcerative colitis and 82 patients with indeterminate colitis
   who underwent an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis between 1981 and 1995. The
   median follow-up was 83 (range, 1-192) months. Demographic data and
   functional outcomes were compared by chi-squared and Wilcoxon's rank-sum
   tests. Probabilities of complications and pouch failure were analyzed
   using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank techniques. Finally, Bonferroni
   adjustments were used for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Patients with
   indeterminate colitis and chronic ulcerative colitis were comparable in
   terms of gender and length of follow-up. The mean age of the chronic
   ulcerative colitis group was higher (34 vs. 31; P < 0.01). At ten pears
   patients with indeterminate colitis had significantly more episodes of
   pelvic sepsis (17 percent indeterminate colitis vs. 7 percent chronic
   ulcerative colitis; P < 0.001), pouch fistula (31 vs. 9 percent; P <
   0.001), and pouch failure (27 vs. 11 percent; P < 0.001). Importantly,
   during follow-up fully 15 percent of patients with indeterminate
   colitis, but only 2 percent of patients with chronic ulcerative colitis,
   had their original diagnosis changed to Crohn's disease (P < 0.001).
   When the outcomes of these patients newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease
   were considered separately, the rate of complications for the remaining
   patients with indeterminate colitis was identical to that of patients
   with chronic ulcerative colitis. Functional outcomes were comparable
   among all three groups. CONCLUSION: After ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
   patients with indeterminate colitis who did not develop Crohn's disease
   subsequently experienced long-term outcomes nearly identical to patients
   with chronic ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease, whether it develops
   after surgery for chronic ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis,
   is associated with poor long-term outcomes.}},

   are identified that interact with each other as an incumbent government
   substitutes a NTB for a tariff, and, among other things, it is found
   that an increase in foreign competition will not cause the government to
   substitute NTBs for tariffs, but a rise in the government's valuation of
   political contribution might do so. JEL Classification: F13, D72.}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported that chromosome arm 10q is one of the target
   regions of allelic loss in human endometrial cancer. To identify the
   gene in this region responsible for endometrial cancer, we further
   characterized this region and localized the hBRAG gene. The function of
   hBRAG has not yet been fully studied, and there is the possibility that
   this gene works as a tumor suppressor. This gene consist of 7 exons and
   6 introns encoding 503 amino acids; all the introns start with GT and
   end with AG in agreement with the GT-AG rule. Expression of this gene
   was studied by Northern hybridization and suppressed expression was
   observed in one (SK-UT-1B) of the six endometrial cancer cell lines.
   Mutation analysis in 38 primary EC tissues and six EC cell lines
   disclosed no genetic alterations. The genomic structure of hBRAG
   elucidated in this study should contribute to the future analysis of the

Abstract = {{induction of p53 by DNA damage results in apoptosis of teratocarcinoma
   cells, whereas MDM2, encoded by a p53-responsive gene, can reverse this
   phenotype by inhibiting p53 function. Here we report that UV (10 or 20
   J/m(2)), but not gamma irradiation (7 or lo Gy), caused a massive
   apoptosis of human teratoma Tera-2 or murine testicular carcinoma F9
   cells, both of which contain wild-type p53, but not murine p53 null
   testicular carcinoma EB-16 cells. Most Tera-2 or F9 cells died overnight
   after UV but not gamma irradiation. Correlated with this phenotype was a
   dramatic and continuing accumulation of p53 proteins after UV but not
   gamma irradiation. This was attributable to UV-responsive repression of
   MDM2 expression, because both its protein and RNA were not detectable
   after UV irradiation. This UV-induced repression appeared to be specific
   to MDM2, because expression of other genes, such as p21, p53, or
   glyceral-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was not reduced. Also, RNase
   protection analysis showed that a DNA region, excluding the p53 binding
   site, in the MDM2 promoter mediated transcriptional repression in
   response to UV. Thus, these results suggest that UV but not gamma
   irradiation can induce p53 by suppressing MDM2 expression in a
   p53-independent fashion and subsequently, massive cell death.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the growth and
   invasiveness of primary and metastatic tumors. Hypothesizing that MMP
   inhibition would slow cancer growth, the MMP inhibitor BE-94
   (batimistat) was evaluated in an orthotopic animal model of human
   pancreatic carcinoma. Ten million human pancreatic cancer cells were
   surgically implanted into the pancreata of 30 athymic nu/nu mice.
   Intraperitoneal administration of 30 mg/kg BE-94 or vehicle control
   began 7 days after turner implantation (13 mice with confirmed
   implantations in each group) and continued daily fur 21 days, and then
   three times weekly until death or sacrifice at day 70. Representative
   tumors harvested from twice in each group were analyzed for presence and
   activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Animal weights w ere significantly higher
   in tile BB-94-treated group at sacrifice (mean 58.4 +/- 7.9 g vs. 39.8
   +/- 6.2 g; P <0.05, Student's t test). The likelihood of survival to 70
   days was significantly higher in the treated group (4 of 13 vs. 0 of 13,
   P <0.05, Z-test for end points) than in the control group as was overall
   survival (P = 0.03, Wilcoxon test). Nine mice in the control group
   developed metastases tu the liver, peritoneum, abdominal wall, or local
   lymph nodes, whereas only two mice in the BB-94 group had evidence of
   metastatic disease (P <0.02, Fisher's exact test), in both instances
   confined to the abdominal wall. Tumors from treated mice manifested
   lower MMP activity than those from control animals. These reports
   support the use of MMP inhibitors alone or as an adjunct in the
   treatment of pancreatic cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The test and analysis of fluid inclusions in the reservoirs is a very
   effective method in studying oil and gas migration and the pool-forming
   times. The type and content of fluid inclusions in the reservoirs are
   evidently correlative with petroleum of reservoirs in Kela 2 gas field.
   The occurrence and data of homogenization temperature and composition of
   fluid inclusions show that the oil and gas began to charge in early
   stage, preserved in the reservoirs since then, and until cracked dry
   gas. There is one main peak in homogenization temperature of organic
   fluid inclusions in the reservoirs. There are three main peaks in
   homogenization temperature of salt water fluid inclusions, and the first
   one is inconsistent with that of organic fluid inclusions. So the
   temperature of 60 similar to 120 degreesC is the one of oil and gas
   charge and the pool forming, while the temperature of 120 similar to 160
   degreesC is the one of oil and gas reservoirs buried deepest, whose
   depth is 5800m, and the temperature of 220 similar to 330 degreesC is
   the one of oil and gas reformed by hige-temperature-liquid. The Kela 2

Abstract = {{Purpose: To study the correlation of genotype for X-linked red-green
   gene array with color vision phenotype in 58 subjects with red-green
   color vision deficiency.
   Methods: The molecular structure of red and green pigment genes on 58 X
   chromosomes was studied exon-by-exon by using heteroduplex-SSCP analysis
   and sequencing. The color vision of these subjects was determined by a
   Neitz anomaloscope.
   Results: Variations in the red and green pigment genes were detected in
   43 subjects and a hybrid gene was found in 27 subjects. About 50\% of
   the fusion sites occurred at intron 2-3. All 3 anomalous trichromats
   with intron 4 fusion were mild type but another 3 with intron 2-3 fusion
   were severe type. No subjects with mild type of color vision defects had
   a fusion site at intron 2-3 or its upstream. Three subjects with
   complete deletion of the green pigment gene manifested deuteranomaly.
   Conclusions: Protans can be differentiated from deutans on the basis of
   genotype. It is still difficult to establish a clear correlation of
   different anomalous trichromats with genotype. The fusion site of a
   hybrid gene affects the phenotype to some degree. Intron 2-3 is the
   common place for gene crossover. (C) 2000 Japanese Ophthalmological

Abstract = {{Silicon carbide with aluminum, boron, and carbon additions (ABC-SiC) was
   hot-pressed to full density, The samples were examined by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), with an emphasis on high-resolution electron
   microscopy (HREM). Amorphous grain boundary interlayers, typically less
   than 2 nm wide, were formed between SIC grains. Heat-treating the
   ABC-SiC at temperatures as low as 1100 degreesC in Ar crystallized the
   grain boundary interlayers completely without significantly changing the
   dominant chemical constituents. Chemical microanalyses demonstrated Al
   and O enrichment for all examined grain boundaries in both as-prepared
   and annealed samples. Quantitative EDS analyses revealed Al2OC- and
   Al2O3-related species (with Si, C, B, or S substitutions) as two of the
   most likely grain boundary interlayer materials, both before and after
   heat treatment. Al2O3, and (Al1-xSix)(2)OC with a 2H-type wurtzite
   structure, were identified as grain boundary films by HREM images. The
   structural evolution in the grain boundary phases during the hot

Abstract = {{Ongoing work at the Queensland University of Technology has developed an
   integrated computer-based tool for the prediction of rail track
   behaviour under changing traffic conditions. The track degradation model
   described in this paper takes into account degradation due to
   interactions between track components. The model uses mechanistic
   relationships and embraces all the major factors that may influence
   service life of track components. The model was applied to a typical
   Australian railway track. The results showed that increasing axle load
   and train showed accelerates degradation of the track and wear of rails.
   The rate of failure of timber sleepers is sensitive to the age of the
   sleepers, traffic parameters and to environmental factors such as rate
   of decay of timber and how well the track drains. Increases in axle
   loads may not lead to a higher rate of sleeper damage failure at fixed
   traffic tonnage.}},

Abstract = {{We describe experiments to compare the activities of two Drosophila
   homeodomain proteins, Bicoid (Bcd) and an altered-specificity mutant of
   Fushi tarazu, Ftz(Q50K). Although the homeodomains of these proteins
   share a virtually indistinguishable ability to recognize a consensus Bcd
   site, only Bcd can activate transcription from natural enhancer elements
   when assayed in both yeast and Drosophila Schneider S2 cells. Our
   analysis of chimeric proteins suggests that both the homeodomain of Bcd
   and sequences outside the homeodomain contribute to its ability to
   recognize natural enhancer elements. We further show that, unlike the
   Bcd homeodomain, the Ftz(Q50K) homeodomain fails to recognize
   nonconsensus sites found in natural enhancer elements. The defect of a
   chimeric protein containing the homeodomain of Ftz(Q50K) in place of
   that of Bcd can be preferentially restored by converting the
   nonconsensus sites in natural enhancer elements to consensus sites. Our
   experiments suggest that the biological specificity of Bcd is determined
   by combinatorial contributions of two important mechanisms: the
   nonconsensus site recognition function conferred by the homeodomain and
   the cooperativity function conferred primarily by sequences outside the
   homeodomain. A systematic comparison of different assay methods and
   enhancer elements further suggests a fluid nature of the requirements
   for these two Bcd functions in target selection.}},

Abstract = {{The coexistence of ferromagnetism and metallic conduction in doped
   manganites has long been explained by a double exchange model
   (ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice model) in which the ferromagnetic exchange
   arises from the carrier hopping. We evaluate the zero-temperature spin
   stiffness D(0) and the Curie temperature T-C on the basis of the double
   exchange model using the measured values of the bare bandwidth W and the
   Hund's rule coupling J(H). The calculated D(0) and T-C values are too
   small compared with the observed ones even without considering, a strong
   electron-phonon; coupling. We thus suggest that the ferromagnetism in
   doped manganites should not originate from the double exchange
   interaction. On the other hand, an alternative model based on the d-p
   exchange and a strong electron-phonon coupling can quantitatively
   explain the magnetoresistance and T-C values.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic energy structure of substitution solid solutions based on
   baron nitride B1-xNRx and BN1-XRx, (R = C. O) (x = 0.25) in a
   diamond-like modification of ZnS type has been investigated by the local
   coherent potential method in terms of multiple-scattering theor-v. The
   total and partial densities of stares were calculated for each element
   in a solid solution. The crystalline potential was calculated using art
   MT approximation. The lattice parameter was chasm based on X-ray
   diffraction data for c-BN:0.3615 nm. The electronic energy structures of
   the solid solutions and binary c-BN are compared in the framework of a
   single approximation. The calculated partial densities of states are
   compared with the experimental X-ray emission and photoelectron spectra
   of boron, nitrogen, and oxygen in these compounds. The calculated
   partial charges of electrons at the top of the valence band show that
   charge transfer from baron to nitrogen rakes place in the solid
   solutions. An analysis of the electronic structures of the solid
   solutions of boron nitride indicates that the quasicore resonances
   inherent in binary c-BN are delocalized and that chemical bonding in the
   solid solutions of boron nitride is weakened.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{293-306}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{During mechanical development dough is subjected to both shear and
   extensional deformations. Thus, it is expected that both flow conditions
   contribute to the development of dough. In order to monitor rheological
   changes, occurring during mixing, shear and extensional properties of
   dough prepared with two flours of different strength and various levels
   of mixing energy were determined using fundamental rheological methods.
   Rheological measurements included: small deformation and large
   deformation (shear test), planar extensional flow and a combined
   shear/extensional flow test, namely extrusion test.
   Results obtained in this research showed that, during mixing, dough
   develops with an increase in both apparent shear and extensional
   viscositics. For all the tests, plots of the measured rheological
   properties as a function of the mixing energy resembled typical mixing
   curves. This indicated that the increase in the power drawn by the mixer
   motor is due to the increase in both apparent shear and extensional
   viscosities. After peak dough development these properties decreased
   synchronously with the mixing curves.
   Results from small deformation shear tests exhibited large variability,
   particularly when non-mixed and underdeveloped doughs were tested. This
   variability was associated with poor water distribution in the sample
   due to insufficient mixing.
   Results of large deformation tests, including shear, planar extensional
   flow and the extrusion test, were less variable and showed that mixing
   and type of flour affect the rheological properties of dough. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Hair cell fate determination in the inner ear has been shown to be
   controlled by specific genes. Recent loss-of-function and
   gain-of-function experiments have demonstrated that Math1, a mouse
   homolog of the Drosophila gene atonal, is essential for the production
   of hair cells. To identify genes that may interact with Math1 and
   inhibit hair cell differentiation, we have focused on Hes1, a mammalian
   hairy and enhancer of split homolog, which is a negative regulator of
   neurogenesis, We report here that targeted deletion of Hes1 leads to
   formation of supernumerary hair cells in the cochlea and utricle of the
   inner ear. RT-PCR analysis shows that Hes1 is expressed in inner ear
   during hair cell differentiation and its expression is maintained in
   adulthood. In situ hybridization with late embryonic inner ear tissue
   reveals that Hes1 is expressed in supporting cells, but not hair cells,
   of the vestibular sensory epithelium. In the cochlea, Hes1 is
   selectively expressed in the greater epithelial ridge and lesser
   epithelial ridge regions which are adjacent to inner and outer hair
   cells. Co-transfection experiments in postnatal rat explant cultures
   show that overexpression of Heal prevents hair cell differentiation
   induced by Math1. Therefore Hes1 can negatively regulate hair cell
   differentiation by antagonizing Math1. suggest that a balance between
   Math1 ana negative regulators such as Hes1 is crucial for the production
   of an appropriate number of inner ear hair cells.}},

Abstract = {{Aflatoxins (AF) are polyketide-derived mycotoxins that frequently
   contaminate food and feed crops, causing health risks to animals and
   humans. The fluP gene was cloned by screening an Aspergillus parasiticus
   genomic DNA library with a cDNA probe encoding part of a polyketide
   synthase (PKS), the 6-methylsalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from
   Penicillium patulum. FluP was hypothesized to function as a PKS in AF
   biosynthesis. The predicted amino acid sequence of FluP demonstrated a
   high degree of identity to MSAS (55\%), moderate identity to another
   fungal PKS protein encoded by wA from A. nidulans (22\%) and low
   identity (<5\%) to fungal fatty acid synthase (FAS) proteins. Disruption
   of fluP in A. parasiticus resulted in the loss of fluP transcript, a 3-
   to 4-fold reduction in hyphal growth rate, the appearance of a fluffy,
   cotton-like hyphal morphology, reduction or elimination of asexual
   spores and spore-bearing structures, and a twofold reduction in
   aflatoxin accumulation. Removal of selective pressure on fluP knockout
   transformants resulted in frequent reversion (10\%) to the wild-type
   genotype and phenotype, establishing a direct link between gene
   disruption and the associated phenotype. The data suggest that fluP
   encodes a novel PKS associated with hyphal growth and cell development
   (sporulation). whose activity indirectly influences aflatoxin
   accumulation in A. parasiticus.}},

Abstract = {{The reaction sequences between the oxides at various calcining
   temperatures were examined through the identification of the reaction
   products. Formation of pyrochlore phase with tetragonal symmetry is a
   required preparatory step for subsequent generation of perovskite phase.
   Most of the pyrochlore phase turns into the perovskite phase in the
   temperature range of 700-800 degrees C and this conversion persists up
   to 950 degrees C. The double calcination approach seems infeasible in
   promoting the pyrochlore to perovskite transformation in the presence of
   excess lead oxide since the decomposition of the pyrochlore phase is a
   rather sluggish process. Sintered Pb(Fe1/2Ta1/2)O-3 displays
   ferroelectric relaxer behavior whose relative permittivity maximum
   exhibits high value (epsilon'(max) = 17 500 at 248 K at 100 Hz). The
   distinct relaxer behaviour along with the further enhanced permittivity
   values for the annealed specimen reveal that the annealing treatment is
   mainly characterized by the elimination of the pyrochlore phase rather
   than the formation of the ordering in the B-site cations. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Taking a broad rather than a narrow approach to family policy, this
   paper identifies three trends that call for responses that could become
   a part of a family policy agenda in the future: growing wage and income
   disparities among American families, the increased labor force
   participation of mothers with young children, and increased life
   expectancy. The latter is discussed within the context of Social
   Security reform and the need for opportunity structures to accommodate
   changing demographic realities. In that vein, it also addresses labor
   force participation of mothers with young children, within the context
   of the need for a family care system to accommodate parents' expanded
   roles in the face of societal expectations. An agenda created around
   each of these three interrelated trends could help to ensure the
   viability of families as social systems and their ability to perform
   their functions over the life span, bringing into better balance
   transactional interdependencies within families, and between families
   and the systems in their environment with which they interact.
   Implications for family policy advocates, educators, and researchers are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{By the geometrical optics method, the phase increment of magnetostatic
   surface waves (MSSWs) propagating in ferrite films (FFs) and
   ferrite-metal film structures magnetized by a nonuniform valley-type
   field is calculated. It is shown that the phase increment in the second
   medium exceeds that in the first medium by an order of magnitude. As
   compared with the same media magnetized by a uniform field, the phase
   increment increases approximately five times. Therefore, the use of
   waves in media magnetized by a valley-type field is very promising for
   the development of microwave phase shifters.}},

Abstract = {{A study was made to determine whether the population of superdeformed
   states in Hg-193 and Hg-195 can be enhanced by using reactions in which
   alpha particles are emitted. The search utilized a W-184 (O-18, alpha
   Xn) reaction at 115 and 120MeV for the Hg-193 study and a W-186(O-18,
   alpha Xn) reaction at 105 and 110 MeV for the Hg-195 study. Two known
   superdeformed states of Hg-193 were observed. The intensities of the
   superdeformed states in Hg-193 populated by a reaction involving the
   emission of an alpha particle were found to be reduced by at least a
   factor of four relative to the intensities of these stares produced in
   reactions involving only the emission of neutrons and gamma -rays. No
   rotational bands built on superdeformed states in Hg-195 With transition
   intensities > 0.8\% of the total 195Hg yield were found. Evidence is
   shown that the energy of the alpha particle that is associated with
   superdeformed states may be lower than that of alpha particles
   associated with normally deformed states.}},

Abstract = {{Six samples of styrene-butadiene block copolymers (sPS-B 1-6) containing
   a range of styrene molar fractions (x(S) = 0.9-0.16) were prepared using
   MAO-activated CpTiCl3 and converted to the corresponding
   styrene-1-butene-ethylene terpolymers (sPS-PE, 1h-6h) through the
   selective hydrogenation of the unsaturated butadiene segments with
   p-toluenesulfonhydrazide. The monomer compositions and chemical
   microstructures of the sPS-PE copolymers were determined by H-1 NMR
   (x(S) = 0.93-0.1) and C-13 NMR, respectively. The chemical shift
   assignments of the monomer tetrads (SSSS, SSEE, EESE, EEbE, EEEE, SEES,
   EEES; S = styrene, E = ethylene, b = l-butene) were also determined by
   C-13 NMR as well as the average monomer block lengths (n(S) = 72-4; n(E)
   = 2-51). The block structure of the sPS-PE copolymers was further
   confirmed by DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), WAXD (wide-angle
   X-ray diffraction), and solid-state CP-MAS C-13 NMR (cross polarization
   magic angle spinning) analysis. The sPS-PE samples with high styrene
   content (x(S) = 0.93-0.43) exhibit melting points in the range of
   242-200 degreesC, and the sPS homosequences are observed in the
   crystalline ``delta -clathrate{''} form. At low styrene content and
   short average sPS block lengths (x(S) = 0.1; n(S) = 4) the styrene
   domains are largely amorphous. Crystalline blocks of polyethylene were
   identified in the samples with long average block lengths (n(E) = 21-51)
   by means of X-ray powder diffraction and solid-state CP-MAS C-13 NMR. In
   general, the initial crystallinity of the polyethylene blocks is lower
   than would be expected on the basis of the chemical composition of
   samples 1h-6h but can be increased with thermal treatment, which
   produces the polyethylene orthorhombic crystalline form.}},

Journal = {{CIRCULATION}},

Abstract = {{Background-Unstable atherosclerotic lesions typically have an abundant
   inflammatory cell infiltrate, including activated T cells, macrophages,
   and mast cells, which may decrease plaque stability. The pathophysiology
   of inflammatory cell recruitment and activation in the human atheroma is
   incompletely described.
   Methods and Results-We hypothesized that differential gene expression
   with DNA microarray technology would identify new genes that may
   participate in vascular inflammation. RNA isolated from cultured human
   aortic smooth muscle cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha) was examined with a DNA microarray with 8600 genes, This
   experiment and subsequent Northern analyses demonstrated marked
   increases in steady-state eotaxin mRNA (>20 fold), a chemokine initially
   described as a chemotactic factor for eosinophils. Because eosinophils
   are rarely present in human atherosclerosis, we then studied tissue
   samples from 7 normal and 14 atherosclerotic arteries.
   Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated overexpression of eotaxin
   protein and its receptor, CCR3, in the human atheroma, with negligible
   expression in normal vessels. Eotaxin was predominantly located in
   smooth muscle cells. The CCR3 receptor was localized primarily to
   macrophage-rich regions as defined by immunopositivity for CD 68; a
   minority of mast cells also demonstrated immunopositivity for the CCR3
   receptor.
   Conclusions-Eotaxin and its receptor, CCR3, are overexpressed in human
   atherosclerosis, suggesting that eotaxin participates in vascular
   inflammation. These data demonstrate how genomic differential expression
   technology can identify novel genes that may participate in the
   stability of atherosclerotic lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Metal matrix composites consisting of Ti-based alloys reinforced with
   SiC monofilaments show great promise for aerospace applications. This
   work is on a novel functionally graded (FG) coating system for SiC
   monofilaments, used as improved reinforcements for Ti-based matrices.
   The system is abbreviated as {[}SiCf/C/(Ti,C)/Ti]. A finite element
   analysis was carried out to investigate the effect of the coating on
   thermal residual stresses generated at the fibre/matrix interface due to
   differences in the thermal expansion coefficient (CTE mismatch) between
   the various materials within the coating system. These residual stresses
   are known to affect fracture behaviour of the composite. The aim of the
   study was to compare a graded system {[}SiCf/C/(Ti,C)/Ti], and a
   non-graded multi-layer system {[}SiCf/C/TiC/Ti]. The role of the carbon
   layer within the FG coating system and the effect of layer thickness
   were also investigated. The FG coating was seen to reduce residual
   stresses generated due to CTE mismatch. In addition correct choice of
   the coating material was seen to allow tailoring of the residual
   stress-state at the fibre/matrix interface. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Number = {{43}},

Abstract = {{Heme structures of a natural mutant hemoglobin (Hb), Hb M Iwate {[}alpha
   87(F8)Hiss-Tyr], and protonation of its F8-Tyr were examined with the
   244-nm excited UV resonance Raman (UVRR) and the 406.7- and 441.6-nm
   excited visible resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy. It was clarified from
   the UVRR bands at 1605 and 1166 cm(-1) characteristic of tyrosinate that
   the tyrosine (F8) of the abnormal subunit in Hb M Iwate adopts a
   deprotonated form. UV Raman bands of other Tyr residues indicated that
   the protein takes the T-quaternary structure even in the met form.
   Although both hemes of alpha and beta subunits in metHb A take a
   six-coordinate (6c) high-spin structure, the 406.7-nm excited RR
   spectrum of metHb M Iwate indicated that the abnormal ct subunit adopts
   a 5c high-spin structure, The present results and our previous
   observation of the nu (Fe-o(tyrosine)) Raman band {[}Nagai et al. (1989)
   Biochemistry 28, 2418-2422] have proved that F8-tyrosinate is covalently
   bound to Fe(III) heme in the alpha subunit of Hb M Iwate. As a result,
   peripheral groups of porphyrin ring, especially the vinyl and the
   propionate side chains, were so strongly influenced that the RR spectrum
   in the low-frequency region excited at 406.7 nm is distinctly changed
   from the normal pattern, When Hb M Iwate was fully reduced, the
   characteristic UVRR bands of tyrosinate disappeared and the Raman bands
   of tyrosine at 1620 (Y8a), 1207 (Y7a), and 1177 cm(-1) (Y9a) increased
   in intensity. Coordination of distal His(E7) to the Fe(II) heme in the
   reduced alpha subunit of Hb M Iwate was proved by the observation of the
   nu (Fe-His) RR band in the 441.6-nm excited RR spectrum at the same
   frequency as that of its isolated alpha chain, The effects of the
   distal-His coordination on the heme appeared as a distortion of the
   peripheral groups of heme. A possible mechanism for the formation of a
   Fe(III)-tyrosinate bond in Hb M Iwate is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of roughness induced fatigue crack closure has been
   studied by finite element modelling. Closure analyses in the literature
   have been reviewed and been shown to lack a reasonable treatment of: (a)
   propagating elastic-plastic cracks, and (b) the influence of the
   characteristically inhomogeneous plastic deformation associated with
   near-threshold crack growth in many materials. Based on an analysis of
   both overall specimen compliance and node behaviour along the crack
   path, the present modelling shows: (a) an increasing effect of crack
   path angle on roughness induced closure levels in keeping with the
   simple analytical model of Suresh and Ritchie: (b) the mechanism by
   which closure occurs is more strongly dependent on residual plastic
   strains in the wake than global shear displacements of the fracture
   surfaces due to mixed-mode behaviour at the crack tip; and (c) the
   closure levels are relatively low compared to experimental data,
   consistent with the absence of environmental irreversibility in the
   finite element models and the idealised crack path morphologies that
   were studied. Slip band simulations show a significant increasing effect
   of inhomogeneous deformation on closure levels, improving the apparent
   accuracy of the modelling results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All

Abstract = {{The high temperature isothermal low cycle fatigue (IF) and
   thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) of a 6061Al alloy reinforced with 28
   vol.\% silicon carbide whiskers were studied. IF experiments were
   conducted at a temperature of 300 degrees C, and two types of TMF tests,
   i.e. in-phase (IP) and out-of-phase (OP), were performed with
   temperature cycling between 150 and 300 degrees C. All experiments were
   carried out under mechanical strain range control. Experimental results
   of mechanical behavior and mean stresses for TMF and IF loadings are
   provided. It can be seen that both IP and OP-TMF show continuous cyclic
   softening until failure, while IF loading initially shows several cycles
   of cyclic hardening followed by cyclic softening until final fracture. A
   comparison of TMF and IF lives has been made and various damage
   mechanisms operative under different strain ranges and loading
   conditions have been explained. SEM micrographs show that damage
   processes under both IF and TMF conditions consist of initiation, growth
   and coalescence of voids in the matrix around whiskers. Due to the
   complexity of the relationship between IF and TMF damage: IF data cannot
   be used to evaluate TMF life. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights

Abstract = {{Transient kinetic analysis of biphasic, single turnover data for the
   reaction of 2,2'-azino-bis-{[}3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]
   (ABTS) with horseradish peroxidase (HRPC) compound II demonstrated
   preequilibrium binding of ABTS (k(+5) = 7.82 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1)) prior to
   rate-limiting electron transfer (k(+6) = 42.1 s(-1)). These data were
   obtained using a stopped-flow method, which included ascorbate in the
   reaction medium to maintain a low steady-state concentration of ABTS
   (pseudo-first-order conditions) and to minimize absorbance changes in
   the Soret region due to the accumulation of ABTS cation radicals. A
   steady-state kinetic analysis of the reaction confirmed that the
   reduction of HRPC compound II by this substrate is rate-limiting in the
   complete peroxidase cycle. The reaction of HRPC with o-diphenols has
   been investigated using a chronometric method that also included
   ascorbate in the assay medium to minimize the effects of nonenzymic
   reactions involving phenol-derived radical products. This enabled the
   initial rates of o-diphenol oxidation at different hydrogen peroxide and
   o-diphenol concentrations to be determined from the lag period induced
   by the presence of ascorbate. The kinetic analysis resolved the reaction
   of HRPC compound II with o-diphenols into two steps, initial formation
   of an enzyme-substrate complex followed by electron transfer from the
   substrate to the heme. With o-diphenols that are rapidly oxidized, the
   heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond of the heme-bound hydrogen peroxide
   (k(+2) = 2.17 x 10(3) s(-1)) is rate-limiting. The size and
   hydrophobicity of the o-diphenol substrates are correlated with their
   rate of binding to HRPC, while the electron density at the C-4 hydroxyl
   group predominantly influences the rate of electron transfer to the
   heme.}},

Abstract = {{The histidine protein kinase CheA plays a central role in the bacterial
   chemotaxis signal transduction pathway. Autophosphorylated CheA passes
   its phosphoryl group to CheY very rapidly (k(cat) similar to 750 s(-1)).
   Phospho-CheY in turn influences the direction of flagellar rotation. The
   autophosphorylation site of CheA (His(48)) resides in its N-terminal P1
   domain. The adjacent P2 domain provides a high-affinity binding site for
   CheY, which might facilitate the phosphotransfer reaction by tethering
   CheY in close proximity to the phosphodonor located in P1. To explore
   the contribution of P2 to the CheA --> CheY phosphotransfer reaction in
   the Escherichia coli chemotaxis system, we examined the transfer
   kinetics of a mutant CheA protein (CheA Delta P2) in which the 98 amino
   acid P2 domain had been replaced with an 11 amino acid linker. We used
   rapid-quench and stopped-flow fluorescence experiments to monitor
   phosphotransfer to CheY from phosphorylated wild type CheA and from
   phosphorylated CheA Delta P2. The CheA Delta P2 reaction rates were
   significantly slower and the K-m value was markedly higher than the
   corresponding values for wild-type CheA. These results indicate that
   binding of CheY to the P2 domain of CheA indeed contributes to the rapid
   kinetics of phosphotransfer. Although phosphotransfer was slower with
   CheA Delta P2 (k(cat)/K-m similar to 1.5 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1)) than with
   wild-type CheA (k(cat)/K-m similar to 10(8) M-1 s(-1)), it was still
   orders of magnitude faster than the kinetics of CheY phosphorylation by
   phosphoimidazole and other small molecule phosphodonors (k(cat)/K-m
   similar to 5-50 M-1 s(-1)). We conclude that the P1 domain of CheA also
   makes significant contributions to phosphotransfer rates in chemotactic
   signaling.}},

   that the phonon-assisted jumps of electrons between localized states

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the reaction of H2O2 With excess SCN- in acidic media
   was studied by use of TI(IV) as an indicator for the concentration of
   H2O2. Pseudo-first-order behavior was realized by this method, and these
   data confirm the acid-catalyzed rate law and rate constant reported some
   40 years ago for this reaction under conditions of excess H2O2 Under the
   same conditions except without Ti(IV), repetitive-scan spectra reveal
   the formation and decay of an intermediate that absorbs in the UV. In
   the proposed mechanism, HOSCN is produced in the first step and it is
   converted rapidly to (SCN)(2) through its equilibrium reaction with
   SCN-. The observed intermediate is believed to be (SCN)2, which decays
   on a longer time scale. Excellent global fits of this mechanism to the
   repetitive-scan data are obtained with rate constants constrained by the
   Ti(IV) data and published previously in our study of the ClO2/SCN-
   reaction. These fits yield a spectrum for (SCN)2 that is characterized
   by lambda (max) = 297 nm and epsilon (297) = 147 M-1 cm(-1) in fine
   agreement with our prior report.}},

Abstract = {{The early vertebrate developmental process of somitogenesis involves
   bands of gene expression that form periodically at the posterior end of
   the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and traverse it with decreasing width and
   velocity. We have constructed a chemical flow system that, based on the
   novel flow-distributed oscillator (FDO) mechanism of wave pattern
   formation, reproduces key physical features of the PSM and observe
   concentration waves having similar spatio-temporal behavior. This
   suggests that the gene expression waves can be understood qualitatively
   in terms of phase dynamics in an open flow of a self-oscillating medium
   and that chemical flow systems can be used to mimic and model biological
   pattern formation during axial growth. In fact, expressions for
   wavelength and wave velocity derived from phase dynamics are found to be
   in quantitative agreement with measurements from both the biological and
   the chemical systems. This indicates that they, despite their
   significant differences, have common dynamics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We (1) describe a model that simulates migration of the Mexican
   long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris nivalis) based on the, flowering phenology
   (nectar-pollen production) of agaves (Agavaceae) and hypothesized
   `rules' governing bat movements; (2) evaluate the model by comparing
   simulated seasonal and spatial patterns of nectar production and
   consumption, and bat movements and densities, to patterns observed in
   the field; and (3) use the model to examine various hypotheses
   concerning factors that control migration. A nectar production sub-model
   represents the flowering phenology of agaves in terms of the daily
   availability of nectar within each of four latitudinal intervals between
   18 and 29 degreesN. A bat migration sub-model represents the number of
   bats present within each latitudinal interval each day, with bat
   movements from one site to another depending on availability of nectar
   and season. Simulated patterns of nectar consumption are similar to
   observed patterns of nectar production based on the number of flowering
   plant species present at different latitudes. Simulated patterns of bat
   movements are similar to general patterns observed in the field for
   Leptonycteris curasoae and L. nivalis. Simulated fluctuations of bat
   density at the southernmost latitude exhibit the same general annual
   cycle observed at a southern roost of L. curasoae. The seasonal
   representation of nectar production in the model corresponds well with
   patterns of nectar production observed over a 2-year period at a site in
   northern Mexico, although nectar production in the model begins somewhat
   earlier. Simulations examining factors hypothesized to control migration
   indicate that predicted migration patterns correspond well with held
   observations only when model rules assume that both food availability
   and season limit migration, and that all bats with access to sufficient
   energy during the correct season migrate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Elevated atmospheric CO2 and climate changes are expected to influence
   managed grassland ecosystems. The mechanistic pasture simulation model
   (PaSim) was used to quantify effects on net primary productivity (NPP)
   and carbon (C) stocks at three locations differing in climate and soil
   type. An earlier model version was modified to enable long-term
   simulations at different altitudes, and to consider management in the
   form of either cutting or grazing by lactating cows. Results from
   simulations under current conditions agreed favourably with measured
   data for yield and C stocks, and model behaviour appeared to be
   plausible. Elevated CO2 alone or in combination with increased
   temperature stimulated NPP at all sites. The stimulation was positively
   related to increasing precipitation at dry sites, but negatively at cool
   sites. Climate change scenarios in combination with elevated CO2 led to
   increase C stocks. The sensitivity of C stocks to changes in temperature
   and precipitation was similar, and much larger than to management.
   Grazing led to higher C stocks compared with cutting, depending mainly
   on the difference in NPP between the management options. Grazing had a
   positive effect on C stocks under cool conditions, but the effect tended
   to become negative with increasing temperature. Comparing different
   sites revealed that local conditions affect system behaviour
   qualitatively. In quantitative terms, the results confirm that the
   combination of elevated CO2 and climate change affects NPP and C stocks,
   and that the influence of management is site-specific. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The plus-maze discriminative avoidance paradigm is a new animal model of
   learning/memory that provides simultaneous information about anxiety.
   Mice are conditioned to choose between the two enclosed arms tin one of
   which light and noise are presented as aversive stimuli) while avoiding
   the two open arms of the apparatus. The test has the advantage of
   measuring, at the same time and in the same animals, learning/memory (by
   the percent time spent in aversive enclosed arm - PTAV) and anxiety (by
   the percent time spent in the open arms - PTO). The effects of
   chlordiazepoxide and caffeine on learning/memory and anxiety of mice
   tested in this paradigm were investigated. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg)
   significantly increased and caffeine (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased
   PTO during the training session, suggesting an anxiolytic and an
   anxiogenic effect, respectively. In the test session, chlordiazepoxide-
   or caffeine-treated mice presented higher PTAV, suggesting amnestic
   effects. Given together, chlordiazepoxide plus caffeine did not alter
   PTO, and the amnesic effect produced by each drug was no longer
   observed. It is concluded that learning/memory depends on an optimum
   emotional level. The pins-maze discriminative avoidance model appears to
   be a useful test to investigate this critical relationship between
   learning/memory and anxiety. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We have studied the ionization behaviour close to threshold for the
   fragment ion production from CF(4), CHF(3), CH(4) and C(3)H(8). In
   particular, we use a reliable method to extrapolate weak ion signals
   towards the appearance energy. Our evaluation is based on an extension
   of Wannier's law for the ionization of atoms towards the case of
   polyatomic molecules. In the experiment we use a hemispherical electron
   monochromator with an energy resolution of approximate to 135 meV. The
   vibrationally cold target molecules are prepared in a supersonic
   expansion and the resulting ions are mass analysed using a quadrupole
   mass spectrometer. We observe several disagreements with recommended
   ionization energy values, reaching up to 5 eV in the CHF3 case. This is
   in contrast to a number of recent reliability tests that we have
   performed on Ne, Ar, Kr,Xe, H(2), D(2), N(2), O(2) and N(2)O and that
   have reproduced the tabulated literature data within the resolution of

Abstract = {{The first results for electron emission associated with dissociative and
   non-dissociative capture processes in low velocity O-18(8+) + CO2
   collisions are discussed. The electron spectrum is very similar to those
   obtained with heavy atomic targets; it is typical of multiple capture
   processes followed by autoionizing cascades, with strong lines
   superimposed on a weak continuum. No indication of a molecule target
   effect is found. It is shown that detailed information can be extracted
   from the dissociation patterns which concern the excitation of the
   target. As an example, the population of O6+(4l4l') states is analysed
   thoroughly. It is shown to correspond mainly to a double capture process
   accompanied by a target excitation. When the autoionization has
   occurred, the target dissociates into various channels for which kinetic
   energy release distributions are obtained. The similarity between the
   present findings and photoionization data is emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{A hypotheses that mitoxantrone is a competitive antagonist at muscarinic
   cholinergic receptors was examined in guinea-pig hearts. In isolated
   left atrial muscle preparations, electrically paced at 2 Hz, the
   muscarinic agonist, carbachol, caused a concentration-dependent decrease
   in developed tension. Mitoxantrone caused a parallel right-ward shift of
   the concentration-response curve for carbachol. Schild plots for the
   effect of mitoxantrone on the carbachol concentration-response
   relationship were linear with a slope of 0.88 which was not
   significantly different from the unity. The right-ward shift of the
   carbachol concentration-response relationship by mitoxantrone
   significantly reversed after an additional incubation with a
   mitoxantrone-free solution, although the reversal was incomplete after a
   2-h incubation in the mitoxantrone-free solution. Mitoxantrone caused a
   concentration-dependent displacement of specific {[}H-3]quinuclidinyl
   benzilate binding to membrane preparations obtained from ventricular
   muscles of guinea-pig hearts. These results indicate that mitoxantrone
   acts as a competitive antagonist for the muscarinic receptors. (C) 2000

   increase brain 5-HT function although recent preclinical findings
   indicate that their selectivity for 5-HT over noradrenaline may be less
   evident in vivo. The present study investigated the effects of the SSRI,
   paroxetine, on extracellular levels of noradrenaline.
   Microdialysis was carried out in the hippocampus of the awake rat. In
   rats treated twice daily for 14 days with paroxetine (5 mg/kg s.c.),
   dialysate levels of noradrenaline showed a maintained two-fold increase
   compared to saline-injected controls. Paroxetine (5 mg/kg s.c.)
   administered once daily fur 14 days did not cause a sustained increase
   in noradrenaline but levels showed a moderate (+58\%) increase in
   response to a paroxetine challenge. Acute injection of paroxetine (5
   mg/kg s.c.) did not elevate noradrenaline levels. Paroxetine (5 mg/kg
   s.c.) elevated dialysate 5-HT after both acute and repeated (twice daily
   for 14 days) treatment. The paroxetine-induced increase in noradrenaline
   (and 5-HT) was positively correlated with plasma concentrations of the:
   drug, which were around the therapeutic range. In comparison to
   paroxetine, desipramine (10 mg/kg s.c.) caused a four-fold increase in
   dialysate noradrenaline (but did not change 5-HT) following repeated
   (once daily for 14 days) treatment and a two-fold increase at for acute
   treatment.
   In summary, despite its selectivity as a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor,
   paroxetine increased extracellular levels of noradrenaline in rat
   hippocampus following repeated administration. We discuss the
   possibility that a facilitation of noradrenaline function might be
   involved in the antidepressant effect of paroxetine, and possibly other
   SSRIs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. To estimate the annual incidence of distal forearm fractures in
   New Zealand children and to describe circumstances associated with this
   fracture.
   Methods. The ages and dates of fracture of all girls and boys aged three
   to fifteen years with distal forearm fractures treated at Fracture
   Clinic, Dunedin Public Hospital in one calendar year were recorded.
   Results. The age-standardised annual incidence rates for Dunedin girls
   and boys aged three to fifteen years were 10.4 per 1000 (95\% CI
   8.3-12.4 per 1000), and 10.4 per 1000 (95\% CI 8.3-12.6 per 1000),
   respectively. The peak incidence in girls was observed at ten years of
   age (23.5 fractures per 1000) and for boys at thirteen years of age
   (25.3 fractures per 1000). Extrapolation of these rates to all New
   Zealand suggest that in children aged three to fifteen years, 3659 (95\%
   CI 2906 - 4413) distal forearm fractures occur per year in girls, and
   3845 (95\% CI 3087 - 4603) per year in boys, representing about 20
   fractures per day. Many of the fractures for the girls and boys resulted
   from apparently slight trauma (62.2\% and 61.6\%, respectively).
   Conclusions. Distal forearm fractures are very common events in New
   Zealand children and adolescents, and are usually caused by apparently
   slight trauma.}},

Abstract = {{Doxorubicin (DOX) is a broad spectrum anthracycline antibiotic used to
   treat a variety of cancers. Redox activation of DOX to form reactive
   oxygen species has been implicated in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, In
   this work we investigated DOX-induced apoptosis in cultured bovine
   aortic endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes isolated from adult rat
   heart. Exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells or myocytes to
   submicromolar levels of DOX induced significant apoptosis as measured by
   DNA fragmentation and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated
   nick-end labeling assays, Pretreatment of cells with 100 muM nitrone
   spin traps, N-tert-butyl-alpha -phenylnitrone (PBN) or
   alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN) dramatically
   inhibited DOX-induced apoptosis, Ebselen (20-50 muM), a glutathione
   peroxidase mimetic, also significantly inhibited apoptosis, DOX (0.5-1
   muM) inactivated mitochondrial complex I by a superoxide-dependent
   mechanism. PEN (100 muM), POBN (100 muM), and ebselen (50 muM) restored
   complex I activity. These compounds also inhibited DOX-induced caspase-3
   activation and cytochrome c release. PEN and ebselen also restored
   glutathione levels in DOX-treated cells. We conclude that nitrone spin
   traps and ebselen inhibit the DOX-induced apoptotic signaling mechanism
   and that this antiapoptotic mechanism may be linked in part to the
   inhibition in formation or scavenging of hydrogen peroxide. Therapeutic
   strategies to mitigate DOX cardiotoxicity should be reexamined in light
   of these emerging antiapoptotic mechanisms of antioxidants.}},

Abstract = {{The herpesvirus protein VP22 traffics between cells, being exported from
   expressing cells in a non-Golgi-dependent manner and localizing in the
   nuclei of surrounding cells. This transport is retained in certain VP22
   fusion proteins, making VP22 a candidate for use in macromolecular drug
   delivery. In an effort to understand the physical basis for this
   activity, we have initiated structural studies of VP22.C1, the
   C-terminal half of VP22, which possesses the full transport activity of
   the native protein. CD and Fourier transform infrared analyses indicate
   a secondary structure consisting of approximately 30\% alpha -helix,
   17\% beta -sheet, and 51\% disordered and turn structure. Unfolding
   studies conducted by CD, differential scanning calorimetry, and
   fluorescence reveal a series of discrete structural transitions in the
   range of 20-60 degreesC, CD and fluorescence studies of interactions
   between VP22.C1 and divalent cations and model polyanions indicate that
   Mg2+, Zn2+, oligonucleotides, and heparin interact with the protein,
   causing changes in secondary structure and thermal stability.
   Additionally, the interaction of VP22.C1 with model lipids was examined.
   Fluorescence titrations of the protein with trans-parinaric acid at
   various temperatures suggest the binding of one to two molecules of
   parinaric acid to VP22.C1 at temperatures >40 degreesC, suggesting the
   possibility of conformation dependent membrane interaction under
   physiological conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of the Nac-coupled glucose cotransporter SGLT1 is regulated
   post-transcriptionally at the level of mRNA stability. We have
   previously demonstrated that cAMP-dependent stabilization of the SGLT1
   message was correlated with the protein phosphorylation-dependent
   binding of cytoplasmic proteins to a uridine-rich sequence (URE) in the
   3'-untranslated region (UTR). In the present study, the regulatory role
   of the URE was demonstrated by inserting it into the 3'-UTR of a beta
   -globin reporter minigene under the control of the
   tetracycline-regulated promoter. The resultant chimeric globin/SGLT1
   mRNA expressed after transfection into LLC-PK1 cells exhibited a
   decreased half-life compared with the beta -globin control, indicating
   that the URE serves a destabilizing function, Activation of protein
   kinase A stabilized the chimeric message but not the beta -globin
   control, indicating the presence of a regulatory stabilizing sequence
   within the URE. A 38-kDa nucleocytoplasmic protein was identified that
   recognized a 12-nucleotide binding site within the URE, A mutation in
   this binding site that prevented protein binding assayed in vitro by UV
   cross-linking also prevented protein kinase A-dependent stabilization of
   the chimeric message assayed in vivo, These findings identify the
   interaction between a 38-kDa nucleocytoplasmic protein and a regulatory
   uridine-rich sequence in the 3'-UTR as critical for cAMP-mediated SGLT1
   message stabilization.}},

Abstract = {{The role and control of the four rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation
   sites that govern the association of PHAS-I with the mRNA cap-binding
   protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), were investigated by
   using newly developed phospho-specific antibodies. Thr(P)-36/45
   antibodies reacted with all three forms of PHAS-I that were resolved
   when cell extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis. Thr(P)-69 antibodies bound the forms of intermediate
   and lowest mobility, and Ser(P)-64 antibodies reacted only with the
   lowest mobility form. A portion of PHAS-I that copurified with eIF4E
   reacted with Thr(P)-36/45 and Thr(P)-69 antibodies but not with
   Ser(P)-64 antibodies. Insulin and/or amino acids increased, and
   rapamycin decreased, the reactivity of all three antibodies with PHAS-I
   in both HEK293 cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Immunoprecipitated
   epitope-tagged mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylated
   Thr-36/45. mTOR also phosphorylated Thr-69 and Ser-64 but only when
   purified immune complexes were incubated with the activating antibody,
   mTAb1, interestingly, the phosphorylation of Thr-69 and Ser-64 was much
   more sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin-FKBP12 than the
   phosphorylation of Thr-36/45, and the phosphorylation of Ser-64 by mTOR
   was facilitated by phosphorylation of Thr-SG, Thr-45, and Thr-69. In
   these respects the phosphorylation of PHAS-I by mTOR in vitro resembles
   the ordered phosphorylation of PHAS-I in cells.}},

Abstract = {{The cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria is abundant with complex
   glycolipids whose roles in disease pathogenesis are mostly unknown.
   Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of the specific
   trisaccharide unit of the phenolic glycolipid-1 (PGL-1) of Mycobacterium
   leprae in determining the bacterial predilection to the peripheral
   nerve. PGL-1 binds specifically to the native laminin-2 in the basal
   lamina of Schwann cell-axon units. This binding is mediated by the alpha
   2LG1, alpha 2LG4, and alpha 2LG5 modules present in the naturally
   cleaved fragments of the peripheral nerve laminin alpha2 chain, and is
   inhibited by the synthetic terminal trisaccharide of PGL-1. PGL-1 is
   involved in the M. leprae invasion of Schwann cells through the basal
   lamina in a laminin-2-dependent pathway. The results indicate a novel
   role of a bacterial glycolipid in determining the nerve predilection of
   a human pathogen.}},

Abstract = {{We have targeted the activation of an endogenous chromosomal locus
   including the human erythropoietin gene using synthetic transcription
   factors. These transcription factors are targeted to particular DNA
   sequences in the 5'-flanking region of the erythropoietin gene through
   engineering of a zinc finger DNA binding domain. The DNA binding domain
   is linked to a VP16 transcriptional activation domain. We find that
   these synthetic transcription factors invariably activate transiently
   transfected templates in which sequences within the 5' flank of the
   erythropoietin gene are fused to a luciferase reporter. The efficiency
   of activation under these circumstances at a defined site is dependent
   on DNA binding affinity. In contrast, only a subset of these same zinc
   finger proteins is able to activate the endogenous chromosomal locus.
   The activity of these proteins is influenced by their capacity to gain
   access to their recognition elements within the chromatin
   infrastructure, Zinc finger transcription factors will provide a
   powerful tool to probe the determinants of chromatin accessibility and
   remodeling within endogenous chromosomal loci.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Intrathecal administration of morphine produces intense
   analgesia, but it depresses respiration, an effect that can be
   life-threatening. Whether intrathecal morphine affects the ventilatory
   response to hypoxia, however, is not known.
   Methods: We randomly assigned 30 men to receive one of three study
   treatments in a double-blind fashion: intravenous morphine (0.14 mg per
   kilogram of body weight) with intrathecal placebo; intrathecal morphine
   (0.3 mg) with intravenous placebo; or intravenous and intrathecal
   placebo. The selected doses of intravenous and intrathecal morphine
   produce similar degrees of analgesia. The ventilatory response to
   hypercapnia, the subsequent response to acute hypoxia during hypercapnic
   breathing (targeted end-tidal partial pressures of expired oxygen and
   carbon dioxide, 45 mm Hg), and the plasma levels of morphine and
   morphine metabolites were measured at base line (before drug
   administration) and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after drug
   administration.
   Results: At base line, the mean (+/-SD) values for the ventilatory
   response to hypoxia (calculated as the difference between the minute
   ventilation during the second full minute of hypoxia and the fifth
   minute of hypercapnic ventilation) were similar in the three groups:
   38.3+/-23.2 liters per minute in the placebo group, 33.5+/-16.4 liters
   per minute in the intravenous-morphine group, and 30.2+/-11.6 liters per
   minute in the intrathecal-morphine group (P=0.61). The overall
   ventilatory response to hypoxia (the area under the curve) was
   significantly lower after either intravenous morphine (20.2+/-10.8
   liters per minute) or intrathecal morphine (14.5+/-6.4 liters per
   minute) than after placebo (36.8+/-19.2 liters per minute) (P=0.003).
   Twelve hours after treatment, the ventilatory response to hypoxia in the
   intrathecal-morphine group (19.9+/-8.9 liters per minute), but not in
   the intravenous-morphine group (30.5+/-15.8 liters per minute), remained
   significantly depressed as compared with the response in the placebo
   group (40.9+/-19.0 liters per minute) (P=0.02 for intrathecal morphine
   vs. placebo). Plasma concentrations of morphine and morphine metabolites
   either were not detectable after intrathecal morphine or were much lower
   after intrathecal morphine than after intravenous morphine.
   Conclusions: Depression of the ventilatory response to hypoxia after the
   administration of intrathecal morphine is similar in magnitude to, but
   longer-lasting than, that after the administration of an equianalgesic
   dose of intravenous morphine.}},

Abstract = {{Silicate apatites called britholites have been studied due to their
   potential application as materials in the form of nuclear waste for the
   containment of actinides. The luminescence study of EU3+ in the solid
   solution Ca10-xLax(SiO4)(y)(PO4)(6-y)O(2)square(2-z) (with z=1S1/2(x-y))
   allows us to predict the location of an eventual actinide ion and
   provide structural information on the expected behaviour of the
   structure towards irradiation damage. The luminescence study confirms
   the preferential location of the EU3+ ion in the 6h site (C-s point
   symmetry) of the space group P6(3)/m, where a strong crystal field due
   to Eu3+-O(4) bond occurs. This bond competes with oxygen SiO4 and PO,
   tetrahedra and the competing is found to be stronger when silicate
   groups are present. This is because silicate tetrahedra are less compact
   than phosphate tetrahedra and are able to approach EU3+ much closer. It
   is also shown that the crystal field strength decreases with silicate
   content, The luminescence spectra tend towards those which are more
   common of Eu3+ luminescence in which phosphates are doped with rare
   earth ions. The spectra of luminescence versus temperature confirms that
   the crystal field between Eu3+(6h)-O(4) is stronger when the temperature
   is low aid the cell parameters are small. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Abstract = {{To assess the in situ impact of oysters Crassostrea gigas on planktonic
   protist and bacteria communities and the potential contribution of
   protozoa to their food resource intake, the abundance and the diversity
   of protists and bacteria were followed in 2 Atlantic coastal ponds, with
   and without oysters. The protist biomass in such ponds was high, with a
   maximum in spring of 982 mug C l(-1) and a minimum in winter of 179 pg C
   l(-1). Whatever the season, the presence of oysters (20 m(-2)
   corresponding to an average of 23 mg dry weight m(-2)) induced a
   significant decrease in >5 pm protist abundance. On the contrary,
   planktonic organisms <5 pm, such as Chlorophyta flagellates and
   bacteria, developed similarly in both ponds. It can be assumed that such
   depletion in micro-sized protists was especially related to the grazing
   activity of C. gigas, which efficiently retains >5 pm particles. In
   spring, oyster grazing triggered dramatic changes in the protist
   community by lowering the taxonomic diversity. In autumn and winter, the
   presence of oysters deeply influenced the taxonomic structure of the
   protist communities: > Fun protists could only develop in the control
   pond, whereas they were removed by filtration in the oyster pond; on the
   contrary, >5 Fun protists that were not retained were favoured in the
   oyster pond. The results showed that hetero/mixotrophic protists
   represent an important potential resource in coastal ponds: flagellates
   >5 pm were the main protist resource for C. gigas; ciliates represented
   the second resource, with a substantial contribution in autumn; diatoms
   and dinoflagellates, though efficiently removed, represented a weak
   carbon resource. Our study supports the hypothesis that oysters may
   access the strong bacterioplanktonic production through
   hetero/mixotrophic protists, which would thus allow the transfer of
   carbon from the microbial loop towards C. gigas.}},

Abstract = {{Calculations of the relative stability of C-118, C-119, and C-120, pure
   carbon species with both trivalent and tetravalent atoms, show the
   interplay between the various forms of molecular carbon and under which
   conditions they are thermodynamically accessible. The analysis is
   performed by quantum chemical screening of all the classical fullerenes
   with isolated pentagons (8148 isomers for C-118 and 10774 isomers for
   C-120) for comparison with the most stable structure of C-119 and C-60
   dimer. While fullerenes show similar trends of stability over a range of
   temperatures, introduction of sp(3) carbons profoundly affects them. It
   is concluded that very high synthetic temperatures may favor formation
   of clusters with tetravalent atoms.}},

Abstract = {{Immobilized DNA membranes prepared by binding between DNA and poly(gamma
   -methyl-L-glutamate) membranes having a cis-diaminedichloro platinum
   group-generated oscillation of the membrane potential under a
   concentration gradient of several salts at frequencies between 0 and 5
   Hertz at pH 7.0, although nonmodified poly(gamma -methyl-L-glutamate)
   membranes showed a constant potential. The amplitude of oscillation
   depended on the length of the joint segments between the DNA and
   poly(gamma -methyl-L-glutamate) membranes; the immobilized DNA membranes
   modified with diaminopropane and diaminobutane showed a high oscillation
   amplitude (e.g., 4-5 mV). It was also influenced by the salts used, and
   the highest oscillation amplitude in the membrane potential across the
   immobilized DNA membranes modified with diaminobutane was observed when
   NaCl was used as the salt solution. Fast Fourier transport analysis
   revealed that the oscillation of the membrane potential had several
   specific frequencies depending on the salt solution and the immobilized
   DNA membranes used. Recognition of the model endocrine disrupters (i.e.,
   dibenzo-p-dioxin and biphenyl) from the oscillation of the membrane
   potential was performed in the immobilized DNA membranes. The drastic
   decrease in the membrane potential and the decrease in magnitude of the
   power spectra were observed in the immobilized DNA membranes modified
   with hexamethylenediamine after the immobilized DNA membranes were
   immersed in the saturated solution of dibenzo-p-dioxin. It was
   qualitatively possible to recognize intercalating molecules of DNA
   including the endocrine disrupters from the membrane potential
   oscillation data of the immobilized DNA membranes.}},

Abstract = {{The resonance Raman spectra of LDS750 in methanol-h(4) and methanol-d(4)
   have been determined at excitation wavelengths on the blue side of the
   absorption maximum. In contrast to our previous studies of the
   solvatochromic molecule betaine-30, Raman intensities of LDS750 are
   observed to be independent of solvent isotopomer. The fluorescence
   quantum yield, however, was significantly larger in methanol-clr than in
   methanol-h(4) The results suggest that the dephasing dynamics that
   determine the resonance Raman intensities are dominated by
   intramolecular relaxation rather than solvent motion. Excited-state
   population relaxation, on the other hand, is perturbed by solvent
   isotope and the more intense emission in deuterated solvent is a
   consequence of less favorable Franck-Condon factors for radiationless
   decay. The radiative lifetime calculated from the quantum yield and
   fluorescence lifetime is considerably longer than that found using the
   Strickler-Berg equation, suggesting that the transition moment in the
   relaxed geometry is reduced from that in the Franck-Condon geometry. Our
   conclusions concerning excited state dynamics in LDS750 are compared
   with those obtained from time-domain measurements on this dye.}},

Abstract = {{Hox gene products, initially characterized as master regulators of
   embryonic patterning, are also required for proper functioning of adult
   tissues. There is also a growing body of evidence that links Hox
   proteins to regulation of cellular proliferation/transformation.
   However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Hox-associated
   transformation and tissue growth have yet to be elucidated. Using a well
   established model system for studying changes in cellular proliferation
   induced by Hoxb4, we show that AP-I activity is markedly increased in
   Hoxb4-transduced cells due to significant upregulation of Jun-B and
   Fra-1 protein levels, Furthermore, we also show that the specific
   changes in AP-1 protein expression are necessary for the proliferation
   effects induced by Hoxb4, and that these changes converge to increase
   levels of cyclin D1, a known integrator of proliferation signals. Our
   observations thus link Hox gene products with key elements of the cell
   cycle machinery.}},

Abstract = {{A structural modification method based on frequency response functions
   is presented in terms of an inverse eigenvalue problem. The design
   objective is to derive multiple lumped mass, damper and stiffness
   modifications needed to reallocate eigenvalues and specify eigenvectors
   of an existing structure. A frequency response function-based
   substructure-coupling concept is used to get the system dynamic
   equations. A linear algebraic equation is finally obtained to identify
   the necessary structural modifications. The exact structural
   modifications are determined. The existence and uniqueness of exact
   solutions are also investigated. The feasibility of structural
   modification is examined under the restrictions of structural
   modifications in the case where infinite many exact modifications can
   exist. The proposed method was applied to an example structure. Based on
   experiment data, the minimum stiffness modifications were calculated.
   The result of application indicates that the suggested method can derive
   accurate structural changes just based on minimum number of measured
   frequency response functions. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   enhanced affinity compared to their non-fluorinated congeners as judged
   from H-1 NMR, F-19 NMR, and fluorescence emission spectroscopic

   displaying an affinity for H2PO4- that was improved by 3 orders of

Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{A methodology is presented for estimating the probability of a flood
   occurring on a particular catchment from heavy convective rain, at a
   lead-time of up to seven days. The procedure is based upon the physical
   characteristics of the land surface, which are remotely measured at a
   resolution of the order of 1 km. The sensible heat flux derived from
   these measurements is used to initialise a simple convective scheme and
   the vertical velocities of ascending parcels of air at the top of the
   atmospheric boundary layer estimated. The precipitable water content of
   the atmosphere is parameterised by a probability density function. The
   combination of this with the vertical velocity of the air leads to the
   derivation of the probability of occurrence of a flood-producing
   convective rainfall event.
   The system has been tested for a limited period over the River Irwell
   catchment in the Northwest of England and the results show some
   correlation between the predicted probabilities and actual convective
   rainfall observed. However, as the result of the procedure is
   probabilistic, a much longer trial is required to assess its
   reliability. This paper describes the physical basis for the proposed
   scheme and the limitations and weaknesses of the procedure are outlined.
   The case study is presented and followed by a discussion of the steps
   required to develop the model further and prepare it for possible
   operational situations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Two mutant strains of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) were investigated with
   respect to virion stability and molecular determinants of aphid vector
   transmission. The mutant 2A1-MT-60x, derived from the mechanically
   passaged wild type 2A1-AT, is poorly transmissible by the aphid Aphis
   gossypii and not transmissible by the aphid Myzus persicae, whereas the
   wild type virus is transmissible by both aphid species. The mutant
   phenotype was shown to be conferred by a single encoded amino acid
   change of alanine to threonine at position 162 of the coat protein (CP).
   Modifying the mutant CP gene to encode the wild type sequence (alanine)
   at position 162 restored aphid transmission. To test for a
   correspondence between changes in the physical stability of virions and
   defects in aphid transmission. a urea disruption assay was developed.
   Virions of aphid-transmissible strains 2A1-AT and CMV-Fny were stable
   with treatments of up to between 3 and 4 M urea. In this assay mutant
   viruses 2A1-MT-60x and CMV-M were less stable, as they were completely
   disrupted at urea concentrations of 2 and 1 M urea, respectively. The
   mutant 2A1-MT-60x also accumulated at a reduced level in infected squash
   relative to the wild type virus. These studies suggest that a primary
   factor in the loss of aphid transmissibility of some strains of CMV is a
   reduction in virion stability. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{We present CCD UBV RI and H alpha photometry for the starburst cluster
   associated with the galactic giant H II region NGC 3603. The mean
   reddening of the cluster members comes out to be {[}E(B-V )] =
   1.48+/-0.21 (s.d.). The surface distribution of the reddening shows a
   radial variation with a minimum near to the cluster center and two local
   maxima at radii similar to 30{''} and similar to 70{''}. Our photometric
   data indicate an anomalous reddening law for the dust inside the cluster
   region, and the ratio of the total to the selective extinction, R, is
   found to be similar to 4.3. A comparison of the observational and
   intrinsic colour-magnitude digrams (CMDs) yields a mean distance modulus
   of (m - M)(0) = 14.0, which corresponds to a distance of 6.3 +/- 0.6
   kpc. This distance is smaller than those obtained in earlier works
   (e.g., 7.2 kpc, Melnick et al. 1989, AAA 49.132.013) but is in good
   agreement with the kinematic distance (6.1 +/- 0.6 kpc) recently
   reported by De Free et al. (1999, AAA 71.132.041). The cluster shows a
   large age spread, containing stars as old as up to several Myr. However,
   the mean age of the cluster is found to be less than or equal to 1 Myr.
   We estimate a minimum star formation efficiency of similar to 25\% and a
   gas removal time of tau similar to 4.6 Myr.}},

Abstract = {{Endogenous circadian rhythms have been described in a wide range of
   organisms from prokaryotes to man. Although basic circadian mechanisms
   at the molecular level are genetically fixed, certain properties of
   circadian rhythms at the organismic level can be; modified by
   environmental conditions and subsequently retained for some time, even
   in organisms shielded from 24-hr environmental variations. To
   investigate the capacity of animals to acquire and store photoperiodic
   information, we examined activity and melatonin rhythms in house
   sparrows during synchronization to two different photoperiods and during
   subsequent prolonged darkness. Under constant environmental conditions,
   intact animals continued to have long feeding activity times when
   previously exposed to long days and short feeding activity times when
   previously exposed to short days. Correspondingly, significantly
   different durations of elevated melatonin in the plasma directly
   reflected the differences in night length during synchronization as well
   as during prolonged darkness. Additionally, we found a significant
   difference in the amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin signal, which
   also was conserved in prolonged darkness. To investigate whether the
   photoperiodic experience of an intact animal can be ``memorized{''} by
   an isolated component of its circadian pacemaking system, we have
   investigated in vitro melatonin release during continuous darkness from
   explanted pineal glands of house sparrows after in vivo synchronization
   to two distinct photoperiods. Differences in the durations of elevated
   melatonin occurred during the first two cycles in culture and a
   difference in melatonin: amplitude was detectable during the first night
   in culture. Our data indicate that photoperiodic patterns imposed on
   sparrows during in vivo synchronization can be maintained as an internal
   representation of time within the isolated pineal gland. Hence, the
   pineal gland, as one of the most significant components of the songbird
   circadian pacemaker, not only has the capacity to autonomously produce
   circadian rhythms of melatonin release but also is capable of storing
   biologically meaningful information experienced during previous cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To explore seizure outcome after surgery for focal epilepsy due
   to malformation of cortical development (MCD), with focus on the role of
   MRI. Methods: Thirty-five patients who had surgery for intractable focal
   epilepsy due to MCD identified by preoperative MRI and confirmed by
   histopathologic analysis of resected tissue were studied. Patients were
   aged 3 months to 47 years (median, 14 years) at the time of surgery.
   Duration of follow-up was 1 to 7.9 (mean, 3.4) years. Results: At latest
   follow-up, 17 patients (49\%) had Engel Class I outcome with no seizures
   or auras only; eight patients (23\%) had Class II outcome, with rare
   disabling seizures; seven patients (20\%) had worthwhile improvement;
   and three patients (9\%) had no improvement. Seizure-free outcome tended
   to be more frequent among patients who had complete resection of
   unilateral MCD (excluding hemimegaleneephaly) based on postoperative MRI
   (7/12; 58\%), compared with patients with unilateral MCD who had
   incomplete resection (3/11; 27\%), but the difference was not
   significant. The frequeney of seizure-free outcome did not differ
   significantly between children (8/14; 57\%), adolescents (7/15; 41\%) or
   adults (2/6; 33\%); between patients who had daily (12/24; 50\%), weekly
   (4/9; 44\%), or monthly (1/2; 50\%) seizures preoperatively; between
   patients who had temporal (2/6; 33\%) or extratemporal or multilobar
   resections (14/28; 50\%); or between patients who were (9/16; 56\%) or
   were not (8/19; 42\%) studied with subdural electrodes. Results for all
   analyses were similar when analyzed at latest available follow-up or at
   1 year after surgery. Conclusions: Surgery can offer seizure-free
   outcome for approximately one half of carefully selected patients with
   intractable focal epilepsy due to MCD. Complete resection of the
   MRI-apparent lesion may improve the likelihood for favorable outcome.
   MRI evidence of hemimegalencephaly or bilateral MCD suggests a low
   Likelihood for postoperative freedom from seizures.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a frequent form of idiopathic
   generalized epilepsy that is usually and easily controlled by valproate
   monotherapy. However, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is often misdiagnosed,
   and some drugs, especially carbamazepine and phenytoin, may have an
   aggravating effect, Objectives: To determine the risk of aggravation of
   juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in patients treated with carbamazepine and
   phenytoin. Methods: Among 170 consecutive patients with juvenile
   myoclonic epilepsy (104 female, 66 male) referred between 1981 and 1998,
   the authors retrospectively found 40 patients (23\%) who had received
   carbamazepine or phenytoin (duration of epilepsy at referral, 1 to 34
   years; mean +/- SD, 13.8 +/- 8.5 years; follow-up, 3 to 50 years; mean
   +/- SD, 16.4 +/- 11 years). Results: Twenty-three patients (57.5\%)
   experienced aggravation of seizures, whereas 6 (15\%) apparently
   benefited from these drugs. There was no effect in the remaining II
   cases (27.5\%). Carbamazepine was prescribed to 28 patients: 19 (68\%)
   had aggravated symptoms, including myoclonic status in two; 4 (14\%)
   were improved, one in association with valproate and one in association
   with valproate and phenobarbital. Phenytoin was prescribed in 16 cases:
   6 (38\%) had aggravation and 2 (12\%) were improved, including one in
   association with phenobarbital. Vigabatrin was given in only one case,
   in association with carbamazepine, and provoked a mixed absence and
   myoclonic status. Conclusions: Among commonly prescribed
   anticonvulsants, carbamazepine appears to have the strongest aggravating
   potential in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, whereas the
   aggravating effect of phenytoin is less prominent. Aggravation was
   mostly in the form of increased myoclonic jerks.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of zinc stearate on the properties of a new type of ionomer,
   namely, zinc salt of sulfonated maleated EPDM rubber (Zn-s-m-EPDM), were
   studied. The activation energy for viscous flow decreases in the
   presence of zinc stearate. Dynamic mechanical thermal analyses (DMTA)
   reveal that incorporation of zinc stearate causes an increase in E' at
   room temperature, but a sharp fall in E' at higher temperature (>100
   degrees C). While zinc stearate functions as a low reinforcing filler
   under ambient conditions, it acts as a plasticizer for the ionomer above
   its melting point (greater than or equal to 128 degrees C). The ionomer
   registers two peaks in the tan delta versus temperature plots, the
   low-temperature peak corresponding to the glass-rubber transition and
   the high-temperature peak corresponding to the relaxation of the
   immobile segments of the polymer chains adjacent to the ionic
   aggregates. Incorporation of zinc stearate strengthens the biphasic
   structure of the ionomer, as indicated by the increase in tan delta at
   the high-temperature relaxation temperature (T-i) and decrease in tan
   delta at the glass-rubber transition temperature (T-g). Dielectric
   thermal analyses (DETA) reveal that beyond its melting point (greater
   than or equal to 128 degrees C) zinc stearate acts as a plasticizer for
   Zn-s-m-EPDM. Incorporation of zinc stearate increases marginally the
   physical properties of the ionomer which displays the thermoplastic
   elastomeric characteristics. Reprocess-ability studies of the zinc
   stearate-filled composition show that the ionomer can be recycled
   without a decrease in properties. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we discuss the power of a pivoting transformation
   introduced by Castillo, Cobo, Jubete, and Pruneda {[}Orthogonal Sets and
   Polar Methods in Linear Algebra: Applications to Matrix Calculations,
   Systems of Equations and Inequalities, and Linear Programming John Wiley
   New York, 1999] and its multiple applications. The meaning of each
   sequential tableau appearing during the pivoting process is interpreted.
   It is shown that each tableau of the process corresponds to the inverse
   of a row modi ed matrix and contains the generators of the linear
   subspace orthogonal to a set of vectors and its complement. This
   transformation, which is based on the orthogonality concept, allows us
   to solve many problems of linear algebra, such as calculating the
   inverse and the determinant of a matrix, updating the inverse or the
   determinant of a matrix after changing a row ( column), determining the
   rank of a matrix, determining whether or not a set of vectors is
   linearly independent, obtaining the intersection of two linear
   subspaces, solving systems of linear equations, etc. When the process is
   applied to inverting a matrix and calculating its determinant, not only
   is the inverse of the final matrix obtained, but also the inverses and
   the determinants of all its block main diagonal matrices, all without

Abstract = {{Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a group of autosomal recessive MCA/MR
   syndromes characterized by pigmentary retinopathy, postaxial
   polydactyly, hypogenitalism, obesity, and mental retardation. Five BBS
   loci have been identified; among them, BBS type 1 (BBS1) and type 3
   (BBS3) are most common and most rare, respectively. We encountered an
   Iranian family that had seven affected members. All patients had a
   history of mild to severe obesity, but it was reversible in some
   patients by caloric restriction and exercise. All patients had
   pigmentary retinopathy, beginning as night blindness in early childhood
   and progressing toward severe impairment of vision by the end of the
   second decade. Polydactyly varied in limb distribution, ranging from
   four-limb involvement to random involvement or even to nonaffectedness.
   Six of the seven patients were not mentally retarded. Although kidney
   anomaly or an adrenal mass was present in two patients, the fact that
   one patient had seven children rules out reproductive dysfunction,
   Linkage analysis with microsatellite markers showed that the disease in
   the family was assigned to a region around marker loci at 3p13-p12
   (maximum LOD score = 4.15 and recombination fraction theta = 0, at
   D3S1603 microsatellite marker), to which the BBS3 locus has been mapped.
   Haplotype analysis did not reduce the extent of the previously reported
   critical region of BBS3, A comparison of clinical manifestations of our
   patients with those of previously reported BBS3 patients did not support
   any type-specific phenotypes, though manifestations in our patients are
   similar to those in BBS3 patients of a family in Newfoundland. Am. J.

Abstract = {{We investigate the one-triplet dispersion in a modified
   Shastry-Sutherland model for SrCu2(BO3)(2) by means of a series
   expansion about the limit of strong dimerization. Our perturbative
   method is based on a continuous unitary transformation that maps the
   original Hamiltonian to an effective, energy-quanta-conserving block
   diagonal Hamiltonian H-eff. The dispersion splits into two branches
   which are nearly degenerate. We analyse thr symmetries of the model and
   show that space group operations are necessary to explain the degeneracy
   of the dispersion at k = 0 and at the border of the magnetic Brillouin
   zone. Moreover, we investigate the behaviour of the dispersion for small
   /k/ and compare our results to inelastic neutron scattering data.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on the assessment of morbidity due to Schistosoma mansoni
   infection is updated. Imaging techniques such as ultrasonography,
   echodoppler cardiography, computerized tomography (CT scan) and magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) introduced a new perspective, and expanded our
   knowledge on morbidity. Three well-defined syndromes caused by
   schistosomiasis mansoni have been described: the stage of invasion,
   acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever), and chronic schistosomiasis.
   Complications of the acute and chronic syndromes have also been
   reported: pulmonary hypertension, neuroschistosomiasis, association with
   Salmonella, association with Staphylococci, viral hepatitis B,
   glomerulonephritis. In most individuals with hepatosplenic
   schistosomiasis the spleen is increased in size. Hepatosplenic
   schistosomiasis can, however, occur without splenomegaly. The definition
   of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis in endemic areas as the finding of S.
   mansoni eggs in the stools in an individual with hepatosplenomegaly is
   not satisfactory anymore. Many aspects of morbidity are expected to
   change after schistosomiasis control. Some are expected to change
   quickly (worm burden, Salmonella bacteremia, hepatosplenic
   schistosomiasis in children) whereas others shall remain for years
   (pulmonary hypertension, glomerulonephritis, neuroschistosomiasis).
   Intestinal schistosomiasis in individuals with low worm burdens is very
   difficult to diagnose and therefore laborious to control. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Background: Recently, measurement of plasma metanephrines was suggested
   to improve the detection of pheochromocytoma compared with the other
   common biochemical tests.
   Objective: To examine the diagnostic precision of measurements of plasma
   metanephrines, plasma catecholamines, and urinary catecholamines and to
   assess their variability.
   Methods: Plasma metanephrine as well as plasma and urinary catecholamine
   concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography
   with electrochemical detection. Before surgery, responses of plasma
   metanephrines and catecholamines to change of posture were determined.
   Intraoperatively, metanephrines and catecholamines were measured before
   skin incision, during maximal mechanical tumor manipulation, and
   repetitively after the tumor was separated from the circulation.
   Patients were reexamined 1 months after surgery. Patients with
   pheochromocytoma (n=17) and with histologically proved other adrenal
   tumors (n=14) were studied before, during, and after surgery.
   Results: Measurement of plasma metanephrines and plasma and urinary
   catecholamines provided 100\% and 82\% sensitivity, respectively, for
   the detection of pheochromocytoma (P<.001). Levels of plasma
   catecholamines but not metanephrines increased in response to change of
   posture (norepinephrine, P=.03; epinephrine, P=.07) and intraoperative
   stress (norepinephrine, P=.002; epinephrine, P=.009).
   Conclusions: Plasma metanephrines offer improved efficacy for the
   diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Less variability in response to external
   factors may favor plasma metanephrines in the screening for this
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Ground and lowest singlet excited state geometries of certain
   substituted benzenes (fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene, p-difluorobenzene,
   p-dichlorobenzene, p-fluorochlorobenzene and aniline) were optimized
   using the ab initio RHF procedure employing the 6-31+G{*} basis set. The
   calculations were also carried out using the 6-311++G{*}{*} basis set
   for two molecules. Excited states were generated using configuration
   interaction involving singly excited configuration (CIS). The calculated
   lowest singlet transition energies of the molecules agree with
   experimental ones satisfactorily. It is found that our calculations
   reproduce the ground and excited state rotational constants A, B and C
   of the molecules obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy quite well.
   Excited state geometries of the molecules have not been determined
   experimentally precisely but certain approximate estimates of the
   changes in bond lengths and bond angles consequent to excitation are
   available in the literature. There is a satisfactory agreement between
   these and our calculated changes in ring bond lengths and bond angles of
   the molecules consequent to excitation. Studies of excited state
   molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps are scarce in the
   literature. Our study of ground and excited state MEP maps of the
   molecules has revealed several interesting features some of which, e.g.
   the ortho, para directing property of the substituents in the ground
   state, are in agreement with experiment. It is indicated that reactions
   at the ortho, para positions in the ground state would take place in
   planes located much above the ring planes and there is an appreciable
   modification in this respect following excitation of the molecules. (C)

Abstract = {{The motion and heating of feedstock particles in the jet during plasma
   spraying have been simulated using a theoretical model based on a CFD
   code. The main parameters affecting particle behaviour are the particle
   diameter, powder injection velocity, the flow velocity and temperature

   interaction between the flow field characteristics and the particle
   parameters, which complicates the particle behaviour during spraying.
   The work demonstrates that particle velocity and surface temperature
   measurements provide limited information and a coherent computational
   model is required for process optimization. An end state of in-flight
   particles is proposed as a means of improving the methodology for the
   control of thermal spraying. Contour diagrams of end-state parameters
   against injection velocity and particle size are presented as a guide

Abstract = {{Iron clusters have been produced by CO2-laser-induced decomposition of
   iron pentacarbonyl in a flow reactor. The absorption of CO2 laser
   photons was achieved by using SF6 as a sensitizer. By adding an
   oxidizing gas, N2O, or a hydrocarbon, C2H4, molecules which are also
   dissociated in the laser field, the iron clusters may react with several
   radicals. The as-synthesized species are extracted from the reaction
   zone by a conical nozzle and expanded into the source chamber of a
   cluster beam apparatus where they are analyzed with a time-of-flight
   mass spectrometer. In the experiment with N2O, we observe a magic peak
   at m=856 amu which can be readily assigned to the particularly stable
   Fe13O8 cluster. If C2H4 is added to the reactant gas, the mass spectrum
   reveals a magic peak at mass m=884 amu. Using deuterated ethylene, the
   magic peak shifts by 12 amu to larger masses, indicating that the magic
   cluster contains 12 hydrogen atoms. With the given restrictions, we
   readily derive the molecular formula Fe13C12H12. Chemical stability and
   symmetry considerations suggest that the detailed chemical formula of
   the magic cluster is Fe-13(C2H2)(6) and that its structure corresponds
   to a Fe-13 icosahedron with six HC=CH or C=CH2 groups bound to six pairs
   of the 12 iron surface atoms. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{A new ab initio pair potential for water was generated by fitting 2510
   interaction energies computed by the use of symmetry-adapted
   perturbation theory (SAPT). The new site-site functional form, named
   SAPT-5s, is simple enough to be applied in molecular simulations of
   condensed phases and at the same time reproduces the computed points
   with accuracy exceeding that of the elaborate SAPT-pp functional form
   used earlier {[}J. Chem. Phys. 107, 4207 (1997)]. SAPT-5s has been shown
   to quantitatively predict the water dimer spectra, see the following
   paper (paper II). It also gives the second virial coefficient in
   excellent agreement with experiment. Features of the water dimer
   potential energy surface have been analyzed using SAPT-5s. Average
   values of powers of the intermolecular separation-obtained from the
   ground-state rovibrational wave function computed in the SAPT-5s
   potential-have been combined with measured values to obtain a new
   empirical estimate of the equilibrium O-O separation equal to 5.50
   +/-0.01 bohr, significantly shorter than the previously accepted value.
   The residual errors in the SAPT-5s potential have been estimated by
   comparison to recent large-scale extrapolated ab initio calculations for
   water dimer. This estimate-together with the dissociation energy D-0
   computed from SAPT-5s-leads to a new prediction of the limit value of
   D-0 equal to 1165 +/- 54 cm(-1), close to but significantly more
   accurate than the best empirical value. (C) 2000 American Institute of

Abstract = {{The Paracentrotus lividus mitochondrial D-loop binding protein (mtDBP)
   is a DNA-binding protein which is involved in the regulation of sea
   urchin mtDNA transcription. Immunoblots of Heparin Sepharose-bound
   proteins at selected early developmental stages, as well as
   electrophoretic mobility shift assay, show that mtDBP is present in the
   egg at a concentration of about 1 x 10(6) molecules/egg. Its level
   increases after fertilization of about twofold, remaining substantially
   unchanged between 16-h blastula stage and early pluteus stage and
   declines thereafter. The content of mtDBP mRNA, determined by RNase
   protection experiments, increases about sevenfold at the 16-h blastula
   stage compared to the egg. A considerable decrease occurs at the 40-h
   pluteus stage, which precedes that of the protein. These results suggest
   that the expression of mtDBP is regulated at transcriptional level up to
   blastula stage, while other factors, in addition to the level of the RNA
   may control the content of this protein in the following stages of
   embryogenesis. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   new mathematical analysis - based on Monte Carlo calculations - has been
   developed for the estimation of U-235 enrichment. The obtained results
   are found to be of comparable accuracy with the results obtained by the
   relative methods which necessitate the use of nuclear material

Abstract = {{Objectives To assess the ability of patients with binocular 6/9 or 6/12
   vision on the Snellen chart (Snellen acuity) to read a number plate at
   20.5 m (the required standard for driving) and to determine how health
   professionals advise such patients about driving.
   Design Prospective study of patients and postal questionnaire to
   healthcare professionals.
   Subjects 50 patients with 6/9 vision and 50 with 6/12 vision and 100
   general practitioners, 100 optometrists or opticians, and 100
   ophthalmologists.
   Setting Ophthalmology outpatient clinics in Sheffield.
   Main outcome measures Ability to read a number plate at 20.5 m and
   health professionals' advice about driving on the basis of visual
   acuity.
   Results 26\% of patients with 6/9 vision failed the number plate test,
   and 34\% with 6/12 vision passed it Of the general practitioners
   advising patients with 6/9 vision, 76\% said the patients could drive,
   13\% said they should not drive, and 11\% were unsure. Of the general
   practitioners advising patients with 6/12 vision, 21\% said the patients
   could drive, 54\% said they should not drive, and 25\% were unsure. The
   level of acuity at which optometrists, opticians, and ophthalmologists
   would advise drivers against driving ranged from 6/9(-2) (ability to
   read all except two letters on the 6/9 line of the Snellen chart) to
   less than 6/18.
   Conclusions Snellen acuity is a poor predictor of an individual's
   ability to meet the required visual standard for driving. Patients with
   6/9 vision or less should be warned that they may fail to meet this
   standard, but those with 6/12 vision should not be assumed to be below
   the standard.}},

   content of 30 mol\% CuO there is a limited increase in density. Both the
   electric resistivity and activation energy decrease with increasing CuO
   content. These changes are correlated with the distribution of the
   structural units in glass. There are specific changes for a CuO content:
   >30 mol\% in the density and the parameters of electric conduction. The
   changes are due to crystallization effects in such glasses. The electric
   conduction appears to be ionic with Pb2+ and Cu2+ as the charge

Abstract = {{Pathology findings: Cerebral amyloid angiopathies are defined by the
   presence of amyloid deposits on the wails of cerebral vessels. These
   amyloid deposits are found in the media of arterioles of the
   leptomeninges and the cortex. They are sometimes associated with
   Alzheimer-type lesions. Overt amyloid vasculopathy characterized by
   lesions of the vascular wall with a media totally replaced by amyloid
   substance may be observed.
   Clinical expression: Lobular hemorrhage, often with recurrent episodes
   is the most frequent manifestation of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
   Cerebral infarcts or leukoencephalopathy may also be observed. An
   association with cerebral angeitis has been reported in a few cases.
   Sporadic or familial disease: Several types can be distinguished
   depending on the sporadic or familiar nature of the disease pattern as
   well as the chemical make-up of the protein deposit. In sporadic
   cerebral amyloid angiopathy the deposit is composed of protein A beta,
   and in familial cases, of protein A beta, cystatine C, gelsosine or
   transthyretine. Mutation of the genes coding for amyloid substance
   constituents have been identified in diverse forms of familial cerebral
   amyloid angiopathy. (C) 2000, Masson, Paris.}},

Abstract = {{Further optical observations have been made with the Manchester
   Occulting Mask Imager and Manchester Echelle Spectrometer of the inner
   and outer shells of P Cygni, and of the 7-arcmin long giant lobe
   projecting from this luminous blue variable star.
   An image in the light of the fluorescently excited {[}Ni II]
   7378-Angstrom line has revealed the knottiness of the inner shell. Well
   defined `velocity ellipses' for the position/velocity arrays across the
   outer shell indicate that its expansion velocity is 160 km s(-1) which
   is somewhat lower than the previously reported value.
   The kinematical behaviour of the giant lobe, both in the vicinity of P
   Cygni, and further away, emphasizes its strange nature, although close
   association with P Cygni is again suggested by these new observations.
   One possibility is that this lobe is a `trail' of collimated ejected
   material.
   The observations are compared with a 60-mum IRAS high-resolution map of
   the region. A variety of possible explanations of the observed phenomena
   are explored, e.g. radio knots in the outer stellar wind either coalesce
   or expand to become the {[}Ni II]7378-Angstrom emitting knots in the
   inner shell; that a mass-loaded wind overunning slower moving clumps
   explains the kinematics of the inner shell; that the one-sided giant
   lobe could be a `trail' of ejected material from P Cygni funnelled
   through the outer shell.}},

Abstract = {{Iron loss in vitro by the iron scavenger bovine lactoferrin was
   investigated in acidic media in the presence of three different
   monoanions (NO3-, Cl- and Br-) and one dianion (SO42-). Hole and
   monoferric C-site lactoferrins lose iron in acidic media (pH less than
   or equal to 3.5) by a four-step mechanism. The first two steps describe
   modifications in the conformation affecting the whole protein, which
   occur also with apolactoferrin. These two processes are independent of
   iron load and are followed by a third step consisting of the gain of two
   protons. This third step is kinetically controlled by the interaction
   with two Cl-, Br- and NO3- or one SO42-. In the fourth step, iron loss
   is under the kinetic control of a slow gain of two protons; third-order
   rate-constants k(2), 4.3(+/-0.2) x 10(3), 3.4(+/-0.5) x 10(3),
   3.3(+/-0.5) x 10(3) and 1.5(+/-0.5)x 10(3) M-2 s(-1) when the protein is
   in interaction with SO42- NO3-, Cl- or Br-, respectively. accompanied by
   the loss of the interaction with the anions NO3-, Cl- or Br-,
   respectively. This step is accompanied by the loss of the interaction
   with the anions; equilibrium constant K-2, 20 +/- 5 mM, 1.0(+/-0.2) x
   10(-1), 1.5(+/-0.5) x 10(-1) and 1.0(+/-0.3) x 10(-1) M-2, for SO4-,
   NO3-, Cl- and Br-, respectively. This mechanism is very different from
   that determined in mildly acidic media at low ionic strength (mu < 0.5)
   for the iron transport proteins, serum transferrin and ovotransferrin,
   with which no prior change in conformation or interaction with anions is
   required. These differences may result from the fact that in the
   transport proteins, the interdomain hydrogen bonds that consolidate the
   closed conformation of the iron-binding cleft occur between amino acid
   side-chain residues that can protonate in mildly acidic media. With
   bovine lactoferrin, most of the interdomain hydrogen bonds involved in
   the C-site and one of those involved in the N-site occur between amino
   acid side-chain residues that cannot protonate. The breaking of the
   interdomain H-bond upon protonation can trigger the opening of the iron
   cleft, facilitating iron loss in serum transferrin and ovotransferrin.
   This situation is, however, different in lactoferrin, where iron loss
   requires a prior change in conformation. This can explain why
   lactoferrin does not lose its iron load in acidic media and why it is
   not involved in iron transport in acidic endosomes. (C) 2000 Academic

   gradients of Na+ and Ca2+ were manipulated to determine the involvement
   of the trans-membrane concentration gradients of these ions in the mode

Abstract = {{In order to define technical limitations of conventional external beam
   irradiation for clinically localized prostate cancer, we evaluated the
   impact of several reduced-field treatment factors, such as reduced-field
   (RF) irradiated volume, RF technique, photon energy of treatment, and
   dose on survival endpoints and local control in a retrospective series.
   Several survival endpoints, such as disease-specific survival, freedom
   from relapse survival, biochemical no-evidence of disease (bNED)
   survival, and local control were associated with several treatment
   variables using univariate and multivariate analyses in 329 patients.
   Reduced-field technique appeared to predict survival outcome, with
   patients treated by bilateral 120 degrees arcs faring less well than
   those treated by full 360 degrees rotational fields. The irradiated
   volume of the reduced-field was also significantly associated with
   survival outcome, with patients treated with smaller volumes faring less
   well. Local failure rates also appeared increased, although not
   statistically, in patients treated with smaller RF sizes. In an attempt
   to explain these detected deficiencies, dose-volume histograms for
   prostate coverage were created for a small sample of patients. The
   deficiencies related to small reduced-field volume appeared to be
   largely attributable to poor dosimetric coverage of the prostate. These
   results underscore the limitations of conventional external beam
   treatment for prostate carcinoma when conventional techniques are
   employed, particularly if small reduced fields are used, and further
   supports the development of improved treatment techniques, such as
   conformal irradiation, as alternatives. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

   Escherichia coli and is unusual because it is separately encoded and
   soluble. Both the crystal and solution structures of a IIBChb mutant
   (C10S) have been reported. In the present studies, homogeneous
   phospho-IIBChb was isolated, and the phosphoryl-Cys linkage was
   established by Slp NMR spectroscopy. Rate constants for the hydrolysis

   units. Evidence is presented for a stable complex between homogeneous
   Cys10SerIIB(Chb) (which cannot be phosphorylated) and phospho-IIA(Chb)
   but not with IIA(Chb). The complex (a tetramer (3)) contains equimolar
   quantities of the two proteins and has been chemically cross-linked. It
   appears to be an analogue of the transition state complex in the

Abstract = {{Studies reported here were undertaken to gain greater molecular insight
   into the complex structure of mitochondrial ATP synthase (F0F1) and its
   relationship to the enzyme's function and motor-related properties.
   Significantly, these studies, which employed N-terminal sequence, mass
   spectral, proteolytic, immunological, and functional analyses, led to
   the following novel findings. First, at the top of F-1 within F0F1, all
   six N-terminal regions derived from alpha + beta subunits are shielded,
   indicating that one or more F-0 subunits forms a ``cap.{''} Second, at
   the bottom of F-1 within F0F1, the N-terminal region of the single delta
   subunit and the C-terminal regions of all three alpha subunits are
   shielded also by F-0. Third, and in contrast, part of the gamma subunit
   located at the bottom of F-1 is already shielded in F-1, indicating that
   there is a preferential propensity for interaction with other F-1
   subunits, most likely delta and epsilon. Fourth, and consistent with the
   first two conclusions above that specific regions at the top and bottom
   of F-1 are shielded by F-0, further proteolytic shaving of alpha and
   beta subunits at these locations eliminates the capacity of F-1 to
   couple a proton gradient to ATP synthesis. Finally, evidence was
   obtained that the F-0 subunit called ``F-6,{''} unique to animal ATP
   syntheses, is involved in shielding F-1. The significance of the studies
   reported here, in relation to current views about ATP synthase structure
   and function in animal mitochondria, is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The complexes of Fe(III), Co(III), Mn(III), Al(III), Cu(II), Ni(II),
   Cd(II) and Zn(II) with
   N,N'-bis(hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (HBED) were
   separated by ion exchange in different modes: ion chromatography (IC)
   and ion electrokinetic chromatography (IEKC). In column IC these
   complexes were separated on an IonPac AS4a anion-exchange column
   (Dionex, USA). Parameters of the background electrolyte that were
   examined in IEKC mode include polymer, competing ion concentration and
   pH. The use of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMACl) as a
   modifier in IEKC provides separation selectivity only slightly different
   from that observed in IC on the IonPac AS4a column. Optimal separation
   conditions were found to be: 0.1 mM HEED, 50 mM PDADMAOH, 10 mM Na2B4O7,
   pH adjusted to 10 with acetic acid. The use of an aromatic ligand
   allowed a 10-fold decrease in detection limits of metal ions in
   comparison with previously studied EDTA. A separation efficiency up to
   400 000 theoretical plates was demonstrated for IEKC. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   estimated from an analysis of these spectra for the triplet rotational
   levels, coupled by the intramolecular interactions with the singlet
   levels studied. It was shown that the microwave power dependence differs
   significantly for different lines of the OD EPR spectrum. This
   difference can be explained by a model where the microwave held
   saturation effect is observed for different OD EPR lines at different
   power values of the microwave field. The decay profile can be fitted by
   a biexponential function in the presence of both magnetic and microwave
   fields. The observed data were analysed using the electron and nuclear

   activity; and a second site (specificity site) for dATP, ATP, dTTP, and

   specificity site had a 20-fold higher affinity than to the activity
   site. In all these respects, mouse R1 resembles Escherichia cold R1,
   Results with D57N were complicated by the instability of the protein,
   but two major changes were apparent. First, enzyme activity was
   stimulated by both dATP and ATP, suggesting that D57N no longer
   distinguished between the two nucleotides. Second, the two binding sites
   for dATP both had the same low affinity for the nucleotide, similar to
   that of the activity site of wild type R1, Thus the mutation in the
   activity site had decreased the affinity for dATP at the specificity
   site, demonstrating the interaction between the two sites.}},

Abstract = {{Glucagon gene expression is controlled by at least four DNA elements
   within the promoter; G2, G3, and G4 confer islet-specific expression,
   while G1 restricts glucagon transcription to Lu cells. Two
   islet-specific complexes are formed on G3, the insulin-responsive
   element of the glucagon gene; one of these corresponds to the paired
   homeodomain protein Pax-6, a major glucagon gene transactivator that
   plays a crucial role in alpha cell development. We describe here the
   identification of the second complex as Pax-2, another member of the
   paired box family. Pax-2 is known to be crucial for the development of
   the urogenital tract and of the central nervous system, but its presence
   in the endocrine pancreas has not been reported. We detected Pax-2 gene
   expression by RT-PCR; in islets, Pax-2 is present as two alternative
   splicing isoforms, Pax-2A and Pax-BE, whereas in the glucagon- and
   insulin-producing cell lines alpha TC1 and Min6, a distinct isoform,
   Pax-2D2, is found in addition to Pax-BE. Both islet-specific isoforms
   bind to the enhancer element G3 and to the alpha -specific promoter
   element G1 that also interacts with Pax-6. Pax-2A and Pax-BE
   dose-dependently activate transcription from the 63 and the G1 elements
   both in heterologous and in glucagon-producing cells. Our data indicate
   that Pax-a is the third paired domain protein present in the endocrine
   pancreas and that one of its roles may be the regulation of glucagon
   gene expression.}},

   Method: In two large French SEROCO and SEROGEST prospective cohorts of

   date of HIV-1 seroconversion was examined by comparing those who
   delivered after HIV infection (n = 241) with those who did not become

   Results: The crude relative risk of developing AIDS associated with
   pregnancy was 0.7 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-1.2]. Adjustment
   for age at seroconversion, the CD4+ cell percentage at entry, and the
   method used to date seroconversion did not modify the results (adjusted
   relative risk, 0.7; 95\% CI 0.4-1.2).
   Conclusions: No deleterious effect of pregnancy on progression from
   seroconversion to AIDS was found. This result has important implications

   ligands 1g-i having one carbon spacers X demonstrated higher degrees of
   enantiomeric excess up to 93\% ee. Interestingly, the present reactions
   catalyzed by Pd-1c-e,g-j complexes afforded the product 4 with the
   opposite absolute configuration S compared with the reactions using
   VALAP, which has the same chiral source as that of 1. The ligands 1a,b,f
   exhibited the induction of R configuration although the yields were very
   low. The production of S-4 was discussed on the basis of the Pr/Mr

Abstract = {{Theoretical infrared absorption spectra of aromatic ring molecules
   having up to 102 carbon atoms and with various edge hydrogenations have
   been obtained using a classic mechanical model and a simplified valence
   force field. Force constants have been adapted from those available for
   smaller molecules. Spectral line intensities are calculated in a double
   harmonic approximation with effective atomic charges obtained using a
   Huckel tight-binding Hamiltonian. Vibrational modes of clusters of like
   aromatic ring molecules are obtained through introduction of an
   interlayer force constant. These modes are predicted to occur in the
   wavelength range between 80 and 400 mum. We explore the effect of
   dehydrogenation on these spectra as well as hydrogenation of terminal C
   atoms in either aromatic or aliphatic form. Many spectra exhibit a
   quasi-continuum between 6 and 9 mum that arises from the overlap of many
   vibrational modes in this region. With CH2 edge groups, we find a new
   spectral feature near 16 mum and the aliphatic CH2 symmetric stretch
   vibration is found to shift from 3.5 to 3.3 mum when these groups are
   present at terminal sites on aromatic carbon skeletons. The relevance of
   calculated spectra to those of astronomical sources is briefly
   discussed.}},

   activating guanylate cyclase C (GCC) to increase intracellular cyclic
   GMP (cGMP). In the colon, cGMP action could involve protein kinase CPK)
   G-II or PKA pathways, depending on the segment and species. In the human
   colon, both PKG and PKA pathways have been implicated, and, therefore,
   the present study examined the mechanism of cGMP-mediated Cl- transport
   in primary cultures of human distal colonocytes and in T84, the colonic
   cell line. Both cell preparations express mRNA for CFTR, Na+-K+-2Cl(-)
   cotransporter (NKCC1), GCC and PKG-II as detected by RT-PCR. The effects
   of STa and the PKG-specific cGMP analogues, 8Br-cGMP and 8pCPT-cCMP, on
   Cl- transport were measured using a halide-sensitive probe. In primary
   human colonocytes and T84 cells, STa, the cCMP analogues and the
   cAMP-dependent secretagogue, prostaglandin E-1 (PGE(1)), enhanced Cl-
   transport. The effects of 8Br-cGMP and 8pCPT-cCMP suggested the
   involvement of PKG, and this was explored further in T84 cells. The
   effects of 8pCPT-cGMP were dose-dependent and sensitive to the PKG
   inhibitor, H8 (70 muM), but H8 had no effect on PGE(1)-induced Cl-
   secretion. In contrast, a PKA inhibitor, H7 (50 muM), blocked
   PGE(1)-mediated but not 8pCPT-cCMP-induced Cl- transport, 8pCPT-cGMP
   enhanced phosphorylation of the PKG-specific substrate, 2A3, by T84
   membranes in vitro. This phosphorylation was inhibited by Hs. These
   results strongly suggest that cGMP activates Cl- transport through a
   PKG-II pathway in primary cells and in the T84 cell line of the human
   colon. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organic ferromagnets, which exhibit exchange interactions between
   unpaired electrons in pi-orbitals, are rare(1-6), and the origin of
   ferromagnetism in these compounds has so far remained unexplained.
   Tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene-fullerene{[}60] (TDAE-C-60) shows a
   transition to a ferromagnetic state with fully saturated s = 1/2
   molecular spins at the relatively high Curie temperature (for organic
   materials) of 16 K (ref. 4). It has been suggested(7-9) that the
   orientations of the C-60 molecules may be important for ferromagnetism
   in this material, but in the absence of structural data at low
   temperatures there has been little progress towards understanding these
   microscopic interactions. Here we report the results of a comparative
   structural study of two different magnetic forms of TDAE-C-60 crystals
   at low temperatures, correlating the structural properties-in
   particular, the intermolecular orientations-with the magnetic
   properties. We rnd that both ferromagnetism and spin-glasslike ordering
   are possible in this material, and depend on the orientational state of
   C-60 molecules. This resolves the apparent contradictions posed by
   different macroscopic measurements(4,10-14), and opens the way to a
   microscopic understanding of pi-electron ferromagnetic exchange
   interactions in organic materials.}},

Abstract = {{The morphological manifestation of regular fractal patterns in ammonium
   chloride and the transition from ordinary to fractal morphology are
   studied at the crystallographic and molecular level by means of the
   Hartman-Perdok theory. The theoretically predicted growth forms as a
   function of growth conditions art: in excellent agreement with
   experimental results for growth out of vapor ((211) and (110)) and out
   of polar solutions ((211), (100), and/or (111)), in the ordinary as well
   as fractal morphological regimes. The (211) surface is (2 x
   1)-reconstructed due to internal or structural energy gain that persists
   in all growth conditions. The mechanism responsible for the onset of
   fractal growth in a gel containing water and agarose molecules is
   solution-induced reconstructive epitaxial nucleation (SIREN) between
   pseudoflat pyramidal (211) faces. SIREN is equivalent to the structural
   match between crystallites, anticipated in the macroscopic theory of
   nucleation and growth kinetics {[}Liu, X. Y.; Strom, C. S.: J, Chem.
   Phys. 2000, 113. In press.]. It is associated with an increase in the
   effective surface supersaturation, brought about by the surface
   poisoning of the agarose inhibitors. It is characterized by a critical
   length parameter (I) of the order of or lower than crystallite
   dimension, and a critical match parameter m --> 1, developed in that
   work.}},

Title = {{Experimental and theoretical characterization of long-lived triplet
   state CH3CH2S+ cations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY}},

Abstract = {{Gas-phase {[}C2H5S](+) ions obtained by electron impact ionization from
   CH3SC2H5 at 13 eV undergo three distinct low-pressure ion/molecule
   reactions with the parent neutral: proton transfer, charge transfer, and
   hydride abstraction. The kinetics of these reactions studied by FT-ICR
   techniques clearly suggests the {[}C2H5S](+) species to be a mixture of
   isomeric ions. While proton transfer and hydride abstraction are
   consistent with CH3CHSH+ and CH3SCH2+ reagent ions, the observed charge
   transfer strongly argues for the presence of thioethoxy cation,
   CH3CH2S+, predicted to be stable only in the triplet state. Charge
   transfer reactions only occur with substrates having an IE below 8.8 eV
   and thus yield an upper limit for he recombination energy of the
   CH3CH2S+ ions. Studies using CD3SC2H5 show that charge-transfer
   reactions are promoted by cations originating from a sulfur-methyl
   carbon bond cleavage. Ab initio calculations at several levels of theory
   predict that CH3CH2S+ ions are only stable in the triplet state.
   Calculations along the fragmentation pathway of the molecular ion reveal
   the tendency to generate triplet CH3CH2S+ ions upon cleavage of the
   sulfur-methyl carbon bond. Calculations were also carried out to
   determine the lifetime of triplet CH3CH2S+ using nonadiabatic RRKM
   theory. The exothermic or near thermoneutral spin-forbidden unimolecular
   isomerizations and dissociations were first characterized at different
   levels of theory, and the minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) for all
   the channels were identified at the CCSD(T) level. The probability for
   surface hopping was then estimated from the spin-orbit matrix elements.
   The calculated unimolecular dissociation rate constants predict that
   triplet CH3CH2S+ ions with less than 10 kcal mol(-1) of internal energy
   and at any level of rotational excitation should be long-lived, and
   strongly support the experimental observations.}},
